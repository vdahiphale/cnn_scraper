We look back at some ofChristiane's most memorable conversations with the trailblazing leader. Welcome to the program. I'm Sara Sidner in New York sitting in for Christiane Amanpour. Western governments have sent Ukraine all sorts of weapons to help its fight against Russia. But if you ask President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, there's something important missing. Tanks. Top defense officials, allies of Ukraine have been meeting today at Ramstein Air Base to discuss whether or not American or German tanks should be included in the latest round of aid. The U.S. has spent billions and billions of dollars so far in Ukraine, but future government spending is all up in the air right now. Not just in Ukraine, but also at home as the country has reached its debt limit. And now, it risks a potentially catastrophic default. Social security payments, veterans' pensions, and more are all at risk. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen says extraordinary measures are now in place to delay default. She's calling on lawmakers to act promptly to protect the full faith and credit of the United States. Yellen, this week, met Chinese Vice Premier in Zurich, and she's now in Africa hoping to expand U.S. trade there. The debt limit, China, Africa, and inflation, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen talked to Christiane earlier about all of this from an exclusive interview in Senegal. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And in that speech, you said a few things, one of them is, countries need to be weary of shiny deals that may be opaque and ultimately fail to actually benefit the people they were purportedly designed to help in the first place. This can leave countries with a legacy of debt, diverted resources, and environmental destruction. I wonder because that sounds very much a message to African nations about the incredible amount of trade they do with China, the incredible amount of investment that China has done far outstripping what United States has done, at least for the last, you know, 10 plus years.

And now, with a weak global economy and high debt, many countries in Africa and low-income countries around the world are dealing with debt burdens that they simply can't manage. And, you know, the United States wants to be there. My trip, as you said, is about many years to come. We see what is happening in Africa. Africa is really crucial to the longer-term global outlook. This is a continent that's population is growing very rapidly. It's a very young population. And it has the potential to contribute to growth throughout the global economy. Not managed properly, it could be a source of problems. We want to make sure that investments are high quality. That they lead to, in the case of energy, that they are sustainable investments. In the case of agriculture, we see countries that need more resilient agriculture systems, especially with climate change, taking a toll on many countries in Africa over the medium term. We see huge opportunities for American business here. So, encouraging trade and investment between the United States and Africa is something that is a win-win both for the United States and also for Africa.

For years, he has taken a particular interest in Ukraine, helping deliver equipment and teaching doctors in that country. After Russia's full-blown invasion last year, there were fears those efforts would be interrupted. But even at 72 years young, Mr. Marsh wasn't deterred. He visited Kyiv in October. Now, he is facing up to his own mortality, something he addresses in his latest book, \"And Finally: Matters of Life and Death\". And we are lucky to be joined now by Mr. Marsh.

And you talk about what it means to be human and our mortality, which is something most of us don't want to talk about very much. What did you learn from this process of putting words to paper? DR. MARSH:  Well, it is complicated because I'm a doctor myself. And I suspect it's not unusual. I denied my pretty obvious symptoms of prostate cancer for a long time before I felt I had to seek a colleague's advice. And that's because as all doctors, particularly if you do dangerous surgery, and neurosurgery is dangerous, you have this, sort of, detached from your patients. You have to find a balance between being kind and compassionate, but also being detached. You have to protect yourself to some extent because, you know, you are dealing with such human tragedy and emotion. And this kind of spilt over in my case to -- it's not an unusual delusion that illness happens to patients, not that doctors. And I was actually genuinely amazed when I was diagnosed with pretty severe cancer. And I, in retrospect, I find that extremely absurd and rather funny, but not unusual.",

MARSH:  Well, I retired from clinical work in England a few years ago, although I have been seeing patients abroad and other countries. I find that answer very -- question very difficult to answer rather. Certainly, one of the big surprises in the aftermath of the diagnosis, and before I knew if I actually had very widely disseminated cancer or not, which I don't as yet, thank goodness. One of the big surprises are I remembered an awful lot of patients I had completely forgotten. And -- whereas over the years I thought to myself on the hill (ph), like most doctors, as being a nice and sympathetic doctor. I was now full of doubt. And I just don't know with the insight and the greater empathy I now have as a patient myself whether I would be able to walk into the operating room and do the really very scary things I did. And cope with things when they went very badly.

I am a deep believer in what you would call socialized health care, the single payer system funded by taxation or something like that. It works very well in the Scandinavian countries. So, I don't accept people who say socialized health care, like the National Health Service, is fundamentally unfit. But it has to be properly financed, and that means paying high taxes. And of course, politicians don't like putting out taxes because they worry they won't win the next election. So, it's very difficult. Because there's more and more elderly people in the population, and there are more and more things we can do to the medically, and less invasive lead, and more safely.

If you look at home ownership through the last recession, you know, African Americans significantly lost home ownership and people find themselves one paycheck away from a tent. And so, this -- you know, the specific economic conditions right now that is driving this situation. The other thing that drives it is the fact that overtime, we have divested from the social safety net. So, we've cut back on drug treatment to the extent that we had mental health treatment, we have cut back on that.

The permits that you need to have. The funding that is slow. And that drives up the costs. So, voters in Los Angeles taxed themselves several years ago to get housing built. But didn't realize that because of all of the red tape, the cost is so expensive, it's between $600,000 and $700,000 per unit. So, just imagine in apartment building with 24 units and multiply that. It is -- the expense is exorbitant. That's why it was important for me to cut the red tape, to fast track, and to promote building. At the same time though, on this -- in the second week that I was in office, I launched a program called \"Inside Safe\" to end street homelessness. Get people out of encampments. Not arrest him. Not give them tickets. Not just move them to another location.

I spent 14 years in South Central Los Angeles on the streets, doing neighborhood organizing, trying to address this problem, prevent the problem. When I went onto my role as a legislator, I was still addressing the issue. That's why I focused on the child welfare system, which is one of the beater systems to homelessness. And also, to the prison system. And then I also focused on legislation to prevent recidivism. Because the issue is, is that the people in tents, it's a diverse group of people. It's not the same. There are thousands of children on the streets. There are women who have fled domestic violence situations. There are veterans. There are people on the streets in tents who actually worked full-time. They just can't afford first or last month's rent. Their credit is bad or they have a history of being evicted and they can't get anybody to rent to them.

And, you know, thereis, of course, a very practical use for the guns that we do use and license in New Zealand, but there is actually a whole set of weapons that were just available but unjustifiably so. And so, I remember very distinctly sitting in a briefing where the police told me the weapons that have been used on the 15th of March and how easily they were legally obtained and then, illegally modified for the purposes of that attack. And it was no question in my mind that our laws needed to change in that moment. What I'm heartened by is that I did not question for a moment that parliament would support that law change.",
