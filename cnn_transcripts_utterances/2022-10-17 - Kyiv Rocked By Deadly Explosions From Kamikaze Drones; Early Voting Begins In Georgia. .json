Plus, a deadly fire breaks out in a notorious Iranian prison as protests across that country grow.The journalist who was wrongfully imprisoned in that prison for a year and a half is our guest. And K-pop superstars, BTS, putting their musical careers on hold, taking on a very different job. This is what we're watching at this hour. Thank you so much for being here, everybody. I'm Kate Bolduan. Kyiv under attack this morning once again, Russian forces starting yet another week of strikes on civilians across Ukraine. Explosions, as you see could be heard in the capital. As Russia launched a barrage of kamikaze drone attacks, at least four people were killed. That's according to the city's mayor so far. Rescue operations are still underway, actually, at this hour to try and pull people from the rubble. Ukraine has accused Iran of supplying Russia with these drones but Iran denies it. And now a new concern at Ukraine's northern border, Russian troops are now in Belarus raising concerns of a new front in the war in Ukraine. Let's get to it CNN's Clarissa Ward is live in Kyiv for us. Clarissa you're able to go to one of the sites where these kamikaze drones hit. What did you see?",

      "sentences": "Well, it was a devastating scene, Kate. It's a residential building that was hit. It's in the neighborhood of a kind of energy plant, which has been targeted today, but also was targeted week ago when that barrage of missiles hit Kyiv. So they're clearly trying the Russians that is, to hit civilian infrastructure, particularly as Ukraine braces itself for another cold winter.But in this instance, four drones did make impacts, some 15 that were heading into the city were intercepted. The one as I mentioned that we saw hitting, very sadly, a residential building, at least four people were killed. We saw the body of an older woman that had been taken out. But also a young couple were killed and the wife reportedly six months pregnant. So a very grim scene here in Kyiv, and really, I think for a lot of people who live in this city, who had felt there had been some modicum of peace and relative calm over the past few months. A grim reminder that the capital is now very much, once again at the focus of these Russian attacks, particularly as I mentioned after that barrage of missiles that hit the city just last week, Kate.",

We spoken to a top level Ukrainian officials.And they do say that there is a good degree of concern on their part about these additional Russian forces pouring into Belarus now. The latest information that we have, and it's a little under 9,000 Russian troops that have been and are being deployed to Belarus at this point in time. But there were certainly some videos out there showing heavy equipment tanks being brought into Belarus. And that certainly doesn't bode well for the situation there. We know that the Belarusian strongman Alexander Lukashenko was very much dependent on Vladimir Putin. He has acknowledged that Belarus is in this war but has also said he does not intend to be part of an attack on Ukraine. At the same time, we have rhetoric coming out of Belarus, claiming that the Ukrainians are plotting an attack on Belarus. The Ukrainians obviously say that is absolutely not the case. And I was able to speak to an advisor to the Ukrainian presidency, and he told me that at this point in time, they don't believe that an attack from Belarus is imminent, but they also say that if it does happen, they would be prepared. And the way he put it, he said it would be Alexander Lukashenko's final decision as a president in Belarus. Kate?",

But this time, this year, it's got everybody's attention.These exercises are expected to kick off by the end of the month. So we're just several days away from this happening. The Russians expected to potentially test fire missiles, test their strategic capability, that is their nuclear capability. What the U.S. is going to be watching for with the Russians is whether they actually move any nuclear weapons around. And if they do it in any manner, then is other than routine training movement, the U.S. says it thinks it will be very capable of being able to detect any unusual movements. It's something that they watch for all the time. But right now, extra careful eyes on all of this. And it comes of course, as NATO along with the U.S., 14 NATO nations today kicked off their own nuclear deterrence exercise, there'll be about 60 aircraft including U.S. B-52s flying in Europe. They'll stay 600 miles off the Russian border, so there's no chance of miscalculation by either side. And they also will test the NATO nuclear deterrence. But very importantly, they are very clear that NATO, the U.S. will not move any nuclear weapons around. That could be the big difference between both sides. Kate?",

Also with a CNN military analyst, retired Major General James \"Spider\" Marks. Thank you both for being here. I really appreciate it. Ambassador, I wanted to ask you of off the top. What -- about what Clarissa Ward was just talking to us about, what do you think these strikes using kamikaze drones in Kyiv and across Ukraine right now, what do you think it means? JOHN HERBST, FORMER U.S. AMBASSADOR TO UKRAINE: Putin has had a very bad three months. His offensive in Donbass was stopped in mid-July. You've had this great counter offensive by the Ukrainians. Then you've had the blow up of the Kerch Bridge, which is vital for new Russian military supplies for their forces in southern Ukraine. To respond to this, because he's facing domestic criticism from his hard right, the chauvinist nationalists in Russia, he's showing he's quote unquote, tough by bombing civilians and infrastructure in Ukraine. But this has also created new problems for him. Because now the United States and NATO looking very seriously at sending high altitude anti-aircraft systems to Ukraine would they should have sent months ago, so this is another bad decision by Putin, but it means additional suffering for the people of Ukraine.",

These strikes have very little impact on what I would call the tactical engagement between Ukrainian forces and Russian forces. What this does, it primarily attacks the Ukrainian will to resist. That's what this is all about. These are terror bombings, not unlike the Nazi bombings of London, the Blitzkrieg that took place in London from 41 or 40 through 41. It really is going after Ukrainian desires about how much longer they want to have this type of fight and behind closed doors. I guarantee you, President Zelenskyy is having very serious discussions about what type of in state that might be achievable in the near term, there might be some form of a ceasefire. In other words, there's got to be an acknowledgment that what we have right now is not sustainable. Ukrainians are doing incredibly well. But I don't think anybody sees the Ukrainians pushing the Russians across the border. What they see is some type of a frozen conflict where Ukraine is really achieving some great technical successes. But at some point, I think there's going to be acknowledgement that Russia will in fact occupy about 15 percent of Ukraine.",

There is this widespread reporting of Russian officials literally grabbing men off the street to enlist them in the war effort.At the same time, of course, there are reports of men going into hiding, people fleeing to neighboring countries.

But then again, bear in mind, that Russia is nothing but a very, very severe, secure environment for Putin and his blanket of security kind of drapes over the entire country. So information that gets out is coming directly from the Kremlin. That's why Putin enjoys such a tremendous amount of support. I mean, everything he is doing is for domestic consumption. The international community understands him to be the, you know, the pariah that he is. But I think it is important to realize that there needs to be a discussion of some type of an off ramp. And what that looks like. And what Zelenskyy has right now is maximalist objectives. But those ends are not being met by the resources that are being provided by NATO.",

No candidate is going to say go into an election saying I'm going to lose.But it is a very different ballgame when you're talking about the notion of election denialism, which is exactly why I asked her that question. And you mentioned, leading into that sound bite, Kate, that the 2020 election is effectively on the ballot in a lot of places. That is true, but it is even more so in Arizona. First and foremost, because Kari Lake, is putting it on the ballot because she is not telling the truth on the stump over and over again, about the election of 2020, she's saying it was stolen, she's saying it was corrupt. And those things are not born in reality. And most importantly, there's no evidence to back that up. And so that's why going forward, it is important to question whether or not she's going to accept her own results. And what I didn't get a chance to ask her and it was also incredibly consequential because we saw what happened in Arizona, just like Georgia in 2020. If she does, in fact, when will she accept the results of the 2024 presidential election?

And that is sort of the accepted idea among a lot of people. But it's also not necessarily the law of the land and a lot of places. So the fact that she didn't want to say what her position is, other than it should be between a patient and their doctor was really interesting, because she's effectively saying that the government should be completely out and there should be no limits.
