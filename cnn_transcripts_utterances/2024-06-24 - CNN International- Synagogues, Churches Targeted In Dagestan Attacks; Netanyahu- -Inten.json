      "sentences": "Yeah, Erica. I think the key thing that we don't know is who exactly is responsible, unlike what we saw after that very deadly attack in Moscow three months ago at the Crocus City concert hall. There has been no claim of responsibility from any specific group. And because of that, we also don't know a specific motive for this attack. We don't also know how many suspects could still be at large. Five militants were killed during the operation to the anti-counter terror operation to stop this attack from happening. But, obviously, we don't know that there may have been more involved. This was quite an ambitious, quite a large-scale coordinated attackhappening pretty much simultaneously across these two cities, Makhachkala and Derbent, which is some 100 or so kilometers away along Dagestan's Caspian Sea coast. What we do know, as I said, is that authorities believe that this was very much coordinated. And obviously, the crucial pattern here is that it targeted these houses of worship, synagogues, and churches in both of these cities, which, of course, is raising questions in Dagestan, a predominantly Muslim region, but one which does have an ancient Jewish population. So, that is what we do know, obviously, raising serious security questions coming three months after the Crocus City Hall attack, but minimal comments so far from the Kremlin, simply offering condolences to the victims, Erica.",

His sort of focus was to put down an insurgency in the North Caucasus. You remember, he fought that very brutal Second Chechen war over the first couple of years of his presidency, and has been battling really a long-running Islamic insurgency in that region ever since.I think the question coming out of this will be, has he sort of taken his eye off the ball in that region, given the laser focus on the war in Ukraine? And there is a secondary issue here, which is that we've seen ethnic tensions raised in that region. Last October, there was an anti-Jewish mob that basically stormed the main airport in Makhachkala, the regional capital, as a flight landed from Tel Aviv. This was just a few weeks after the October 7 attacks, very scary, terrifying scenes on the tarmac there around this plane, and that led to extra security around synagogues after that. So, I think that is raising questions as to the motive of this latest attack. But, obviously, this is the very last thing that President Putin needs. He needs stability more than ever, as he tries to keep the approval of the Russian people for his war in Ukraine.",

So, the fact that the intense phase of this war is going to end is significant. It's something we have been hearing in the past few days. Certainly, the Defense Minister, Yoav Gallant, before going to Washington, said that it was the phase C that they were looking at now, suggesting that he was going to Washington so that he could talk to U.S. officials about this next phase and what the focus will be.So, Netanyahu did say that this isn't the end of the war in Gaza. He was clear in that, but said that it would be the end of the current stage in Rafah. This is where the most intense fighting has been in recent weeks, in fact, since about May 6 or 7th. And what that means, he says, is so the military can then refocus its attentions on the northern border with Lebanon, where there has been increasing cross- border attacks between Hezbollah and Israeli troops. Now, he also said that he was ready to accept a partial deal with Hamas when it comes to the hostage deal, saying that he is ready to make a partial deal to return some hostages. He also specified, though, that after that ceasefire, he has every intention of going back into Gaza and having -- this will continue until the group is eliminated completely, saying that he hasn't given up on that idea. Now, this is something that hostage families have rejected. They have condemned, saying that that it is not about some hostages. It should be about all hostages. It's also something that Hamas has rejected, saying that it shows he is rejecting what the deal of the ceasefire and hostage deal is on the table at this point and what the U.S.-led and backed deal is. So, there has been condemnation about that part, Hamas saying that they want a complete permanent ceasefire, and this is clearly not what Netanyahu is subscribing to here. Erica.",

Certainly, we're hearing from both sides messaging that this could be the next war, the next front that opens. It's obviously not something that the Biden administration, that countries around the world want. They don't want this conflict to escalate.But, certainly, Israeli officials and within the military have been very clear that what is happening on the northern border at this point is unacceptable, saying that there are tens of thousands of residents that had to evacuate just after October 7, and they have not been able to return since. Similarly, on the other side of the border, there is something like 90,000 Lebanese residents who have had to move away from southern Lebanon because of the continuing and recently increasing cross-border attacks. So, we're certainly seeing and hearing from the Israeli establishment that this is going to be the next focus, and as I mentioned, the fact that the Defense Minister is in Washington, in the United States, speaking with U.S. officials about this next phase of the war, that's certainly bringing it into sharper focus as well.

President Biden remains at Camp David where he is expected to stay preparing for this debate right up until the last minute, traveling down to Atlanta on Thursday, as he prepares to face off against his -- former President Donald Trump. But, at the same time, the Biden campaign is engaged in an all-out push today to try to warn that abortion rights remain under attack. The campaign is using this two-year anniversary of the Dobbs ruling which overturned Roe v. Wade to argue that Donald Trump poses a threat to the future of abortion rights in this country. Vice President Kamala Harris will speak at two campaign events in Maryland and Arizona today.And this morning, the campaign is out with a stark new ad warning about Trump's plans. The ad features a Louisiana woman named Kaitlyn Joshua, who says she was turned away from two emergency rooms after experiencing a miscarriage at 11 weeks of pregnancy. She said that this was due to Louisiana's abortion ban and directly blames Donald Trump for her experience. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Now, the White House and the campaign are also bracing for the possibility that the Supreme Court this week could issue a major decision in a case involving emergency care relating to abortion.Now, it all comes as Biden's advisors really believe that this issue of abortion rights is something that will galvanize voters, especially women and independent voters, heading into November's election. Democrats saw some success around the issue of abortion rights in the 2022 midterms, and that is something that Biden's team is hoping to replicate heading into November. Now, President Biden is still at Camp David with his advisors, preparing for his in-person showdown with Donald Trump, their first matchup in person since that -- those two 2020 debates. Now, the campaign advisors have said that abortion rights is one of the issues where they really believe they have a stark contrast to draw with Trump. So, it certainly is expected that it will come up in the upcoming debate. Biden is running through some informal discussions surrounding possible questions that could arise with the debate before transitioning into full 90-minute mock debates, as he is preparing to face off against Trump once again.",

First up for Judge Aileen Cannon's courtroom is a motion to dismiss Special Counsel Jack Smith from the case. Donald Trump's lawyers argue that his office has been improperly funded. And later today, a hearing into prosecutors' request for a gag order barring Trump from talking about the FBI agents who raided Mar-a-Lago.

So, Donald Trump's team, they are trying many different ways to get this case dismissed or to get the charges against him dropped, erased, thrown out. The way they do that is they come to Judge Cannon. She sets a hearing and is having hours and hours devoted to each of those separate requests.So, today is part two of an attempt by Donald Trump's team to convince the judge that the Special Counsels' office doesn't have the constitutional authority to bring a case that there isn't money that Congress has given to the Justice Department that could be used for an office like this, the Office of Special Counsel Jack Smith appointed to handle this case, investigate it and bring the charges, take it to trial. So, that is what is going to be talked about this morning. In the afternoon, prosecutors then are going to be arguing what they want in the case. They want the judge to limit Donald Trump's speech. They want him not to be able to comment about law enforcement involved in this anymore. He has been speaking quite a lot about the law enforcement specifically that took part in the search of Mara-a-Lago in August of 2022. And he said misleading and false things about that search that such as that he was in danger. He wasn't even in Florida whenever that search took place. And so, that is going to be argued before Judge Cannon. We don't expect any rulings to happen today. But, you never know. In court, it's always possible. Judge Cannon, though, she likes to take her time. She likes to hear all of the sides of the issues, and she often has a lot of questions. Erica.",

We now have that figure. Saudi authorities saying that many of those, over 80 percent, of those who died are what they call unauthorized. So, people who did not have the proper permissions.But, here is the thing to understand about the Hajj. It is a pillar of Islam. It is a lifetime goal for most Muslims to get there. They will save every penny until maybe they're in older age, their 70s and 80s. And they're applying for this lottery system time after time with the hope that they'll get that green light. And then, in the midst of all this, this desperation, these families trying to get there, the elderly who want to be able to carry out that pilgrimage. There are tour groups that governments now say were operating without proper permissions, and governments are beginning to crack down. Egypt, for example, has banned 16 of these tour groups. Reports indicating that people simply arrived to Mecca to find they had no proper accommodation, no proper cooling, no buses to carry them the many miles to the various sites they needed to go to. Tunisia is also taking steps. I believe their government has fired one of their ministers. Jordan is cracking down on these tour operators. But, for these families, these reverberations around the Muslim world will only begin this week when people should be returning home. But, of course, those who lost their lives, for their families, they're going to be asking these questions to the government, seeking accountability.

Residents of the Panamanian island tell CNN, living on the mainland would affect their livelihood and lifestyle. HERMINIO REYES, GARDI SUGDUB RESIDENT (Interpreted): I'm losing fishing time because I'm not looking at the sea every day. And that's in my nature. I want to ensure that every day my family is eating fish and also yuccas, everything that is natural. ROMO (voice-over): The community Secretary Agusto Walter said that before the move, the island of Gardi Sugdub had around 1,300 inhabitants, and in some homes, up to four generations would live under the same roof. But, conditions in the new community of Nuevo Carti do not seem to be better. Walter says that electricity and water go out sometimes for days at a time. The climate change effects will only get worse as sea levels rise. Residents of the island looked at other solutions to protect their homes. These fillings in here on the island are built with wood and stones to prevent water from entering the houses when the tide rises. CLAUDIANO LOPEZ, GARDI SUGDUB RESIDENT (Interpreted): What they told me at first was that they didn't think it was climate change. They didn't believe it. But now, they're tired of drying everything. Removing stones and when the sea rises, it takes things away. AGUSTO WALTER, COMMUNITY SECRETARY (Interpreted): I know that in 10 or 30 years, this will be noticeable but not now. Now, people think that it is not a big deal that it's not going to happen. But, yes, the sea level is going up. ROMO (voice-over): Rafael Romo, CNN, Atlanta. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

      "sentences": "These dramatic social media videos emerged not long after the state-owned Chinese company responsible for this launch hailed it as a complete success in a statement online Saturday, describing this mission as a Chinese-made Long March 2C rocket carrying satellites jointly developed by Chinese and French scientists into space.Now, we have reached out to this company and the Chinese government for comment. But, for many people on the ground watching these suspected debris plummet towards their village, they felt quite differently about this mission, with one witness telling CNN that they thought they had seen a rocket fall down right in front of their eyes, with other people on social media saying they heard a loud explosion after the debris fell into the ground. A since-deleted notice from village authorities posted on social media showed that local officials were telling villagers that they were about to conduct a rocket debris recovery mission and advising people to stay away from these debris, avoid being harmed by toxic air and explosions. Now, that assessment echoed by experts CNN spoke to with them telling us that these debris are likely from the first-stage rocket booster and are indeed highly toxic. Now, if this falling debris incident is confirmed, it's not without precedents in China. Just last December, debris from another rocket launched from the same center in Xichang province landed in a nearby region, damaging two houses, according to stay media. And back in 2022, charred remnants from a Chinese rocket booster plunged and controlled back to Earth, an incident widely criticized by many Western experts as irresponsible and risky behavior by China's national space agency. All of this, of course, is taking place at a time when China is not only catching up, but also trying to get ahead of the United States in an increasingly heated space race.

Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams are stuck in space, while scientists and engineers continue to study the Boeing Starliner spacecraft that is supposed to take them home. The Starliner suffered helium leaks and thruster problems on the way to the space station.CNN's Tom Foreman is tracking this story for us. Good morning, my friend. So, Tom, in terms of the reasons for this delay, what are we hearing from NASA and Boeing?",

      "sentences": "Well, they obviously say, as people often do, in cases like this, this is an abundance of caution. They want to make sure everything is all right. But, let's talk about what the issues were. The issues were helium leaks that were occurring on this craft, which took some time to isolate and to figure out. There are reportedly five leaks so far that they have found and that caused some of these thrusts -- well, a thruster shut down, then some others were shut down in response to that, which may be related to this.Now, you may be wondering what helium is for up in space. Remember, when you have a zero-gravity environment, if you have fuel in a tank that needs to get to the nozzle part, gravity would assist on Earth, but up in space, it doesn't. So, helium, which is inert and doesn't really react with much of anything, can be used to pressurize the tank and drive it to the nozzle. Whether that's happening with this particular spacecraft, we don't know. But, that's one typical use. So, if you're losing helium, the question is, why are you losing it? Does it interfere with the thrusters? And have you lost enough for that to be a problem? We don't have answers to those questions. But, NASA is trying to sort all that out. It's also complicated because they have a couple of spacewalks, one has happened, one about to happen, that they're -- that they'd like to get out of the way and not try to do all of this at once. So, the bottom line, Erica, is though this may seem like an inconvenience that this capsule is stuck with the ISS right now, they need to solve these issues to be able to undock and to come out of orbit. They must solve them before that, and if not, this could be a much more serious problem than it appears at the moment. Erica.",
