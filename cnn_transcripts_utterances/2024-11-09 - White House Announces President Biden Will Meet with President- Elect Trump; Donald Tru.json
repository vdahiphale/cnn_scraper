      "sentences": "Hello again, everyone. Thank you so much for joining me this Saturday. I'm Fredricka Whitfield.And we begin this hour with a return to a political tradition. Today the White House announced that outgoing President Joe Biden and President Trump will meet in the Oval Office on Wednesday morning. It's a meeting that did not happen in 2020 after Trump refused to admit that he lost the election to Biden. And this comes as Trump and his transition team are working quickly to fill key White House positions. And sources tell CNN that we could learn some of the new names as early as today. Earlier this week Trump made history by announcing Susie Wiles as the country's first ever female chief of staff. And now there is a scramble underway at Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida as members of his circle and the GOP sphere are battling behind the scenes for a spot on his team. We have got a team of correspondents covering all the developments for us. CNN's Alayna Treene is covering the Trump transition near his Florida home. Let's begin with Arlette Saenz and this newly announced meeting at the White House. Arlette, what do we know?",

Biden had said that he extended this invitation in a phone call he had with Trump after the election on Wednesday. And in that call, he said that he told the President-elect that he was committed to having a peaceful, orderly transition and transfer of power.That stands in stark contrast to what we saw play out back after the 2020 election when former president, or then President Trump, refused to concede the election to Biden and put up many roadblocks in the transition process during that period of time. But now they are returning to this tradition. Actually, back in 2016, then President Barack Obama had hosted Trump just days after he had defeated Hillary Clinton in the 2016 election. They sat down in a meeting in the Oval Office, as you see right there. Now, we are also told that the first lady had extended an invitation to first lady, incoming first lady Melania Trump to visit the White House when the President-elect comes. We are still waiting to hear when exactly that meeting will happen. But it all really highlights what the president and his advisers have been quite eager to show, is that he is committed to having an orderly transition even as it was something that was not afforded to him in the past. And this meeting in the Oval Office on Wednesday will be a key step in that process.",

They also say when I talked to his team and his top advisers that Donald Trump is committed to a peaceful transfer of power. As Arlette mentioned, though, that did not happen or occur in the aftermath of him leaving and losing, or leaving the White House but losing the 2020 election.But also I think it's so important to keep in mind the context of this. The relationship between Donald Trump and Joe Biden, the criticisms and attacks that they have lobbed at each other over the last year. Before Kamala Harris took over and became the Democratic nominee, the official Democratic nominee, I should say, he was going against Joe Biden and had very harsh words. So I think this meeting will likely be a bit awkward. But I think they both recognize, and I hear this from the Trump side, that they need to go back to tradition here and really have this meeting, figure out what the best process is to have the peaceful transfer of power. And I'd also say this comes after him and Joe Biden spoke on Wednesday after Donald Trump had won the election. Sources familiar with that call told me that it was a cordial call. It was very short. It was very brief. Joe Biden congratulated him and reiterated his commitment to that peaceful transfer of power, and also had invited him to the White House. So I think we will see how this goes. I am eager to see what this meeting will be like and what we learn from it, particularly knowing just the very sour relationship between those two men.

      "sentences": "All right, Arlette Saenz, Alayna Treene, thanks to both of you ladies. Appreciate it.So as the transition takes shape, officials in the Pentagon are meeting to discuss what to do if Trump issues controversial during his second term. CNN Pentagon correspondent Oren Liebermann explains. (BEGIN VIDEO TAPE) OREN LIEBERMANN, CNN PENTAGON CORRESPONDENT:  Pentagon officials are beginning to have informal discussions on how to respond and how DOD would respond if President Donald Trump tried to use active military domestically, and what would happen if he tried to reinstitute an executive order called Schedule F that would allow him to more easily fire apolitical civilian employees across not only the federal government but also specifically the Pentagon and the Department of Defense. In terms of the question of how to handle the attempted deployment of active duty military troops domestically or the issuing of an unlawful order, defense officials we have spoken with say that largely relies on the chain of command, and that chain of command specifically following lawful order and abiding by laws that determine how they can be deployed. But it is a question of whether they would that is to resign or refuse to obey the order, and how that would happen. Crucially again, it relies specifically on the chain of command following the law, knowing the law, and handling it properly. But the Insurrection Act, which Trump threatened to invoke during his first term as president, still gives the president a large amount of leeway into how and why he would try to deploy active duty military domestically. It has happened in the past. But it was used for enforcing desegregation or for the handling of, for example, the Rodney King riots. Trump has threatened to use those active duty troops in his first term to handle large scale protests. Again, recently, he has threatened to use troops to carry out mass deportations. Should he choose to do that and use active military troops in a domestic law enforcement capacity, that in and of itself would be quite unprecedented for that use. So that's something the Pentagon is beginning to game out, essentially to look at the possibilities. The results of the possibility that he reinstitutes Schedule F, and that would reclassify a number of apolitical civilian employees in a way that would make them more easily fire-able. Crucially, that could disrupt the day-to-day operations of the building. The Pentagon is, of course, a very large organization that relies on that apolitical civilian population and the number of employees simply to function on a day-to-day basis. So the Pentagon having those conversations about the questions and, crucially, the concerns. (END VIDEO TAPE)",

Republicans I talk to say you can never guarantee anything, of course, when it comes to Donald Trump and the potential for him to really upend any race that he could potentially comment on and influence. But I will note that this is a secret ballot election. So there is a risk for Donald Trump getting himself involved in the Senate Republican leadership race in the sense that if he endorses someone and then that person doesn't end up winning the election, number one, you are starting off 2025, essentially, on the wrong foot with the person that you are going to have to work very closely with to get your agenda through.But number two, there is no accountability measure for Republican senators in terms of they don't have to stand up and publicly reveal who they are voting for. Again, it's a secret ballot election. So I don't know that it is necessarily in Donald Trump's best political interest to actually weigh in on this race. I think Republican senators view John Thune, the current majority whip, as the front runner in this race, but Rick Scott is getting a lot of backing from conservative media figures and from grassroots conservatives as well. The question is will that translate into votes for Rick Scott for majority leader. And again, it's a secret ballot election, so there is no mechanism to really hold Republican senators accountable for this. Some are coming out and saying publicly who they will support. But it's only a handful so far. And we are four days away from this election.",

They have just issued a statement, the Qatari foreign ministry, clarifying that they have suspended their mediatory role in discussions about ceasefires and hostage releases between Israel and Hamas. They said they gave notice of that 10 days ago because, to summarize what the foreign ministry's statement said, to paraphrase it, that there was no progress and that neither side was willing to take part in it in a serious discussion about how to achieve the ends. And so until that changed, they said, they're going to suspend their mediation activities.But I think the most significant bit of the statement we got from the Qatari foreign ministry is that they pushed back hard on the idea that the country was going to kick out Hamas political representatives inside Qatar. There had been reporting earlier from CNN and other news organizations as well, briefings from U.S. officials that under U.S. pressure, Qatar had agreed to kick out Hamas, and they would have to find somewhere else to go to set up a political office. That would have had all sorts of knock-on consequences for how to contact Hamas in any future negotiations, for example. But this statement comes out and says, actually, those media reports are not true. They're false. And the statement goes on to say that the political office of Hamas in Qatar continues to play a very important role to be a point of contact between the two sides. And so, look, it's not going to change its policy when it comes to keeping Hamas in the country, apparently, but it is going to suspend any further attempts, any further mediation efforts that it's been engaged with.",
