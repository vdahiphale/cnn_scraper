It indicates how important India is as a strategic partner to the U.S.And I think it will all be wrapped up when the prime minister meets with the (INAUDIBLE) this evening. That's just going to add to the show that you've seen already that was on full display yesterday at the White House. You had song, dance. You had pageantry -- all of it. And then they got down to talking across the table with some very significant deals having been announced. But I also want to tell you about how India is viewing all of this, and I want to start with a few newspapers from this morning. This is The Indian Express and it says \"Deals closed, doors open.\" Now the doors open bit, of course, also talks of how Narendra Modi, while he was at the White House, spoke about how Indian Americans were invited inside -- and thousands of them -- inside the White House on Thursday when he was being received officially by the U.S. president. Let's go on to the Financial Express now. \"India-U.S. tie take jet speed\" is what it says, and that's because of the jet engine deal that has now been signed. Very significant there again, Christine, because it's not only the production of jet engines that India and the U.S. will now be getting into, but also the sharing of that technology, which also goes on to indicate and symbolize how America is ready to trust India with their technology here. Now, I do want to talk about the bigger picture but before that let's just listen into two very important lines from Modi's speech at the U.S. Congress on Thursday. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

They say age is just a number but as more working Americans grow older and retire it puts a strain on Social Security and Medicare.All right, looking at markets around the world right now, Asian markets finished lower. Investors there are concerned that rate hikes by major central banks might hinder global economic growth. European markets also lower following a bigger-than-expected rate hike by the Bank of England. On Wall Street, stock index futures right now down a little bit here. The S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq actually rallied late yesterday snapping a three-day losing streak. The Dow finished slightly lower. Markets were moved the by Fed chairman's comments to the Senate. Jerome Powell said the central bank would move interest rates at a careful pace from here. On inflation watch, gas prices held steady overnight at $3.58 per gallon, down substantially from those near-record highs last summer.
