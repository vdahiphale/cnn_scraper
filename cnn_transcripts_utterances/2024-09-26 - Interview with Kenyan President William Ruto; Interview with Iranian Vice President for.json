I'm Christiane Amanpour in New York. The Middle East and world leaders here at the U.N. are on edge as Israel prepares for a possible ground operation in Lebanon. Both sides have launched dozens of strikes today as the death toll climbs. Twenty-three people from the same family were killed in one airstrike alone, which was on Lebanon. Meantime, the U.S. and France, among others, are working feverishly on a ceasefire plan between Israel and the militant group Hezbollah, while Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who's expected to address the U.N. General Assembly tomorrow, signals no such restraint. His message to the IDF is, keep fighting. Ben Wedeman is joining us from Southern Lebanon. So, Ben, from your perspective, are you hearing anything about a down or a ceasefire? And how bad are these strikes on the leadership of Hezbollah? We hear yet another leader has been targeted, according to the Israelis.",

And we see what's happened in Gaza, in the West Bankm now in Lebanon that there's no stopping them.

And now, with so much attention on the Middle East and Ukraine, another war barely acknowledged is in Sudan. It's rapidly becoming one of the worst humanitarian disasters as famine is declared after months of civil war. The Sudanese Armed Forces are now mounting a new offensive to try to retake the Capital Khartoum. Many countries have tried to mediate, including Kenya, since this war broke out some 18 months ago, killing a nascent democracy amongst all the civilians and people who've been killed. And across the globe, in Haiti, where gangs run rampant, Kenya is also leading an international policing force to try to restore order there. But Kenya's president has also been under immense pressure at home with a brutal crackdown on mass protests that led to the deaths of more than 50 people. President William Ruto is joining me now from the U.N. headquarters. President Ruto, welcome to the program. Can I just ask you when you see everything that you guys are trying to figure out how to contain this week at the U.N., what stands out for you most as the biggest danger that affects you?

We have serious humanitarian issues, and it is our position that in Sudan, thanks to the United Nations.

I am persuaded like many that a military solution will not come out in Sudan. And that is why Kenya is deeply invested and engaged in finding a solution, bringing together all the actors. This will not be solved by talking to the military men alone, we need to talk to their political leaders, women, civil society, to find a solution. In any case, the revolution that removed the dictatorship in Sudan was a people's revolution, which was hijacked by men in military uniform, and they have made a mess of the country. We believe that it is time the International Community look at Sudan much more keenly because we are having a humanitarian disaster in the offing in Sudan, especially because of the famine that is imminent.

The guns are silent at the palace, which was under siege, the guns are silent in the national hospital that was under siege. The National Police Academy that had been overrun by gangs today is training police officers and the port is much more calm. My assessment, listening to the commanders, listening to the leadership in Haiti is that we need additional personnel. The challenge is resources, logistics, and equipment. And we have had several meetings at the U.N. led by Canada.

I mean, steps in the right direction. We're not there yet. Long way to go. But we now have four women in the in the cabinet, and I'm very proud of that. We have a Sunni vice president in the cabinet for the first time. These are happening for the first time in Iranian history, not just after the revolution, four women in the cabinet, we never had four women in the cabinet even before the revolution, at least as long as I can remember.

COLLINS:  It's a pretty serious diagnosis, that's for sure. Yes, we are a very polarized society and there's a lot of vitriol and animosity. And that has led us in this current circumstance to a place where a whole lot of things that we used to consider absolutely rock solid for our society are now rather frayed. One of them is, is there such a thing as truth nowadays? Well, my bubble says this is what's true, maybe yours says that's what's true. Hey, if a fact is a fact, it's true for everybody and it doesn't care how you feel. We've lost trust in science along the way. Almost as if some people have to be the pro-science, then the other people have to be the anti-science. Science, again, is about objective facts. It doesn't care how you feel about the answer, it just is what it is. Climate change is real, by the way. COVID vaccines actually work and saved about 3 million lives. Those are facts. But those kinds of things are harder now for people to agree on. I'm also a person of faith, and I think faith as a source of a different kind of truth, the transcendental truth, the truth about who we are and what we're called to do and how we're supposed to love our neighbors. That's gotten frayed as well, and I'm sorry to say oftentimes because politics has jumped in and overtaken the messages of faith that should have been the dominant ones. All of this, Walter, kind of leads us to this area where we don't know who to trust anymore.",

Kennedy Jr., people saying you shouldn't do the MMR vaccines, taking an old discredited paper saying maybe they cause autism. What mistakes do you think, if any, were made? Maybe vaccine mandates weren't the way to go because it just caused a counterreaction or what would you do differently? DR. COLLINS:  Yes. Well, first of all, I do think science communication could have been done more effectively than it was, and I'm pointing the finger at myself here because I was one of those people being called upon very regularly to try to explain what we knew about COVID and what we were trying to accomplish and what kinds of actions people would need to take to try to protect themselves and their neighbors. I wish that we had -- every time we put forward one of those recommendations had a little bit more time to say, you know, there's a very evolving story. We have incomplete data about this virus. What we're going to tell you today is the best we can do, and please don't imagine that any of these public health people have any particular acts to grind, we're just trying to do what we can to save lives, but it might have to change a week from now or a month from now because we'll get new data and we'll realize that recommendations we made yesterday are not the ones we should make for tomorrow. We didn't do enough of that. And so, when things changed, like, do you not wear a mask? Do you wear a mask? People began to doubt whether the experts were really experts at all. And we were unable, I think, to get control of the message of what is actually true here. So, that was certainly a lesson to learn. Did mandates make it worse? First of all, I think mandates, scientifically, were entirely justified. The paper just came out in Scientific Reports that assessed over 2020 what were the measures that were taken during that terrible year that actually reduced transmission of the virus? And mandates, looking at all 50 states, some had, some did not, clearly had a beneficial effect. But people didn't like them at all. They sort of added to this sense that the government is heavy handed, it's taking away your liberties, it's making random decisions that are -- getting in the way of people being able to have their own choices. And so, I think it probably did add to more of the resistance and the resentment about public health just at the point where public health might have helped us save more lives.",

COLLINS:  Yes, I think that's a lot of it. I think the statement about the advances in science being breathtaking is easily defended. And we already talked about COVID vaccines, which turned out to be a source of distrust, which is really strange because it was such a phenomenal achievement. But now, we have vaccines for cancer. And a lot of people are like, well, I don't know about that either, even though they're starting to look really promising. We're curing sickle cell disease with gene therapy in a way that I never dreamed would happen in my lifetime. We have promising ways now to attack problems like Alzheimer's disease. And everybody wants to see those advances happen, but there's still this undercurrent of suspicion. Are the scientists really all atheists? Are they really all on a take? Are they just trying to promote themselves? Can you trust this data? All of the things that we know about science in terms of the peer review process and the self-correction when things are published that turn out not to be reliable, those seem to have slipped away from people's memories as much.

They don't prove your hypothesis, and it hits you real hard, and you talk to your pastor. Tell me how that led you on a road to faith and a road to science. DR. COLLINS:  So, yes, I did not grow up in a faith tradition of any sort. And I was an atheist when I was a graduate student studying physical chemistry. The example you talk about was the very first real serious science I tried to do after I had gotten into medicine and was trying to do molecular biology research, and it was something I care deeply about. It was my first big opportunity to make a discovery. And it was six months of hard work and I was making a lot of mistakes because I wasn't really familiar with a lot of the techniques. But ultimately, the day came where the results were going to be clear. I had this in my head. This is going to be a big moment. I've discovered something that other laboratories are going to want to use, and it was a complete and utter failure. There was no chance of rescuing anything useful out of this. And I told my mentor the next day, I'm leaving the program. I must be not destined for this. And he talked me out of sticking around, but I wouldn't -- I did go and talk to my pastor and said, I'm a person who's trying to put faith and science together, because by then, I had reached that point of becoming a Christian. But is God basically sending me a message here? Just move on and do something else. And he said, now, wait a minute, let's look at the figures in the Bible. By the way, my pastor was a former NASA engineer. So, he knows about all this. Look at all of the heroes of faith who failed over and over again, from Moses on down through Peter and Paul, did they just give up because they had a bad experiment? No. They learned from it. They figured out something really that they hadn't appreciated before. That's what you need to do. OK. I decided to give it another shot. And the next experiment, I was a lot more careful about the design, to be sure I had understood all the ways that it might go wrong, and that one turned out to have gone much better. And then, here I am. Now, some -- 40 some years later, having had an amazing experience as a scientist with plenty of failures along the way, but always trying to learn from each one of those.",

Tell me about what you think we should all do right now. DR. COLLINS:  Well, that is what I come down on as the possible solution to this unfortunate situation we find ourselves in. I don't see the divisiveness and the hyperpolarization and the vitriol and the fear and the anger getting solved by political voices, but I think it can be solved by us. If each of us would do a couple of things, first, try to take your own truth temperature and say, have I brought on board things that are actually not true? And in which case, maybe those need to be discarded. Have a hard look at whether you've been able to discern the difference between facts and fakes. We all get hit with a lot of those. Sort that out. And then, second, become one of those that builds a bridge with people of different opinions, like I learned to do with Wilk and Braver Angels. Reach out to somebody who you know disagrees with you about something where there's a lot of emotion, gun control or immigration and say, I'd really like to understand where you're coming from because I would -- I have not been able to get beyond the perspectives of the people around me. So, let's have a glass of wine and you can tell me and I'm going to really listen, your background, where you come from, what you believe, and how you've arrived at this particular perspective. I want to understand that. And you might make a friend and you might also find out that your own positions are not as rock solid as you thought they were. And that's how we bring ourselves back together again. The pledge at the end of the book basically is asking people not just to say that's a nice idea, but to make a commitment to be part of the solution. If you sign the pledge and you can put your name up on the Braver Angels' website to document that, that's a reminder that we're all in this together. And together, we might be able to do, as Margaret Mead, has suggested, make a real change in a culture, because a few committed citizens is what it takes. In fact, that's all that has ever made a real difference. Let's be part of that. We have a chance here to heal our nation one person at a time.
