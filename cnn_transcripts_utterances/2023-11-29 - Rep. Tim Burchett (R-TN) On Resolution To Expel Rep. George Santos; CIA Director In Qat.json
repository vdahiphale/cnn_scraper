And I think this is why the Israelis are telling Hamas through the mediators that it will not discuss any further deals until all the women and children are out. This is an attempt to press Hamas to release this family. MATTINGLY-- U.S. officials have been very candid about whenever combat operations continue they want and have been telling Israeli -- their Israeli counterparts that in the south, operations must be much different than they were in the north, primarily because of how many people -- refugees have moved toward that area because of what happened in the north.

The situation is completely different there, especially that they are the ones who asked a million Palestinians to move from northern Gaza to southern Gaza, and they cannot really move them again.So I think we will see a much different mode of operation and more specific and more targeted raids even though in such a dense area I'm not even sure such a thing is possible.",

A new court filing shows Trump plans to argue he had good reason to believe the election was fraudulent and that, quote, \"His concerns regarding fraud during the 2020 election -- rather than 'knowingly false' or criminal -- were plausible and maintained in good faith.\"Joining us now, Temidayo Aganga-Williams, who served as a senior investigative counsel for the January 6 Committee. He is currently a partner at Selendy Gay Elsberg. I lot -- I have lots of thoughts about lots of things. But on the legal side, they lost how many dozens of court challenges here? The election clearly was not fraudulent or stolen and many people told Trump that. How do you make this case if you are a Trump lawyer? TEMIDAYO AGANGA-WILLIAMS, FORMER ASSISTANT U.S. ATTORNEY, EASTERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK, PARTNER, SELENDY GAY ELSBERG, FORMER SENIOR INVESTIGATIVE COUNSEL, JANUARY 6 SELECT COMMITTEE:  Well, I think -- speaking first to the filing, I think it's completely baseless. I mean, this is a complete red herring. He's trying to get documents that have nothing to do with the question of whether or not he is, in fact, guilty here. Whether he had a criminal intent here. I think what he's trying to do though is one, give work to Jack Smith. He's asking for documents all across the U.S. government, from the intelligence agencies to the Department of Justice, and he's basically saying that if you find these documents it could help me prove my case. But I think what the Trump defense lawyer is trying to do here is to say I didn't have criminal intent if I'm -- if I'm the former president. I didn't intend to do something criminal because in my own head, my subjective mind thought I was doing something that was -- that was -- that was legal. That is not a defense here. And what I mean by that is that you can think subjectively that the election was stolen. It doesn't mean you get to storm the Capitol, for example -- and that's the difference. If you're engaging in something that you believe to be illegal, even if you had good intentions, that's still a crime. And I think that distinction here is going to be really important.",

This undercuts both parties and their legislative accomplishments for years and years and years. And that's the intent, you think? AGANGA-WILLIAMS:  I think that's exactly the intent and it's been openly discussed in the -- in the legal forums for decades, right? This way it's set up now has been happening so it's a new deal. It's the way the economy operates. But if this were to happen here we know Congress won't act, and what's going to happen is a stalemate. And frankly, for a lot of people, that's the goal.",
