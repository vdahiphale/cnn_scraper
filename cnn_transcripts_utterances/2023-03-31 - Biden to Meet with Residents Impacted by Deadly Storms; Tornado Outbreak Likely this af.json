That might be a possibility.There's also the idea and the Wall Street Journal is saying this, that it's an attempt to intimidate journalists in general.

We're told that the service will last about an hour and that the church here behind me can accommodate well over 1000 people.Now overnight, an obituary of little Evelyn was released and in part, you get a sense of just how much of a role this girl played in her family's life. She's described as being the beacon of joy to her family, and that her faith was pure and that her prayers were sincere. Now on Saturday, we're also going to see a funeral service for a nine- year-old Hallie Scruggs. Her father was the lead pastor is the lead pastor at the school's church. And in 911 calls that were released yesterday, you can hear her father calling 911 and saying that he was going to run inside of the building after hearing that there was a shooting that was going on inside. The dispatcher tells him look, it's not safe for you to do that. You really should wait until police get there. Now at no point during that 911 Call, does it appear that Scruggs father knew that his daughter had been shot. On Saturday, we're also going to see another funeral service. That one is going to be for 61-year-old Cynthia Peak. She is a substitute teacher. She is among the three staff members that were killed. And then the remaining funeral services will take place throughout the weekend and then into next week. Alex?",
