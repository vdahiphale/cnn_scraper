Now, it uses those tunnels to store weapons, to store its leadership, to store goods and other things like that. And even hostages, where many of the hostages, 135 still being held captive by Hamas, believed to be held.Now, how does it work? Israel has about seven pumps. It's going to pump water, seawater from the Mediterranean Sea into those tunnels. It is just at the testing phase right now. What Israel wants to see is if it works and if it will be a good addition to its arsenal of ways to try to destroy those tunnels and potentially kill militants and put things like rocket launchers out of commission. Will it work? Well, there is precedent in that Egypt in 2015 flooded some of the tunnels that ran from Egypt into the southern part of the Gaza Strip. Again, in order to clamp down on smuggling going from Egypt, weapons and the like going from Egypt into the Gaza Strip. Now, that worked for a time. But as we can see with the massive arsenal of rockets, rocket propelled grenades and other equipment that Hamas has amassed and been using against Israel since it carried out the massacre in October 7, it was only a short term fix because Hamas is quite able to still continue to smuggle weapons and other things into the Gaza Strip. What are the risks? Well, there's a danger to the water supply, the environment, farmers complained in 2015 and, of course, ultimately, Kasie, the big concern is that it could also kill some of those hostages.",

So here is the accumulation totals we're expecting, Amarillo northward, we could get a few inches of snow. Higher elevations again measuring feet, not in inches -- snow not in inches, but in feet rather. And so mountain snow, clear and cool, maybe a few lake-effect snow showers. Kasie, you mentioned the potential of some wet weather across southern Florida. What we're concerned about here is several days of wet weather as a stationery boundary sets up that is creating flood watches, flood concerns going through the rest of the workweek.
