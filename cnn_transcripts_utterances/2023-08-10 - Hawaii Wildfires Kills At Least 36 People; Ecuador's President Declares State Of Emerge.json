So, as of right now, we've seen a lot of cooperation, a lot of respect. As you know, the Convention Center has been set up as an alternative site for tourists that may be displaced right now.

We, at the moment, do not know the full terms of any deal that's been reached between the United States and Iran. You know, of course, that the U.S. and Iran do not have diplomatic relations. They have been in treaties and helped by the government of Qatar. And we know that these four Iranian- Americans have now left and are at the hotel. We understand that they are being fitted, they are wearing, and they will be wearing ankle bracelets. They are being in the custody not of the Americans, not of any international diplomats in Iran, but in the custody of Iran still, the IRGC, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard. That is the way it's going. And then we understand that once all the T's are crossed and the I's are dotted between the United States, Iran and any intermediaries, then they will in the next several weeks, we don't know exactly when, be actually freed, freed to leave the country. So, what the lawyer, Jared Gensler, has been saying and is saying to us, and I'm going to read you what he said is that, \"This is an important first step. We welcome it, but we are just waiting, and we are not gonna call it freedom yet. We're waiting to see how it all plays out.\" But you know, Dana, this is a really big deal. Siamak Namazi, 51 years old, has been held there for over seven years. He's the longest ever American hostage, they call themselves, American prisoner held there just because of being American. And the two others have been held for the last five years. There was another, a fourth, whose identity we do not know because the family has not made it public.

She's been looking at, you know, potential racketeering charges, which would allow her to ensnare many defendants, including Donald Trump. But the Trump campaign is now airing an ad in the Atlanta area where they did a number of claims against her. Some of them are true, like she's been disqualified from investigating Georgia Lieutenant Governor Bert Jones in this probe because she hosted a fundraiser for his Democratic opponent, something the judge slapped her down for. There are other claims in this ad that are more salacious and completely baseless. They allege, you know, that she had a relationship with a local rapper that she had previously defended. There's just no factual basis to back that up. So, Fani Willis sent a note to her staff, and I'm going to read you a part of it. She said, \"We have no personal feelings against those we investigate or prosecute and we should not express any.

So, he was the longest held and he had been left behind three times in U.S.-Iran prisoner swaps. Once under the Obama administration and twice under the Trump administration. There were also with him, two other Iranian-Americans who were taken five years ago. They were Emad Sharghi and Morad Tahbaz. And in the last year, a fourth who's been unidentified publicly. In other words, we don't know his identity. But all four, according to Jared Gensler, who is the lawyer for Siamak Namazi and family, say they have seen and they have eyewitness accounts that they are at this hotel now, out of Evin Prison and they are under house arrest. We have been told that that will include wearing ankle bracelets. They are not put into the custody of the U.S., of course, because the U.S. has no presence in Iran, nor the Swiss, which actually represents Iranian-American diplomatic interests. But they will still be under guard by the Iranian authorities and the Iranian security services. So, this is what Jared Gensler, the lawyer, is telling us. He basically says that this is a very, very good first step but it is only the first step because they are not free. They are not free to leave Iran yet. That, they believe, might happen, hopefully, if the deal goes as according it should, in the next several weeks. The brother of Siamak Namazi, Babak Namazi, says, \"We are grateful that Siamak and the other Americans in Iran are out of Evin prison and under house arrest. While this is a positive change, we will not rest until Siamak and others are back home. We cannot and we continue to count the days until this can happen. We have suffered tremendously and indescribably for eight horrific years and wish only to be reunited as a family.\" So, that is what's happening. We know that the families were told yesterday, I believe, by the United States, by the White House, the State Department, that this was imminent and also cautioned that this is not the end of this journey for them. But it's a huge, big step. So, there are four who have been let out of Evian Prison today under house arrest, under Iranian security surveillance right now. And this is how it all unfolded. We're just going to play you a report. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) AMANPOUR (voice-over):  It was a heartfelt plea heard around the world.

They said clearly that they would consider any military intervention in Niger to be an act of war, and they would defend Niger. They would rally together as these other military juntas. So, if this does go ahead, it means that we're looking at ECOWAS forces on one side and Niger, Mali, and Burkina Faso troops on the other in confrontation. So far, this coup has been a bloodless coup. Nobody has died in it. Nobody has been shot in the ways that you've seen coups in other places. And that's something the military has been celebrating. That's why they've been keen to show so many people supporting them. But if this does happen, it might lead to actual military confrontation. There could be deaths in this situation, Zain.",

ECOWAS, from the moment this coup happened, took a very hard line on this coup, I think much more so than what we have seen in previous coups in Mali and Burkina Faso and Guinea just in the last few years. I think, sadly, a lot of ECOWAS response is trying to correct their weakened response to those coups. You know, they sort of met those with the shrug when they happened. There was certainly no tough talk about trying to roll them back like we are seeing now. And so, I think it's both a reflection of the fact that Niger was seen as a real democratic state in ECOWAS and that rolling back this particular democratic state would really undermine the entire regional grouping, number one, and then number two, I think, as I said, they're trying to talk tough in ways that they didn't talk tough because they might have, you know, unleashed this contagion of coups by not drawing a line in the sand sooner when all of these coups started a few years ago.",

And it's certainly notsomething that this standby force has ever trained for. It's not received training from the United States. I mean, we're talking about a hostage situation where the president of the country is essentially being held as a human shield against this military intervention, right? And so, we're talking about going in liberating him somehow and then restoring him against the wishes of the entire national army. And at the same time, you've got, you know, at least an ambivalent society. We don't know fully how much support this coup has, but it doesn't have no support. It has some amount of support from the population. And so, I understand that ECOWAS is drawing a line because it feels like it needs to condemn any kind of coup, even if that coup has got a popular element to it. But as the same time, as Larry said, this has been a bloodless coup thus far, and I think the threat of starting a war in Central Africa right now is one that I think ECOWAS needs to be very careful about, how it positions itself and how it says what it's going to do going forward.",
