Look, we just heard from our Rosa Flores, who is on the border watching what is a crisis according to all of those who are there on the border.I know this is a huge issue right now. Joe Biden has said he's willing to make some big compromises with Republicans to get a bill passed that would not only try to deal with the border but also fund Israel in Ukraine. What do you think is the biggest compromise that you might be willing to make with Republicans, including the Biden administration to get this done? REP. DEBBIE DINGELL (D-MI): So, look. We've need a comprehensive immigration reform for decades in this country, not just for a few years. And you can't look at that report and not know that we have a crisis on our border. It's tough. It's really hard. And I think that's what people elect us to do is to get to really hard decisions. And there are a number of issues we have to worry about. We have to always keep our national security, front and center. But at the same time, we -- there's so many people coming here with hope, like many of our forefathers did, but they need to know the real circumstances when they get here. And I think we've got to do so many things. Tony Blinken is going to -- Secretary State is going to Mexico tomorrow. We need these governments of other countries to be communicating reality to those that are coming here. We must never lose our humanitarian and our compassion for people who trying to escape horrific situations. But we have a mess. And it's why we haven't dealt with this for decades because it is hard. But we can't put the hard aside anymore. So, let's see what really comes out of these discussions in the Senate. I'm not willing to say what I'm going to vote for until I know what is brought forward. But we cannot ignore this. And in the midst of all of this, we also need to remember that there is a need by some. We have small businesses that need workers. And caregiving in this country is a crisis. But how do you protect our national security all at the same time? It's not so easy.",

But it's still a mess that needs to be dealt with.I do want to ask you about one specific thing. And other Republicans have been really sort of going after this one thing saying this is the hang up -- this is the big hang up. And it has to do with humanitarian parole where the United States government can basically sort of let people in by bypassing the kind of regular immigration process if, on a case-by-case basis, it's for something urgent. An urgent humanitarian reason and can cause like a significant public benefit to the United States. That is one of the big issues that Republicans don't want to see continuing. They want that parole issue to stop and not let people in even with those sticking points. Is that a sticking point for you? Do you want to keep that in place that decision to be able to help somebody if they're in a major humanitarian crisis?",

We have to really have a tight definition of what that is.And that's why I'm unwilling to say I'll support this or support that until I know what are we being asked to vote on. And this is not simple. Anybody who thinks this is simple, we would have voted on it decades ago. And we haven't done it under Republican presidents or Democratic presidents.

But West has a long history of making antisemitic statements including tweeting last year that he was \"going to death con three on Jewish people.\" The Anti-Defamation League responded to West this morning saying that this may be the first step on a long journey toward making amends to all of those that he has hurt.
