Donald Trump way ahead, Jeff.JEFF ZELENY, CNN CHIEF U.S. NATIONAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT:  Without a question, John. And the one fellow that Nikki Haley was talking about there, of course, is Donald Trump, and he has held a commanding lead. That has been one consistent trend of this entire Republican campaign election year, this primary campaign election year, is that his lead has largely stayed the same. It's grown, in fact, from the beginning of the year. But take a look at these numbers in South Carolina. He has a 31-point lead over Nikki Haley. So, what this race is now, it effectively is a race for second place. Who is going to be the candidate to effectively end up with a head-to-head race against Donald Trump? And Nikki Haley has been on the move. For all the talk about these Republican debates this year have not really had much impact on the race. For her, that's not true. Her strong performance in the first and second debate have clearly put her on a path to being second place in this race. Yes, she's tied in Iowa with Governor Ron DeSantis, but clearly in South Carolina, which is number third on the presidential primary calendar, this is a strong showing for her. And John, she's getting her support largely from independents, as well as college educated Republican voters, that is a weak point for the former president. So, even though he is not going to be on the debate stage next week in Miami, she certainly is going to be. So, we are seeing a collision course here between Nikki Haley and Ron DeSantis, but she clearly is on the move. She will be campaigning tomorrow in New Hampshire. He is there today as well. So, a very competitive race in the undercard, if you will, in this campaign, John.",

She, of course, Nikki Haley, appointed him to the Senate in the first place, but he has clearly struggled. A big question here is, and we're keeping an eye on, will he make, will he qualify for the next debate next week in Miami? He believes he has but there are some questions here about if he's to reach the appalling (ph) threshold, the RNC has set.So, if he makes the debate stage, that certainly gives him a chance to be in the conversation. But he is struggling, of course, to keep pace with her. He's campaigning in Iowa today, so he is focusing on there as well. But it's been a difficult road for him in this campaign. She clearly is leading the way here, John. But again, the overall takeaway for all of this campaign is Donald Trump is still in command of this race. It's his race to lose. John",
