Thank you so much for joining me. I really appreciate it. I want to talk about the politics of all of this in your very important state and even more specifically your very important city of Dearborn. The Congresswoman from Michigan, Rashida Tlaib, did meet with President Biden's did meet with President Biden's campaign manager on Friday. You declined to meet with her. Why? MAYOR ABDULLAH HAMMOUD (D), DEARBORN, MICHIGAN: I don't think that this is a moment for electoral politics. I think over the course of now 115 days, Israel has murdered more than 26,000 residents and displaced over 2 million. And so for us, this is an issue that demands action and not lip service. And this is an issue that requires policymakers to come talk about taking a different course of action. And that's not a conversation you have with campaign staff.",

We will cut off every penny of money that we send to the Palestinians. If you empathize with radical Islamic terrorists and extremists, you're disqualified. You're just disqualified.

However, Democrats nationally need to reckon with the question of what does it mean for them to potentially lose thousands of voters on the response to this human rights issue and what are they going to do about it?The question you posed me is actually a question that should be posed back to the president. What will he do to regain the trust and respect of the Arab American and broader Muslim American community? And the position that we're taking, one in which we're demanding a call for a ceasefire, is actually the position of the majority of Americans. Over 60 percent of Americans support a ceasefire. Over 80 percent of Democrats support a ceasefire. So this is not without of line and out of touch of the general American people.",
