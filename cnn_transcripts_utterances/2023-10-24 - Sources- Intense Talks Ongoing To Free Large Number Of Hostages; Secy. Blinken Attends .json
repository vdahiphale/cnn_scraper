      "sentences": "So, this morning, we've learned that the United States and several other countries are in talks to secure the release of a large number, that is what they're saying, a large number of the more than 200 possible hostages being held by Hamas in Gaza. This would be their 18th day in captivity. So far, four people have been released, two Americans and two Israelis. Sources do tell us the negotiations are complicated -- obviously complicated by a number of factors, but they are ongoing.With us now. Retired General Wesley Clark, CNN military Analyst and former NATO Supreme Allied Commander. And, General, one of the things that we were talking about. Israel from the minute this happened said they will destroy Hamas. Their goal is to destroy Hamas and make sure Hamas can never operate again. But when we're talking about from a military perspective of achievable goals, what are the military goals within Gaza if there is a ground operation? GEN. WESLEY CLARK, CNN MILITARY ANALYST: Now, we don't actually know what those goals are yet. They would be classified in the Israeli operation. But we can imagine what they'd be. And the other big goals -- strategic goals are, destroy Hamas, make sure they can't reconstitute, provide safety for Israel, etcetera. But the specific tactical missions with objectives, those aren't known yet. So, you can speculate what they might be.",

This has to be a different operation. So, if they're really going to go after Hamas, they're probably going to compartmentalize Gaza, probably go after key locations in the north like the utilities, the desalinization plant, to completely secure an area, wall it off, maybe protect the population that's there, you identify the population, you go underground, and you do it step by step going through this.It's a very complicated piece of ground. It can soak up your manpower instantly. So, it's not just a matter of sort of whizzing in because they're going to come in behind you, they're going to come up from underneath, and the population is not on your side. So, anything you do, there's a whispering campaign. Even if you've knocked out all the telephones and everything else, the Israelis are here, they're there, they're doing this. So, it's you're at an intelligence disadvantage. So, you have to be very specific, very directed, in this.",

So, you can't simply blow up all the tunnels if you could do it by magic. If you could pump some kind of gas in there and blow it up, you might be killing all the hostages and a lot of civilians.",

And importantly, sadly, there's more another update that Blinken provided that we see here, which is that 33 Americans have died as a result of the October 7 Hamas attack.That death toll is higher than what the State Department had said Friday. And also, he noted that in the room as the council was meeting today, were some of the families of the hostages taken by Hamas with them sitting there today traveling over from Israel. Many of them to be at the U.N. Security Council today.",

Tom Emmer, the House Republican whip, and also Mike Johnson, the Louisiana Republican are the final two to be known -- who are going to this final round of balloting. Byron Donalds of Florida is out of this race as is Kevin Hern of Oklahoma.Now, the magic number is expected to be about 109 votes to be nominated as speaker. That is going to be of course, far short of the 217 you need to be elected speaker in the full House. So, that's going to be the challenge for one of these two members. We expect a vote in this conference meeting to decide to essentially say -- see if whether or not, any of these members who eventually get a nomination, whether or not those can actually get the 217 votes. That will be tested separately after the fifth valid vote, which will happen here in a matter of moments. But in talking to some members, what's clear is that there's a clear frustration, both of the process of how this has all gone down in the last few weeks. And some members are concerned flatly about Tom Emmer himself and his record on spending. Listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. DAN NEWHOUSE (R-WA): But he's frustrated.
