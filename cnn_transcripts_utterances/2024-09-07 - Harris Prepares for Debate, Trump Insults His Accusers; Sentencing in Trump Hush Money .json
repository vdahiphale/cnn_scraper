And with just under 60 days to go until Election Day, the two campaigns could not be more different.The former president spent much of Friday in a courtroom, trying to overturn his sexual assault and defamation verdict and lashing out afterwards at his accusers. Well, Harris is in Pittsburgh this weekend. preparing for the debate. A source tells CNN's MJ Lee, a big mission for the vice president is to find ways to remedy the muted mics rule during the debate. Her campaign want to showcase her skills as a prosecutor, despite not being able to respond to Trump in real time. And her team hopes it won't make Trump look disciplined and obscure what they call his unhinged nature. While Harris focuses on the debate, she is pulling in some top endorsements. Former Republican vice president, Defense Secretary, chief of staff and congressman Dick Cheney is now joining his daughter, Liz Cheney, in supporting Harris. In a statement, Cheney said, \"In our nation's 248-year history, there has never been an individual who is a greater threat to our republic than Donald Trump.\" Cheney added that Trump, \"tried to steal the last election using lies and violence. He can never be trusted with power again.\" Dozens of business leaders are also throwing their weight behind Harris, including James Murdoch, the son of media mogul Rupert Murdoch; \"Shark Tank\" host Mark Cuban and the former chairman of Walt Disney Studios, Jeffrey Katzenberg. Well, meantime Trump was in New York for oral arguments on his motion for a new trial in the E. Jean Carroll's sex abuse defamation case. Trump said he was disappointed in his legal team. He lashed out at Carroll and several other women who have accused him of sexual assault, repeating some of the same defamatory comments he was found liable for. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

You need time in between those kinds of prompts for that particular thruster to cool down and then fire again.

It takes time to figure these issues out. But seeing it safely land and deploy well and the service module fall away just like it was supposed to, I mean, again, let's remember that, in Apollo 13, those astronauts had a 10 percent chance of survival as they were reentering the Earth's atmosphere. And as they, as the Apollo 13 astronauts watched that service module slip away, they realized half of it was missing. And the moon gets further and their dream of ever walking on it slips away.

      "sentences": "The stakes heading into this debate are just so enormous because the race is just so close.Look, we had six battleground state polls out yesterday. This is our map right now to 270. The yellow states are the toss-up states. There are seven of them plus the second congressional district in Nebraska. Where are our polling tell us? Harris leads outside the margin in Michigan, outside the margin in Wisconsin. Doesn't mean she's going to win them. They're still competitive but let's give them to her for now right there. Trump led outside the margin in Arizona. Again, doesn't mean he's going to win it but let's give him that. That gets you to 252 to 230. I'm going to lean North Carolina red. Democrats are getting mad at me right now because there is some polling showing Harris maybe slightly ahead there. Until I want to see more data, I'm just going to lean it right because that's where it's been in every election since 2008 and in many before that. If you do that here's where you are. So let's say for the sake of argument, Donald Trump gets Georgia back and Kamala Harris can hold on to Nevada, which has been mostly a Democratic state, even though it's tough right now. What that gets you, 262-256. Nebraska would get whoever gets at one more. It would all come down to Pennsylvania. Let's flip the scenario for the sake of argument. Harris does well in the suburbs like Joe Biden. She holds Georgia. But the economic hardships after COVID in Nevada cause it to go back to Donald Trump. Same idea, 266, 252. Somebody gets that one, it still comes down to Pennsylvania. That's where we are. I can give you other scenarios where Pennsylvania doesn't matter. But as this plays out, the reason both campaigns are spending way more money there than anywhere else is because they think it is what's going to tip the scales. This is the most remarkable thing I find about Donald Trump. For all the volatility in our politics and all the volatility in him that you played in that segment at the top of the program, which was breathtaking. By the way, look at Donald Trump. In these volatile times, in all the tumult we've had in our American politics, he's a straight line. He's at 49 percent in Arizona in our new poll. He was at 49 percent in Arizona. That's the result in 2020. That was the result in 2016. In Georgia, this is the one slight aberration, 47, 49, 51. If you look at these six battleground states, two elections that have been settled, these are the final results and in our polling here, Donald Trump has never gotten the majority, except for in Georgia, once, once. He's the 47, 48, occasionally 49 guy. Now that's significant. It's going to get you close to 50. But if you're Kamala Harris, you're thinking, I need to get to 49 point what, right? You want to get to 50. But what is it? And how strong? In 2016, the third party candidates made the difference. When Joe Biden got out of the race, one of the reasons Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. left the race is because support for third-party candidates plummeted. So if you look at Donald Trump for all the tumult in our politics, in the battleground states, he's essentially a flat line. So Harris knows what she needs to be. Now in some cases, it's 47 percent, 49 percent. That's hard to beat but at least you know what the target is. Here's one thing I want to show you just to watch. Out in the west, she has some troubles with Latino voters. In the battleground states of Pennsylvania and Georgia where Black votes matters, in our polling, she's running a little bit behind where Biden was in 2020 right now. I want to point this out. It's a smaller subset of voters, so the margin of error is large. So I'm not saying this is -- these numbers could be a little bit better. Polling should not answer your questions. You should raise your questions. So when I read our polling, I said, OK, let's watch this to see if in other polls these numbers are a little bit higher. It might not be a problem but it's something the Harris campaign, they need this turnout so they're going to keep an eye on that. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Also last year, the Justice Department says it uncovered a secret Chinese police station operating in Manhattan, accused of intimidating Chinese dissidents living in the U.S. Reports at the time claimed more than 100 secret Chinese police stations in more than 50 countries and territories. China dismissed the claims as completely false, calling the locations \"service centers,\" to help citizens abroad with renewing official documents, like their Chinese driver licenses. This new 64-page indictment from U.S. federal prosecutors in New York reads like a spy novel, accusing Linda Sun of acting as an unregistered agent of the Chinese government, conspiring with her husband, Chris Hu, to commit bank fraud, accusing both of money laundering millions of dollars from China. Bankrolling the couple's luxurious lifestyle, paying cash for their nearly $4 million Long Island mansion and $2 million condo in Hawaii; buying brand new cars, like a 2024 Ferrari and Range Rover; funneling millions to her husband's businesses, even sending her parents dozens of salted ducks, a Chinese delicacy.
