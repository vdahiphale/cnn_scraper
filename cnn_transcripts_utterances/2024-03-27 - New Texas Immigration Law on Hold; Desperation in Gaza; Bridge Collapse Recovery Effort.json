At the same time, divers are searching for the six missing victims who were doing construction the Francis Scott Key Bridge at the time of the collapse and are now presumed dead. We're going to bring you live updates from officials throughout the day. Now let's go, though, on the scene to CNN's Gabe Cohen. Gabe, tell us what you're seeing. Does there look to be any terms of progress when it comes to clearing some of the wreckage or debris or even just investigating it?",

In terms of the recovery effort, that search-and-rescue that's becomea recovery, no word yet on any updates there. Those crews are dealing with really brutal conditions on the water, a lot of rain today, choppy waves, dark, very -- lack of visibility, dark conditions under the water, a lot of debris. So they're having a difficult time. And, as of just a little while ago, they had still not found anything substantial. And as you mentioned, there are a couple dozen NTSB investigators who are here that have been on that ship. They have spoken with the crew. And they have been collecting electronics, including the data recorder, that black box you mentioned, that they're currently analyzing. And they're hoping to release more information later today that can provide a bit of a timeline as to what went wrong here, what caused that terrible blackout, when the pilot of the vessel lost power, lost the ability to steer, ultimately creating that collision with the column of the bridge and the collapse. So we're still waiting on a lot of information there.",

SANCHEZ:  Let's get some expert analysis on the recovery from Butch Hendrick. He's a veteran rescue diver who founded and runs Lifeguard Systems. Butch, thank you so much for being with us. So, Maryland's governor described the conditions of the dive as treacherous. You have frigid temperatures, low visibility, and not to mention all the debris that's in that scene.

So, one of the things that's difficult as well for us is that we train public safety divers, police, fire, even military, to be able to find an object like a human body that's on the bottom, how to find evidence, how to work around a vehicle or two that have ended up in the physical water. We are not training them how to work on an operation that's this magnitude, the way the bridge is collapsed, the amount of debris that's interactive. And when I say interactive, if you don't mind, something of this sort, we visually see a bridge in our mind's eye, but, right now, every piece is twisted mangled, and turned in another format. And something as simple as moving one piece can move multiples. So, if you open the door on a car that might be entangled in it, that -- with that combination of current, could very quickly change a whole dynamic and another series of pieces could break loose. So they're searching on the outskirts of the debris, and they have certainly got to be very careful. With no visibility, everything is in braille.",

And, yes, the chances that one of the containers could be coming off, everything has got to be removed from the top up. And each piece -- when the commercial divers do get there, there's a good possibility they're going to be cutting portions of steel out to remove them, knowing that that piece can be moved without another piece, or they have got to secure one and two to move piece number three, or the whole thing will continue to re-collapse.

Another piece dynamically shifts, and you could have 20 parts that are suddenly going to change position. The diver could be dead in a matter of seconds, and he wouldn't even know it.",

And it appears as though early evidence says the pilot made all of the right calls in a timely manner. But the voice recorder will confirm that. In the sinking of the El Faro, the NTSB recovered the voice recorder from that tragedy at 15,000 feet below the surface. And it gave them an incredible picture of exactly what happened. For the data recorder, it will tell you what was going on with the vessel's engine and why it apparently lost power and whether it actually regained power or whether that was the alternate generators kicking in. I mean, I think this investigation, all of the pieces are in place to have a successful conclusion. The real challenge will be, how do you prevent this from happening again?",

And what steps did they take to both warn the bridge and to try and avert the collision? And I think the voice recorder will lay that out in detail. But it seems, early on, that the pilots were on top of it, and we just don't know what caused the engine to seize up and cease operating.",

Let me get you up to speed here, because in the majority opinion, the chief judge made it very clear that it is likely that this law, S.B.4, is not in line with the Constitution. Here's an excerpt from that majority opinion. It states -- quote -- \"The Texas removal provisions bestow powers upon itself that are likely reserved to the United States.\" Now, to a degree, the chief judge acknowledges that Texas is frustrated, because Texas argues that it is -- quote -- \"being invaded\" and that the federal government is not doing enough. And, of course, the state of Texas maintains that this is a constitutional measure. Well, the chief judge acknowledges that and says, the thing is, one of the root causes for the executive branch not to take enough action is because of the legislative branch, because of Congress, because Congress is not funding it properly, so that there could be a proper response at the border. And here's what the justice says -- quote -- \"Texas nobly and admirably, some would say, seeks to fill at least partially the gaping void. But it is unlikely that Texas can step into the shoes of the national sovereign under our Constitution and laws.\" The judge takes it even further and it says, look, it doesn't just impact domestic policy. It impacts foreign policy. Here's what the judge said -- quote -- \"The dynamic nature of relations with other countries requires the executive branch to ensure that enforcement policies are consistent with this nation's foreign policy with respect to these and other realities.\" And, Boris, of course, the plaintiff's here and civil rights and human rights organizations have issued statements saying that they agree with this decision by the appeals court, and they know that the fight is not over. I should add that the appeals court will have oral arguments on this on April 3. So it's not over, Boris.",

Now, Mexico has issued a statement saying in part -- quote -- \"Enforcement of S.B.4 would inappropriately burden the uniform and predictable sovereign-to- sovereign relations between Mexico and the United States and creating diverging removal requirements between and among individual states and the national government.\" Boris, Mexico is so concerned about this, especially about the potential of racial profiling of Mexican nationals here in the state of Texas who might be here legally, they are having all of the consulates in this state that are Mexican consulates provide services to individuals who are Mexican nationals just to make sure that they feel that their government is supporting them -- Boris.",
