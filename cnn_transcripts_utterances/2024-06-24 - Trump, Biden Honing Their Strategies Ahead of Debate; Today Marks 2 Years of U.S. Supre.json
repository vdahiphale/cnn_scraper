Plus, it's been two years since the Supreme Court overturned Roe versus Wade, handing control to the states.But how will it impact the outcome of the election this November? And a month's worth of rain in just three days. This morning, Iowa is reeling from what authorities are calling monumental flooding. All right, 5:00 a.m. here in Washington D.C., a live look at that beautiful sunrise in New York City on this Summer Monday morning. Good morning, everyone, I'm Kasie Hunt, it's wonderful to have you with us. Three days and counting before the historic debate rematch between President Biden and former President Donald Trump. A president and a former   president have never faced off in a debate like this. Both sides, of course, angling for any edge they can get, and the urgency feels palpable. President Biden has been hunkering down at Camp David for three days of preparation so far, including participating in mock debates, that style of preparation, of course, creating criticism from Trump's supporters, including Florida Representative Byron Donalds. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. BYRON DONALDS (R-FL):  He has to be in Camp David for 7-8 days to prepare himself to be in a 90-minute debate with Donald Trump. That does not bode well for a man who says he wants four more years. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

CNN's Max Foster joins us live now from London. Max, good morning to you. Bring us up-to- speed on the investigation into this and what's happened here? MAX FOSTER, CNN INTERNATIONAL ANCHOR &amp; CORRESPONDENT:  Well, we're hearing very slowly in terms of information, it's only just really wrapped up that operation. And this is an area of Russia predominantly Muslim population, but also with a very ancient Jewish community there as well. And this was attack -- apparent attack on both communities. So, two churches and a synagogue attacked as well as a police checkpoint and a police vehicle it seems. So, very dramatic scenes and across two cities, and it does appear obviously, to be coordinated. But we haven't had a formal update in terms of the investigation apart from they think that an international terrorist organization was linked to it. We did, of course, have an attack on the concert hall, didn't we? In Moscow earlier in the year, ISIS claimed responsibility for that, but we haven't had a claim of responsibility for this. In fact, the authorities suggested that the Moscow attack was more to do with what's happening in Ukraine. So, we wait to see what the authorities say and where they pin this.

They're much more concerned about that in terms of a regional escalation, because if there is, you know, the more skirmishes there are across that border with Lebanon, with Hezbollah, the more that there is risk of something going wrong or some miscalculation and it blowing up into a much bigger war, not just because Hezbollah is so well armed. But Hezbollah's linked with so many other proxy groups wish are also linked to Iran, and they could all get involved. So, maybe, the plan here is to go into this third phase in Gaza, but then, you know, shift the focus to northern Israel. That appears to be what all of the analysts are reading this as, anyway.",
