Good day. I'm Kasie Hunt to our viewers watching in the United States and around the world. It's 11 a.m. here in Washington Wednesday, November 8th, just nine hours until tonight's Republican Presidential Debate, 362 days until Election Day. This is today's \"State of the Race\". Democrats woke up thrilled this morning after voters handed them a string of victories last night especially on abortion rights. One Senate Republican saying the elections were a \"Complete failure\" for their party. Meanwhile, new CNN polling shows the Democratic President behind Donald Trump in a hypothetical rematch in 2024. About last night, Democratic Governor Andy Beshear won a second term and deep red Kentucky defeating Republican Challenger Daniel Cameron who had close ties to Trump and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell.

One of the only bright spots for the GOP Mississippi Governor Tate Reeves won re-election beating out Democrat Brandon Presley who was the second -- is the second cousin of the King. Now all of this comes despite rough poll numbers for President Joe Biden, the latest to CNN survey of registered voters shows former President Trump leading Biden 49 to 45 percent. We'll dig into those numbers in a second. But let's first bring in today's panel. Republican Strategist Doug Heye Former Communications Director for the RNC, CNN Political Commentator, Kate Bedingfield, former Biden White House Communications Director, and Molly Ball, Senior Political Correspondent for \"The Wall Street Journal\". Welcome all, thank you for being here. And it's been a long 24 hours for everybody covering all of this. But it came -- just let me start with you, because it's very clear that abortion is that was my big question going into the night was abortion going to be as potent of an issue as it has been in the other elections we've seen since the fall of Roe?

We saw it in Virginia where it was interesting to me that Glenn Youngkin was so aggressive about claiming that he had charted out sort of compromise position for Republicans on this issue. He sort of tried to take on this issue head on for them. And voters rejected it entirely and said, you know, actually rolling back protection from 26 weeks to 15 isn't a compromise; it's actually just a ban. So it was interesting to see the potency and also to see amidst all of the anticipatory chatter leading up to Election Day about how dire things were for Democrats? How dire they were for Joe Biden? It was interesting to see that on the issues -- on this issue of abortion, I would also argue on a lot of the issues that Governor Beshear ran on some of the kind of, I would argue core Biden economic issues, voters were still incredibly motivated to turnout for Democrats. So that's a great sign for Democrats as they move into 2024. But it was interesting to see that it was still so motivating for voters --",

And so what we saw last night, these were all state level elections, and voters are saying all right, if you return it to the states, this is where we're going to vote on it. Does it then continue to be a national issue? Or are Republicans able to avoid it at the national level by making that argument? The other thing is Trump has had this very interesting dance on this issue, where unlike his competitors in the Republican Presidential Primary, he has tried to avoid and sort of walk back his pro-life position, saying that -- that banning abortion is cruel. That the six week bans are not a good idea, sort of running away from that decision that is -- that that he did, right? He's the one who put those Justices on the Supreme Court and enabled it to overturn Roe V. Wade.

This this assertion that she was China friendly when she was Governor of South Carolina?

Some tougher numbers buried in there, showing that Latino voters just narrowly prefer Biden 50 to 46. 23 percent of black voters like Trump.

But then I want to show you this \"New York Times\" a piece of this \"New York Times\" story, because the big X factor is whether or not we're going to see an election where we have a convicted felon running against an incumbent president because it is entirely a possibility. \"The Times\" writes \"If the Former President is convicted and sentenced, as many of his allies expect him to be, in the January 6 related trial held next year in Washington, around 6 percent of voters across Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, say they would switch their votes to Mr. Biden.

Those constituencies that are going wobbly, for Biden, the young voters, the minority voters in particular, those are Democratic constituencies. They come home at the end of the day. They certainly don't go to Trump. But the other school of thought is, well, if the Democratic brand is strong enough to win in all these places, maybe Biden's the problem, and it speaks to his weakness.",

Those are a lot of the voters that we're seeing and polls are more sympathetic to the Palestinian cause. Biden is sort of on the same page as Democrats have historically been with his strong support for Israel, including the Israeli government, including President Netanyahu, who he's not necessarily had the easiest relationship with. But that's something that has inspired a huge amount of anger. And when you have a sitting Congresswoman, calling the President of her party complicit in genocide, that's not something you can really walk back. And coming from a state, Michigan where there's a large Arab American population, many of whom are very angry at the President about this. This has significant political implications.",

You know, heobviously went to Israel just a few days after the attack, which many people were surprised that he would make that kind of show of support, but also take a trip in which the outcomes were not baked. And we did not know what he was going to be able to get out of the trip. But the thing to understand about it is that in addition to obviously showing support for Israel after they had been attacked by a terrorist group, he was also going to try to maximize his leverage and helping keep Netanyahu, keep Israel from making what could be a rash movement that would cause the conflict to spiral. He really wanted to use his leverage to try to maintain a level of calm now that's, you know, it has now been a month and tempers continue to be very high, which is understandable. This is incredibly emotional. But I think, you know, for Biden, I would imagine, he will continue to move forward from a global strategic perspective, trying to do everything he can and use every again, quiver in his -- everyone's quiver, I guess, to try to, to keep to try to keep things from spiraling. And so if that means, you know, not publicly taking a swipe at Netanyahu in a moment where he's privately trying to negotiate a situation where we can get additional hostages out of Gaza, then he's going to do that. That doesn't mean that the public component of this isn't incredibly emotional and incredibly hard. We obviously are seeing it play out. You know, the one thing I would say about the politics of this, to the point to your point about kind of the younger, democratic piece of the Democratic coalition, I would go back to the conversation we're having earlier about who their alternative is. I mean, if they're upset with Joe Biden, because they believe he hasn't been supportive enough of Palestinian Americans, they're going to do we really believe they're going to turn to Donald Trump who instituted a Muslim ban.

Because, you know, you talk to anyone on Joe Biden's campaign, they will tell you that black voters are the reason that he is president of the United States today, particularly black women, but also black men. Look at the numbers there on the screen. Black voters support Biden, yes, overwhelmingly 73 percent. But Trump has 23 percent support from black voters, that is significantly higher, it's gone up in recent years. We also have Latino voters on the screen, 50 percent to 46 percent.

So we just have to make -- continue to make contrast. And that is if, and only if, he does end up being the nominee. Let's be clear that the Republican nominee has not been officially designated.

And there was sort of competing testimony on that question. The sons Eric and Donald Trump Jr. were sort of very clear and tried to push the question off on accountants saying that that accountants helped prepare some of these questionable financial statements that are behind the lawsuit. The former President went in Court two days ago and sort of went was all over the place and suggested that both accountants did it, but also that he was aware of, of how things were prepared. So I think prosecutors are going to ask her a little bit about that. And what she knows about the management of the Trump Organization sort of record keeping and finances. But to be clear, she's not the most critical or consequential witness here, that all came in the form of the former president and his two sons.
