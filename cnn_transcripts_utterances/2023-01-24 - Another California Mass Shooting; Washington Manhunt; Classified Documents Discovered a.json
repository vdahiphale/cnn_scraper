New CNN reporting is that classified documents were found at former Vice President's Mike Pence home. We are told that a lawyer for Pence discovered about a dozen documents marked classified at his home in Carmel, Indiana. They have now been turned over to the FBI. But the discovery comes after Pence has repeatedly said he did not have any classified documents in his possession. Let's go straight to CNN's Paula Reid with the latest on the story, Paula, this is happening again. What are the details on this case?",

Now, Pence has repeatedly insisted that he had no classified materials in his possession. But his attorneys uncovered these materials in boxes that originally went to a temporary home that he had in Virginia before moving on to Indiana. Now, I emphasize these were not in a secure storage area. Now, it is not clear at this point what these documents were or their level of classification. Now, once they were discovered, they were handed over to the FBI. And, Abby, the Justice Department is now conducting a review of this matter. Pence's lawyers say they also searched a Washington, D.C., office and they did not find any classified materials at that location.",

      "sentences": "Stunned.In fact, stunned from members of both parties. Leaders say they are perplexed at how exactly documents continue to show up outside of the secure spaces where -- in private residences, now Mike Pence's home in Indiana, this after Joe Biden's home in Wilmington, his private office, as well as what we saw in Mar-a-Lago. How this happened and why this is happening is a question that lawmakers want to explore. One, Senator John Cornyn, said -- quote -- \"it's not good.\" And another senator, Dick Durbin, who's the Senate Judiciary Committee chairman, told me that people, ultimately, elected officials have to be held responsible. He told me: \"I don't understand this.\" Now, one of the reasons why they're concerned is that we have focused a lot about Joe Biden over the last several days, including documents that apparently he had or that were in the Senate at the time when he was serving that somehow appeared in his private residences. A lot of members on both sides say it is unclear how exactly that happened as well and how Joe Biden could have gotten in possession of documents that are typically reviewed in very secure spaces Now that these documents are in Mike Pence's office, the concern from John Cornyn and others that this appears to be a wider spread problem than perhaps we ultimately know here, and also some calls to continue an investigation into this matter. James Lankford, a Republican from Oklahoma just told me moments ago the Senate needs to look into this. That is not something that Dick Durbin, who runs the Senate Judiciary Committee -- the Democrats run the Senate -- wants to do. But how will the House Republicans decide to pursue this? They have launched an investigation from at least two committees about Joe Biden's handling of this. What will they do about Mike Pence? We have not heard from them yet because the House is not yet in session, but we will later today, and it'll be done -- it'll be -- we will see if they decide to expand their investigation, look into Mike Pence, or simply keep it focused on Joe Biden -- Abby.",

He understood it, and seemed to have a sense of fidelity to it.But if you're DOJ and you're now seeing a former president, a current president with documents dating back to his Senate time, and a former vice president all dealing with the same issue, what questions do they have? How do they approach this? ELLIOT WILLIAMS, CNN LEGAL ANALYST:  Well, it's not all the same issue. And we should be careful here. Look, this -- the same law applies to everybody, which is that, Abby, when there are documents that have leaked out or been removed or not in a secure place, what was the intent behind getting them out of there? Was it inadvertent, as the vice president -- excuse me -- Vice President Pence -- I have got to clarify that now because there's so many -- but that Mike -- President -- Pence seems to be saying that these might have been accidental disclosures. Were they accidental or intentional, and what was the level of obstruction of justice or of an investigation that happened afterwards? That is what the Justice Department needs to look into. Now, look, that will involve probably, I think, a special counsel here to fairly and adequately look into how these documents got out, why they did. Was it just sloppiness? Or did some -- was someone voluntarily trying to get documents out of the White House? That is the same standard of law that has been applied to President Trump that should apply to President Biden and ought to apply here.",

Absolutely serious oversight is required, and not just of how they handle the documents. But we all have a system of overclassification. We classify too much material. And probably far too many people have security clearances. I mean, I used to be very frustrated as a member of Congress. I would go into a classified briefing, only to learn to learn things that I already read in \"The New York Times\" or on CNN. I mean, that's not helpful. And so I think there is a problem with this. And, by the way, members of Congress are -- I had access to some really interesting stuff. I was on the Homeland Security Committee, and I was responsible for infrastructure protection and Transportation Security. So I saw a lot of really sensitive things about how our enemies might try to blow up our airplanes or attack our critical infrastructure. And so -- but I think members of Congress are very attuned to this issue. And I'm pleased to say, in my experience, they never had issues. So the question is, can Congress do that serious oversight in a manner that is balanced, that would -- could actually help fix what is appears to be a broken system at the White House and the vice president's residence.",

If there's -- if we really do know everything, if Pence's team has really put forth all of the facts out here into the public sphere, and it is true that these materials were packed up in boxes, moved from Point A to point B, that he was not aware of it, it's not clear that would prompt a special counsel. In the investigation into former President Trump and current President Biden, part of what prompted the special counsel were how they handled and interacted with the Justice Department. With former President Trump, of course, his investigation among the most serious, in part because he has not cooperated with the Justice Department, also the volume of material, hundreds of documents that he retained and then refused to fully cooperate. His property was searched, of course, because there were concerns that he was even moving material after the investigation began. And then once he declared his candidacy for president, the attorney general decided to pass the entire investigation off to a special counsel. With the current President Biden, there are some questions about why it took them so long after the initial disclosure to search other locations, in one instance, not telling the Justice Department before searching another place, and then not being fully transparent with the American public. They sort of backed Garland into almost having to appoint a special counsel to handle a further investigation. Those facts are not on the table right now. So, at this point, it's not clear that there will inevitably be a special counsel. But, once again, the Justice Department is doing exactly what they did in the Biden case, which is conducting an initial review, and then they can figure out if this needs to proceed to a full-blown criminal investigation.",

Why did this man commit, as they say, the mayor here says, such a heinous act?Well, our Stephanie Becker, CNN producer, just spoke with a man named Adam Hood, who was an old friend of the suspect. They knew each other for a number of years. This man, Hood, rented an apartment from the suspect. Eventually, they did fall out over a small lawsuit and some other things, but this is what Hood had to tell us about the suspect. He said that this man just didn't trust people. He was a pure misanthrope. He led a very simple life. He had no friends, very few hobbies. This is a direct quote: \"He hated people to the bone.\" However, Hood says that he never saw this man act on any of that hatred. He wasn't a fighter. He wasn't an arguer, but, inside, he -- quote -- \"hated people to the bone.\" Now, apparently, the suspect did like to dance, and he danced a lot. He was an occasional instructor here at this dance studio, where he ended up killing 11 people. Now, apparently, the suspect complained a lot. He complained a lot about the other instructors at the dance halls that he went to and also about the people who managed and owned those dance halls. But, according to Mr. Hood, the suspect never complained about any of his students. His anger was always directed at other instructors, who he said treated him badly. Now, what Mr. Hood concludes is, he says: \"It was all in his mind. He hated people.\" Now, of course, there was a search of his trailer home out in Hemet, and police found lots of ammunition, another rifle and evidence that this suspect is actually making suppressors, silencers in his home. He was also arrested just once back in 1990 for a suspected unlawful possession of a firearm. Now, I mentioned 11 people dead; 10 people died at the scene. One person died in the hospital. And we now have identities from the coroner of all 11 dead, six women, five men, the age range 57 up to 71. And, of course, there are also some injured still in the hospital. And the local representative here, the congressperson, said a lot of those people in the hospital are not only having to process the trauma of what happened here, but they're now also worrying about their medical bills, worrying if they will ever get their jobs back.
