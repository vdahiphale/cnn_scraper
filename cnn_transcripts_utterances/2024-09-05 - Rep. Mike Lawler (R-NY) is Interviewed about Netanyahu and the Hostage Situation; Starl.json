Poll showing the economy remains at the top of many American's list. Harris taking the stage yesterday to promote what she says she will do for an opportunity economy, as she's calling it. Trump, though, has a very different message. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KAMALA HARRIS, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE U.S. (D) AND U.S. PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: My vision of an opportunity economy is one where everyone can compete and have a real chance to succeed. Where everyone, regardless of who they are, or where they start, can build wealth, including intergenerational wealth. Where workers are treated with dignity DONALD TRUMP (R), FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT AND 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: If you let the Trump tax cuts expire, which she wants to do. She wants to terminate them. If you do that, you will suffer the biggest tax increase in history. This country will end up in a depression if she becomes president, like 1929. This will be a 1929 depression. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

It's why Iranian petroleum sales have increased $100 billion since Joe Biden and Kamala Harris took office. Those are the funds that are being used to fund Hamas, Hezbollah, the Houthis, and other terrorist networks in the region.The United States not only needs to start implementing the Ship (ph) Act and the Iran China Energy Sanctions Act, my two pieces of legislation that were included in the supplemental aid package that this administration has thus far refused to actually implement. They need to cut off the source of funding for Hamas, and they need to hold Iran accountable. But more than that, we have to make it clear, there are still four living American hostages being held by Hamas, and three deceased hostages being held by Hamas. They have to be released immediately. And President Biden, and Vice President Harris, should be making that abundantly clear to Qatar, to Egypt, through these negotiations with Hamas, separate and apart from the situation with respect to Israel. The Americans should be released. And the fact that when those first hostage negotiations occurred, and you had hostages released, the fact that these Americans were not part of it is shameful.",
