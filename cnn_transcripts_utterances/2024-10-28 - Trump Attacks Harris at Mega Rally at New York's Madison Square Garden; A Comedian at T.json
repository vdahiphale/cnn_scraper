And at that very same rally, Puerto Rico is called an island of garbage. We'll speak to Puerto Rico's congressional delegate for reaction from his community and dire warnings. The entire population of northern Gaza is at risk of dying. We'll speak with an emergency coordinator on the ground who just came from the north of Gaza for the very latest. The rhetoric is being ramped up and the closing arguments are being made in the home-stretch to the U.S. presidential election. This hour, Vice President Kamala Harris is in battleground Michigan to focus on U.S. manufacturing. Earlier in an interview with \"CBS News\", she was asked what her first 100 days in office would look like. Have a listen to this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KAMALA HARRIS, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES &amp; DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE:  It's going to be lowering costs in a package of legislation, that is about lowering cost again. On the issue of housing, small businesses, child tax credit, basically putting more money in the hands of American working people, but also cutting middle-class taxes. A priority in equal form is going to be what we need to do to deal with reproductive health care and reinstate the freedoms and the rights that all people should have, and women should have over their own body. And then dealing with immigration and particularly border security and bringing back up that bipartisan bill that Donald Trump killed. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

You saw the expressions, it was a -- they called the people of Puerto Rico garbage in Madison Square Garden, no less in the home state of over a million Puerto Ricans. This is egregious. It is insulting and it will cost President Trump, if not addressed properly. You know, our people are not garbage, they're quite the opposite. They're kind, they're talented, they're beautiful. Puerto Rico is the connector of the Americas, both geographically and culturally. And we have a large legacy of patriotism.

Office for Humanitarian Affairs warns the entire population of north Gaza is at risk of dying, accusing Israel of what itcalls blatant disregard for basic humanity and the laws of war. Yet, the Israeli parliament could approve measures today that would make the humanitarian crisis even worse. It's expected to vote on bills that would ban UNRWA, the U.N. Agency for Palestinian Refugees from working in Israel, which would hamper its ability to aid Palestinians in territories occupied by Israel. A U.N. official says that could cause the entire humanitarian response in Gaza to -- in their words, disintegrate. Meantime, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, he'll address parliament today focusing largely on Iran two days after Israel bombed military targets there. Mr. Netanyahu accused Iran of trying to develop a stockpile of nuclear weapons aimed at destroying Israel. He says in stopping Iran's nuclear program, quote, \"is at the forefront of our minds\", suggesting further action could be coming. Let's bring in our Jeremy Diamond for us with the very latest. Jeremy, let's talk about, first of all, this proposal that's being put forward as being discussed. A two-day ceasefire hostage proposal by Egypt being put forward. Any traction there?

We actually heard indirectly, Ishould note from the Israeli Prime Minister during a private Likud meeting where he suggested that if this proposal was viable of a two-day ceasefire, four hostages getting released during that time, that that's certainly something that he said he would take, quote, \"right away\" according to a Likud member who was in that session. But he also cast doubt on it, suggesting that it's not a proposal that Hamas would actually accept. And that is indeed the question here, because Egypt really is trying to break the mold of previous ceasefire negotiations by putting forward not something that's a multi-phase process, that could ultimately lead to an end of the war. But rather something far more limited, almost a confidence building measure with just a two-day pause, four hostages being released and then the hope that there could be ten days of negotiations between Israel and Hamas to ultimately perhaps get to a permanent ceasefire. But the real question is going to be whether or not this is something that Hamas is willing to even entertain. In the past, of course, they've made very clear that they won't release any hostages unless it's part of an ultimate deal that would end the war in Gaza, but has their calculus changed in the wake of the killing of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar? That's something we may find out in the days ahead as the mediators are set to meet with Hamas to present to them a number of the formal proposals on the table, including presumably this Egyptian one.",

And I think it's important to recognize too, you know, sometimes we can get overwhelmed by these numbers, those are, you know, the people killed, the moms and dads and brothers and sisters, grandmas, grandfathers. And it includes the eight-year-old son that the director of Adwan Hospital. He was detained, and when he was released, he found that his eight-year-old son died in the fighting. Our figure is on the displacement, probably higher, we're estimating between 75,000 and 110,000 displaced from Jabalya into Gaza City, and that is putting an intolerable strain on the health system there. Just to pick one example, Daraj Health Center was seeing 500 patients a day before the war, that went up to 1,700 a day during the conflict. It's now a three and a half thousand per day of which we estimate about 800 children. That's putting an intolerable strain on the people, the system.

We're not able to reach all of the areas we want to reach, not all the areas we were granted access to for the first round. We are going ahead from the 2nd of November.

We are just eight days out fromthe U.S. presidential election and every day on the show we have been looking at the voter groups in states which could make or break the race for the White House. Tonight, we are looking and delving at -- into Wisconsin. Latest polling has Kamala just slightly ahead of Donald Trump, as you could see there, with 49 percent to his 46 percent, but her lead is far from locked in. When he ran in 2016, Donald Trump flipped to a traditionally blue state, with the smallest of margins, less than 1 percent, and there are concerns amongst Democrats he could do the same thing again. Let's get more from Wisconsin. Anya van Wagtendonk is capital reporter at Wisconsin Public Radio, and she joins us now. Anya, welcome to the show. I mean, as we've just shown our viewers there, it's such a tight race, right? Both candidates very much neck and neck with eight days to go.

And we're really kind of seeing that reflected on the ground. Everywhere you go you see, you know, really a kind of evenly divided set of yard signs. People are really certainly turning out and understand that this is, you know, really the most kind of purple of purple battleground states.

And so, that for Democrats in particular, is very, very motivating. It's a little complicated. It's tied up in our court system at the moment, but that's certainly an issue that you hear Democrats speaking about a lot. Republicans are also focused on immigration. And so, when the candidates come through, and as you mentioned, they come through quite a lot, they really speak to those issues at their bases. And I think a really key part of the strategy on both teams is to turn out the bases. There are a few, you know, undecided voters at this point.
