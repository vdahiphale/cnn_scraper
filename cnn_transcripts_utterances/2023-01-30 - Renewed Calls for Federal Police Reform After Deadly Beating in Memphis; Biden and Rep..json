Because, you know, Ben Crump said himself that we were a blueprint for what could be in terms of how swiftly we acted, but we also need to think about being a blueprint for what is possible and changing the culture of the entire criminal justice system.",

As the attorney points out, he arrived late to the scene, and also after he was pepper sprayed. It goes on to say, whether Desmond's actions crossed line that were crossed by other officers during the incident.Joining me now, Chris Stewart, he's managing partner and the Stewart Miller Simmons Trial Attorneys, and Todd Axtell, former chief of police there at St. Paul, Minnesota Police Department. Gentlemen, good to see you both this morning. Chris, the attorney is basically saying here, look, this should be about individual action. All five officers who were fired, of course, fired officers, have been charged with second-degree murder along other charges.

We are absolutely disgusted by what we have observed on the video and heard on the audio. It absolutely has to change. But there are things that can be done. And I guarantee you that this is not -- it was not a surprise by other members, good members of the Memphis Police Department, who saw this happen, because officers don't come to work on any given day and decide to act in this egregious way.

But I think you also hear from people, look, if we can do more stuff on a local level, maybe that will trickle up. So, I wonder, as you are looking at this, Chief, and you're looking at the way things are playing out, is there a blueprint that you see that could to more actions, specifically on a legislative level that would keep this conversation going?Sorry, Chief, that was for you, Chief. I think that we may have lost that audio. But, Chris, as we are looking at that, right, and you have been there in these meetings, as you point out. And there's always this back and forth of where things need to happen, where they don't need to happen. And I noted this earlier by we heard over the weekend from lawmakers, you have Congressman Jordan saying, yes, I think there are things to be done, but there is nothing in the George Floyd Justice and Policing Act that would have changed things for Tyre Nichols. It's this, well, I am throwing up my hand because this one bit of legislation is not solve all of problems. Do you see a way of breaking through that barrier?",

It is right there. You just have to do your job. That's why we need independent boards along with some police enforcement to review use of force incidents. They need independent prosecutors.

That's from the White House perspective, because it's dealing with paying our obligations on money already spent. Now, the White House also clearly says, when you talk to folks there, they are more than happy to have a conversation with Kevin McCarthy and Republicans about overall government spending going forward and reducing spending, and what have you. So, you see, or at least I think you can see where they become sort of semantics here.
