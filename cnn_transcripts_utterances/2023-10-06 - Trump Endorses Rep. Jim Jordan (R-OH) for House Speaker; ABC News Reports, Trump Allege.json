One of them is that Trump endorsement likely only helps him with conservatives and members of the House Freedom Caucus that likely he already could have locked up at this point.Really, Jim Jordan's difficulty and the path ahead for him is going to be whether or not he can lock down moderate support, whether he can get the support and backing of some of those Republicans who are running in Biden-won districts, whether he can convince them that he's the right man for the job. Because as Kristen was laying out, this is a guy on Capitol Hill who has led every investigation into Joe Biden, who has also been at the forefront of defending Donald Trump at moments when other members in the Republican Party would maybe wish that Republicans would take a step back and let Donald Trump go his own way. So, that is one of the key questions. Behind the scenes, Jim Jordan's argument to some of those members is we need to unite in this moment and I'm the guy who knows the rebels and can convince them to come with us as we move forward. He also argues he has an effective messaging strategy. He is someone who's on Fox News. He is someone who has a clear direction of where he thinks the party should be going, something that I think some Republicans wonder if Kevin McCarthy was as effective at. So, that is his argument. Whether or not he can sell those moderates or McCarthy allies remains another question. Erica, Phil?",

There is very little information in our federal government that we protect more seriously than that nuclear weapons national defense information.And just as an indicator of that is most people know a sitting president, not of course a former president, but a sitting president has the ability to declassify most top secret classified data at his discretion. This is one of those rare categories of information, nuclear weapons material, that is classified not by presidential order, but by statute. So, the president himself or herself cannot declassify this information at their own at his discretion.

They are one of our Five Eyes partners and our closest intelligence partnerships around the globe.However, protecting national security information is not based on making kind of game time, do-it-yourself decisions when you're talking to your buddy at Mar-a-Lago. You have to. We are all obligated to protect that information all the time, and that means complying with the very clear legal regime, the laws that surround how you can discuss information, who you can discuss it to, where this can take place, which, of course, in this case, would only be in a sensitive compartmented information facility, a SCIF. So, yes, we are very close to the Australians, maybe this person or others knew this information, but that does not make it lawful or a good idea to share that information, certainly somewhere like Mar-a- Lago.",

So, there may be underlying evidentiary issues that make this not the strongest issue to bring as an independent charge.

Would you support somebody in the speaker's race who did not want additional Ukraine aid? REP. VICTORIA SPARTZ (R-IN):  Well, listen, I think, you know, we have a different opinion, but I'll be honest. I think a majority of people understand that it's a very serious war, and ultimately we as a country, you know, we forced Ukraine to give up nuclear weapons. So, it's important for us, you know, that we help, you know, Ukraine, you know, to win that war. But it's also important that, you know, there is a proper oversight that we have a proper strategy and allow actions with this strategy. I hope it's a wake-up call for President Biden and some of the senators to understand that we have to start providing weapons to the military.

We have to be good in all fronts. And they haven't been doing that. And I think it allows, you know, people get upset, but it also allows Russia to do a lot of propaganda to destabilize.
