This has really been a negotiation, really, as President Biden said to the families today, since the earliest weeks of our administration, we've engaged in a process to try to bring these Americans home. And we had standards of what we would accept and what we would not accept. And really, over the last six months, that process intensified.We had very intense negotiations in Doha in Qatar. We're very grateful to Qatar and also to Oman for helping to facilitate this.
