Spanish Soccer Federation president Luis Rubiales is resigning. It follows weeks of fierce criticism for the unwanted kiss he gave to a star player during the Women's World Cup celebration. On Friday, the Spanish national prosecutor filed a complaint against Rubiales paving the way for the country's national court to launch a formal investigation and begin gathering evidence which could lead to possible charges. We've got team coverage, \"CNN WORLD SPORT's\" anchor with Don Riddell and CNN sports analyst Christine Brennan are with us. Don, I want to start with you. What else do we know?",

And even if Rubiales had understood the magnitude of the situation at that moment, he could have saved himself and the team and the entire federation, the Spanish federation so much angst, and you know, would have put this burden behind them at least from the standpoint of he would have been gone.No, he did not because he was living frankly, Paula, in a different world. He was living in a world where men could get away with this kind of stuff. Who knows if you feel comfortable doing that in front of the cameras, what on earth has been going on behind the cameras? We know the Spanish players last year, a year ago, were rebelling against their coach who is now gone, as Don said, as well. But there's been trouble in the Spanish Federation for a long time. And finally the comeuppance has occurred. I think this is a wonderful day, frankly, for women around the world, not just in sports, but throughout culture. And women are being listened to and the world is reacting. And if FIFA and the misogynistic, sexist world of soccer is reacting this way, even though it's only three weeks, that's also pretty quick in some ways. It's certainly much better than it would have been 10 or 15 years ago, probably even five years ago, Paula, and I think that's one of the big takeaways.",

But no. This blew up and became a worldwide story, obviously as it should have.One of the Spanish politicians right off the bat said this is our Me Too moment. And Jenni Hermoso right away in the first interviews after it happened said I didn't like that. So women have found their voice. The world has listened. And if the world of football, of men's soccer, male-dominated soccer, Paula, can listen to women like this, I think the sky is the limit for sports that are not as misogynistic or sexist. And so in many ways this is a moment of celebration even though of course the Spanish women didn't get a chance to celebrate because that was taken away from them by Rubiales.

This is doorbell video from last night showing Cavalcante is now clean shaven with a change of clothes aside from his prison pants. And this van that he stole last night has been found.

And in a map you can kind of sort of retrace where this 34-year-old escaped killer has been the last day or so.According to investigators, it was last night that he managed to slip out of that perimeter near Lockwood Gardens where we've been reporting from for the last several days along with my colleagues as well. And they believe that he quite literally just made it across the street onto a dairy farm where the keys to a van had been left in that vehicle. So it was as easy as jumping into that car and then driving about 22 miles north to the Phoenixville area. And that's where these new images are from, from the doorstep of a former co-worker of Cavalcante. Authorities are sharing these pictures as you mentioned. He looks clean shaven and looks all in all in fairly good spirits for somebody who's been on the run for well over a week and a half. But at one point then, he resumes that drive and then makes it about 10 miles west to northern Chester County which is where he quite literally ran out of gas and had to ditch that vehicle.

That number is expected to rise as rescuers go through flattened buildings searching for survivors. The worst destruction is in the remote areas of the Atlas Mountains. Reaching those places is difficult, but critical as crews begin to open access to areas that had been blocked by rubble.CNN's Sam Kylie is in the hard-hit region. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SAM KILEY, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (on-camera): People here in Asni, in the foothills of the Atlas Mountains, have thought that when this earthquake struck and it did this, they didn't so much feel the tremors as feel that they were being caught up in some kind of war. And that is exactly what it looks like. They didn't feel the ground shaking under them, they said, they felt and heard the sounds of explosions, explosions from within and without their own homes, and explosions up in the hills. And 25 people were killed in the town of Moulay Ibrahim which is just about three kilometers, a mile and a half or so from here. This is normally a tourist paradise, not just for foreigners but for locals, too. Some of the victims still be left buried under the rubble because it's too dangerous to get them out are actually Moroccans who were up in these mountains enjoying the cooler temperatures in the summer. Everybody we're talking to here, though, has got a complaint that the central government is really nowhere to be seen in their words. We have seen some evidence of their help with these yellow tents, offering temporary accommodation here. In Asni, that's accommodation for 1200 people who've lost their homes or whose homes are now uninhabitably dangerous. These areas have been struck in the last 24 hours by at least four aftershocks local people tell us. And they're saying they're just not getting the help that they need. Inevitably there is always going to be a level of frustration from people hit with this cataclysmic event but there are dozens of these villages all over this region and for that reason it is the hardest hit region in all Morocco where the death toll continues to climb well over 2,000 now.

And it's our fight too, right? It's a fight against a brutal dictator by a fledgling democracy. And to say that just because the fighting season may slow down their advance, that that somehow is equivalent to their failing when they have done nothing but win unexpectedly now for -- you know, coming on two years, is a little rich.Yes, the fighting will be different when the ground is frozen, but you know, frozen ground also makes it easier for vehicles to get around under some circumstances. So my point is here, that this is not something that's going to be over quickly. And if, you know, people are expecting a Hollywood ending here, that at the end of two hours, the Ukrainians are going to merge victorious, this is the real world. They have brutal, brutal fighting to do against an entrenched enemy and they're going to continue to win so long as we in the West continue to support them in their fight, which is why at the end of the day, I'm pretty animated against people who were saying that this is somehow verging on failure.",

Yes, they control the House by a very narrow margin and yes, the speaker of the House has to listen pretty hard to any four Republicans, including people like Matt Gaetz and Marjorie Taylor Greene because without them he no longer has a majority. But the reality is, we know how this ends. A budget does get passed. I do imagine that the, you know, social media performers on the Republican side are going to demand their pound of flesh.

You can see that eye starting to pop out once again in the last few frames that really indicate that we are seeing some strengthening and some organization here with Lee. Winds of 120 miles per hour. It's moving to the west-northwest at eight miles per hour. So this is going to continue to slow down a little bit.By the middle part of the week, we'll finally get a better idea of where this is going to go because it's expected to take that turn to the north. This could top out as a category four storm later tonight or early tomorrow morning. So we do expect further strengthening from the storm. But the million-dollar question with this storm is when exactly will that turn to the north take place? Models are slowly starting to come together and agree a little bit more on when that's going to happen. But then you can see how spread out they are up here. So a little bit of uncertainty there. But the sooner this turn take place, that will mean the less impacts we'll see to the U.S. East Coast, if any. So it's still too early to tell what kind of impacts we'll have along the East Coast, if any. The best thing to do is just be prepared. Stay tuned. By the middle part of the week, we should have a much better idea of what we're looking at here. Still a couple of possibilities of where the storm could go. We're looking at potentially passing a little closer to the East Coast or a little bit farther to the east. It all depends on what we call this trough right here, this ridge that's building, and if it breaks down a little bit more that it possibly could allow it to go a little bit farther to the west. But of course we're going to keep a close eye on this. We'll have much more to come in the days ahead -- Paula.",
