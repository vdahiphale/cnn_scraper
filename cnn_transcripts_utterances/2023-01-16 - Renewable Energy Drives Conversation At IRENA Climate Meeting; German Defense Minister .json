Coming up, we're going to get youthe very latest on the war in Ukraine and that deadly strike on the Dnipro. I'm going to speak to the Lithuanian Foreign Minister, who is calling on the world to supply Ukraine with more military hardware more on that in a moment. First though, I'm going to begin this hour, with a focus on the climate crisis and global efforts this year to tackle it. The top line is simple more needs to be done urgently if we as a world community want to get a tangible result. And that is, of course, protecting the planet. Well, that will be the message that business and political leaders will hear this week as they gather at the World Economic Forum in Davos. They will actually come face to face with the results of climate crisis as the Swiss resort boasts notably less snow compared to previous years. And that call for immediate action was also loud and clear this weekend here in Abu Dhabi, where the global climate conversation really got underway at the annual meeting of the International Renewable Energy Agency. A stark warning from UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres opening the meeting he said we should be investing $4 trillion a year into renewables to prevent catastrophic climate change. Well, I was there to see his address and partake in the high level discussions being held, have a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ANDERSON (on camera): We're here at IRENA's General Assembly surrounded by some of the biggest players in the global energy transition. Now this is setting the scene for the United Arab Emirates hosting COP28, which will provide a critical status update on our battle to fight climate change. SULTAN AL JABER, COP28 PRESIDENT: COP28 will be a milestone moment, as the world conducts the first global stock take to assess progress against the goals of the Paris Agreement. We don't need to wait until the global stock take to know just how much work there is ahead of us. ANDERSON (voice over): These leaders say they are working towards the same goal, limiting the Earth's warming to 1.5 degrees. But despite some progress at last year's COP27 in Egypt, the world is still not on track to meet those goals. ANDERSON (on camera): John Kerry, let me bring you in at this point, you know, collectively, the - is not on track to hold temperature rise at 1.5. And have we moved past that target at this point? And what policies and measures is U.S. putting in place to increase your own ambition? JOHN KERRY, U.S. SPECIAL PRESIDENTIAL ENVOY FOR CLIMATE: Well, thank you, Becky. Theoretically, yes, we can. But there's nothing in the current activities of countries all around the world, mine included, that indicates that we are prepared to do what we need to do in order to meet the 1.5 even if we went to zero, even if China went to zero we don't solve the problem. Every country has to step up and that's the virtue of the stock take. ANDERSON (voice over): the United Nations Chief Antonio Guterres addressed the assembly, emphatically outlining his solution, renewables, which he says are the only safeguard to our future, and can ensure energy security. Today he says renewables accounted for about 30 percent of global electricity. Guterres says this was doubled to over 60 percent by 2030 and 90 percent by 2050. To make a renewable future, a reality, its critical developing nations have the resources and tools to transition. But where will the required investment come from?",

And the very real work that needs to be done as we move towards COP 28, which is at the end of the year, right here in the UAE have a listen. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SAMEH SHOUKRY, PRESIDENT, COP27: Personally loss and damage was a great success, long overdue 40 years in the making, and thereby to have included it on the agenda. But not only done that, but to have created consensus on the establishment of the finance mechanism. The fund itself, I think, was a forceful indication of the degree of cohesion and the desire to build trust within the state parties within the developing. ANDERSON (on camera): The loss and damage work went a long way, I think to building or rebuilding the confidence and trust of so many people around the world who felt like they didn't have a seat at the table.

The IMF hailed Egypt for having finalized that program, and having instituted the necessary reforms in almost exemplary fashion. And then we were hit by COVID and subsequently by Ukraine, and this has had an impact on us as it has had an impact on others. ANDERSON (on camera): Then I understand. But do you feel the Egyptian Government misjudged the global outlook since the last IMF loan? And the Egyptian military has traditionally placed an outsize role in the economy?

And we've been witnessing some really tragic scenes as we've been covering all of this yesterday and throughout the day today, with people just breaking down in tears, people cursing Russia, for this attack. Obviously the Russians themselves at this point in time saying they were not behind it the Ukrainians not having any of that though. But right now, of course for the authorities here on the ground this remains as you correctly pointed out a race against time. They understand and they acknowledge that it's highly unlikely that they are going to be able to find any more people alive underneath the rubble. Nevertheless, the Ukrainian President says that this will remain a rescue operation as long as there's even the slightest hope of finding anyone alive here's what we witnessed. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) PLEITGEN (voice over): The morning brings to light the full extent of the destruction the residential building home to dozens of families annihilated down to the foundation. Even though rescue crews still work the chances of finding survivors now virtually zero. All night residents watched in fear, anger and grief. Nevin Shanaya says she passed by the building only about half an hour before this. There are many friends and people close to me here many, many she says. Elena stunned by the scale of the destruction curses the Russians. I simply hate them children people die here. We can't speak anymore. Throughout the night, the death toll continued to jump. On top of the many killed Ukrainian authorities say dozens were injured, many of them children. In just this location Dnipro one of many sites in Ukraine, Russia targeted with barrages of missiles this weekend. The Ukrainian say the reason why the damage here is so extensive is that this building was hit with a cruise missile called the KH 22 that's designed to destroy aircraft carrier strike groups. And obviously, when it hits the building, it completely annihilated burying dozens of people underneath. The Ukrainians call the attack state terrorism. And the President says rescuers will continue to try and save anyone trapped here. Let's fight for every person President Zelenskyy says the rescue operation will last as long as there is even the slightest chance to save a life. But even the slightest hope has now all but died.

One of them, of course, could be main battle tanks for Ukraine, but air defense certainly remains one of the main priorities. And Becky, we do know that right now Ukrainian troops are being trained in the United States on the Patriot anti-aircraft system, one is being provided by the United States, one will be provided by Germany. That the Ukrainian state is an important first step, because that's a very long range air defense system that could have a chance to knock out one of those cruise missiles like for instance, the KH 22 even though that is still very difficult. But the Ukrainians say they will need a lot more help defending their skies, a lot more systems to help defend their skies. It is obviously a very difficult task, and certainly one where they hope they say they hope the international community will do a lot more to help them keep their citizens safe, and obviously keep their city safe as well Becky.",

Honestly, I don't think that Ukrainian civilians should be paid with their lives in order to get the weapons that they need. I think we have to be way more serious about how do we see this war ending. And it has to end in Ukraine, by training us winning the territories that are now currently under Russian occupation. And for that, most of all they need, they need weaponry, and all kinds of weaponry. And first and foremost, it's tanks and main battle tanks.

It's the deadliest air crash in more than three decades in Nepal. Dozens of bodies have been pulled out of the gorge using cranes; some are yet to be identified by family members. On Monday, rescue teams retrieved the black boxes, the flight data and cockpit voice recorder that could help understand the moments leading up to the crash. The Himalayan country has a record of air accidents due to its mountainous topography and sudden changes to the weather. But in this case, officials say it was a clear day. The Nepal Government has set up a panel to probe the air accident and will hopefully find answers to what led to the third worst aviation accident in Nepal's history.

They are calling for the worlds or newtaxes, certainly on the world's wealthiest individuals. Report found that the richest 1 percent received nearly get this twice as much money as the rest of the world combined in the past two years. Well, the headline may be more startling, I do feel as if it's a little bit like Groundhog Day, because joining us now from London is Anna Stewart. Anna, I am pretty confident that we have had this discussion before around Davos as the sort of great in the good. Certainly those who earn the most it seems get to the top of the hill, the content of this report doesn't really seem too different from what we've heard before.

      "sentences": "Well, I think that's the most depressing fact of it all, really, is that we get this report from Oxfam on the eve ofDavos every year before the meeting, when the elite all gather in this very swish ski resort in Davos. And every year, we find out that the wealthy have got wealthier, and inequality gap just seems to get wider. And it's really no different this year. It's good to see some protesters are out there braving the cold, waving their banners. Now, according to this report, you came through some of the facts of how much wealthy the wealthy have got. You can see there, the top 1 percent have gained $26 trillion versus the rest of the world. And actually, in this report, they say every billionaire is a policy failure because Oxfam believes that with a change of policy, we could see much bigger wealth redistribution, and that is what they want to see. So they do come up with some solutions in this report. For instance, they want to have a onetime wealth tax on the rich. They want windfall taxes on companies to end profiteering off things like the war in Ukraine, think about those energy companies and the huge profits they've made. Where does that go to the shareholders? And also, I thought this one was interesting, a permanent increase of taxes on the richest 1 percent to at least 60 percent of their income from labor, and also from capital. And I find this one interesting, because it suggests, of course, that you could actually tax people on their shares that they have like Elon Musk. How would they pay for their huge value of the shares they hold? Well, they probably have to sell some. So some real action there to be taken, according to Oxfam but Becky, the question is will anyone actually do anything about it? Given we get this report almost every single year I do question whether it will actually move the needle? But it will put pressure on policymakers and these figures are useful for lobby groups.",
