Let's look at this, Lynda, we are in a city that's become a lake, you have this water that's mixed with all sorts of material, whether it's oil, it's waste, it's everything from the environment. And it's all across the city. This is a state of about 1.7 million people and most of the stage is underwater. That's the reality of people here who have to use boats where they have to work before where they could walk over; they could use vehicles because so much of their life is submerged. We haven't heard from people who escaped the floods with nothing more than their lives, the kids and the clothes on their backs, who have lost everything. The fridge the couch, their every single possession in life is under the water right now. They have to make do with it. When you look at this city, for instance, you see people who are having to make do with just get your boots and roll up your sleeves and try and wait and get through it across from the streets is what used to be a car that belongs to a driving school here that's completely submerged. I don't think that's ever going to work again. And the building that houses the driving school across the street, that's the front ground floor, is completely gone. So its people who are living on the second floor and higher who kind of wade through it and try and make the way to the top of it. And that's the reality for life be in here in Bayalata, but also for many, many parts of Nigeria. And that's why there's so much anger that the government didn't respond effectively to this crisis and has not declared a national disaster, not putting emergency measures even though for many people who are displaced living rough on the streets. It's a very real, very immediate emergency for them. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MADOWO (voice over): Our communities still submerged nearly a month after the flooding began with no end in sight. Boats have become the only way to get around much of Bayalata State in Southern Nigeria. The street of tends to rivers driving entire communities away from their homes.

There's also a real fear about food insecurity because people have had their livelihoods washed out. So they have to depend on aid for any sort of assistance. And that is exacerbated by the climate crisis. That is a real challenge here. The government has blamed this on the climate crisis. But Nigerians don't feel that that's correct. They feel this is a result of negligence. But the reality is what's happening here is not too dissimilar from what we saw earlier in the year in Pakistan.

What we're seeing today is that we're absolutely addicted, as was said by Dr. Tedros, from the W.H.O the Director General ofthe W.H.O, to fossil fuels, and that fossil fuel addiction is resulting not only in exacerbated impacts from climate change, but also indirect health harms. We're seeing that people around the world are still suffering from energy poverty, they cannot access the energy they need, for their basic needs to keep the walk their homes at healthy temperatures, to cook, and to refrigerate and light. And we're seeing that about 13 percent only 13 percent of the people in the lower human development index countries today have access to clean fuels and technologies for cooking. All the rest are still relying on dirty fuels. That is the consequence of the low adoption of renewable energies and the continuous over dependence on fossil fuels. And we looked at the air in people's home in 62 countries, it exceeds more than 30 times the levels of air pollution compatible with the guidelines of the W.H.O people are breathing toxic air in their homes. What this means is that people are still relying on dirty fuels because of the low adoption of renewable vulnerable to the volatile fossil fuel markets, to energy poverty, and to all the health consequences that come with it. So today, while countries are devising their responses to the energy crisis, if we go back to fossil fuels, this situation will only get worse. And so in the climate crisis, we will be condemned to a future of ill health. But we also see that by aligning our response to the climate crisis with the response to the energy crisis through a health lens, what we could prioritize is a rapid transition to clean energies, avoiding about 1.2 million deaths each year from exposure to outdoor air pollution that comes directly from fossil fuel burning. We could also deliver healthier cities, more active travel, better cardiovascular health, better lifestyles. Through better diets, we could avoid up to 11.5 million deaths that today we incur through high carbon diets. So we're seeing that the transition towards healthier energy systems is very well aligned to the transition to a healthy future.",

However, we're also seeing an opportunity here, if today, rather than taking those profits and investing them to fossil fuels, they will invest in a low carbon energy transition, which they have the infrastructure and the capacity to do that could actually be part of the solution. We need to see at COP 27 strong commitments from governments to stop subsidizing fossil fuels and redirect those funds to promoting low carbon energy. And to help those that are struggling today with the rising energy costs. We need the commitments made by oil and gas companies to be kept and for oil and gas companies to be held accountable, legally accountable for their commitments, because today, they're undermining the future of our soil.",

What we need is for all countries to realize that the costs of inaction vastly exceed the cost of action.

Andrei Kelin discussed Russia'soptions with CNN's Chief International Anchor Christiane Amanpour. And you can catch the full interview on Amanpour later today at 6 p.m. in London 9 p.m. in Abu Dhabi. Well, prices at the pump are falling sharply across much of Europe, laying fears of a potential crisis this winter. Gas is less than a third of its peak costs this summer, due in part to fuel storage tanks reaching capacity and mild temperatures. And another possible reprieve could be on the horizon. A check minister says his counterparts in the European Union are on board with supporting a price cap on gas and electricity, though they are still split on how to do it. Our correspondent Anna Stewart is following the developments and joins us now from London. Anna, the key question here will energy companies bring down the prices?",

But what we are seeing in terms of prices right now is a huge fall. And I think we've got a chart we can show you the European benchmark for gas. And it's now dropped to levels we haven't really seen since mid-June, so actually before Russia started reducing supplies down Nord Stream. Now some of this is good news. This has been Europe working very hard to secure gas supplies at a huge cost. And there was of course, a plan to try and fill up their storage facilities. The target was 80 percent by the first of November, it's already well above 90 percent, they've done incredibly well. And also you know what temperatures are pretty high right now for this time of year. So demand isn't where it could have been. That is all the good news. The bad news is Europe frankly has too much gas at the moment in many ways. It's got more gas than it knows what to do with. And as storage facilities being so full just shows you the limitations here because there are LNG vessels floating off the coast of Europe unable to come in. There aren't enough LNG terminals, regasification facilities; there aren't enough storage facilities to further bolster the security. And when we look at prices for December, January, February, you do see them climb again. So we're not out of the crisis. And we also have to start to worry almost already about next winter because we'll be approaching next winter as a continent probably with storage facilities absolutely dry.",

That's according to state run media. They've described this incident as a terrorist attack. They say three armed men entered the shrine in the southern city of Shiraz armed men shooting those inside. And at least two people have so far been arrested according to the authorities, as reported by state media. They're currently affording to detain a third individual but this is developing as we speak. Now this is just coming in. We still don't have all the details around this incident. But it is of course important to remember the context in which this report is coming in. We have seen over the last few days and particularly today, widespread demonstrations across the country and a significant presence by the Iranian security forces they have previously framed these protests as rioters as those attempting to disturb state security. We understand of course, from the Iranian state prosecutor, public prosecutor, rather, who said on Monday that more than 300 protested had been charged for allegedly threatening state security. So this is certainly important context for where we see this attack coming. There are concerns that this could potentially lay the groundwork and set the pretext for the Iranian authorities to perhaps step up at the presence of their security forces. We've already seen a significant presence and of course, very much concerned that this could give the pretext for the Iranian security forces to step up their crackdown on protesters. They've already framed these demonstrations, many of them, of course, largely peaceful protests, as riots as people threatening state security. And we have seen the use of excessive and lethal force. Now given this incident and the details that we're seeing coming in now, this could certainly set the pretext for intensification of that crackdown by the Iranian security forces. But of course, none of this is still really much coming in now. We still don't know all the details around the motive behind this potential attack. And this is of course, being reported by state run media that is important to note. But at this stage, as we understand it 15 people killed including two children, at least 10 people injured.

But what we learned from Alphabet last night when it performed or when it was released results was that it missed on the top and the bottom line, the revenue and earnings. And a few things are happening here, Lynda. On the one hand, you have increased competition from the likes of players like Tik-Tok, but on the other hand, there's a larger macro story. And I think that's what we're getting at when we talk about the economic slowdown or recession fears. Our Alphabet, Google's parent saying that it is seeing slowing ad spent. The reason why this matters is because in periods of economic uncertainty and periods of economic slowdown, it tends to signal marketing and ad budgets. That's where we tend to see the first sort of belt tightening from corporate America. And so it gives you a signal sort of how executives are feeling about the state of affairs. And what we learned is that in fact, we're starting to see slowing spend in categories like mortgages and loans. And here in the U.S., mortgage activity has really fallen because of increased interest rates, sales have really fallen. And so you're starting to see that spill over not just in the housing industry, but for the bigger digital ad spend players. One analyst putting it this way, when Google stumbles Lynda, it's a bad omen for digital advertising at large. And I think that says it all.",
