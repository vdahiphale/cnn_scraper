Epshteyn is really the only person, given the context in that indictment, who they could be referring to. And the next example is a mention of e-mails that were sent between John Eastman, Ken Chesebro, who are both attorneys working for the Trump legal team, and the third recipient, we know was Boris Epshteyn. So, really, that allows us to nail down who this individual, co-conspirator number three was.",

And there are similarly details that also help us identify Kerik as the individual listed as number five. We know that Bernie Kerik was deeply involved with Rudy Giuliani's legal team trying to help find evidence of widespread voter fraud. And we know that Bernie Kerik was specifically at a White House meeting in November 2020 where Trump was present, and they were talking to a bunch of state legislators from Pennsylvania, trying to pressure them to hold a special session in their bid to overturn the election. So, his presence at that meeting, in addition to the confirmation from his lawyer, made clear. We also know that another individual co-conspirator number six is also at that meeting in November 2020. Phil Waldron, an election denier, a member of Giuliani's team. We were able to find out through context clues and his attendance at that meeting that he too is one of the unnamed individuals.

And when I was talking to people in Trump's orbit after, you know, this indictment came out the other night when were on air, that was one of the first things they pointed to. The fact that there are these 18 other co- defendants that were listed in the actual charges, but also these 30 unindicted co-conspirators that Zach was just referencing there. I mean, several of them, some of them still work for him, including Boris Epshteyn.Some of them are still high ranking officials in the state of Georgia, including the lieutenant governor, Burt Jones, he's unindicted co- conspirator number eight CNN believes. And so, just to look at the magnitude of that and the people who are not just always people who are close to Trump like a Boris Epshteyn, but also a lot of these officials who were in Coffee County who aren't in Trump's inner circle at all. I think there is a lot of room for some potential plea deals here. Of course, we don't actually know if that's something that some of them are going to pursue, but it's certainly an open and fair question in Trump world. And they themselves were trying to figure out who these names were that Zach was just going through here, trying to identify each of them. You know, not even just in this case, in other cases, Jake, they've also been trying to figure out who the unindicted co-conspirators were and if there are people who are still actively in Trump's orbit.",

And I have been making some calls on this, Jake, and I am now told that it is unlikely, that is, to go forward in any real capacity if anything happens on Monday at Bedminster at all, when he teased that it's going to happen there at his golf course, in part that is because we are told that his advisors have warned him and cautioned him against having a press conference on baseless claims that he's been making for three years now that don't have anything to back him up but also while he is facing several trials precisely for that.And so, we'll see what actually happens on Monday. But right now, Jake, I'm told it is unlikely and there should be real doubt on the idea of any press conference happening at all.

And what I was told is that a few months ago, Giuliani and his attorney, Bob Costello, went down to Mar-a-Lago in late April, they met with Trump and they were basically making this pitch, Jake, that it is in Trump's best interest to be paying Rudy Giuliani's legal bills. What we have seen come forward in recent days from other attorneys in court is he is cash strapped. He is basically broke, that they say he cannot afford the legal bills that he has right now from that Smartmatic lawsuit. And basically they went to Trump trying to get him to cover all of Giuliani's legal expenses, given he was doing stuff at Trump's behest.Trump only agreed to pay $340,000 to this data vendor. That might seem like a lot of money. It is a lot of money, but when you look at what Giuliani is up against, he has seven figure legal fees, Jake, right now, and he is really struggling. And so it speaks to, one, something not surprising. Trump does not want to go into his own money to pay for someone else's legal fees. Certainly he's paying a lot of people's already. And two, it just speaks to the immense financial stress that Rudy Giuliani finds himself under. And it's not even close to being over because he's facing disbarment proceedings, he's got lawsuits, and now, of course, he's been indicted in the state of Georgia.",

But the other thing I'm hearing, Jake, is that Donald Trump this week even, has been telling people in conversations that he thinks Fox News is worried about ratings. He had a dinner last month with Fox News executives, the president, Jay Wallace, and chief executive Suzanne Scott, and they really encouraged him thoroughly to join the debate. And he's been telling people, I remember -- I talked to someone on Monday who just spoke with him about this, saying that he thinks this means that they're very worried that they're going to do poorly without him there.

But what all of this does is a couple of things, one, it raises the bar for Governor DeSantis to actually pull all this off. It raises the bar for him to go after Vivek Ramaswamy in this way. But it also points out perhaps one of the biggest challenges and flaws of his campaign. That is he effectively has outsourced virtually everything to his Super PAC. That's why this had to be published online, so he could see it, so he could see the smart advice, if you will, from Jeff Rowe, who's leading the Super PAC because his campaign can't talk to the Super PAC. So this is the challenge. He's outsourced all this field work to the Super PAC as well. So this is essential part of this.But back to the actual debate itself, I think the idea of going after Chris Christie like that, who's very practiced on a debate stage, he's done this before, pretty risky to go after him. And at the end of the day, the voters I talked to in Iowa and New Hampshire, other states want to see some differentiation. If they're turning the page from Trump, that's what they want them to do, turn the page from Trump. So defending Trump by going after Christie, I'm not sure that works.",

Right after I was named, however, like you said, conservative news outlets in Idaho started putting out all of this horrible press, saying that I was influencing the students in my classroom in negative ways.
