The PRC cannot enable the largest war in Europe in recent history without this negatively impacting its interests and reputation.So what should we make of NATO calling out China in this way? And what sort of reaction could we see and what other action could NATO take? SCHMIDT: To be quite blunt, NATO declared that China was now a direct threat to the North Atlantic, right? And to its European-based members, which it hasn't done before. That's quite a big deal, and it extends the philosophical umbrella of NATO beyond, you know, European boundaries, right? At least in theory, right? This opens up the idea of Georgia, or this opens up the idea of using NATO as a structure to build some kind of alliance in the Far East. And so this is really a statement that there's a world that's emerging now with Russia and China and North Korea on one side. And the United States and NATO and Europe on the other.
