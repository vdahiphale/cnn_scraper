The French President said there was no alternative to his unpopular Pension Reforms as he signed them into law, and then he addressed the French people about an hour ago, his effort to turn the page after weeks and months of political infighting, turmoil, and discord on the streets. It hasn't stopped. In Marseille, a few moments ago, this was the scene. The French President says he has heard the outrage from protesters and striking workers. He wants to talk to union leaders about work conditions and pay. He says, the French people must tackle the country's economic problems together.

He said, Mohamed Hemedti (ph) Dagalo, the leader of the Rapid Support Forces, the RSF has mutinied against the state. He gave the interview to our chief international investigative correspondent Nima Elbagir. She's with me from London. This is just terrific. I mean, these are fight -- they're fighting for what? Control of one of the poorest countries in the world with the most dreadful conditions for most ordinary people. And still, they are killing each other.",

I spoke to General Burhan inside the army H.Q. and I could hear, Richard, the sounds of explosions and fighting, bearing down on him. It's very clear that that up until now, there is really no way forward. We were able to speak to doctors who had been forcibly evacuated after their hospitals came under attack. And what they described was horrifying that at some point, they were forced to evacuate patients. One doctor said to me, we began praying for salvation. And by the time we were evacuated, we were actually praying for a painless death. It's so hard to get that information. But what we're hearing is just awful.",

But we haven't really heard much in response. Egypt is deeply concerned because their soldiers have been taken hostage by Dagalo. This is one of those situations which you actually really see the new world order. And the new kind of spheres of influence, really thrown sharply into relief.

The -- if you're traveling to the United States, for travelers who -- from countries who must apply -- if you need a visa, it cannot take more than two years to be granted permission to arrive. Here's a few examples. If you're an Indian Capital, Delhi, your average weight is 333 days, on average. Getting a tourist visa in Brazil or Brasilia, 479 days. The approval process average is 714 days in Mexico and a whopping 752 from Bogota. The cost of all these delays, 2-1/2 million visitors and billions of dollars in spending. The reality of course, is many people, E.U. and others, Asia come on the visa waiver scheme. So, they don't need to. But you only have to fall foul on one or two things. And you're in the visa system. And therefore, the queues. Geoff Freeman is with me. CEO of U.S. Travel Association. You are going to tell me that these waiting times are unacceptable. And I'm going to ask you, so what can you do about them? GEOFF FREEMAN, PRESIDENT AND CEO, U.S. TRAVEL ASSOCIATION: Richard, not only are they unacceptable, they're completely counterproductive. I mean, these wait times are telling these travelers to avoid the United States. Let's face it, nobody in their right mind is going to wait 700 days for the right to do an interview to come to the United States, when they've got plenty of other markets around the world that are competing for their business. And in terms of what do we do about it? That's the key. We got to compete for their business. We've got to find a way to attract these travelers to the United States. India, that wait time you mentioned of 300-some days, it was nearly 700 days just two months ago. So, we have it in our arsenal to figure out what needs to be done to reduce these wait times. It's absolutely critical. We do that. If we want to attract these travelers and the billions of dollars they spend.",
