Well, it cost him the speakership in 2015. On the other hand, he's the speaker now. So perhaps the politics are changing. I think what you saw from Comer is look, saying the quiet part out loud. Saying on national television what you would normally say in a closed room with donors or inside your caucus as you're making political strategy. It's nice that he sort of laid out for us exactly what they're doing. I think there will be a backlash. I don't think Americans like to see their government being used in such a nakedly partisan fashion. I think it will cause a lot of people to discount whatever it is they come up with.
