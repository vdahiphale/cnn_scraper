      "sentences": "Well, early Tuesday, former president Donald Trump announced that he received a target letter for the investigation into January 6. And this announcement came just hours before his attorneys were expected in court, in Florida, for the special counsel's other investigation into the mishandling of classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago resort.Now, it's interesting that this hearing in Florida was the first time that prosecutors and defense attorneys appeared before Judge Aileen Cannon. She's the Trump appointed judge, who will oversee the prosecution and all eyes were on the judge to see just how receptive she was going to be to the Trump team strategy of trying to delay any possible trial until after the 2024 election. I was in court for about two hours for this hearing and it was clear that Judge Cannon was amenable to the strategies that she thought that the special counsel suggestion. Could they do this case? Put this case on trial in December? That was a, quote, compressed timeline. She said, look, cases like, this they take more time. Now both sides were arguing about Trump's status as a candidate for the presidency. At the extent to which that impacts the timing of a possible case and now his lawyers insist that the case is unusual. It would only be fair to do it after the election. But prosecutors said, look, he's not president just because he's running for president doesn't mean he should be treated any differently than any other, quote, busy, important American. But notably, the judge, she didn't seem interested in getting into this issue of his candidacy. She was focused on how long it was going to take the lawyers to do the work necessary to get this closer to trial. And you can expect, that if the former president is charged in Washington in connection with January 6th, they will likely pursue a similar strategy trying to delay any possible trial at least into the 2024 election.

When, in fact, Joe Biden had won this state by 154,000 votes. Dana Nessel's investigation has been ongoing since January, and she is now charging those 16 individuals will be expected to turn themselves in. Now, this is all happening while investigations into fake electors' plots are ongoing in the six other states, where those fake electors plots happen, including Arizona, and Georgia. At the same time, the special counsel Jack Smith, he has been investigating the efforts to overturn the 2020 election with some of these fake electors of his testified to the grand jury. So there's potentially a lot more charges to come in other states, but, for now, the Michigan attorney general, Dana Nessel, being the first to charge these so-called fake electors with serious crimes that could amount to decades in prison if they are convicted.

Now, Ducey has told associates that Trump called him pressured him to find fraud in Arizona's vote, with Trump believed could help him overturn the national results.

We are learning more about the U.S. army private who crossed the line of demarcation between North and South Korea and is now being detained by the North. We now know his name, Travis King, and that he was said to be discharged from the military after being facing discipline for an assault in South Korea. CNN's Kristie Lu Stout is live in Hong Kong. Kristie, we have now heard a number of twists and turns in this story and there's still a lot we don't know. Bring us up to speed here. KRISTIE LU STOUT, CNN ANCHOR &amp; CORRESPONDENT:  Christine, we now know that the mother of the detained soldier is speaking out, in an interview with ABC News, Claudine Gains (ph) of Wisconsin said she was shocked that her son would cross into South Korea. It was on Tuesday when her son, Army Private Travis King broke away from a tour group and crossed into North Korea willfully and without authorization. The U.N. command says it is working with the North Korean military to resolve the incident and, earlier today, North Korea fired two more ballistic missiles. Now, King was not in uniform when he crossed into North Korea. He earlier spent some 50 days in a detention facility in South Korea for assault, involving at least one South Korean national and he was facing disciplinary action by the U.S. military. He was said to be separated from the U.S. army. A U.S. official told CNN that King was being escorted to the airport to go back to the U.S., but because the escorts could not go through customs, he was able to leave the airport. That is how later, on he crossed into North Korea, it was during a tour of the joint security area, or the JSA. This is the footage the JSA that you're looking at your screen right now. It's located inside the DMZ, the highly fortified border between the two Koreas and, the tour is open to the public. But, while there are checkpoints to get to the JSA, the actual border between North and South Korea is only those small raised behind that is on the ground. I believe we have this photo for you. You may remember this. A couple of years ago, the former U.S. president, Donald Trump, when he met with the North Korean leader at the JSA in June of 2019, he stepped across that very line. During a JSA tour, though, participants -- they are kept away from the line, some 20 yards away. Now, this incident comes at a time of high tension, you know what North Korea has fired about a dozen missiles earlier today. This morning, North Korea fired two short-range ballistic missiles and now, North Korea has a U.S. soldier in its custody, the mother of the soldier says she just wants her son to come home.

Judge Cannon knew that was a bridge too far. She knew she granted that, she would be reversed by the 11th Circuit, possibly even taken off his case.

Now, the lasttime Trump got a letter like this, he was indicted within three weeks by the feds. I expect the same timetable here. So that is going to be a big deal because this is going to be the first time that the former president will be indicted over his conduct while president. That's something our country has never had before. I think these charges, although not as strong as the case of the Mar- a-Lago documents, because in, there you have a direct tie between Trump in the criminality, alleged criminality. In this case, on January six, it's more attenuated, the more layers between him in the violence that day.
