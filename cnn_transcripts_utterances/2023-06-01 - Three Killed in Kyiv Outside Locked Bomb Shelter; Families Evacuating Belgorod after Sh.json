Ukraine's military said it shot down all 10 missiles fired at Kyiv, in the latest round of strikes. But falling debris killed three victims, including a 9 year old girl and her mother. I want to bring in CNN international correspondent Sam Kiley, who is in Eastern Ukraine for us. Tragically, Sam, tragically, the inability to enter a shelter caused the death of three people, including a little girl. How did this happen?",

People just ignore the sirens or very often ignore the sirens. But on this occasion, it would appear that a significant number of civilians gathered at the doors of this bomb shelter in Kyiv, banged on the doors, thought that there may be other points of entry, because they couldn't believe that it was not possible to get into a bomb shelter. And then tragically, a missile was destroyed in the sky above them. The descending debris killed three people and injured others. An extraordinary series of catastrophic moments of bad luck. Arguably perhaps nobody would've been hurt had that bomb shelter been open. Now it's part of an official investigation by Ukrainian authorities. These are bomb shelters that have been around and in fact were built during the Cold War as a defensive measure against a NATO attack. Ironically, of course, it is Russia that is attacking Ukraine at a time when Ukraine is discussing joining NATO as a consequence of the Russian invasion.",

One Donald, Trump after he leaves the presidency, is in a room with people without security clearance as people working on a book, an autobiography that his former chief of staff was writing, as well as communication aides of him, people who did not have the security clearances that would allow them access to secret and national security documents. He is talking to them about a secretive national security document, a plan from the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, so the head of the U.S. military, where that plan indicated that the Pentagon would be prepared to bomb Iran if the president so choose. And Trump is not only talking about this plan, he is referring to a document as if he is holding. On the audio recording, we are told that he is rustling a paper around, seemingly this paper that he is describing to these people or referring to. In addition to that, he appears, on this audio recording, to be acknowledging the limitations that he has, as the next president, that he doesn't have the ability to share this document more widely, that he did not declassify.

Roberts-Smith has always denied those and brought these defamation proceedings against the newspapers today. He has lost. This was not a criminal proceeding. This was a defamation trial. But it served as a proxy for a war crimes hearing. This was the first time the war crimes allegations had been tested by an Australian court and most egregious of those allegations were upheld. Both concluded that Ben Roberts-Smith killed an Afghan non-combatant with a prosthetic leg and that Ben Roberts-Smith kicked an elderly Afghan man off a cliff and then ordered Australian soldiers to shoot him. Some of those that served with him in Afghanistan testified against him in this case. Some of the Afghan civilians which came into contact with Australian soldiers, some 10 years ago, beamed in to Australia's federal court to tell their side of the story.
