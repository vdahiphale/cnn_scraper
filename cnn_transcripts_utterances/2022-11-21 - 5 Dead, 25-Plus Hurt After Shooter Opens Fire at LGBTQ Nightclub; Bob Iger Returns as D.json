And they said it was not busy. Maybe 30, maybe 50 people max in there. So, five dead, 25 injured at least amongst that.

Authorities are still not saying what they believed the motive is, but amongst the small LGBTQ community here in Colorado Springs, they have already made up their own minds, that this was an act of hate against their community. There was a candle lit vigil last night that was supposed to be an interfaith service for the transgender day of remembrance, and, of course, it became something else. It was an overflow crowd at a synagogue here remembering both trans people who have been killed and also the people who were killed in that club. And people were saying this is a reminder that our community is still under threat. Now, there are, of course, a lot of heroes here as well. Law enforcement was on the scene very quickly. This man was detained. So, the fire department was able to come in and treat people in the club very, very quickly because the gunman had been detained. And we hear from the mayor of Colorado Springs that two patrons of the club actually managed to subdue this gunman. He came in, as I said, with this long rifle, he also had a handgun. And, apparently, according to the mayor, these one or two patrons used the gunman's handgun to subdue him. And that could have saved a lot of lives. Guys?",

We're waiting to hear from him.This morning, two major pediatric groups are also calling for an emergency declaration. They say that is needed because of the rapid rise that we've seen in the respiratory illness known as RSV. In a letter, they write, quote, we need emergency funding support and flexibilities along the same lines of what was provided to respond to COVID surges. Joining us with more on this is CNN's Senior Medical Correspondent Elizabeth Cohen. Elizabeth, the question here, though, is, is it a slippery slope of declaring certain things an emergency or is this something that they do believe measures up and it needs the same kind of forceful response that we saw for the pandemic? ELIZABETH COHEN, CNN SENIOR MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT:  Kaitlan, the American Academy of Pediatrics and the Children's Hospital Association, they say this is for real, they are not crying wolf. They say they are overwhelmed. They say, you know what, think back to when COVID was overwhelming hospitals with adults. They're basically saying this is the pediatric version of that and that they really need help. Let's looks at one of the major reasons why hospitals are overrun. It's RSV, that respiratory virus that is just coming out in very high numbers very early in the season. It is to the point now that if you look so far this season, 6 out of every 1,000 U.S. infants have been hospitalized with RSV. That is a huge number. 6 out of 1,000 infants have ended up in the hospital with RSV. And I want to introduce you, Kaitlan to one of them. Her name is Ira Pokharel (ph), and she is in Baltimore, and she was doing well and then she got RSV symptoms, her parents rushed her to the hospital, she ended up being in the ICU. She was intubated. And they couldn't handle her there at the hospital that she was at in Baltimore. They had to ship her out. They couldn't find another hospital in Maryland. They had to make calls to state after state. Finally, they found one single bed at Children's National Medical Center in D.C. and they saved her life. But imagine if that one bed had not been found.
