It is the world's second busiest. Have a look at those scenes. It looks like an ocean. Emirate says passengers already in transit to the airport can continue but warns customers to expect delays. Dubai has recorded a year's worth of rain in just 12 hours enough to turn roads into rivers. Dubai's desert climate means the city's infrastructure just can't cope with so much rain falling so quickly. The heavy downpours for some drivers to abandon their vehicles and slowly wade through the floodwaters while some homes and businesses so water flood their ground floors.

So there's the cloud cover thunderstorm, another thunderstorm rolling on by. And now this weather is actually into parts of southern Iran and even into Pakistan. But here are the numbers as we go 99 millimeters in 12 hours, the annual average is less than that, which means for the entire year, they should have picked only up about 94 millimeters. And we got this in 12 hours so just a tremendous amount of rainfall for anywhere in the world. But certainly in places that don't see that much rainfall at any one time. In fact, after 24 hours, we were at 159 millimeters of rainfall before it finally stopped and now that weather has finally moved into parts of southern Iran and also even into parts of Pakistan. Some of that could be piling up quite deep.

Israel's war cabinet is set to meet again in the coming hours to try to decide how to respond to Iran's aerial assault last weekend without sparking a broader conflict. Sources tell CNN the U.S. is expecting a limited response by Israel's military, with U.S. intelligence suggesting a small scale attack inside Iran is most likely. But Israel is given no official word on its plans or when a strike could occur. The IDF though is again confirming its retaliation is only a matter of time. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

You can see the holes in the sides of this fuel tank. This missile was actually found in the Dead Sea. It was recovered and it was taken to this base in southern Israel. But now Israel says it must respond it must reestablish deterrence. They say this attack cannot go unanswered. The only question now is how the Israeli military will respond and when? And so when you see that video, you can really just get a sense of the size and the scale of these missiles and the destructive power that they could potentially deliver. I'm told that the warhead on top of that missile would typically weigh about a half a ton, a half a ton of explosives of destructive power. And so you can just think if these missiles had indeed made it through Israel's air defense systems, the kind of destruction that they could have caused.
