It comes nearly two days after the committee expected to release it all because of typographical errors and printing issues. But it is nearly 900 pages with a comprehensive narrative of what happened occurred before, during, immediately after January 6.Most importantly here it also lays out 11 specific recommendations from the committee about how various agencies and even Congress can move forward. And key among those recommendations is the committee is pointing to a section of the Constitution, the 14th Amendment, Section 3 that clearly states that anyone who is engaged in an insurrection can be disqualified from holding office. The committee says that constitutional provision should be enforced. And while they don't say it directly, the take away is that they believe that Donald Trump should be barred from holding office again, especially because he has now announced his plan to run in 2024. The committee separately is also pushing for passage of the Presidential Election Reform Act. That would make clear that vice presidents do not have the power to overturn elections, of course as Trump pressured Pence to do. And the committee is also recommending that federal intelligence and security agencies really take a much closer look at the dangers of violent extremism, especially since members of the Proud Boys and Oath Keepers were at the forefront of the Capitol attack. Plus, there's a host of new details in the 800 plus page report including about how John Eastman first contacted Donald Trump at the White House on December 23rd, 2020, almost exactly two years ago, to fill Trump in on his plan to get Pence to overturn the election. Of course, Pence refused to do that. And also, how a little known attorney named Kenneth Cheeseboro allegedly came up with that plot to appoint fake electors in battleground states to try to claim that Trump actually won in the states. And crucially here, that fake elector plot is exactly what is now being investigated by state prosecutors, including in Georgia. Also, federal prosecutors from the special counsel's office. And those prosecutor's from the special counsel's office, they have even served subpoenas to election officials in several battleground states as part of its ramped up investigation. So, the committee wrapping up its report but still potentially a long way to go on the criminal side. Jessica Schneider, CNN, Washington. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

We've heard from one U.S. official who has told CNN that an early U.S. government assessment is that this may well have been a slip of the tongue. But of course, officials will be watching quite carefully over the coming days, weeks to see whether president Putin uses it again, and whether perhaps this marks a shift in rhetoric from Putin or indeed the Kremlin when it comes to discussing the situation in Ukraine, the war in Ukraine. And whether that translates to any shifts on the situation on the ground. Of course, we did listen to Putin yesterday addressing reporters. He answered numerous conditions on the situation in Ukraine. And he reiterated what the Kremlin has said before which is that the Kremlin, that Russia remains open to the possibility of future negotiations, at least from Russia's perspective. Take a listen.
