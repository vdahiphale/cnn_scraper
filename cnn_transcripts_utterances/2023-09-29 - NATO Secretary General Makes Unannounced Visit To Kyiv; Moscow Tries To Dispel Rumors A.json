Rumors spread by Ukrainian intelligence and that Kadyrov has denied on social media.

Under this new law the only way a Prime Minister can be declared unfit to serve is for physical or mental reasons and it would need to pass both a super majority in the Israeli cabinet as well as the Israeli Parliament. Now, Benjamin Netanyahu faces an ongoing corruption trial, charges of which he denies. But there were some concerns from his allies that the attorney general was going to declare Netanyahu unfit for office and potentially try to remove him from office because of the situation in his ongoing corruption trial. But as this law has now passed, you can only declare a prime minister unfit for office for physical or mental reasons. And with these very high hurdles of votes that need to be passed. Now the petitioners who brought this case to the supreme court, they argue that this law was passed in a misuse of constituent authority. That this law was passed solely to benefit Benjamin Netanyahu. And what was interesting is that the lawyers representing the Israeli government and the Israeli parliament essentially admitted to as much. They said, sure this law will benefit Benjamin Netanyahu, but that they're arguing that the supreme court cannot and should not strike it down, because if they do, they are arguing that this is the supreme court essentially taking electoral decisions into their own hands and casting aside the millions of people who voted for Benjamin Netanyahu. Now, those arguing against this law, including the attorney general, lawyers for the attorney general, said that a law cannot be used as a kind of private resource, arguing that it cannot be used to remove personal problems from the field of morality and criminal law. And they're arguing that at minimum, if the supreme court will not annul this law, that they will at least delay its implementation until the next session of the Israeli parliament. We are expecting a decision on this specific case could come as soon as the coming weeks. Hadas Gold, CNN -- Jerusalem. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Researchers dive from coral reef to coral reef and say what they have found is even more dire than they expected. \"We've seen a bleaching of corals, which is something that is worrying and that is massive\", she says. \"The majority of coral is bleached, and this is because of the high temperatures.\" The scientists say it's not too late to reverse the damage, but that we have to dramatically reduce human-caused pollutions that's heating oceans to record levels, killing off coral reefs and filling the seas with microplastics. With this study, the scientists say they will be able to measure much more accurately how much harm has been inflicted on Cuba's unique natural environments. \"We are going to have a baseline,\" she says. \"We hope to identify the spots along the coast where the pollution is and how concentrated it is.\" For two months, the scientists carried out dozens of dives, taking hundreds of samples from the bottom of the ocean. Scientists are barely out of their wetsuits before running tests in their ocean (ph) laboratory. They hope what they learn can change how resources on this island are used.
