My concern is how there's such a discrepancy in how former President Trump was treated, by raiding Mar-a-Lago, by getting the security cameras, by taking pictures of documents on the floor, by going through Melania's closet. Versus Joe Biden, they're like, OK, your personal loggers who don't have security clearance, they can go through, they can just keep looking and keep looking and, you know, determine whatever is there.

That is a very different posture than what we saw with Donald Trump where he was fighting for a period of more than eight months to not turn over hundreds of missing documents that the Archives was asking about. When my friend Mr. Comer says we're looking for equal treatment, that's all we're looking for.

CNN's Natasha Chen has more on the epic flooding that hit California amid an historic drought.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) NATASHA CHEN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: We're at Johnson's Beach at the Russian River here in Guerneville, California where residents tell me this is supposed to be a driveway right here. But it's so flooded and you can see that sign where it says no life guard on duty. Local residents tell me there's supposed to be a walkway after that for another 20 feet as well as an entire parking lot before you even reach the beach. So, many of them have come to the water's edge taking photos as one woman told me, she has lived here 30 years and just extremely intrigued to see the water come up this far. Of course, there is more rain expected into Monday morning. And because there has been storm after storm in California over the last few weeks, the ground and rivers are so saturated it's not going to take much for more flooding and more threats of mud slides. Mud slides like the one we saw in Belmont, California, on Saturday. Belmont police showed these photos on social media of part of a hillside coming down into a neighborhood. So those are the types of dangers that city and county officials are really warning people about. In fact, there's not just more rain coming but high winds as well. San Luis Obispo and Santa Barbara, there are high wind advisories there. Thousands of people -- as thousands of customers in California still without power and millions under a flood watch.

We saw those harsh lockdowns, those quarantine measures, the mass testing on a scale we hadn't seen anywhere else in the world.Well, that all came toon abrupt halt in December after the Chinese government basically did a back flip. That followed weeks of protests and obviously the strain to the Chinese economy. But what was rather startling to the international community, Max, was this claim that only 37 people had died as a result of COVID. They were maintaining that claim that that was the death toll over the past month up until the weekend. And then there was a meeting between the Chinese health minister and the World Health Organization and there was a drastic revision where Chinese National Health Commission came out and said actually the number is more like 60,000 COVID deaths over the last month. They said they were now adding in the COVID deaths with underlying illnesses and they also said, quote, the delay was due to a comprehensive exam examination of hospital reporting. Now, Max, International analysts, experts, medical experts, they're not necessarily buying that 60,000. They think the number is much, much higher. And you know, add Chinese New Year to it, you know, it further complicates the situation. This is going to be the largest, you know, migration of humans in the world. And because people have been separated for so long, you will see people traveling across the country. They will be moving from the cities to provinces, to rural areas to the villages where there's a large elderly population and poor public health infrastructure. The concern is there's going to be a spike in cases and obviously, a spike in deaths -- Max.",
