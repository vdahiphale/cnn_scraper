      "sentences": "Hello, and welcome, everyone. I'm Michael Holmes, and we continue our breaking news coverage of Israel at war. And there are growing signs this hour that an Israeli military ground operation into Gaza could get underway at any moment.After a week of airstrikes and artillery aimed at Hamas inside Gaza, and a hastily ordered evacuation of up to a million civilians from Gaza City, Israel declared on Saturday that it is ready to open a new phase in the war with a focus on, quote, \"significant ground operations.\" Earlier, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met soldiers on the frontlines, you see him there, offering words of support, telling them to be prepared. Also on Saturday, Iran warned far-reaching consequences if the Israeli attacks don't stop. The Iranian foreign minister met with a senior Hamas official for the first time since the fighting began, and there is deep concern that Iran and its proxies might try to escalate the conflict, especially along Israel's northern border. As a deterrent of sorts, the U.S. is sending a second carrier strike group to the Eastern Mediterranean as well as additional fighter jets. Military experts say it is extremely rare for the U.S. to post two carrier groups at the same place. But they say, it underscores the seriousness the Biden Administration places on this crisis. Elliott Gotkine is covering all of this for us from London. The signs continue to point to a ground incursion by Israel. Bring us up to date on the latest.",

      "sentences": "Michael, I think ever since Hamas launched this devastating and brutal terrorist attack on Israel, killing more than 1,300 people a week and a day ago, it's been a question of when rather than if Israel will launch a ground invasion.It does now seem that this ground invasion is imminent. Israel saying that it is preparing foray, in its words, \"significant military operation.\" We don't know specifically when that is likely to happen, but it does now seem imminent. But of course, it's always fraught with danger when Israel has gone in the past. And it did carry out a couple of reconnaissance raids, if you like, into the Gaza Strip before the weekend. But it's always fraught with danger at the best of times. This time, of course, very much complicated by the presence of more than a hundred hostages that Hamas took when it launched that attack just over a week ago. But Israel, it seems, undoubtedly will go in, and it will go in hard. Hamas is not only expecting them, but will perhaps even be welcoming them because it will give Hamas a greater -- more opportunity to kill Israeli soldiers and also to potentially abduct them. And let's not forget that Hamas has a kind of warren of tunnels underneath the surface of the Gaza Strip, which it will use, no doubt, for both offensive and defensive capabilities. At the same time, there is concern about growing violence in the Israeli-occupied West Bank. And of course, on that Northern Front, as you were mentioning in your introduction, that we've already seen exchanges of fire with Hezbollah, backed by Iran, launching rockets into Israel, Israel retaliating. We've also seen some fire from Syria and also reports that Israel has also carried out strikes on Syria as well, such as Aleppo airport concern there that Syria may be used as a conduit for additional weapons to its proxy in southern Lebanon, Hezbollah. So a lot of concerns, a lot of potential for escalation, but Israel saying certainly as a warning to Hezbollah that if it does get involved for real, that, in its words, it will bring the destruction of Lebanon. And of course, this is one reason, as you said, why we're seeing this second U.S. aircraft carrier being deployed to the Eastern Mediterranean to, it is hoped, deter any such escalation at least in the north.

In any case, if they stay, we will, of course, take the available precautionary measures in order to minimize collateral damage and minimize the killing of civilians. But again, we must remember, we are going to fight.

And we are prepared for that. Fighting will be slow, advances will be slow, and we will be cautious. But we are very determined to get to the Hamas terrorists that currently are hiding underneath -- hiding underneath their civilians in the tunnel system that they have.

Thousands of Palestinians have fled to Southern Gaza since Israel issued that evacuation order early on Friday. But of course, as we were just discussing there, not everyone can leave. Many say there's nowhere to go. They fear they won't be able to return. Perhaps they don't have transport. Some hospitals in Gaza are refusing to evacuate, saying it's simply too dangerous to move ill patients. In the south, though, thousands of people have been stranded at the Rafah Crossing into Egypt. The Egyptian Foreign Minister says the crossing with Gaza is open, but he says Israeli airstrikes on the Gaza side have made the roads there inoperable. Meanwhile, aid trucks have begun arriving in Egypt but can't yet enter Gaza for that reason. One young Palestinian pleading for the fighting to stop.

An ambulance with a young girl and wounded woman inside rocked by explosions as they attempt to flee. It is unclear what happened to the pair, but they're among the tens of thousands of people on the move after Israel's military called on nearly half of Gaza's population, some 1.1 million people, to get south in a matter of hours, but along the safe passages specified by the IDF, utter horror. You're looking at the carnage and chaos on Salah-al-Din (ph) Street, one of the designated evacuation routes. In the aftermath of explosions, families killed amid their belongings. CNN has geo located this video and four other clips from the horrifying scene. The U.N. calls Israel's evacuation advisory impossible and a violation of the rules of war. And Palestinian officials accused the IDF of bombing civilians even as they fled. Dozens of evacuees were killed or wounded by Israeli airstrikes, according to Hamas. CNN has reached out to the Israeli Military for comment. The victims are flooding into Gaza's overwhelmed hospitals. And again, it's the youngest caught in the crossfire. Nearly half of Gaza's population is children. \"What did the children do to deserve this?\" this woman says, \"Did they fight you? Did they fire rockets? My niece and her whole family are dead. The only survivor is a two-year-old girl.\" The healthcare system is on the brink of complete siege making it impossible to get aid into the enclave. And already, there's a shortage of everything, even space in the morgue. \"We're keeping the dead in ice cream trucks so the bodies don't rot,\" this doctor says. \"Gaza is in crisis. Gaza needs help.\" For those still able to move south, this is one of the neighborhoods families are expected to flee towards, Hanunes (ph), where Israeli airstrikes have wreaked havoc. \"This is a genocide. Not a war. It's genocide,\" this man says, \"and it's an attempt to force all Palestinians out of the Gaza Strip.\" Finding refuge is proving dangerous and deadly. And for the many families desperate for shelter, the fear is there may be no safe places left. Salma Abdelaziz, CNN, London. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

The Israeli military said 30 mortar rounds were fired from Lebanon into Israel, while Hezbollah put out a statement, claiming its fighters had used precision weapons to target five Israeli positions, including an Israeli surveillance post. Late Saturday, the group's media wing put out video showing precise hits on communications and surveillance equipment at those positions. The official Lebanese News Agency reported that an elderly couple was killed when an Israeli round struck their house in the Lebanese town of Shebaa. Hezbollah said one of its fighters was killed in confrontations with Israeli forces. Earlier in the day, residents of the southern Lebanese town of El Hayyam (ph) came out to mourn the killing of Reuters cameraman Issam Abdallah, well known in the Middle East press corps for his work in conflict zones around the region. Friday afternoon, Abdallah was filming an exchange of fire between Israel and Hezbollah. When their position was struck with rockets fired, witnesses told CNN, from the Israeli side of the border, six other journalists were injured. All were wearing protective gear with press markings. And Israeli spokesman described Abdallah's death as tragic but didn't concede it was caused by an Israeli strike. Now, also Saturday evening, the Head of Israel's National Security Council in a televised briefing with journalists said Israel hopes to avoid a two-front war involving Lebanon. He said the current level of clashes between Israel and Hezbollah is, in his words, below the escalation threshold. He also said we hope Hezbollah won't bring about the destruction of Lebanon. Now, in the past, Israeli leaders have warned, among other things, that if Hezbollah goes to war with Israel again, Israel will send Lebanon back to the Stone Age.
