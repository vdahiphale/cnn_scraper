So, why don't we just take a look over the last three campaign cycle. So, these are poll bumps after the first debate, the change in margin. Joe Biden gained four points after the first debate in 2020. Hillary Clinton gain five points, which, of course, is something that we've spoken about, that Donald Trump, the last two times, that Donald Trump went out and debate in the first debate, voters reacted negatively. Mitt Romney gained for debates out of that first debate in 2012, turned what was a clear Obama lead into a very tight race down the stretch. And, of course, what's important to keep in mind here is, Biden's down by just a point, well within the margin of error. If we look at these bumps, historically speaking, if Biden has a good evening tonight, it could change this race completely. One in which Donald Trump has perhaps a slight edge to one in which Joe Biden might have a slight edge and all of a sudden a campaign that lot of people, not have written off, but certainly one in which there's been a lot of doubts about that Joe Biden campaign.

If he can come out tonight, be energetic, like we're being right now, he could perhaps change this perception of him as someone who is just seen as plain too old to be effective as president. So, that's what Joe Biden's looking for. What is Donald Trump looking for? Well, voters don't think Donald Trump's too old, even though he's only slightly younger than Joe Biden. But what this consistent complaint about Donald Trump is, is he doesn't have the right temperament to be president. We see that in this poll as well, 54 percent of likely voters say that Donald Trump does not have the right temperament to be president. That's why it's going to be so interesting to see, how does Donald - what does Donald Trump do tonight? Is he going to be what he did last time around against Joe Biden in that first debate and Hillary Clinton, you know, trying to interrupt constantly. We'll see how the muted mics might work in that situation, or does he try and throw a curve ball - throw a curve ball at Joe Biden, actually calm, dare I say be presidential, not exactly an adjective often used to describe Donald Trump's behavior, but that could perhaps work in his favorite because both of them tonight have weaknesses, which a strong debate performance may, in fact, be able to ameliorate.",

He did not abide by the rules that his campaign had abided by.But you have an advantage tonight that we did not have, which is the decision about muting the mics. And I think that does make a big change in ways we may not really understand until we see the debate because it's flummoxing. It's flummoxing to cut off somebody who won't stop talking. Several moderators have struggled with that, with Trump. And I got to admit, I struggled with that with Pence.",

He did add, he will support the Republican ticket in November.This morning, a short-lived attempted coup in Bolivia is over. Dramatic moments show the Bolivian president confronting his former army chief, who apparently tried to overthrow him. The ex-army chief is now in custody and insisting that the president had ordered him to carry out a military operation to boost his popularity. Bolivian officials say that is untrue. Police in the Bahamas say they have now found the cell phone belonging to a Chicago woman who has been missing for more than a week. Forty- one-year-old Taylor Casey was last seen on June 19th. She was on a yoga retreat. Authorities say her phone was found in the water. They have not said if they suspect foul play. All right, happening now, two pandas are on their way to the San Diego Zoo from China.
