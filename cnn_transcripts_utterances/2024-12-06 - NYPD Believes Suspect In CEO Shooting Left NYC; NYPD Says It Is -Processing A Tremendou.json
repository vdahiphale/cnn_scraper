And the reason they even got all the way up here, to give you perspective, we are miles north of where the shooting actually unfolded. And essentially what they did was they traced this person using extensive video canvassing from the scene of the shooting, which is in midtown Manhattan, trace him on an E bike going towards Central Park, then exiting the park, which at that point was a little over 20 blocks north of the shooting.Then from the bike, about 10 blocks north of that, he drops the bike, gets into a taxi cab and then takes that taxi all the way to the bus terminal where I am here. Again, that is a miles long trip and over five miles from where the shooting actually took place. And take a listen to what we've heard as far as the priorities for not just the chief of detectives but also the New York Police Commissioner on what they're looking at now. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Once you identify the face, you're going to look at databases of things like driver's licenses to see if you can identify the individual.

And as Omar pointed out, it could have evidence, or as the NYPD is also concerned, it could have a gun in it, it could have the murder weapon, which he may have dumped, so that if he was stopped, he wouldn't have it on him. So the backpack is considered critical to find if they can.And one of the things they're probably about to do is to come up with a picture of what that backpack looks like. A close up of the version, you know, that you would find in a store and say, this is the one we're looking for. It looks just like this. And did somebody pick it up?

Part of the reason they feel better about him than they did Matt Gaetz, who ultimately withdrew and Donald Trump called him up to tell him he didn't have the numbers, is that they argue that no one has told them, no senators have called up Trump's team or Hegseth's team and said we are a hard no yet. It's not saying that they're definitely a yes, but they haven't said they're hard no or that was the case with Matt Gaetz. The other thing that I think is just very important to keep in mind though is that a lot of people I've been talking to in Trump world and at Mar-a-Lago are saying that Donald Trump cannot give in to this pressure right now because he already lost Matt Gaetz. They think that this would be a huge sign of weakness and kind of give lawmakers more power over Donald Trump than they're willing to do right now. This is what one person, I'm just going to quickly read it for you, told me about this.",
