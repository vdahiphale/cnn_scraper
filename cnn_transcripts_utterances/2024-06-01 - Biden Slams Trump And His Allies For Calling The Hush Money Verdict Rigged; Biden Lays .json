It has -- the notion that it's fundamentally rigged has led to death threats, over 89 death threats against the local prosecutor. It's a very serious situation.

Well, Boeing Starliner spacecraft is designed to take NASA astronauts to and from the International Space Station.Now, you may be thinking, Wait a minute, aren't there already spacecrafts that already do that? And the answer is yes, but NASA wants more because NASA likes backups, contingencies, and redundancy. So right now, the only options are a Russian Soyuz spacecraft to take NASA astronauts to the space station. You know how tenuous the U.S. relations with Russia have been lately. And then the other option has been SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket and Crew Dragon capsule, this the Boeing Starliner spacecraft is going to add to that fleet of options. And this is something that NASA, a moment that NASA has been working towards, for 10 years since 2014 when NASA first doled out these two dueling contracts to Boeing and SpaceX as part of its commercial crew program. Back then everybody thought Boeing would be first to fly a crew. But that did not turn out to be the case. SpaceX has now flown 13 crews to outer space. And so, today is Boeing's chance to finally put its first crew up in orbit and that crew is the commander Butch Wilmore, and the pilot, Suni Williams. And these two were sitting on top of that rocket about an hour ago, just two hours away from liftoff when engineers spotted a faulty valve on the Atlas 5 rocket that is supposed to propel that Boeing Starliner spacecraft up into space. And so, those astronauts had to get down, go back into quarantine and they have been sitting in quarantine for about a month now. They have been able to go back to the Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas spend some time with their family. But it's been a long time that they've been waiting for this moment today. And so we've got liftoff scheduled for 12:25 p.m. Eastern Time from Cape Canaveral Space Force station. If all goes according to plan, the Boeing Starliner spacecraft will separate from the ULA's Atlas 5 rocket a few minutes after liftoff. Then Butch and Suni will go on a 24-hour trip to the International Space Station. Stay there for eight days, and then come back to earth so fingers crossed guys. Weather's looking good. So far, no technical or engineering issues, but we wait and see because we're still a few hours away from that countdown starting.",

And it's this inflation data that the Federal Reserve watches especially closely in the report show that in April, the PCE price index rose 2.7 percent from a year ago and rose 0.3 percent on a monthly basis.Now food prices, well, they did fall, but gas prices ticked up for the month by more than 1 percent. But if you strip away both of those categories, food and energy, you get what's called core inflation. And this is seen as a better indicator of underlying inflation and annual core PCE rose 2.8 percent, which is what Wall Street expected. So you put it all together. And what you have is inflation data that appears to be moving sideways, not exactly accelerating, not falling either. We also saw in the data consumer spending took a dip rising 0.2 percent compared to 0.7 percent. We saw that in March. Now, Friday's report is yet another reminder of what appears to be a bumpy road ahead for the Fed. It also casts some doubt on how soon the central bank will be able to cut rates. Now the Fed hasn't raised rates since July of 2023. But they have kept rates at this this high level, in fact, their highest in two decades since that meeting. So there is now a growing appetite for rate cuts. The feds next rate setting meeting is set to take place in less than two weeks. But before that, we will get the May jobs report next Friday.

      "sentences": "Victor, Amara, families met with the Justice Department for a full day, Friday, pricing for more accountability from Boeing. The timing here is really significant. Just two weeks ago, the Justice Department made a huge change going back on a years old deal it made with the company.The Justice Department now says that Boeing did violate that deal to avoid a fraud charge after the 737 Max   eight crashes of 2018 and 2019. And that Boeing is no longer protected by a two-and-a-half billion-dollar settlement. It is a deal that victims' families have never liked. They have been fighting for years for Boeing to face more punishment from the federal government, something that could now happen or the Justice Department could simply reach a new settlement. After Friday's meeting, victims, families and their attorneys say the Justice Department did a good job of listening to them. But for now, that is it, listening without much action. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ROBERT CLIFFORD, LAWYER FOR BOEING 737 MAX VICTIM FAMILIES: Prosecutors in true fashion were a bit tight-lipped about their intentions, but they represent to us in good faith that their investigation and analysis continues, and we'll take them at their word. But make no doubt about it, what the families want, Boeing engaged in criminal conduct that should be properly prosecuted and penalized. That's the position of the families from around the world.

And so, that's what we're looking for. We want to build the grassroots presence in every state, we also want to be there for drag artists when they come under attack.
