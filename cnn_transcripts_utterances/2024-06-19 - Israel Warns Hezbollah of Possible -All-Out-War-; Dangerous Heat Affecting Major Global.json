Also happening over the next two hours, Israel warns of all-out war with Lebanon after Hezbollah releases an alarming video and later, the sounds of celebration after a thrilling encounter at the Euros between Turkey and Georgia. Well, top Israeli official is warning that Hezbollah would be quote, destroyed if all-out war breaks out along Israel's northern border with Lebanon. Foreign Minister Israel Katz's posts on the X platform coming after Hezbollah released a video purportedly shot from a drone flying over several Israeli cities including Haifa. The nine minute video showed Israeli military and civilian locations, its appearance follows months of cross border attacks and targeted killings of several Hezbollah commanders by Israeli forces. Ben Wedeman connecting has set this out from Beirut. Let's start with that video. What's the point? What's the message here?",

      "sentences": "Well, I think the message here, Becky, is very much that Hezbollah is capable of penetratingIsraeli airspace getting beyond its border defenses, which Hezbollah has actually targeted on a regular basis since last October, flying over highly sensitive sites in and around Haifa, collecting that information, flying a drone back and publishing it. It's a real sort of finger in the eye of the Israelis, underscoring just what Hezbollah is capable of doing. Also, let's keep in mind this is the video they're showing us. Hezbollah is making public, we don't know what else they've managed to collect as well. It really underscores sort of the shifting balance of power between Israel and Hezbollah in particular, but across this conflict in general. I mean, keep in mind, for instance, back during the 2006 war between Israel and Hezbollah, within hours, the Israelis were able to essentially knock out Beirut International Airport. But Hezbollah could not do the same to Israel, it couldn't hit as far south as Haifa but not much beyond that. That's changed by all accounts according to almost every analyst you speak to Hezbollah now has the capability also to knock out Tel Aviv, Ben Gurion International Airport and reach targets beyond. So there's kind of now a balance of terror, so to speak, mutually assured destruction, if you will, perhaps not have the nuclear type. But both sides are now able to inflict considerable pain on the other. And I think this video nine minutes really underscores that Hezbollah since 2006, has made a huge leap in its capabilities, Becky.",

CNN Analyst BarakRavid is reporting on Axios that the White House has canceled a high level meeting with the Netanyahu government now. This is the latest source of tension between the Prime Minister and the Biden administration and is as a result of this video that we first told you about yesterday on this show. In it, Mr. Netanyahu claimed that the U.S. is withholding military aid. The Axios report says President Biden's envoy in Israel told the Prime Minister his comments were quote, inaccurate and out of line. And we're going to have a lot more on this story and how it could impact Mr. Netanyahu's scheduled trip to Washington next month. We'll do that next hour for you. Meantime, Russian President Vladimir Putin says ties with North Korea will reach a new level. Mr. Putin and the North Korean Leader Kim Jong-Un signed a new strategic partnership deal in Pyongyang today. He said the treaty includes a mutual defense provision in case one of the countries is attacked. Mr. Putin is expected to leave shortly for Vietnam.

But really, Becky the headline here, we are all wondering, did Vladimir Putin and Kim Jong-Un just create a new authoritarian version of NATO's Article Five, which of course, provides the response that if one NATO country is attacked, the rest of NATO would respond in the country under attacks defense. So what we have here, we have a statement by Vladimir Putin. At the end of this meeting, which was very bizarre for most of the day, we have an iconic indelible image of both of these authoritarian leaders in an open air limo, a profusion of balloons scattered throughout Kim Il Sung Square in Central Pyongyang. We're thinking OK, maybe small ball economic tourism provisions will be agreed to, the Kremlin was very careful with its language yesterday sort of qualifying what would be agreed to and then Vladimir Putin comes out. And he says, quote, this agreement includes the provision of mutual assistance in the event of aggression. So we're now we're wondering, well, what kind of assistance does that mean, military assistance? Is there sort of a qualifying statement? Is there a conditional statement in the mix there, but again, we don't have the written text. And we are all wondering, Becky, we were talking earlier in the week about that 1961 Treaty between Khrushchev and Kim Il Sung where the language was very strong, saying that the USSR back in the 60s shall immediately come to the military defense of North Korea, if it were attacked, and vice versa. We don't know if that is the case. But Kim for his part is calling this an alliance that is certainly new. Listen to what he said.

Well, in the U.S., millions of people are struggling with weather related dangers ofdifferent kinds, including extreme heat and wildfires. Fire crews are making some headway in battling the wildfires in California, a major fire burning north of Los Angeles is now just over 30 percent contained. But large parts of New Mexico are in a state of emergency with one fast moving wildfire there completely uncontained. Officials say one person has died as thousands flee the fires. CNN's, Ed Lavandera joining us from a village in New Mexico, where two fires have converged. This, of course has been an area of the U.S. which has had extreme drought for nearly a year. These fires already explosive and it's early on in the summer. How are people coping? And what does this mean for available resources in battling these fires, Ed? ED LAVANDERA, CNN SENIOR U.S. NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, this is a massive fire that has erupted very quickly and spread very quickly. It's become very difficult to containers started Monday morning here in the City of Ruidoso, New Mexico, beautiful little mountain community here in New Mexico, and more than 8000 people have evacuated in less than 48 hours from this area. These are some of the roadblocks that are in the area. And you can just see the thickness of the smoke at the scene here as this is a road that takes you out to the northern edge of town where so many people were scrambling to evacuate. And the city is a ghost town. You know, just there are so many people who've evacuated, the visibility is very difficult. The majority of what we see on the roads here are first responders, police and firefighters here and kind of navigating the area. And many of these people have scattered, the residents here have evacuated to some distance away about an hour or so drive. And you know, many of them just anxiously waiting to see if their homes have survived these wildfires. As you mentioned, it's essentially two wildfires consuming about 20,000 acres of mountainous of forest land here. And the Ruidoso, New Mexico area, 1400 structures that have been consumed by all of this, we spoke with one resident Michael Scott, who evacuated here Monday night, and he talked about what he saw with us on the way out of here.

So it remains a very volatile situation, when we were here yesterday afternoon. The winds were ripping around and changing directions very quickly.

CNN's Natasha Bertrand is following the story from Washington. And you've got some new reporting on this. So when we say most European countries, there are some who aren't as enthusiastic by any stretch of the imagination about Ukraine, joining NATO as others, but ultimately, what is holding the U.S. and some of its allies back in pushing for NATO membership for Ukraine at this point, what's the holdup here?",

And they're going to produce a joint communique that is going to basically lay out Ukraine's path to NATO membership. Some NATO countries are pushing for, as you said, stronger language saying that Ukraine should have a quote, irreversible path to NATO membership, because that would send a very strong signal to Vladimir Putin that Ukraine is going to be in the alliance, really no matter what, and now that they've started down that path of applying for NATO membership that cannot be put on the table. For example, in any kind of peace negotiations, or any kind of negotiations that goes on to end the war. Of course, Vladimir Putin is deeply opposed to Ukraine, joining NATO. But on the other hand, you have the U.S. and the U.N. and the Germans, who are a little bit wary of that irreversible language. They want to instead to say that Ukraine has a bridge to NATO membership in terms of its application, in terms of the 10 year security pact that the U.S. has negotiated with the Ukrainians because they say Ukraine still has not fulfilled a lot of the commitments that it needs to fulfill for NATO membership, including some of those really important democratic and anti- corruption reforms that the U.S. is still working with Ukrainians on actually completing.",

And that is after it took the crown from Microsoft by the time Nvidia shares closed Tuesday with a more than 3 percent gain. The computer chip manufacturer's market capitalization hit roughly $3.34 trillion Nvidia's chips are essential in producing processes. The power artificial intelligence systems and other chipmaker posted a blockbuster first quarter noting a 262 percent increase in revenue and a 462 percent increase in profits year over year. Well CNN's Matt Egan is in New York for us, still with us. So I assume that means you didn't buy stock in Nvidia some time ago when it was just a real company back in the mid- 1990s. What is Nvidia's new title as most valuable company in the world mean, do you think for the future of AI and AI focused companies?

Because it's computer chips, power ChatGPT and other AI models. It's essentially making the picks and the shovels in this gold rush. It's had a meteoric rise, the share prices up something like 300 times over the last 10 years alone. It's absolutely fascinating. This rise really happened when they decided to make this bet on instead of just powering those graphics for video games, they made a pivot to try to power artificial intelligence. I mean, look at that share price going straight up that to do that 10 for one stock split. And as you mentioned, they've now surpassed Microsoft and Apple is the most valuable company on the planet, pretty amazing, considering a lot of people have never heard of NVIDIA. It's actually worth roughly twice as much the next closest foreign competitor, and that's oil giant Saudi Aramco, which is around $1.7 trillion. And when you look at NVIDIA, and how it stacks up, globally, we're talking about a company that is now worth more than several major economies, including the GDP of France and Russia, Canada, Brazil, one company worth more than those entire economies. It's amazing when you think about it, as far as what this means for other companies. Listen, I think the door is wide open to other companies that are in artificial intelligence. Investors are so hungry right now, to get a piece of this AI boom. Remember, NVIDIA doesn't even make AI. It's just doing the infrastructure that enables AI. I do think they'll Becky, that all this does raise some questions about whether or not NVIDIA is almost getting too big at this point, right?
