We're going to tell you what it all means for this investigation.Also breaking, the jury in the trial of a man who killed a fellow New York subway rider with a chokehold deadlocks, leading the judge to drop the top charge in the case. We'll have details on the deliberations and the lesser charge Daniel Penney still faces. Also tonight, a CNN exclusive, our interview with the leader of the Syrian rebel group behind the surprise offensive that's reignited the country's civil war and has imperiled the regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Welcome to our viewers here in the United States and around the world. I'm Wolf Blitzer. You're in The Situation Room. First up tonight in The Situation Room, the hunt for the CEO killer expands more than 48 hours after the brazen shooting. Investigators now have reason to believe the suspect in the case has left New York City. Let's get more from our Senior Crime and Justice Correspondent Shimon Prokupecz. Shimon, why do authorities now think he may have left town?",
