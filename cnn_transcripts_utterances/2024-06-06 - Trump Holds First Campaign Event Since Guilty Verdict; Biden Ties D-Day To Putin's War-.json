Now, Bannon is not out of options, although this tight time frame is definitely working against him, he could go to the U.S. Court of Appeals. He could go to the Supreme Court. He could ask for some emergency intervention. But just to give you an idea of where they were in regrouping when I was talking to one of his attorneys after court, they were saying we still don't know what our next step is going to be in this. We don't know if or when go to the appeals court. We don't know if were going to go straight to the U.S. Supreme Court to seek some kind of emergency relief. And again, they have just weeks for another court to intervene in this matter in order to keep Steve Bannon out of prison for what was something a jury handed down in 2022, finding him guilty of defying subpoenas from the January 6 Committee for both testimony, as well as for documents -- Brianna.",

One is the economy. Two is immigration, and three is they don't think he's up to a second term. So you can fire up your base with the early stuff but he talked about today.

When Trump talks about all this, all his own grudges, his own grievances, his own vendettas, his own vengeance, it riles up people he's already got, but it alienates the people he needs.I think Scott's exactly right. He's -- Trump is running as a president with a low approval rating and a high cost limit. And yet, Biden is now inching ahead of Trump. It's a dead heat race, but because perhaps the trial in New York, Biden's inching ahead. So this tension -- I'm betting that Trump cannot keep a focus off of himself. I may be unfair because I don't much like the guy, but he seems somewhat self-absorbed to me. And Biden's message needs to be and he's been on this time, was not on it in that clip you showed us, but needs to be -- he -- Trump's in it for himself. I'm in it for you. That's very different than saying he's a crooked, he's a crooked, which he is. But instead he -- Biden needs to say and the Democrats all need to say, I'm in this for you, for your health care, your childcare, your right to choose. I'm in it for you. He's in it for himself.

He worked its way through the court and now he's going to jail.I mean, he should not be surprised by the outcome here because the defense he put up for divine this opinion was invalid. So my advice to anybody going to work here for Trump, either on the campaign or in the White House, or for Biden on the campaign or in the White House, is that you and you alone are responsible for your own actions.

There's been reporting that he met with all the big oil executives, asked him for a billion dollars and told them in exchange for that, he waived all of our environmental laws for them. Now, that's something that affects you and me, you know?So, I'm not very interested in Mr. Trump's personal problems. I'm interested in the lives and families of the American people. I would say to Steve Bannon when he said they're not going to shut me up. That is music to my ears. I don't want to shut up, Steve Bannon. I don't want to shut up Donald Trump. They're the best asset that Democrats have because the more they talk about this many conspiracy stuff, which raises them money, riles up their base, it alienates those voters who voted for Nikki Haley, who 20 percent of Republicans consistently are protest votes against Trump, and they will not come home with all that nutty conspiracy stuff.

Do you think though that the U.S. might eventually need to allow Ukraine to expand the use of those weapons? LT. GEN. MARK HERTLING (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST: It's possible, Briana, but what the president was talking about today was what we in the military would call either tactical or operational deep strikes. What those are, are methods to interfere with any potential effects of the opponent on the battlefield, to hit them before they are able to use the kind of equipment it would have effect on the tactical fight. As Russia has executed this war, they have moved their equipment further and further back from the front lines. And they have been unmolested. I think the president is right in giving the potential use of these kinds of weapons to hit these operational targets within the perimeter of the Russian attacks on the frontline of Ukraine.",

But he has been saying this for the past two plus years. So I think the Biden administration realized that it's a bluff and it's a bluster and he won't do that because he knows what might happen if he does. So I think it is continuing bluster and it's -- the very fact that he has now become increasingly a war criminal based on the kinds of tactics that he's using and going after Ukrainian infrastructure and Ukrainian civilians.

Now, under cross-examination, she acknowledged that she didn't actually see him using crack cocaine that day or that night. She only believes she did -- he did because of his behaviors. So that is something I think the defense and certainly has going in their favor. What we did see from the prosecution, we saw video of Hallie Biden on October 23rd, 11 days after he bought the gun. She had found it in his car. She said she found what she thought was residue and she was worried about him. She said, I was -- I didn't want him to harm himself and I didn't want my kids to find it and to harm themselves. And so, she says, you can see in the video, she shows up at a parking at a supermarket and throws it in a trash can and then hours later shows up panicking as she's trying to find it and doesn't encounter it.
