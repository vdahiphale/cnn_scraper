      "sentences": "Hello, everyone. I'm Fredricka Whitfield. Thank you so much for joining us.New today, Iraq is now summoning a top U.S. diplomatic official in protest of a barrage of punishing U.S. air strikes in the Middle East. The U.S. says those strikes hit 85 targets linked to Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps Quds force and affiliated militia groups in Iraq and Syria. The strikes a response to a drone attack in Jordan which killed three American soldiers on Sunday. Iraq is claiming the explosions that just happened involving the U.S. killing 16 people, including civilians. U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin says the strikes are just the beginning of the U.S. response. Iran says the U.S. Has made a strategic mistake, while Iraq and Syria say the U.S. actions could inflame more conflict in the region. CNN has teams around the globe covering all of these developments. Let's go first to CNN's Ben Wedeman in Jordan. Ben, these strikes were sudden, devastating. How are officials on the ground? How are those in Iraq reacting?",

      "sentences": "Well, I'll start with Syria, where of course they've said, the Syrian officials have said that there have been civilian, as well as military casualties in what's described as significant devastation in several spots in the eastern part of the country, where it's known that Iranian advisers, as well as Iranian-backed militias have been operating.Now, as far as Iraq is concerned, let's keep in mind there are about 2,500 U.S. troops in Iraq at the moment. The Iraqis have come out and condemned the U.S. strikes, saying that they're unacceptable, they're a violation of national sovereignty. And we've heard the same thing from the Iranian government as well. Now, the Iraqi foreign ministry has summoned the U.S. charge d'affaires in Baghdad, there is no ambassador at the moment, to file an official protest. But beyond those countries that are aligned or close to Iran, the reaction across the Arab world has been fairly muted to these strikes, Fredricka.",

He is trying to strike a balance here, trying to deter these groups, trying to degrade their capabilities, while also preventing a wider war from breaking out in the region. And remember, Fredricka, he is also trying to secure this major breakthrough agreement that would secure the release of hostages in Gaza in exchange for a prolonged pause in the fighting. None of these things is happening in a vacuum and certainly President Biden watching this very closely going forward.",

They're not sort of along the same lines as the kind of strikes we saw overnight in Syria and Iraq.There's a U.S. carrier group operating in the area, they used F-18s to shoot some of those drones down, fired by the Houthis, according to the Pentagon. And this is really what has been going on almost on a daily basis now for many, many weeks. And, of course, the Houthis, their rationale for targeting navigation in the Red Sea and the gulf of Aden is that they believe they are helping the people of Hamas by preventing ships from reaching Israel, as Israel pursues its war in Gaza, Fredricka.",

      "sentences": "All right. We'll leave it there for now, gentlemen. Ben Wedeman, Kevin Liptak, thanks to both of you. We'll see you next hour.All right. Let's get more analysis now on all of this. Joining me right now is CNN military analyst and retired Air Force Colonel Cedric Leighton. Good to see you, Colonel. So what do you believe the message is that the U.S. Is sending with these strikes? COL. CEDRIC LEIGHTON (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST: Well, Fredricka, I think the message has several components to it, but one of them is that we're telling the Iranians that their proxies are entities that they're actually responsible for. So we're sending a message saying that these proxies have behaved badly and that their conduct was unacceptable when they killed those three American soldiers. And as a result, we're going after not only the proxies, but also, as far as we can tell, elements of Iranian intelligence and the Iranian Revolutionary Guard as it's deployed into Syria and Iraq. So it will be interesting to see what the battle damage assessment actually is, you know, how successful the attacks actually were. But the message to Iran is one where, what we're trying to send is we can use weapons that at the moment have only been used outside of Iran, but those weapons are also capable of going into Iran should we feel the need to do so.",

      "speaker": "LEIGHTON",
      "sentences": "Yes, it really has to be a calibrated series of responses, Fredricka. And what you're seeing right now is in essence the beginning phase of that response.It was a very hard-hitting attack, it might be the beginning of what I would call a mini air campaign, where you go in and you have a set of targets, basically have a target list that you go after. And it's done by importance, the kinds of things that you think are part of their command structure, their logistical structure. And if you note that when you look at where the strikes actually occurred, they're basically along the Euphrates River Valley both in Syria and in Iraq. And that is where there is a high concentration of these militias and of course, the advisers from Iran that are helping those militias. So that's the first phase. And as things move forward, sometimes these targets are going to be re-struck, but they're going to be done in a way that's methodical and systemic, with the idea of keeping these people in check.",

But the attack on Tower 22 occurred on Jordanian territory, in Jordan itself, and as a result of that, the kingdom of Jordan feels it's important to protect their sovereignty and make that happen. And so that's the basic idea here.The other nations I don't think are going to do that.",
