You don't -- you often see patients who are brought into the hospital, but you don't see that, that sort of just horrific beating that he took over those several minutes. When you, when you look at this sort of thing, there's obviously so many different injuries that he could have sustained at the time. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GUPTA (voiceover): I think one of the areas that people probably paid a lot attention to was just all these blows he took to his head and to his face. He was restrained at one point, taking fists to the face and he was being kicked in the face when he was on the ground. What can happen sometimes is that the brain is the one organ in the body, that when it's starting to swell, it really has no place to go because it's encased by the skull. Every other organ in the body can swell a little bit more easily. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

But it's also worth noting that he's a pretty skinny guy from we understand. And there were kicks to the body, to the torso, to the chest, as well. And any of those organs may have actually sustained damage and started bleeding as well, could have been suffering from internal bleeding at the time that all this was happening. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)GUPTA (voiceover): And that brings us to the to the next point, which I think is critically important. When you look at sort of the timeline of what was happening there. It was around 8:33 or so 8:34 when you see this last kick that he sustained, and then he was handcuffed and dragged over to the car. And then it's eight minutes later before we see EMS even arrive, but it's not until around 9:02. So, 20 minutes after that, 21 minutes after that almost half an hour in total before you see a gurney arrive. So, you have a critically ill man who's lying on the sidewalk, sustained all these injuries, hard to say, the extent of the injuries or even how serious they are at that point. Obviously, they are serious, but what exactly is the most serious is difficult to ascertain. And it's a full half an hour before he's really assessed. You hear at various times that it's going to take a while for the ambulance to get there. And that's, that's obviously very problematic. He needed to be in a hospital whether or not it would have made a difference ultimately, that's hard to say. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

You had officers yelling and screaming in profanity. There was a misapplied use of force right from the very beginning. It was really a combination of poor policing tactics, that rapidly trans, you know, transcended into just reckless, unjustified physical assault. I don't know a police academy in the United States or around the world that has as part of their policing tactics, kicking somebody in the head, restraining their arms, punching him in the head.

So, these squads, the Scorpion Squad, Anti-Crime Squad, you can put any naming convention on there that you want, the intent of these specialized units is to reduce violent crime, specifically gun violence. And what they do is it actually gives police commanders greater ability and flexibility to put officers into hotspot areas where violent crime is rising. But the but these organizations, these units need to have very strict controls -- they need supervision. And that's one thing we did not see in this video at all, was a level of command. We saw reckless officers unmitigated without a command structure dictating what they should be doing.Now, let me just go back to the, these units, there needs to be a balance between reasonable outputs by these, these, these groups, and those reasonable outputs are arrest, right? You want to take your violent criminals off the ground, but more importantly, there needs to be a positive community outcome. You know, when you have policing action, right? I can't just go into a neighborhood, arrest everybody violently and think that that makes the community be safer. There has to be this balance, and that's the struggle that Chief Davis has, but it's a struggle that law enforcement commanders across the country have every single day -- is that balance between, you know, positive community outputs, or outcomes with policing outputs.",

Because they beat a man to death. There's nothing in their training. There's nothing in their training that in any way said this was how you should conduct yourself.

How engaged their supervisor, is their supervisor ever going on straight with them?Not that they should have, have to have been there to tell them to stop killing somebody. But to what, to what level is the supervisory staff involved? Well, she touched on that, Chief Davis in saying that they did not -- one of the struggles she had, because she's not been there long, she's trying to drive change is that they don't, they don't have enough supervisors.

But sometimes in these cases, you know, we hear advocates also calling for more diversity and policing, right? But in this case, we have a female black police chief, who by the way, is, is being hailed for her transparency and her quick response. But also, we have five black officers.

And by that, I mean, you can have an agency as diverse as Memphis' and still have this. What I would say is, you -- the culture of this unit, if nothing else, has to be called into question.And obviously, it was not designed with any sort of outcome in mind. But somewhere along the way, this unit has deviated from what the initial assignment was, and they've gone in the wrong direction. Because this, I saw I met what I envisioned to me when I say how did this happen? You have a group of guys, they're probably high performers. They bring in a lot of stats, and you're seeing crime go down in the city. And oh, by the way, the city's facing horrible, violent crime. And so, their supervisor is happy, they come in, and they say, hey, sorry, you know, we took care of you tonight, this is what we got. But that sergeant is not really drilling down and seeing the quality of the arrest, how they made these arrests. This is how, this is how these things have happened in the past 20 years because we really became data-driven. And Chief Davis is not about numbers, she's been down this road, she knows that, she knows how this stuff goes wrong. But again, if the supervisory staff is not attuned to that, and they're not engaged enough, I do think this is where you could get an outcome like this.",

And the FBI and DOJ are investigating.Secretary of State Antony Blinken visits Egypt, Israel, and the West Bank this weekend as deadly Israeli-Palestinian violence escalates. Police say at least seven people were killed Friday near a Jerusalem synagogue, and they say the gunman was killed after a shootout with police. And earlier this week, Israeli forces killed nine Palestinians in a West Bank refugee camp. And this is a remarkable story. No life-threatening injuries after a massive 85 car pileup on a Wisconsin Interstate. It happened in the middle of a winter snowstorm, with snow, and ice, and whiteout conditions on Friday afternoon. Wisconsin State Patrol reports 21 people were taken to area hospitals. The highway was shut down for nearly eight hours before he was able to reopen. Well, the Virginia school district, where a 6-year-old allegedly shot his teacher has fired its superintendent, and the vice principal of the school has resigned. Richneck vice principal, Ebony Parker resigned Wednesday, hours before the Newport News school board voted to oust Superintendent George Parker. Now, those moves come in the aftermath of the shooting earlier this month, when police say the first grader brought a gun to school and shot teacher Abby Zwerner. The district has faced widespread criticism as well as allegations from Zwerner's attorney that school officials failed to act after several teachers and employees warn them that the child had a gun.

We have to have ironclad processes and procedures in place at school districts that make sure everyone is trained, and trained properly. So, that, if in fact, some report, or something like this begins to take place in your school, everyone knows how to properly handle it.And I think every school district needs to address that. You have to be careful when you start to mandate, things like that from Richmond, you want to give your school boards in your localities the opportunity to make sure that their folks and their systems are trained. What we have been asked to do just this week, the Hampton Roads Planning District came to us. And as a part of their legislative package, they ask us to promote conflict resolution and mediation skills throughout the course of the matriculation of the student. Would that have helped a sixth grader? We don't know whether they would have understood that. But you can start even before that, to let students know that they're going to be conflicts, they're going to be disagreements, but that you can handle them courteously, and without violence. You know, I'm a member of the legislature. We agree and disagree hundreds of times a day.",

We've got a lot of areas that are going to be dealing with snow. And yes, even unfortunately, some locations of ice. We are focused mainly from Idaho all the way over to Michigan. That's where the bulk of the winter weather advisories are located. This is a very fast moving potent low pressure systems that are going to ride along the front. But even though they are fast, they're very intense. So, they still will have the potential to drop four to six, even as much as eight inches of snow in some of those low lying areas. And you could be measuring it in addition in excess of a foot, when we talk about areas of the intermountain west, Though a lot of these low pressure systems will ride right there along that front along the northern tier of the U.S. So, a couple of different waves there. On the southern side rain will be the main focus where those temperatures just aren't quite cold enough yet, and very heavy rain. Ice is going to be a concern across Illinois and areas of Missouri, where it could end up accumulating up to a quarter of an inch. Then, we get the really big cold air that filters back in.
