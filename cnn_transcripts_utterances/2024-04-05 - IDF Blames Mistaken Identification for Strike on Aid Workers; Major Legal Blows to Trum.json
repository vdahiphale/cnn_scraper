The internal investigation has found Israeli forces believe they were targeting Hamas, end quote, mistakenly assumed two Hamas gunmen were in the vehicles in the aid convoy. Israel has now fired two military commanders.Let's get right to CNN's Nic Robertson. He joins us now live from Jerusalem. Can you walk us through the findings? It's a couple of pages.

      "sentences": "Yes. I think it's kind of key to look at what the White House is saying here. U.S. policy is going to be determined on how Israel moves forward from these statements, and we heard the same from Secretary Blinken today, and it is what Palestinians are telling us as well.It's one thing to hear it from the Israeli government, particularly when they're pushed by the United States to do this, but let's see the reality on the ground. And the context of that, of course, is that back in January this year, the Israeli government said that it was okay for food shipments to come in through the port of Ashdod, which is 20 miles from the Erez Crossing. However, those food shipments, when they arrived, were then blocked by protesters. We already know that elements with inside Netanyahu's -- Prime Minister Netanyahu's government, right-wing elements, are saying that they didn't agree with this move by the Israeli government. This sets the scene for, again, potential protests to potentially stop convoys. It hasn't happened, but this is why the White House will look closely. And another point of reference here is that, when he was here in early February, Secretary of State Antony Blinken told the Israelis that they should be opening the Erez Crossing in the North of Gaza, because that's where the humanitarian situation is most desperate. That's where people are literally dying of starvation. We just got a figure from people on the ground there today. You know how much it is, for one kilo, 2.2 pounds of potatoes today, $22, $22 for two pounds for potatoes. That's the price of the potatoes, that's why people are starving in the north of Gaza right now, and that why there's going to be so much scrutiny to see if this actually happens, that the U.S. has called so many times for Erez to be opened.

It comes on the heels of a very blunt conversation between President Biden and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu yesterday, where Biden warned Israel would face consequences if they do not do more to protect civilians and ease the humanitarian crisis in Gaza.Now, in that phone call, a senior administration official tells CNN that Netanyahu admitted that the IDF was to blame for the strike on this convoy. And this morning, we have some interesting new language from Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who, ahead of the Israelis' report being released, said that there must be a thorough, independent investigation and full accountability for what happened.

In that phone call, Netanyahu assured the president that Israel would be trying take steps to prevent incidents like this from happening again. That's according to a senior administration official.One thing that the two men agreed on was that more needed to be done to be able to track where these humanitarian aid workers are in Gaza. There also was a discussion about the need to get more humanitarian in to the enclave, and that was through the opening of these access points, as Nic was talking about earlier, just in the hours after this call between Biden and Netanyahu, Israel approved the opening of that Erez Crossing in Northern Gaza. Now, one thing that Secretary Blinken and other officials here at the White House have stressed is that while they welcome the opening of this crossing, while the welcome the ports, they also want to see the metrics of the -- see how many aid trucks are actually getting in, see how much assistance is actually being distributed to the American -- to the Palestinian people. But, really, this call between Biden and Netanyahu will be closely watched since it was one of the starkest warnings that he's offered -- that Biden has given to Netanyahu about the way that they're conducting their operations, saying that things need to change.",

      "sentences": "A lot of rejection, but also, John, think about it this way, a lot of green flags by judges to allow prosecutors to continue these cases against Donald Trump toward the trial. So, you have the Mar-a-Lago documents case, you have the Georgia January 6, 2020 election case, you have the hush money case in New York.In all of those, Donald Trump's team is either trying to get the cases totally dismissed or put on hold for a very long period of time. And in each of these this week, we're seeing the judges say no to those requests. That is somewhat typical in the way that this typically works before trial to see these denials of these requests to dismiss the cases. And, John, there is a silver lining for Trump that is coming to him based on how his lawyers are arguing these things in both the Mar-a- Lago documents case and in the hush money case. The judges have looked at requests from Trump's team, arguments around the Presidential Records Act, him trying to claim the classified documents or his personal records, as well as in the Hush Money case in New York, that he's about to go to trial on, an argument around presidential immunity on both of those. While the judges are saying no to the requests on the table from Trump's team, they're saying, we might want to think about these topics again and talk about them later. Judge Aileen Cannon, specifically in the classified documents case, says that she's not really even going to determine yet if there is going to be the idea of presidential immunity or Presidential Records Act discussed before a jury. And she says to the Justice Department who says, get rid of this idea already. She says, this is just a genuine attempt in the context of the upcoming trial to better understand the party's competing positions and the questions to be submitted to the jury in this complex case of first impression. So, in these criminal cases, denials for Donald Trump's team as the table setting is happening, as the trials are approaching, but it is not the final word from these judges, not at all.",
