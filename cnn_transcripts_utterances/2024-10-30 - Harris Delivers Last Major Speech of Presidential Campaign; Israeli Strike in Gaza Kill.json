It's the bottom of the first inning, Yankees player Gleyber Torres hitting a long fly ball heading for the stands. Dodgers outfielder Mookie Betts leaps up for the ball. He makes the catch. Then come in the Yankees fans. One tries to rip the gloves off of Betts' hand, another firmly holds onto his wrist. Both cheering when the ball drops from Betts' glove. But it all backfired because the play was ruled out as fan interference. And they were removed from the stadium. It was their loss. The Yankees pulled off an epic comeback scoring 11 runs and forcing a game five. Dodgers end the show with one piece of advice. Watch out for those Yankee fans.

Well, this was the very same spot where outgoing president DonaldTrump stood on January 6th, 2021, when he urged his supporters to march the U.S. Capitol ahead of the deadly riot and insurrection. Well, Harris told Americans their vote in this election will probably be the most important one they ever cast. That they're making a choice about whether they want to live in a country rooted in freedom, or one ruled by chaos.

That comedian, Tony Hinchcliffe, Trump conceded probably he shouldn't have been there.For more, I'm joined by Lara Putnam, a professor of history and director of global studies at the University of Pittsburgh. Lara, lovely to see you. Talk us through the symbolism of Kamala Harris speaking, you know, where Trump held his January 6th rally and then fired up the mall, which led to a siege on the Capitol. Her message was of unity with that freedom sign in the background. Will this resonate with voters and most importantly, undecided voters?",

Well, what we know is that, that location absolutely pounded home one of the themes the Harris campaign has sounded, especially in recent days, about the importance of democracy and about the threat that Trump's character presents to democracy. She's been emphasizing how former members of his own administration have come out and said that he's a fascist or similar to a fascist.But what we know from polls and from research is that for undecided voters, those aren't really as compelling. So for some highly engaged Democrats and others, that theme of protecting democracy is a priority. But for the voters who Harris might not otherwise get, those undecided voters, the independents, the younger voters, people who are less politically engaged, that's really not what resonates most. We know that what resonates most with them is a clear communication of what her economic policies and economic priorities are. And so, you know, I think what we saw tonight was Harris using the setting to reinforce the points that she was making about the value of democracy, about unity, about moving the nation forward. But she used the text to her speech to also make he sure she hit those points about making homeownership affordable, bringing down prices and protecting Medicare, protecting Social Security. So, again, those core economic policy issues that we know are actually what are most likely to make the difference in for that independent voter, that undecided voter, who hasn't yet made up their minds to support her.",

The reality is that, you know, you hear a story and that doesn't end, you know, the story for that day. That's just for that moment. It's just a continuation of indiscriminate killing of women, children, civilians every single day. All the atrocities that have been described that I've described, that all my medical colleagues from around the world have described for months and months, just continues on every single day. And that's from a trauma standpoint, it's from a living conditions standpoint. All of this stuff just worsened and worsened and worsened, even in just the three months since I was there last.

It's really, really tough to describe. And that's the (INAUDIBLE) feeling there is everybody's at their wits' end.As you say, they're exhausted, they're to the point of feeling hopeless, which is very difficult to see, because these are people who, you know, the last time I went no matter what happened, they kept going because they didn't have any other choice. And it's beyond, you know, I would say that three months ago I used the same thing that we're at the point of this entire system and society collapsing, and things have just gotten worse. And so when you think it can't get any worse, it continues to. There's absolutely no medical supplies coming in. Every single thing from sutures to antibiotics and medicines to gauze to dressings is just running out, and you're just finding other things to replace. And I just don't know what else we can do to plead for help and there's just no response. You know, this letter from the U.S. about two weeks ago with a 30-day window to try to improve humanitarian aid, I mean, you see what the response is. Aid organizations were banned from sending personnel in which was already almost nobody coming in, now they're talking about banning UNRWA, which is basically the backbone of humanitarian aid there. So instead of things improving, it's just, with impunity, making moves to make things even worse when you can't even imagine how much worse they can get.

And that's the entire area that's white. That's the computerized forecast of how much precip is going to come down. Now, there's going to be obviously flooding damage. But this is a wind event. Everything has a certain factor. Is it a wind? Is it a surge? Is it a flood? We know the one that moved through the Philippines didn't have much wind, but it certainly had flooding just last week. So this is what we're seeing here as the wind and the surge would probably be equal to or not even greater than the flooding potential here. An awful lot of wind damage here. Many spots here all the way even into China are going to see tropical cyclone winds somewhere, maybe even over 100 kilometers per hour. And then on up toward Kyushu. Now, Taiwan is no stranger to these big things. Since like 1950, there have been 30 Taiwan landfalls of what's an equivalent of a category four or five Atlantic hurricane. So yes, major damage can happen there in Taiwan and it does, but this year we've already had two and really another, but Krathon and also Gimme has already taken its toll there in damage across the eastern parts of Taiwan. There's going to be more. Obviously we could even still see this continue to increase in intensity. Probably likely go down before landfall, but we're still going to have to watch this.
