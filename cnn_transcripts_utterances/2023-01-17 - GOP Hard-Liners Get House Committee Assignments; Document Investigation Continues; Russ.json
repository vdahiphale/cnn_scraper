      "sentences": "House Republican leaders giving freshman New York Congressman George Santos not one but two committee assignments despite the countless lies he told during his campaign. He joins with other controversial colleagues as well who also have new committee assignments.Tonight, we're talking about all of that and what it tells us about Speaker McCarthy's hold on the GOP or maybe their hold on him. I want to bring in Democratic Congressman Ritchie Torres of New York. He is one who has been calling on the Federal Election Commission to launch an investigation into Santos over allegations that he broke campaign finance laws. Congressman, thank you for being here this evening. This is certainly a congressman and a colleague who has a lot of questions surrounding him. I wonder -- I mean, you have questions about in particular, the more than $700,000 that he seems to have spent on his campaign. Why do you ask the FEC to investigate this in particular? REP. RITCHIE TORRES (D-NY):  Well, of all the 535 members of Congress, both in the Senate and the House, there's no one who poses a greater threat for the integrity of Congress than George Santos. We know he has lied about every aspect of his life. And even worse than his lying is his possible lawbreaking. And for me, the $700,000 question is, where did all the money come from? A decade ago, George Santos was a wage earner at a call center, accumulating thousands of dollars in debt, facing evictions. As latest 2020, he reported a salary of $55,000. And then miraculously, in 2021 and 2022, he became a multimillionaire. He claims to have earned millions of dollars from clients, yet he disclosed the names of none of those clients on his congressional disclosure as required by federal law. And that's why I filed an ethics complaint against George Santos for falsifying his financial disclosure. We're finally getting a clear sense of exactly how the money flow from various entities into the coffers of the Santos campaign. COATES:  You know, for so many who are looking at this issue, congressman, they're wondering whether there is a mechanism to have somebody who has been accused of lying, who has admitted to lying, who has the allegations you're speaking about and the questions you've raised, to have them no longer be a part of Congress. As you've said, you call him one of the biggest dangers to our democracy, but also to our national security. There's a distinction there. The integrity of Congress and also national security. On that latter point, what is the nature of your concern there?",

I don't think, given the fact that Tom is a pocket quarterback and has always been very adept, he has had only one significant injury in his career, that very long career, very adept and avoiding significant contact, I don't think the safety issue would be the major factor in his decision.No matter what, he has got options, including if he just wants to go sit on a beach somewhere for a year. He's got a television option. Fox has a contract waiting for him that is stratospheric. And even dwarfing his football compensation, there are teams that would want him to play for them. If he feels like he doesn't have as good a shot at the Super Bowl with the Bucs as he once did, where he won it once and came close to second time, but this year, they were under 500, there are teams that he could probably go off and be part of. The Las Vegas Raiders have mentioned Derek Carr as their starting quarterback, apparently over. Whether he wants to align himself with the outlaw raider brand is another thing given his generally positive image. And the most obvious one would be the San Francisco 49ers, a very good team, still alive in the playoffs. That's where he grew up. That's the team he grew up rooting for. He likes to tell the story of being a little kid and watching Joe Montana at Candlestick Park for the 49ers back in the day. But there is just one problem. The 49ers quarterback, Brock Purdy, the last player taken and in last round of the draft, the so-called \"Mr. Irrelevant,\" as the good-naturedly dubbed \"the last player taken to the draft,\" is doing just great. And Brady should be able to relate to that, because unlike Brady's most accomplished contemporary, Peyton Manning, who was the number one pick in the draft and highly touted, Tom was the 199th player taken, not the last but close to the last, and then goes on to become the most accomplished quarterback in NFL history. If the 49ers were in desperate need of a quarterback, which apparently they are not, that  would be perhaps the perfect closing chapter to go back home where he grew up, for the team he grew up rooting for, and write the last chapter in his career, but that avenue doesn't appear to be open.",

Residents of Rio Verde Foothills are suing neighbor city, Scottsdale, for cutting off their water.Now, Rio Verde had been buying water from Scottsdale, getting it trucked in, as a matter of fact, from a private supplier until that is the first of this year. That is when Scottsdale closed up the tap for the unincorporated neighborhood in efforts to conserve water for its own residents in Scottsdale, which they had warned that they would ultimately do. They finally, of course, announced the end of the deal late last year. That is when CNN's Lucy Kafanov took a trip to check out the situation.
