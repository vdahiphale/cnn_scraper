That is deafening for them as they're running through the school trying to communicate. And you can hear that there's an officer running and in charge and you can hear them communicating with each other saying go, go, push, push. That's not because the others aren't responding. It's because they're communicating to make sure that they all know exactly what they're doing that they stay -- they're all carrying live weapons, right? They want to make sure that they stay.

Incredibly courageous and effective response on the part of the police. I can tell you that as Katherine said, the complexity of searching a large building when you're clearing it room by room with any door that you're about to open possibly hiding a shooter is very difficult. So, in 15 minutes, this was an incredibly quick response, neutralizing a suspect like this. These officers used exemplary room-clearing techniques, exemplary communication techniques, as was already stated. The tactics of shoot and move are employed. These are exactly the types of training and the types of responses that we hope for in any police department that's responding to an incident like this. And officers Engelbert and Collazo had just did -- just showed incredible courage, incredible efficiency, and effectiveness in their tactics and techniques. And they saved lives.

Because so often when someone leaks that last intent and says they're going to do something, it may be just minutes before. And that's why I very much urge people to make a call to the police, make a call to 911. They're not going to create a fuss, if a fuss -- it shouldn't be created. But it get -- might give them the extra moments to look for somebody or to look for a car, or to be prepared in case somebody's going to shoot. But we do know 30 to 40 percent of these types of shooters intend to and often do commit suicide or suicide by cop as we saw here. So, the challenge is that if they're going to kill themselves anyway if we can get to them before they do that, maybe we can interrupt that violence for their own death. And we can also interrupt the violence to others. So, if you -- if you get an information like this, you have to call. I've so many people have said to me, well, I thought I'd wait for the weekend.

They are contemplating just legislation that would even loosen those laws to 18 years of age. When you hear from the police chief that this individual had bought seven firearms from five different stores legally, talk about the pressure it puts on police officers, particularly in these types of states that allow open carry to do their jobs and protect citizens given that if they had just seen her walking down the street, there was nothing they could have done theoretically until she did open fire. [14:15:00] DAVIS: Right. This situation sets up an almost impossible world for police to effectively do their job. We have people who are running down to the store and buying firearms that police don't have access to. Officer Collazo just had a sign-on when he went into that encounter. And he went up against a person with a military-style rifle. The other officer had a rifle. But not everybody has those things. And we don't want to have a world where police are walking around with a rifle slung over their shoulder. Those are the kinds of things you see in other third-world countries. We have to think very carefully when we start to argue that the Second Amendment just gives everybody the right to carry firearms everywhere at all times, it is -- it's a dangerous proposition. And it's mostly dangerous for the officers who have to try to do their job in that environment to say nothing of poor innocent children like this that are being just horrendously murdered.

She's part of the team that helped to break this story just a couple of hours ago. Katelyn. walk us through the details of this new order.KATELYN POLANTZ, CNN SENIOR CRIME &amp; JUSTICE REPORTER: Well, we're still getting some details because this order is under seal as all of these have been in recent weeks. But this is something that puts wind in the sails of the special counsel investigation. Jack Smith has been seeking vice president -- former Vice President Mike Pence's testimony, sent him a subpoena calling him in before the grand jury. They went to court to try and fight over whether he was going to have to go, whether he was going to have to answer questions. And ultimately, Judge Jeb Boasberg of the DC district court. He said yes, Pence must testify. Pence is going to have to testify specifically about conversations he had with Donald Trump. And we're hearing from our sources, that one of the key findings that Judge Boasberg made here is that Pence must testify about interactions where Donald Trump may have been acting corruptly. And so, if you recall those conversations, he was having with the president at the time, Trump was pressuring him to block the election results. He was calling him names, as some of the witnesses have said. And Pence himself has talked a little bit about this in a book he's written and publicly -- but he hasn't testified before about exactly what happened and what was said in phone calls only between he and Donald Trump. And so that is what the investigators are seeking here. Also, I should note that Pence did have a bit of a win in this in that he seems to have expanded some of the powers of the vice presidency convincing the judge that he should have some protections of Congress -- constitutional protections around him on January 6, whenever he was president of the Senate. And ultimately, Bianna and Boris, I should really note that Donald Trump did argue to close off some of the answers of Pence, citing executive privilege.

I'm saying that you know, they failed to get this bank ready for spiking interest rates. Some lawmakers, they kind of accused regulators of basically being asleep at the wheel. And then progressives like Senator Elizabeth Warren, they blamed the 2018 rollback of Dodd-Frank. That rollback, which I should note was bipartisan, meant that Silicon Valley Bank didn't have to get stress tested, even though it was a big, large regional bank.

Now, you can see on that screen. Consumer confidence is not necessarily at healthy levels.It's still well below where it was before COVID. But it has bounced back off the lows from last year when Americans were dealing with four and five-dollar gasoline prices. This is an encouraging sign and it's probably in large part because the jobs market has held up and inflation has cooled off. Now, consumer confidence is up but home prices, we're learning, they actually dipped. New numbers from S&amp;P Case-Shiller show that home prices, they dipped between December and January by 0.2 percent. That is the seventh month in a row of falling home prices. Year over year, home prices were up by almost four percent. But that is a big slowdown. When you dig into this report, you can see that just slip out -- just like everything else in real estate, it's all about location. Because some housing markets like Miami and Tampa, they're still seeing double-digit year over year home price increases. Other housing markets like San Diego, Seattle, San Francisco, they've seen home prices drop. You know, going forward in the housing markets so much depends on what happens with mortgage rates. If the Fed is able to pause its interest rate hiking campaign, maybe mortgage rates can actually start to come down a bit.
