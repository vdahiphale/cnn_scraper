I'm Max Foster in London.Just ahead, Israel's Prime Minister dismisses reports that his country is considering a ceasefire with Hezbollah, that Israel is threatening to launch a full ground incursion into Lebanon. Then Hurricane Helene is intensifying and is now a category 2 storm. It's set to make landfall in Florida in the coming hours. We'll have a live update from there in just a moment. Plus, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is in Washington where he'll reveal his plan for victory over Russia in the coming hours. We've got the details for you. The U.S. and its allies are calling for a 21-day ceasefire on the Israel-Lebanon border. Even as Israel launches a new wave of strikes against Hezbollah on Thursday, including areas of Lebanon bordering Syria. Three people were killed in the Tyre district of southern Lebanon. Overnight, the IDF says it hit at least 75 targets. Israel says it's dismantling and degrading Hezbollah infrastructure. The Lebanese health ministry says at least 81 people were killed on Wednesday. Tens of thousands are fleeing as the conflict escalates. Lebanon's Interior Minister says more than 70,000 people are registering in official shelters. Meanwhile, Israel's Prime Minister is heading to New York for the U.N. General Assembly. He is pushing back on reports of a pause saying he's told the military to fight with full force. Our CNN teams are covering all the angles of the story. Nic Robertson is in Tel Aviv. Jomana Karadsheh is in Beirut. Nic, just bring us the latest situation then on the ground at least.",

      "sentences": "You know, Max, just listening to Nic there, you know, this talk of a possible ceasefire, very few people here would have hopes of that happening when they consider the positions of both Israel and Hezbollah. And a lot of people would tell you they've heard those same sort of promises and that sort of talk when it comes to a ceasefire in Gaza and they haven't seen it happen.So not many people have faith in that happening anytime soon. And, you know, the fear, the apprehension here is just palpable. People are terrified of what might be coming, what is unfolding in this country right now when we're talking about the number of people who've been displaced. I mean, just in a matter of days, you've had tens of thousands, possibly up to hundreds of thousands of people who've had to flee their homes. There's no exact figure. We've heard estimates 70,000 to 90,000 people, but that is those who have registered and are staying at government or U.N. run shelters. That doesn't take into account as we've heard from Lebanese officials, the number of people who have had to go and stay with family, with friends, with relatives, who have had to rent apartments, stay in hotels. For example, in our hotel in Beirut, we have had many displaced families from southern Lebanon and from the southern suburbs of Beirut who are staying here. And, you know, the Lebanese government estimates that that number is approaching 500,000, nearly half a million people. That's almost 10 percent of Lebanon's population. People who don't know when they're going to be able to return to their homes. They fled airstrikes, they fled because of Israeli warnings and the Israelis telling them yesterday, do not return to your towns and villages, those areas that have been pretty much emptied out after this recent escalation. And then you also have the casualty toll that is continuing to rise by the day. Max, you've got the country's hospitals, the health sector here that was already struggling before this recent escalation. Considering the situation in Lebanon, the economic situation, the brain drain, the crises they've had to deal with in recent years, it is very right now, as we're hearing, they're overwhelmed. They're struggling to deal with the sheer number of injured in their thousands just in this past week. And the numbers continue to rise as Israeli strikes have intensified in recent days. I mean, we are finding it really hard to keep track of the number of airstrikes that have taken place just in the last 24 hours. They are focused primarily in the southern part of Lebanon and in the eastern Beqaa region, where you do have Hezbollah presence. But there are also residential areas there, residential neighborhoods. Yes, Hezbollah has taken a really hard hit with these attacks and airstrikes in recent days. But this has also been devastating for Lebanon and for the civilian population. I mean, to give you one example, one of the deadliest strikes overnight happened in the Beqaa region in Eastern Lebanon in a town Unine (ph). The mayor there telling us that at least 23 people were killed in a strike on a building. They were all Syrian nationals. Members of one family, including women and Children. The men were day laborers, Max. These are people who live on a day's wage, and they were killed in this airstrike. And the mayor tells us he knows of no links to Hezbollah. And you hear so many of these accounts from different parts of the south and the east where these airstrikes are taking place. One young man we spoke to who had fled from southern Lebanon to Beirut yesterday, telling us what we saw happening, he says, in Gaza, we are seeing it happen here right now. And you hear that from a lot of people. There is this fear of what some are describing as the gasification of Lebanon. Real fear of that.",

      "sentences": "Well, Max, what's also interesting here is that during these feverish negotiations of the past 48 to 72 hours, the Israelis have been involved. Top U.S. officials have been talking to their Israeli counterparts. The government of Lebanon has been involved. Obviously, they've been speaking with Hezbollah. So you've had all these parties who have been on these phone calls trying to put together this text, which would not come as a surprise to Hezbollah and Israel when it was put forward last night. So, when White House officials woke up this morning, I imagine they were quite disheartened to hear what Netanyahu's office is saying, which is that there are -- that it's incorrect, that there is an imminent ceasefire. That -- and he -- they went on to say that the IDF should continue fighting with full force.Now, let's be clear about what we're talking about here. This is not a permanent truce between Israel and Hezbollah. This is a call for a 21- day pause to then restart the negotiations to be able to get to a more permanent ceasefire. So this was just a first step, and it really reflects the fact that there was so much fear of a potential escalation, that we were entering such a dangerous period. Where this conflict that we're seeing in northern Israel, southern Lebanon could really spiral out of control. So, you have U.S. officials with French counterparts as well as others. This is a statement that was put forward by the U.S. and 10 other allies, including the G7 countries and three Arab countries, and they put together a briefing call for reporters very quickly late last night at 9:30 p.m. And they were speaking with some confidence saying when the governments of Israel and Lebanon accept. They talked about this as being a breakthrough and yet here we are looking right there on the screen at continued fighting. Noises from from the Israeli government saying that there's no sign of an imminent ceasefire and that the IDF should keep fighting. So it is far from clear at best, Max, that this ceasefire is going to go into effect anytime soon. But, as you noted, Prime Minister Netanyahu is on his way to New York. U.S. officials are still here in New York. We know that the Secretary of State is meeting with Netanyahu's top aide, Ron Dermer, later today. So those diplomatic conversations, those diplomatic efforts are still very much continuing, Max.",

CARLOS SUAREZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Max, good morning. That's right. So we are in Pinellas County. We're in the city of Gulfport. That is just to the west of the city of Tampa here in Florida, where, as you can see here behind me, we're already starting to feel the effects of this hurricane. This part of Gulfport is known to flood. And to give you a sense of just where things are at this hour, my photographer is going to go ahead and try and push in just to the west of me here rather. You're taking a look at the bay there, and that is a volleyball beach court. And you can see how the water has already started to creep onto that part of where we are. So it will no doubt at some point today cross over to the street where I am standing, which, as you can see, is flooded. This part of Pinellas County is expected to see anywhere between 4 to 6 feet of a storm surge. And that is on top of what you're looking at right here, this right now is really the result of high tide, which got underway around 7:00 Eastern Time, and some of the rain that we've seen the last couple of 12 to 18 hours. Once that storm continues its track north, just to the west of where we are, we expect that storm search to go ahead, push all of that water in here. You add that with all of the rainfall that we're going to get. And Max, you can get a sense of exactly why the flooding that we're seeing here is one of the reasons why city officials have ordered this part of Pinellas County to evacuate over in Hillsborough County, which is about a half hour drive, which is home to the Tampa area. There is also a mandatory evacuation order in place for some residents that live along the bay there because that part of Florida is expected to get the same amount of storm surge as you all have been talking about the sheer size of the storm really means that no matter where you live in the state of Georgia, and even parts of Georgia, chances are you are going to feel the effects of Hurricane Helene.

We know from Ukrainian data that the number of drone launches has gone up significantly in August and now in September, which of course coincides directly with the Kursk incursion. So this seems to be continuing with that pattern.One interesting thing, given that we heard President Zelenskyy at the UNGA claiming that he had information that Russia was planning to target Ukraine's three nuclear power plants that are not under Russian occupation. Of course, it still occupies the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. Energoatom, which is the state nuclear energy company, said that they recorded a drone flying at a critically low altitude near the Rivne nuclear power plant, which is in the west of Ukraine. So, obviously, this is a major concern for nuclear safety, but also, given the sort of sustained assault that we're seeing on Ukraine's energy grid ahead of winter. There was also a drone attack on substations in the Kyiv region, and one woman was killed in a missile attack on the Odesa region overnight, Max.

So on the one hand, it is alarming and Dmitry Peskov making it very clear that this, he said, is a signal to unfriendly countries. So read a direct counter to the possibility that the West could give permission for Ukraine to use Western long-range missiles on Russian soil. Russia is laser focused on trying to prevent more Western aid to Ukraine. What was announced, Belarus is now going to be under the nuclear umbrella, the Russian nuclear umbrella. The idea that a nuclear armed country supporting, it's not clarified exactly what that means, an attack on Russia by a non-nuclear power would be seen as a sort of joint attack. And then broadening the range of scenarios potentially under which a first strike could be justified. Take a listen to Putin on that point. (BEGIN VIDEOCLIP) VLADIMIR PUTIN, RUSSIAN PRESIDENT (through translation): The conditions for Russia's transition to the use of nuclear weapons are clearly established. We will consider this possibility upon receipt of reliable information about a massive launch of air and space attack weapons and their crossing of our state border.

And if we have those, there they are. And if you wait, you'll see that there was -- it looks like an explosion and smoke. This, the Sarmat missile really one of the centerpieces of Russia's modernizing arsenal. So I think that will show that obviously that modernization is not 100 percent going to plan and feeds into the idea that a lot of this is still just rhetoric coming from Russia.",

We still don't have much information. We are waiting to hear more from the Israeli military on who or what the target of that strike was. But we have seen over the past more than week now, these strikes carried out by the Israeli military in Beirut on the southern suburbs, where you do have a presence of Hezbollah there. They carried out a strike last week that was a major blow to Hezbollah, taking out some of their senior commanders, one of its top commanders of the special -- what is known as the special force of Hezbollah, the elite Radwan force and other commanders as well. So we'll have to wait and see what the Israeli military says was the target of the strike.

I understand the want by the United States and many others to put a 21-day ceasefire plan on the table, but it's hard for me to see why Israel would accept that. We got to keep in mind going back to October 6th, which was the day before October 7th, the region was at relative peace. On October 7th, Hamas attacked into Gaza -- I'm sorry, Hamas attacked into Israel from Gaza and killed over 1,200 Israelis, took over 200 captive. And then the next day, Hezbollah launched its attacks on provoked against Israel as well, and has been shooting rockets and missiles into Israel ever since.Now -- every day since. Now, from those early months on, Israel has been anxious to strike back at Hezbollah because as you know, over 60,000 Israelis have been displaced now going on 11 months. And just a few weeks ago, Israel said one of the war objectives now is to return those people safely and securely to their homes in Northern Israel. And they've been signaling this for quite a long time. And I might add that political parties, political leaders across the spectrum in Israel support this. So I don't see why Israel would take the pressure off now, allow a ceasefire that would permit Hezbollah to regroup, to reestablish their command and control.

Since making that forced confession, Hakamata has always maintained his innocence, which you can see in the hundreds of letters he's sent and written to his family over the years. Now, he was granted a retrial in 2014 after new evidence emerged in his case. And as we learned from the judge's ruling today, that evidence was in fact fabricated by the police. They planted articles of clothing at the scene of the crime and said that the bloodstains on the clothes matched his DNA. But, again, as we learned from today's verdict, at least some of the evidence used to convict him was fabricated, which is all the more reason why human rights activists argue that the death penalty should be abolished. Hakamata's case has renewed debate about Japan's criminal justice system and who it serves. Hanako Montgomery, CNN, Tokyo.",

These are national treasures that were gifted by the Chinese central government to Hong Kong ahead of the October National Day holiday next week.Now the pandas, they touched down earlier before midday today, Thursday in Hong Kong. They were given a welcoming ceremony at the Hong Kong International Airport. And then they were given a very special escort by elite police officers on motorcycles to their new home here at Hong Kong's Ocean Park. The two five-year-old pandas are named An An and Ke Ke. And they're from a conservation and research center in Sichuan province. An An is male, Ke Ke is female. They were both born in June of 2019. They are not genetically related and they're said to have complementary characteristics. They're also said to be in good health. Even so, they have to spend 30 days in quarantine here at Ocean Park. And then after that, they have a month to acclimate and to get used to their new habitat. But the public won't get a chance to see the dynamic duo of the giant pandas until mid-December.
