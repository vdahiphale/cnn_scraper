And that is what many NATO allies -- I spoke to the Lithuanian prime minister yesterday, who was making a similar case this week.",

      "sentences": "You're exactly right. What Ukrainians need are the long-range weapons, the ability to fire deep into the territory that the Russians control. They control a lot of Ukrainian territory as we know. They're firing into that territory.It's important for the Ukrainians. It's important actually to be able to attack the Russian military units that are attacking Ukraine wherever they are. We've seen that the Ukrainians have used their own weapons to fire into and to attack targets in Russia. They're using their own weapons for that. There's no reason why they couldn't use long-range U.S. weapons to do that. The Europeans, also, Jim, have those long-range weapons that could be provided to the Ukrainians. ERICA HILL, CNN ANCHOR AND U.S. CORRESPONDENT:  What are you sensing about the shift we're seeing in terms of long-range weapons? TAYLOR:  I think there's clearly a debate going on within the administration. The debate has been on going for some time. We've seen the increase in the lethality, the range and the weight of these weapons. Start off back nine months ago, now we're all the way back to HIMARS. So I think that debate is ongoing and I think they'll soon get to the conclusion that these long-range weapons ought to be provided to Ukraine.",

I think it's daunting for a lot of Russians around President Putin that this is a loser, this war is not being won. They know they're not winning the war on the ground.They know they've got problems with their own people, who are fleeing the country rather than volunteering or being drafted into the Russian military. They know they've got pressure from their right wing. So President Putin has all this problem, in addition to the Chinese telling him to back down. So I think this is a problem for President Putin. And I don't know if he's figured it out yet. But when he does, then he'll probably be able to tell them come to the negotiating table.",

This is going to be a high priority for the White House. This is an important step for them. And it comes at such an interesting time, just months after the overturning of Roe v. Wade and as concerns really exist up here on Capitol Hill about the future protection of privacy rights in this country. You saw a lot of Democrats arguing this had to happen before House Speaker Nancy Pelosi passes the gavel to Republicans in a few weeks. This is also a huge moment for the Speaker herself. This is an issue she has been working on for decades. She wrote that her very first floor speech on the House floor really dealt with the AIDS epidemic and the need for Congress and public officials to do more to combat that epidemic. There was also such a fight in her history for overturning \"Don't Ask, Don't Tell\" as well as passing multiple hate crimes legislation. So it's such an important moment for her. She'll have a bill enrollment ceremony, celebrating the passage, assuming that's what happens in just a little over an hour.",
