Explosions and plumes of black smoke could be seen in Gaza City, and Hamas says its fighters also clashed with Israeli troops inside Gaza. He has more from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER (through translator): We fought with exemplary heroism in Gaza. Your stories are very inspirational and know that you lost comrades. This is very, very difficult, but we are fighting for our lives, for our home. This is no exaggeration. This is war. We are now in a double battle. One battle is to block them here. The second battle is to win a crushing victory that will erase Hamas. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

An IDF spokesperson says the group has attacked Israeli positions along the border with Lebanon, which the military has responded to.

Of course, President Biden's actual visit, actual presence inside Israel would have delayed matters a little bit because Israel was never going to go in on the ground while the President was in town.Now when he was asked Secretary of State Antony Blinken, when he was asked if the U.S. is pressing Israel for a delay, he simply said that these are decisions that Israel has to make. And when President Biden was asked, he said simply, I am talking to the Israelis for its part. Israel has denied these reports. It has denied that the United States has asked it to delay going in on the ground. But clearly, we've been expecting this to happen for a number of days now. It hasn't happened. Perhaps the U.S. is pressing for a delay, as we understand it, perhaps it's the weather, perhaps just changing facts on the ground, or additional intelligence that the Israelis are getting, for example, as to the whereabouts of its hostages and other bodies and other perhaps Hamas infrastructure and assets on the ground and below the ground. So delays have clearly happened. The U.S. we understand is pressing Israel to delay in order to facilitate further negotiations for the hostages to be released. And to get more humanitarian aid in. Israel says that isn't the case. We do expect that ground invasion to happen. We know it's a question of when rather than if, it seems we're on the cusp of it now.

CNN's Scott McLean has more now on the situation in the besieged enclave. A warning though his report contains graphic images. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SCOTT MCLEAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voiceover): Those who arrived at the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in central Gaza alive are the lucky ones. There were five airstrikes this morning near the hospital. This video shows the smoke from one rising nearby. Some 110 bodies were brought here overnight and this morning. One medical source tells CNN the morgue is now full. The rest of the bodies wrapped in white sheets now lay outside in the heat of the day. Relatives try to identify their loved ones, finding them confirms their worst fears. Inside the hospital children, including a toddler are among the dead. Several of these victims were found with their names written in Arabic on their legs, an increasingly common marking as parents try to make identification easier if they were their kids are killed. This hospital is located outside of the area of northern Gaza that Israel has been trying to get civilians to evacuate. On Saturday, the IDF dropped leaflets telling people that everyone who chose to not evacuate from the north of the strip to the south of Wadi Gaza might be considered as a partner for the terrorist organization. In a statement the IDF confirmed it dropped the leaflets but said it has no intention to consider those who have not evacuated from the affected area of fighting as a member of the terrorist group. Even those who have managed to avoid the bombs are not out of danger. A trickle of aid 20 trucks were allowed to cross the Rafah Border Crossing from Egypt on Saturday. But that's a tiny fraction of what is needed",

These are usually schools that's UNRWA, the UN Agency for Palestine Refugees, runs and where it hosts little girls and boys. These have now become overcrowded shelters with no privacy, no locks, one toilet for several hundreds or even thousands people situations very, very dire. So 20 and 14 trucks is a welcome gesture. But as a reminder, before this conflict, over 100 trucks of humanitarian aid and fuel used to come in, and here I really must insist on the fuel. No fuel has come into Gaza for the last two weeks. And without fuel, it's not going to be possible to go around Gaza in our trucks and distribute assistance, or to power the water desalination plants and get clean drinking water or to power hospitals and their life saving machines.

I also think that person will have to be strong enough not to make promises that he or she cannot keep, because that really was part of Kevin McCarthy's downfall.

So, so when Hamas went there, I think they expected that they would have the full fury of a modern military coming after them. But they actually had hours of leisure when they could do what they wished on site. And during that time, I'm sure it was pretty obvious to them that they would rather not have a prolonged standoff in Israeli territory when they can just take everybody back. You know, hundreds of people back and bring -- have them in Gaza territory instead.",

So this, I think is a document, a chemical weapons document that is, an expression of aspiration rather than a fully-fledged plan to kill large numbers of people with terrible, corrosive, poisonous gases or whatever.It is still alarming that anyone would try to do this. But unlike the hostage manual, it's not describing something that is anywhere close to being able to take into fruition.",

Zhai is visiting the region this week to promote peace talks and push for a ceasefire.And CNN's Kristie Lu Stout joins me now live from Hong Kong. Good to see you, Kristie.

Zhai Jun says that China is willing to do, quote, \"whatever is conducive to promote dialogue, to reach a cease-fire, and restore peace. He also adds that the risk of a large-scale ground conflict in Gaza is, quote, \"significantly rising\".Look, China wants to present itself to the world as a neutral mediator, but we have to keep in mind that China has some deep economic interests that it wants to safeguard in the Middle East, especially access to energy like oil and gas. Now, it was on Saturday that Zhai Jun was in Egypt, and he made remarks at the Cairo Summit for Peace. Zhai, in addition to visiting Egypt, is also visiting the UAE, Saudi Arabia, and Jordan, and other countries in the region. And Zhai says that China has provided and will continue to provide humanitarian aid to Palestinians through U.N., through bilateral channels and that China wants to promote a two-state solution. Now, according to a foreign minister readout of the Cairo Summit, we have it, let's bring it up for you. It says this, quote, \"to end the cycle of the conflict between Palestine and Israel, it is essential to implement the two-state solution, establish an independent state of Palestine, and realize peaceful coexistence between Palestine and Israel,\" unquote. And that is what we heard last week. Thursday last week, straight from the top leader of China, Xi Jinping. It was when he made those first comments ever since the war broke out. Xi called for a two-state solution. He said it was the fundamental way out. And what we have not heard from China -- we have yet to hear any condemnation of Hamas. China has not condemned Hamas for its brutal terror attack on Israel on October 7th. And that has prompted anger from Israel, disappointment from Israel. It's prompted criticism from U.S. officials as well. Back to you.",
