And that the initial narrative officials told of a heroic first response was a lie.Joining us now is Adam Martinez. His son Zayon was eight years old when the tragedy unfolded. Zayon survived, but is struggling still from the trauma that he experienced that day. And Adam, you have a podcast that you host now called \"Karma Corner\", where you interview family members of Uvalde shooting victims and others close to this tragedy. And we thank you for that and for being with us here today to talk about this. As you look at this report --",

You know, like, they say Uvalde -- I keep hearing that Uvalde is healing. That's what I'm hearing. Because there's murals that were painted. I mean, you talk to the families, you listen to that podcast, you don't hear that they're healing. How do they heal when the same people that were in there are running for sheriff? They're winning, winning elections. You know, it's a slap in the family's face. And how do we move forward, you know, when there's so much division? They need to come together. Uvalde needs to come together and support the families, not these officials who didn't do anything, the officials who let our children down.",

So I feel, yes, we, you know, we've lost friends or, you know, but I think we've gained more support and we continue to gain support. I just hope that people actually do the right thing.

Jean Carroll said on her -- on the stand that her status was, quote, \"lowered\" after suing Trump for denying that he raped her.In May, a federal civil jury found Trump sexually abused Carroll several decades ago. The judge here has already established that that is a fact. And the trial is now to determine how much the former president should pay Carroll, who's seeking more than $10 million in damages. Now, yesterday, the judge threatened to kick Donald Trump out of the courtroom for disruptive behavior. Today, Trump wasn't there. He's attending his mother-in-law's funeral in Florida. Let's get to CNN Correspondent Kara Scannell, who's been following all the twists and turns of this case. She's outside the federal courthouse in New York for us.

We're getting a look now at this new video where we can see a huge crater. Homes reduced to rubble after Pakistan says it launched retaliatory strikes overnight in Iran.Yesterday, Pakistani officials say an Iranian missile strike in Pakistani territory killed two children. Let's discuss what we are watching in the region now with Retired Navy Commander Kirk Lippold. Sir, thank you so much for being with us. You, of course, were the commanding officer of the USS Cole when the ship was bombed in October 2000 by al-Qaeda there in Yemen. And I know you're watching very carefully what's happening. Pakistan and Iran trading airstrikes in the wake of the terror attack that killed almost 100 people in Iran. Israel's fighting a war with Hamas as the Houthis are targeting shipping lanes and the U.S. is responding. How are you seeing these developments that are all happening at the same time even if, you know, some of them aren't exactly related? CMDR. KIRK LIPPOLD (RET.), FORMER COMMANDING OFFICER, USS COLE: Well, Brianna, first, thank you for having me on. And when you look at what is happening, go to the center of gravity for all the issues that are occurring, and it's Iran. Clearly, Iran is feeling rather emboldened throughout the region to be able to conduct the type of strikes. Now going into Pakistan, claiming that they're going after terrorists, a bit ironic when you really think about it, given that they're the number one state sponsor of terrorism. But when you look at what is happening with Yemen and the Houthi rebels disrupting maritime shipping in the Red Sea, I would look at the area between Iran and Pakistan right now, that may have been just a simple exchange. I don't foresee that really expanding much beyond that. They're kind of sending a signal to each other that, hey, get your little terrorist groups that hate each other's countries, get them under control, tell them to stop any cross border incursions. But I don't think you're going to see a continuing expansion of the conflict in that area.",

We want to make sure that we completely cut off that illicit supply of arms. But it's going to take a lot more than the United States. We don't have the naval forces in the region to be able to sustain that large of an interdiction operation. And we should, in fact, expand it along with our allies that could include the U.K., the Netherlands and other nations that are working with us in that Operation Prosperity Guardian.",
