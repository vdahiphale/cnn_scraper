The criminal hush money trial of former President Donald Trump has wrapped up for the week. On Monday, we expect to hear from Trump's former fixer and lawyer, Michael Cohen. They worked together for years. But we do want to begin this hour with straining ties between Israel and the U.S. An Israeli official says the nation's security cabinet has now approved an expansion of its military operation in Rafah. This comes just a day after U.S. President Joe Biden told CNN America would halt weapons shipments to Israel if the Israeli military invades the southern Gazan City. Benjamin Netanyahu responded to that threat on an American talk show today, insisting that the operation will go on as planned and Israel will stand alone if necessary. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Officials estimate nearly 110,000 people have escaped the southern Gazan city since Monday. But many hundred thousands more remain.The U.N. General Assembly has passed a resolution calling on the Security Council to reconsider Palestinian membership in the U.N. Israel's foreign minister condemn that decision, calling it absurd. Let's bring in CNN international diplomatic editor, Nic Robertson. So, Nic, we're learning that Israel's security cabinet has approved expanding the military operation in Rafah. This follows the U.S. president saying the U.S. would not provide weapons if that operation goes forward. I know that some Israeli officials are playing down the size of this operation, but it's hard not to see this as a direct defiance of the U.S. president. Is it?",

      "sentences": "Yeah, you can parse the words, whether this is an operation or a full-blown operation. And we won't know until -- until it happens. I think what we're witnessing on the ground as Israel as certainly poised and ready. It has already told Palestinians to move from the eastern parts of Rafah. It already has what it calls one of the hospitals, the principal hospitals to shutter its doors and move out.The population is moving. So, some of the conditions on the ground that you would expect before -- before a larger offensive have happened. And I think a couple of other key details to look at here, last weekend before the IDF actually went into the Rafah area and drop those leaflets, literally the day before Hamas fired a bunch the rockets at Kerem Shalom, they killed at least three soldiers. That really, you know, was assigned for the military, if you're poised to go into Rafah, you can't really hang around. And I think for those troops that are in there, the government is now in the military is caught in a tough place, either you reverse and get out, or you move ahead and they have a very big deployment of military hardware now at the Rafah border crossing, just inside of Israel. And I think look at what happened this afternoon. Beersheba, right 30 miles from Rafah, IDF says nine rockets were fired by Hamas from the Rafah area to Beersheba. Sirens went off there twice. This hasn't happened in months. One lady was lightly injured, one of the rockets was intercepted, four others landed, one of them landed in a children's play park area. If you're the IDF and you're looking at what Hamas is doing in Rafah, that looks tantamount to goading the IDF to push in and expand those operations.",

Well, now, to Capitol Hill here in Washington, where a highly anticipated report on Israel's conduct, military conduct in Gaza could be delivered to Congress as soon as today. This according to CNN contributor, Axios political reporter Barak Ravid. The State Department's report is expected to stop short of declaring Israel in violation of terms of use for U.S. weapons during this seven-month long and ongoing wars. CNN international security correspondent Kylie Atwood joins us now. Kylie, do we know whether the report has reached a conclusion? And do we know why it's been delayed?",

      "sentences": "Well, we do know that it is really close to being finished here, Jim. We are expecting it to be sent to the Hill as soon as today, but definitely in the coming days. NSC's John Kirby was just asked by a reporter at the White House about the delay here and he said that it has nothing to do with a nefarious effort to try and hide the report are trying to make it harder for us to report on.He says it has to do with the spade work going into making sure that this report is taken seriously and done in a fulsome way. So we'll watch and see when we actually get the report. But as you said, our colleague or contributor Barak Ravid has gotten us ahead of the report in such that he is reporting that it's found that Israel did not actually violate U.S. terms of use for us weaponry. Of course, that weaponry that they're getting from the United States, its being used to continue the war in Gaza to go after Hamas, that Israel has been carrying out since October 7th. So that would lead us to believe that the report doesn't find that Israel violated international humanitarian law. And that is what this report has to determine. The other thing that it has to make a determination over is whether Israel impeded the delivery of humanitarian support into Gaza. And that's another key one, Jim, because we've heard from U.S. officials sort of trying to have it both ways saying that Israel needs to be doing more, but they have been making some progress. Well, this is a report that requires a determination to be made at specific moments throughout the course of the last few months here, not just a final declaration of where Israel stands right now, but was there any moment in time where they were impeding that humanitarian aid from getting into Gaza. We'll have to watch and see when this report actually gets out to Congress and his briefed here to us.",

Jessica Schneider joins me now. So, Jessica, tell me how prosecutors today and prior today of set the stage and effect from Michael Cohen. Yeah. They had to lay a lot of the groundwork throughout this testimony that we've heard. But in particular today, I mean, we heard from representatives from Verizon, from AT&amp;T, from the D.A.'s office, just talking about records, whether they were phone records or whether they were tweets or other text messages that they had subpoenaed all to get them into the record and presumably, when Michael Cohen takes the stand on Monday, beginning on Monday, it's supposed to be several days likely, they will be able to then take that evidence that they already got admitted into evidence.

But in fact, once you're gone, that could happen. And we could have seen that some 50 years ago with Richard Nixon, had it not been for Gerald ford pardoning him? The other choice they have is to the idea that if he does something in the furtherance of his office, it's a violation of the law. He's immune from prosecution for doing that act. Those are the two choices that they seem to be working out between them. I happen to agree with Kaitlan that the case in D.C. is still on for -- in my thought process, still on a semi front burner. It depends on when they make their decision and how quickly Judge Chutkan can finally reach a trial date. His defense team has refused to file anything with the court claiming there's a stay the state prevents the court from doing anything, doesn't prevent people from filing things, and she has tried to encourage them to file their motions. She's going to force that to happen as quickly as she can and then rule summarily on most of those motions in anything that needs a hearing will get a very quick hearing. I think you could see a trial date by the third week of August. And that case shouldn't take more than three to four weeks to try. So I think Kaitlan is on the right track there.",
