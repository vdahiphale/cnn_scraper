We will have much more coverage on the release of these American prisoners throughout the day on CNN. And next hour, I'll be speaking to Richard Ratcliffe, the husband of Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe about just what these families might be experiencing today. But for now, these are some of the other international stories were following this hour. Libya is in the middle of a full-blown humanitarian disaster after deadly flooding decimated the city of Derna just over a week ago. It's still unknown exactly how many people died when flood water swept entire neighborhoods out to sea. The United Nations has revised a previous death toll of more than 11,000 down to nearly 4,000 lives lost. That's the figure the World Health Organization is reporting. More than 9,000 people are still missing. Our Jomana Karadsheh is in Libya, and joins us now live from Derna. Jomana, good to have you there for us. So, there is certainly has been some confusion of the death toll from the numbers we're getting from the United Nations. If you can give us some clarity as to what you're seeing and hearing on the ground, Jomana.",

Thanks so much. We have much more news still to come, including Ukraine, pressing ahead with its counter offensive. We're going to go live to the region is where they are seeing some of the heaviest fighting. Plus, dozens of world leaders, a high stakes summit, and a huge list of global challenges. We'll get the latest as the United Nations General Assembly kicks off in New York. (COMMERCIAL BREAK)",

While on the frontlines, the fighting continues near Bakhmut, near a village that Ukraine claims to have retaken last week. Ukrainian defense official says 300 square kilometers were \"liberated\" over the summer. There are also reports of blasts near local government headquarters in the Russian-held parts of Ukraine's Donetsk region. I want to go live to CNN senior international correspondent Frederik Pleitgen for the latest on all of this. Fred, Ukraine is saying, obviously, it's retaking more territory both in the east and in the south as part of this counter offensive. What are the details?",

Good to have you on the ground there in Ukraine.As Fred was saying, dozens of world leaders, of course, are gathering this hour at the United Nations General Assembly in New York. They are facing a huge list of global challenges, including the devastating floods in Libya and Russia's war in Ukraine. And it is a job made harder by the fact that key players are skipping this year's summit, including China, Russia, the U.K. and France. U.S. President Joe Biden will be attending, as well, Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who is appearing in person for the first time. Well, CNN's Richard Roth is in New York and is covering it for us. Richard, good to have you. So, let's just start with Zelenskyy. What are we expected to hear from him?",

I think the personal bilaterals, the one-on-one meetings that take place during the building during UNGA, as it's known, will be more effective, perhaps. And also, the Washington visits speaking to Congress and to President Joe Biden. I mean, Biden may run into him here, something plan a few pleasantries, but the bigger meeting is Thursday. It's rare that we've had a big war involving one of the permanent five members of the Security Council, and yet, things roll on with the U.N. General Assembly taking place. A lot of other issues, as you pointed out. The fact that the four leaders of those countries: China, Russia, France, the U.K. are not here doesn't mean that the U.K. or France efforts are minimal. I mean, they have their high-level people here during the week.",

The long-awaited freedom for five U.S. citizens who were detained for years in Iran. They are scheduled to arrive in Qatar any minute now in a complex deal that includes the release of five Iranian nationals detained in the U.S. Video from Iranian state media is set to show them boarding their plane in Tehran bound for Doha. The deal includes the transfer to Qatar of $6 billion in Iranian funds that had been frozen in bank accounts in South Korea. White House National Security Council coordinator John Kirby spoke to CNN's Kate Bolduan last hour about what the prisoner release means going forward. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Well, look, we are still going to deal withIran's destabilizing behaviors, we've added to the military presence in the Gulf region, we have continued to sanction Iran for other destabilizing activities, are still providing drones to Russia, for instance. They are still providing -- posing a threat to maritime shipping in the Gulf and the Strait of Hormuz, we're going to hold them accountable for all of that. I don't think we should look at this as some sort of confidence building measure to a better relationship with Iran. Now look, if Iran takes steps to destabilize -- to stop their destabilizing behavior and to behave as a better actor in the region, all that's to the good. But we secured this deal simply to secure this deal, to get these five Americans home. It was not orchestrated as some way of reproach -- a rapprochement. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

You know, five prisoners being released from U.S. jails, Iranians. Two of them want to stay in the United States, one will be relocated to a third country with his family, only two of those five have opted to go back to Iran, the five that are being released. Now, we only know the names of three of them, two of them, their families don't want them to be identified. But the expectation is that they will move very quickly from Doha back to the United States. But for Doha, it's played a huge role. Eight rounds of negotiations and talks to get to this point being the middleman the intermediary between Iran and the United States. And as we heard from John Kirby there, the mission for the United States was to get these five people home. The mission for Iran is to try to lead alleviate some of their very pressing economic -- the very pressing economic needs that they have at home. And that's witnessed in the amount of, you know, the amount of anger that's being expressed on Iran's streets by protesters protesting Mahsa Amini's killing and the killing of so many other people over the past year. So, there is real need in Iran to have access to these funds. And that's been part of the leverage, if you will, what the Qataris have been able to sort of dangle as the carrot for the Iranians in this whole deal. And they do seem to be very much motivated by money as they have. But as they have done in the past, the releasing of Nazanin Zaghari- Ratcliffe got the Iranians access to 450 million pounds of, of money that had been spent by the Shah of Iran on British tanks. That was a quid pro quo there, if you will. And then, and Jason, who was released with four others that were $400 million of armaments funding restored to the Iranian. So, there is always been a work around with the money on the Qataris here. And you see their plane landing on the ground there. That has come from to come from Tehran. The Qataris have been using their diplomatic skills, have been able to work out the nuance and the detail to make sure that both sides got something.",
