That's in response, they say, to a rocket attack in northern Israel. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ANDERSON (voice-over):  You see the aftermath of that attack here. The IDF says the rocket was fired from Lebanon. First responders say one person was killed; at least eight others are injured. Meantime, there is fear and panic in Rafah, Palestinians forced to flee there, bracing for a threatened Israeli ground offensive that the U.N.'s relief chief says could lead to, and I quote him here, \"slaughter.\" And families of hostages still held in Gaza and survivors of the October 7th terror attacks are at The Hague today to urge the International Criminal Court to file arrest warrants for Hamas leaders. And Jeremy Diamond is there at The Hague, back with us this hour. Nic Robertson is in Tel Aviv and, Nic, we will start with you. What more can you tell us about this rocket attack in northern Israel?

Their allegations draw on a body of testimony and evidence. Everything relating to the kidnapping of their loved ones but also, of course, the killings and the sexual violence that took place on October 7 and since. And so these families have come here, urging the prosecutor of the International Criminal Court to file charges against Hamas' top leaders. On the flight that we just took from Tel Aviv to here, Flight 131, which was named for the 131 days of captivity that the hostages who still remain in Gaza have endured. I spoke with several of these family members. And what they told me is that on the one hand, they are looking for justice. They are looking for accountability. They hope that Prosecutor Khan of the ICC will indeed use the evidence that they have presented to file charges against Hamas' leaders. But beyond that, they are also hoping that the world doesn't forget what has happened to their loved ones. And they're also hoping to build pressure not only on Hamas with the hope that sanctions could soon follow on these leaders beyond this ICC filing. But also of course, on their own leaders and on leaders around the world, who are working to try and negotiate a potential ceasefire in exchange for the release of hostages. We know that those negotiations have been taking place. They have been progressing in recent weeks. But all of that, of course, as far too slow for these families, who have waited an agonizing 131 days for their loved ones, unsure of their circumstances, unsure of their fate. And so certainly they are hoping that this today will call attention to their plight  and pressure the negotiating table, including Israeli leaders, to make a deal.",

You can access the newsletter by scanning the QR code on the bottom of your screen. Actually not sure that it is there. But you can also find information on that newsletter on your CNN app. Well, there is growing panic in Rafah as desperate Palestinians, over 1.3 million, more than half of Gaza's population there, are left with nowhere to go as their last refuge could become the focus of Israel's next ground attack. A number of international organizations pleading with Israel not to launch a ground offensive, including from the World Health Organization. It has repeatedly expressed concern about Israel's relentless bombardment of the Strip. And last month, the director general, Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, was visibly shaken at the U.N., describing, quote, \"hellish\" conditions in Gaza. I'm going to show you that moment.

As you know, more than28,000 deaths now and more than 70 percent are women and children. That alone is enough to stop the war. Because those who are dying are the wrong people, who haven't done anything to bring this problem. So the best solution for this is to find a political solution. I'm a strong believer that military intervention will not be a lasting solution. You know, you said earlier, I broke down in a U.N. meeting. The reason for that is my own experience. I know what the situation feels to be in that. I know the sound of guns, I know the smell of war and also what it looks like. I can feel in what situation the kids and the women are living in. If a military intervention cannot be a solution, and I say, the long term is political solution. I think Israel has to consider that very seriously because this is not for Palestinians. It's in the interest of Israel as well. I wish peace for the Israelis and for the Palestinians. They can live in peace side-by-side. I ask Israel again to make the right decision to find a political solution. All the distraction, for instance, you know about 50 percent of residents' units have been destroyed. And not just the 28,000 (INAUDIBLE) but if you take the missing close to 9,000 and the injured close to 70,000, more than 100,000 casualties, that's too much already to carry.",

The people living there of that nationality itself. But yes, there is a significance which goes beyond just the expat community. There was a moment they've been waiting for. We are told this is a temple, the first Hindu temple in Abu Dhabi that they wanted for awhile. Yesterday, Indian prime minister Narendra Modi, while addressing more than 40,000spectators who were at a stadium in Abu Dhabi to see him, he also mentioned to them that this was a proposal that he had put forward in 2015 that was accepted by the UAE. And 27 acres of land is what was given for this temple. It's built on a sprawling land donated by the UAE government. It's made of pink sandstone columns topped by seven spires representing the number of sheikhs that rule each of the Emirates. But also Becky, you'd know this as much as me or rather better than me in this case, that it may also signify how far the UAE has come in acknowledging its expat community, especially the Indian community in this case, which makes up such a huge and large population in the UAE. Along with that, it also perhaps signifies and indicates deepening ties between the UAE and India, especially under Modi's governance. We're talking about two nations. You mentioned how Modi, this is third visit in eight months. And that to an election year. Becky, how often do you see the prime minister of a country going into elections, moving away from his country and visiting another country just two or three months ahead of the elections? Well, talk about two that have had free trade deals since 2022, the bilateral trade ties amount to about $90 billion  between them. And also, you've seen what a big welcome he got from the UAE president. There was a guard of honor. They hugged. And he was also the guest of honor at the summit where you're at. So clearly this was a big moment, not only for the Indian expat community but also a way of sealing the already ongoing, healthy, robust ties between the two countries -- Becky.",

This is a major election year right around the corner. But you're right to point out, I think this is his seventh trip since becoming prime minister, third in the past year or less. So as I say, incredibly significant moment. Well, before we move on I want to bring up two images that show how, in spite of the conflicts raging in this region and beyond, many players are working to chart their own path. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ANDERSON (voice-over):  I want to bring back these images of the warm embrace between Narendra Modi and UAE president Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan. The Indian prime minister welcomed with the guard of honor on his third visit in less than eight months, a sign of that fast growing relationship between emerging powers of developing economic and political times, at a time of geopolitical upheaval. Remember the UAE has just joined the BRICS grouping, of which India is an incredibly important member. And another image of a new political reality emerging in this region and beyond, this Turkish President Erdogan, who was here in Dubai Tuesday, arriving in Cairo today to be met by Egyptian president Sisi, a first visit by a Turkish president after nearly a decade of fraught relations. Two significant moments in the region or the wider region from which I am reporting to you tonight. Well, Ukraine says it destroyed a Russian warship in the Black Sea earlier today. Nighttime video provided by Ukraine shows a sea drone racing toward the landing ship before a huge plume of smoke rose from the vessel. Kyiv claims it is now disabled. A third of Russia's Black Sea fleet with this latest attack, CNN let me tell you, cannot confirm the authenticity of these images and the Kremlin has declined to comment. Earlier in Brussels, NATO secretary general Jens Stoltenberg called Ukraine's recent gains a significant blow to Russia. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Sort of like if you were building cars and you use a giant factory, you need about 1 million square feet of assembly line space. Well, if you don't have a building that's large enough to fit that, then you need to set up part of the assembly line, tear it down over and over again. And that's slow and it takes a lot of time.
