And now we are hearing from Chinese leader Xi Jinping who is calling for all out efforts in the search and rescue after this devastating earthquake.There are a number of challenges, really three big challenges right now, infrastructure, communication as well as weather. Let's first talk about infrastructure. As we look at some of these pictures, you can see the damage is extensive, not only inside of businesses like that grocery store, but also on many of the roads. There is a tremendous amount of rubble and debris not only on highways but also many of the streets in these smaller villages. That certainly is going to make getting rescue workers as well as just general search and rescue efforts. It's going to make things very difficult. So that's one big challenge. Another issue is communication. In fact, we are getting reports that three villages have lost their phone signals. That's according to CCTV, which of course is China's broadcaster. And then there is of weather. It is wintertime, so by nature it's cold. And of course, nightfall still a few hours away. But that is going to add to the challenge. As leader Xi Jinping calls for the mobilization of resources, we are now getting reports from CCTV that four helicopters as well as hundreds of soldiers and military personnel are ready to deploy. A drone has also been made available. So as you can see from some of these pictures, it is it's going to take some time to get a full assessment to the scale of all of this. A lot of these areas are very remote. So that's why it's going to take some time. To give you some geography, this area where this happened (INAUDIBLE), it's about 100 miles away from the epicenter, but it is where there is a scenic area to view the iconic Mount Everest. That scenic viewing area has now been closed. It was closed about one hour after the quake first struck. And as far as reopening, not clear. A lot of people this time of year do try to make this expedition to Mount Everest. This is perhaps a time when conditions are favorable. We've been seeing reports on social media that a number of people have canceled their trips. So, Polo, hopefully we will get a better idea as to the size and scale of destruction. But as we have seen over the last few hours, the death toll has been rising. Many of these areas are very remote. And that is obviously adding a very big challenge as we piece together the story from here in Beijing. Polo.",

But last month, even Trudeau's finance minister and longtime ally Chrystia Freeland resigned from his Cabinet, leaving him on even shakier ground with a blunt resignation letter accusing the prime minister of using costly political gimmicks at the expense of Canada's fiscal health. Freeland added that the government needed to start pushing back against America first economic nationalism. A former high school teacher and the eldest son of Pierre Trudeau, one of Canada's most well-known prime ministers, Trudeau was elected three times. He became a poster child for the country's progressive agenda on the global stage, seen as antidote to Trump during the incoming U.S. President's first term. His government pursued policies on alleviating child poverty, gender equity, cutting middle class taxes and the legalization of cannabis. And while he was generally praised for his handling of the pandemic, voter sentiment has soured since, high inflation and affordable housing crisis and an increase in legal immigration have tested Trudeau's government.",

We don't know. I mean, it's conservative -- the leader of the Conservatives, Pierre Poilievre have talks a big line. We'll see. I mean, Canada is in a very, very weak position. The economy is heavily dependent on exports to the United States, oil and cars in particular. So any disruption of that could be crippling to the economy.

That would create a huge internal constitutional crisis with the provinces who prosper, whose budgets depend on those exports.

More than a month after signing a cease fire agreement, Lebanon says that Israeli forces are withdrawing from a key southern town. Just look at the region here. The Lebanese military says that it's now started to deploy its own forces there in coordination with the U.N. interim force in Lebanon, which is now monitoring the end of the hostilities in the region. The deal that ended the fighting between Israel and Hezbollah calls for the Iran-backed fighters to withdraw from south Lebanon, which Israel argues isn't happening fast enough.

It flows from Lebanon's Bekaa Valley through its rolling hills and into the Mediterranean, just a few kilometers from Israel's northern border.Now, this is also at the heart of a U.S.-brokered agreement designed to end the conflict that raged between Israel and Lebanon last fall, and to prevent another one from erupting. To the south of here, this is where Hezbollah has maintained a robust presence of Iran-backed fighters for more than 40 years, facing off with Israeli forces in and around the Lebanon-Israel border. But all of that is set to change dramatically if a fragile truce between Israel and Lebanon is to be maintained. Hezbollah has agreed to withdraw its forces to the north of this river, creating a de facto buffer zone with Israel. Hezbollah has about 20 more days to carry out its side of the bargain. Israel says this isn't happening fast enough, that Hezbollah is dragging its feet. And Israel has breached the agreement hundreds of times, mostly near the border, since the end of the war around 40 days ago. Israel is also meant to withdraw from Lebanon under the terms of the deal. Now, Israel is also threatening to pull out of the ceasefire agreement completely and to keep Israeli troops in Lebanon until further notice. It's an incredibly delicate phase that could trigger further violence or a lasting calm. And it could determine whether this river stands at the threshold of Lebanon's past or its future.
