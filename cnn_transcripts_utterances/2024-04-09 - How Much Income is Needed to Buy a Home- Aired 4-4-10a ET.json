It now leans at a four-degree angle, slightly more than the Tower of Pisa currently tilts. In 2023, scientists concluded the Garisenda was at high risk of collapsing and authorities temporarily closed off the streets around it. The city plans to use the same equipment used to save the Tower of Pisa for this 20- million-dollar multiyear restoration project. (END VIDEO CLIP)",
