This just days before the 2024 election. Former President Donald Trump escalating his violent rhetoric against one of his chief critics, Liz Cheney. Here's what he said last night about the former Republican congresswoman.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: She's a radical war hawk. Let's put her with a rifle standing there with nine barrels shooting at her. OK. Let's see how she feels about it. You know, when the guns are trained in her face. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

But the Trump campaign is pushing back, not necessarily responding to the direct substance of the violence of the rhetoric, but to the broader comment about wars.And this has been sort of a subtext of his pushback against Liz Cheney overall. Of course, Donald Trump very angry that Liz Cheney, a prominent Republican, is campaigning on behalf of Kamala Harris and leading a movement. We don't know the size of the movement, Republicans for Harris. But the Trump campaign, a spokeswoman is telling CNN this. She said President Trump was clearly explaining that warmongers like Liz Cheney are very quick to start wars and send other Americans to fight in them rather than go to combat themselves. Of course, Donald Trump did not serve in the military. He was indeed of the era where he could have, but did not for a variety of reasons. So that is a bit hollow in and of itself. But Jim, when you step back, it is unknown if there will be any political fallout from this. The outrage has sort of hit a ceiling, is my sense, when you talk to voters. But that does not make it any less jarring in the course of our history, just a few days before an election to have a former commander-in-chief who's vying to be the next commander-in-chief talking like this about a former congresswoman.",

I think people hear that and they are exhausted.People are tired of all the fighting for eight years that this guy has generated. I think that hopefully there are enough Americans, even if they're undecided, who at the end of the day say, I just don't want to go through four more years of that kind of division, that this country's got bigger things to do, that we can unite and that they're going to support Kamala Harris.",
