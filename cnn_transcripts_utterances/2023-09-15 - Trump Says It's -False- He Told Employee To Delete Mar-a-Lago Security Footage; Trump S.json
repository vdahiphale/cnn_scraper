The only time we have seen him, as far as I can remember, actually testify under oath has been when he was deposed and forced to do so.So it doesn't seem likely that he would testify under oath, and again, that his lawyers would allow it. And one thing I want to point to in that sound, he talks about how those were his tapes, that he didn't have to turn them over. I do want to remind viewers that there was a federal subpoena multiple for those surveillance tapes. So this idea that he didn't have to cooperate, that is part of why he was in trouble in the first place. And he also mentioned another legal gray area that I thought was very interesting. He was asked about whether or not he would pardon himself if reelected to president and he didn't rule it out completely. And he also said this wasn't the first time he had discussed pardoning himself looking back to 2020. Listen to this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

The tropical storm force winds extend about 300 bucks from the center. And so, you are going to feel those tropical storm force conditions across the Cape and eastern Massachusetts. So we are going to look at the storm passing to the east, just offshore, possibly making landfall across portions of Nova Scotia and then head to the north racing. But we are going to see some really heavy rainfall across eastern Massachusetts main as this storm continues to the north. So it is a fast moving storm, but it is going to pack a bit of a punch. We're going to see anywhere from, say, 2 to 4 inches of rain, especially across eastern Maine. Eastern Massachusetts, we're looking at about 1 inch or 2 inch of rain. But again, I think the wind is going to be the biggest thing with those power outages, taking those -- some of those trees down here.

He's on trial in this particular case for 16 of the 20 articles of impeachment. Now each side has one hour to present their closing arguments to the state senators and after that, the deliberations will begin, and this is where, the math kicks off.

Everyone I've been talking to over the last few weeks here in Austin really has no idea how this is going to play out. And remember, we talked about 30 senators making this vote.
