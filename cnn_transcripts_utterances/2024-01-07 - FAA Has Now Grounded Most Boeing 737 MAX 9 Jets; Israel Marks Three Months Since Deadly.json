But yes, you do seem to have failures when planes are brand-new and when they get very old. So it's not surprising.And there was some talk about the fact that they were having problems pressurizing this aircraft. This particular vehicle apparently may have had some kind of leak. Now, the NTSB will have to carefully determine whether or not this leak was around that plugged door or not. That door can be opened by mechanics from the outside. Obviously, it's not intended to be opened from the inside. But we were sure lucky that this happened at a lower altitude and nobody was sitting in the two seats directly adjacent to that plugged door.",

And I thought the chair did a great job of asking the public to look for it. She didn't say this, but we sometimes tell the people, do not move it, do not bring it to the NTSB, leave it in place and photograph it, call the police, they'll call the board.But in any case, they want to find the complete picture. To do that, the missing piece of the puzzle is that door that was ejected. Now, they know approximately where it went down, they think. So I think they'll have that. How was it manufactured? You know, I've talked about a leak in the aircraft after it was delivered to Alaska. But this aircraft was -- that fuselage, rather, and door was made in Wichita, Kansas, by an outfit called Spirit. It used to be part of Boeing, it's a subcontractor now. So, they'll want to go back and look at the assembly process and the parts. Every once in a while so-called bogus parts sneak into the inventory. These are parts that aren't FAA certified. I'm not suggesting that happened here. But the NTSB is very methodical, and they eliminate everything that didn't happen so they can focus on what did happen. So this is going to be perhaps weeks, months, maybe a year or so before the final report is issued. But if they find anything significant, they'll immediately educate and announce to the airlines, the FAA, and the world what they found. So, not to worry. People shouldn't panic. I wouldn't be afraid to get on a 737 MAX tomorrow. Because they're going to thoroughly look at these aircraft. I know the secretary of transportation and the FAA has pushed that agenda forward with an emergency airworthiness directive which requires inspection. So this is going to be a process that will take days, maybe weeks. But we've got to keep in mind, this is a very safe system.",

They have a long history of engineering excellence. A lot of people point out, in recent years, they've become very financially driven. And a lot of people thought that the 737 MAX should have been replaced with a new so-called clean sheet design. But the new regulated airline and manufacturing world, bottom line is everything. So I think the executives at Boeing decided, we can stretch this airplane one more time and do it safely. Clearly, they were wrong with what happened in Indonesia and Ethiopia. And there was another incident just recently where they found a loose bolt on a rudder connecting rod, which is kind of scary. The nut hadn't fallen off. Excuse me, the loose nut -- the bolt hadn't fallen off. This could be a quality control problem at Boeing and at their subcontractor.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is making it clear he has no intention of stopping the ongoing military campaign in Gaza. He says Israel must keep going until it achieves its main objectives, which include eliminating Hamas, rescuing the remaining hostages, and making sure Gaza is no longer a threat, in his words.On the ground, the military claims results are showing the IDF says it finished dismantling what it called the Hamas military framework in Northern Gaza, and it's now focusing on the central and the southern parts of the enclave. But local health officials say Palestinians are paying a heavy price. More than 120 people have been killed in Israeli strikes since Friday. That's bringing the total to well over 22,000, according to Gaza's health ministry, which is run by Hamas. The ministry does not distinguish between combatants and noncombatants but has said about 70 percent of the dead are women and children. CNN cannot independently confirm those numbers. The top U.S. diplomat is pressing ahead with his whistle stop tour in the region, aiming to prevent the war from spreading.

A source familiar with the matter tells CNN that national security adviser Jake Sullivan briefed President Biden on the issue after he himself had learned about the hospitalization on Thursday afternoon. The Pentagon did not publicly disclose Austin's hospitalization until Friday.They then revealed he had entered Walter Reed Medical Center after an elective medical procedure, and he had experienced some complications. He stayed there throughout the week and remains there at this time. The Pentagon has not provided much information about how serious this matter was, but they did say that Deputy Defense Secretary Kathleen Hicks did assume some of the duties and responsibilities of the defense secretary while he was there. The defense secretary, Lloyd Austin, did assume full duties over the weekend. He released a statement saying that he is on the mend and is looking forward to returning to the Pentagon. But he did address some of these transparency issues with not disclosing the fact that he was in the hospital much sooner. He wrote in the statement, quote, I also understand the media concerns about transparency, and I recognize I could have done a better job ensuring the public was appropriately informed. I commit to doing better. He added: But this is important to say, this was my medical procedure, and I take full responsibility for my decisions about disclosure. Now, his hospitalization comes at an important time as the U.S. is still grappling with Russia's war in Ukraine and also the conflict in the Middle East between Israel and Hamas. There are also greater concerns about that conflict spreading and becoming a wider regional issue. So still many questions remain about what exactly sent Austin to the hospital and why he waited so long to disclose this, not just to the public but to President Biden.

ASSOCIATE FELLOW IN INTERNATIONAL SECURITY STUDIES, RUSI:  Good morning. Yes, indeed. I think the efforts for bringing this conflict to an end sort of skipped to the end of it and trying to look beyond. I think this is entirely regrettable, quite frankly. It's very clear in terms of Israel's plans for moving forward, they don't really see much need to think about the day after. And they are far more intent on prosecuting the war. And they are very clear that, in spite of international public opinion demanding a cease-fire as a result of so many civilian casualties in Gaza, as a result of the Israeli strikes, they will not listen unless United States engages in a far more serious fashion. And what we've seen so far is shuttle diplomacy, but also awareness on the Israeli side that the United States won't do more than simply talk. There's no suggestion, for example, that there will be the halting of arms or the reduction of aid or anything that is substantive enough that will hold the Israelis back from not only prosecuting this war further in Gaza, but also risking the regionalization of it and the spreading of it to places like Lebanon and elsewhere.

They don't want the displacement of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians from Gaza into Sinai and elsewhere, which is what many Israeli officials have been talking about for months now. They don't want any of that.The question is, what they're going to actually do about it. And if the Israelis take seriously that they're going to do something about it. Otherwise, we see a scenario where, unfortunately, hundreds of thousands of Palestinians are forced out of Gaza itself. Not simply out of their homes in Gaza. Your reporters, I'm sure, have already seen that more than 70 percent of people's homes in Gaza have either been destroyed or damaged, and they can't live in them anymore. That sort of scenario where they're actually forced to leave Gaza altogether, either by force the displacement or by making the Gaza strip so incredibly uninhabitable, people will do anything to leave, to escape the bombing, the starvation, the humanitarian crisis that you alluded to. And then looking at the West Bank, which is not so far away, the Israelis have been displacing scores of Palestinians in the occupied West Bank, much as they have been doing for many years now, and making the prospect of any type of two-state solution a complete pipe dream. And again, if we're looking for solutions for regional stability to actually be real, we need to do a lot more when it comes to bringing this conflict to a close, in terms of an immediate cease-fire, and seeing forward a political solution that is actually durable and sustainable.
