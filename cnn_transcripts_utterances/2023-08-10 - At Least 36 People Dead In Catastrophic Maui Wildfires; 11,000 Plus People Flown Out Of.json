And it is really the epicenter right now. Airlines are adding flights. In fact, this is the latest from Hawaiian Airlines. They've added four flights today, after adding nine flights yesterday. In some cases, airlines are doing something called up gauging meaning swapping out smaller planes that would typically be on a route with larger planes to get more people and more seats headed off of the island.In fact, Hawaiian Airlines has even started adding $19 fares to try and incentivize people to leave. The big question now is how to deal with people coming in. And you mentioned United and American Airlines, they have canceled their flights on to the island. That is a big deal because some of those flights are nonstops from places as far away as Chicago, Denver, LAX. The head of transportation on Hawaii -- at Hawaii, his name is Ed Sniffen, he says that right now the best thing that's happening is that airlines are waiving their fees, meaning that if you had a trip to Hawaii, to Maui, you can change your trip free of charge, no change fees on pretty much every major airline that flies to Maui and he says, I want you to listen now that it is helping people although the island will be open for business again soon, he insists.

And it -- you know, it -- it keeps the court system moving, you know, instead of doing one off cases, so that is -- that is the preferred methodology, that does not appear to have been an option for the Special Counsel's office. But for the DA in Fulton County, she has, you know, again, she has the luxury of a bit more time. This one is, you know, sequence and sequences last in time. And given the number of defendants and the complexity of the charges. It surely will be last or you know, should come later in -- in the timing of all of these court cases that the former President is trying to juggle.

But here there's even more pressure if they are named and indicted, co-defendants, there's -- there's always that pressure and surely, you know, as with any RICO style charges, there are going to be leaders, they're going to be middleman, they're going to be, you know, kind of the lower level, folks.
