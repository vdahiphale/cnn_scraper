And we are following breaking news on what the IDF calls a precise and targeted operation that puts Al-Shifa hospital now in his crosshairs. Al-Shifa is Gaza City's largest medical facility. It is also what the Israelis say is a base of operations for Hamas terrorists. That's an assessment that is also endorsed earlier today by American intelligence. Now, before tonight, that hospital already resembled hell on earth, with no fuel, no power, little medicine, no anesthesia and thousands of patients. Doctors tell CNN that can hear armored vehicles but are unsure right now if soldiers have penetrated the hospital perimeter. We'll start first with CNN's Jeremy Diamond in Sderot. Jeremy, we've heard a lot from the IDF over the past few hours. What do you understand is the objective right now of this dramatic offensive into Al-Shifa?",

      "sentences": "Well, Abby, we have been watching for weeks now as the Israeli military has been laying the groundwork to target Al-Shifa Hospital. They have claimed for weeks that Hamas operates a large command and control center below the hospital's grounds, and tonight, we're learning that the IDF is carrying out what they are calling a precise and targeted cooperation on at least one part of the Al-Shifa complex.You can hear explosions behind me, though, happening in the northern part of Gaza, further away from Al-Shifa Hospital, indicating a fighting still happening there. But what the IDF is saying is that they are carrying out this operation based on intelligence and operational necessity. They say that their forces include personnel with medical teams and with Arabic language speakers as well in order to try and avoid civilian harm. Hamas, for its part tonight, rejecting once again this accusation that it is operating out of hospitals, and it also, interestingly, blames not only Israel but also the United States for what it says is giving Israel the green light to conduct this operation by endorsing what it is calling a false narrative about its presence in hospitals. Indeed, earlier today, the White House national security spokesperson, John Kirby, saying that United States does believe that Hamas operates and underground facilitate below Al-Shifa hospital and that it may be holding hostages there as well. In fact, that is something that an IDF spokesperson tonight very strongly hinted at, saying that there may be hostages there, potential hostages at this hospital. It's not clear whether this operation is designed to extract those hostages from that hospital, if indeed they are here. But he did say this is a very complex operation, made more complex by the fact that we know that thousands of people are still at this hospital, including patients and staff, but also thousands of people who are displaced and sheltering on the hospital grounds. Earlier today, a doctor telling CNN that tanks were spotted at the facility, gunfights could be heard in the yard, and, clearly a very precarious situation for the people who are there. Abby?",

And this really does seem to be kind of the heart of the tunnel network. It is so dense right here.Do you think that when they say there is an operational necessity here, you heard Jeremy lay out some possibilities perhaps that there are hostages there, perhaps there is a command center there, what do you think is the most critical thing for the IDF to take out in this moment? PLITSAS: So, if they're operating on active intelligence, right, I think you mentioned a couple of logical possibilities. If it's time sensitive, it's likely that there're hostages potentially there, that they're acting on it. The command center has been known and speculated for a very long time but the Israelis have been in the area within a couple of hundred meters for a few days, so they've lost the element of surprise. Hamas will know that they're in the area and that this is eventually going to happen. So, it's a good possibility that Hamas may have cleared out, used the tunnels to move to other locations, but what they'll still find, if that's the case, if everything the intelligence holds up, will be a command center which will then lend credence to the stipends that Hamas has been using the hospitals and civilians as human shields. And as you saw, they already started getting on offensive information, operations-wise, and went after the Israelis and the Americans saying that they're responsible for what happened as opposed to them having a command center underneath a hospital.",

That testimony today was grisly, graphic and harrowing. But the culture of vengeance and punishment did not come overnight. It came because Trump ushered it in. And, listen, politicians before Trump, as you just said, were not always nice. They're not always angels. In fact, there were times were there was actual violence in the Capitol.

And what we learned was that in these insulin deserts, which by the way you see a high prevalence of in the south and the southeast. But you see them all across the country from Utah to New Jersey to Texas. These are folks who are likely to be uninsured, but not only uninsured, but below the poverty rate. They are likely not to have much education beyond a high school degree or no education beyond high school and they don't have access to the internet or very little access to the internet. And so, they're literally cut off. And what the report shows is that in spite of the progress that we've made, I'm proud of the fact that my insulin provision that we passed last year caps the cost of insulin. For folks on Medicare to know more than $35 of out-of-pocket costs. I think folks in the corporate sector, as we have pushed them, have begun to put some caps in place, but they can rescind them at any time.

We've got both senators from Alabama, Tuberville, and Britt. There is a bipartisan path to getting this done, because all of us, especially in the South, are feeling the impact of unmanaged diabetes. We know the impact that this has not only on individuals, but on our overall health care system, $1 out of $4. And our health care system is spent on people with diabetes.
