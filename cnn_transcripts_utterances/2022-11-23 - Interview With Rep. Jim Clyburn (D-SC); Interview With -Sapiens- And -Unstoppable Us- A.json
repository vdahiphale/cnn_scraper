So, let me ask you then, you say, put politics -- put people over this kind of politics and partisan debate. And let's not forget that the majority of the American people support the kind of gun control that has been proposed, sensible gun control of all parties. The majority of American people overwhelmingly support it. But, do you think there will be gridlock? I kind of asked you that before because the Republicans have already indicated that they intend to go political. They want to bring up, let's say, rather than gun safety, Hunter Biden. They want to bring up certain, you know, go for impeachments and this and that. Do you foresee that that will be a sensible track for the Republican leadership?",

She's leaving our party in a very good place. We defied all expectations in this recent election. And laws are managing because we stayed the course. People can't tell us that people are not interested in maintaining democracy. They're only interested in cheaper gasoline at the pump and a cheaper loaf of bread. Now, people who are in democracy will then fetch to purchase groceries and to afford to buy gasoline.

We have scientific knowledge. We also have economic resources. It's estimated that if we invest about two percent of global GDP in developing the right technology and infrastructure, we can prevent catastrophic climate change. Now, two percent of global GDP is a lot of money, but it's completely feasible. It's what politicians do all the time, shifting resources from here to there. Again, it's a question of motivation. Do people have the political motivation to do it? And also -- you know, we now see the World Cup in Qatar. And for me the World Cup, despite, you know, all the criticism, it's a -- is very positive sign, that look, people can agree on something globally. You know, with all the criticism that we hear about globalism, if you like the World Cup, you're a globalist, because the World Cup is really globalism in action. Globalism doesn't mean the establishment of some dictatorial global government that forces us to do things we don't want. It simply means that different countries can reach agreement on common rules of how to behave. You know, for Brazil to play football against Germany, first of all, Brazilians and Germans need to agree on some common rules. It doesn't mean they are not patriotic. It doesn't mean they still share the national team. They're still fiercely patriotic, but this patriotism can go hand in hand with agreeing with the other countries on common rules.

Israeli police say that what happened was two bags were placed, one at each of these bus stops in hidden areas. They say that they were packed with things like nails and ball bearings, and that they were actually detonated remotely by cell phone, they believe. And they believe that they were detonated in order to cause maximum harm. One Canadian Israeli teenager, a 15-year-old was killed in that first initial bombing, and more than 14 have been injured.

What are you seeing right now when it comes to cases of RSV? DR. DANIEL RAUCH, CHAIR, AMERICAN ACADEMY OF PEDIATRICS COMMITTEE ON HOSPITAL CARE: We are seeing more than we have ever seen before. We are absolutely swamped with kids who are getting this. And the age distribution is a little bit different from prior years. We are seeing more older toddlers and preschoolers than the typical age group which are infants.",

In most people it causes just cold symptoms, upper airway congestion, snotty nose. The problem with little infants is that they breathe through their nose, they're obligate nasal breathers. So, if they get cold and congestion, it's hard for them to breathe. The other problem is it does crawl down into the lungs and causes damage to the lining of the lungs, which is where you change oxygen and carbon dioxide. So, that's where it causes some significant breathing problems.",

RAUCH: It's bad. They're -- it's regularly now that there is not an available pediatric intensive care unit bed in all of New England. And we've called down in New York to see about availability. And we're ending up taking care of kids in our community settings and in our emergency rooms that typically would have been transferred to children's hospital or facilities that can do higher level of care. And our pediatric providers on the front line and the emergency medicine people and the nurses and the respiratory therapists are doing an unbelievable job in keeping these kids in the settings that they weren't used to having them and making sure that nothing bad happens to them. The question is, how long can they keep that up? Different from the initial COVID surge, this is hitting the whole country at once. So, I can't ask for help from providers from the south and the west and -- to come to the northeast now and then promise them that I'll return the favor later on in the year when it hits them, because it's hitting the whole country at once.",

What would that get you? What are the gaps that need to be filled? DR. RAUCH: So, we learned some things dealing with adults during COVID, that if you break down some barriers to providing care and community centers, like telehealth and credentialing issues and cross state issues, it improves the ability of people to share their expertise and to provide help. And we need to do that for our kids. We did it for our adults. A lot of those exceptions expired as the pandemic lessened a little bit, but we need to reinstate them to help our pediatric providers. It's challenging to be in a community health center or emergency room and be dealing with a kid who needs ICU level care and not have that available. And then not have anybody be able to talk to you because there's -- the people you normally call are across the state border and they're not licensed in your state, or they're not credentialed in your institution, or there's fear about malpractice issues. We need to break those barriers and make the care deliver easier.",

I mean, the -- you're asking for help that the beds are too full, that you're not able to find the kind of resources necessary, this seems pretty dire. DR. RAUCH: I agree. And as I said earlier, I'm scared for later in December, in January, in February when the staff just can't keep up this pace any longer. We can't make more people. We can make people more effective. So, again, the -- ask for the emergency declaration was to help people be more efficient in their care and to get help via other methods than people just physically showing up. But -- and hopefully, we will be able to figure out ways to extend the care that we deliver. People already being very resourceful in providing levels of care in emergency rooms and in community centers that they never did before.

RAUCH: So, it -- the infants who gets it, it suffers for two reasons, as I explained before, they're obligate nasal breathers. So, if you get all congested and you can't breathe through your nose, you can't feed, and it's hard to open your mouth to breath. They're also -- because they're younger and they're not as well developed, it's hard for them to cough and clear their lungs. It's hard for them to have the stamina to keep up breathing fast for hours and days, whereas your -- even the older child, your two-year-old typically do that and get through this without needing to be hospitalized.",

The things to worry about are if your child is having significant trouble breathing. There's nothing we can do for your child once they've been infected to stop the progression. So, unless your child needs intervention, keep them at home. You're better off at home. Your child's better off at home. Talk to your doctor about things you can do like cleaning out your child's nose and making it easier for them to breathe and feed.

RAUCH: It's another great question. Typically, the age range of asthma is older children, two and up. And the age range that gets affected by RSV is under two years old. And that's the surprise this season is we're seeing those older, two, three, four years old get this. And there is some overlap in symptoms and things that are going on between asthma and RSV. Certainly, if your child has any underlying illness, getting RSV can make it a little bit worse. And the RSV can be a little bit harder for them to fight off. So, if your child is that risk, then definitely speak to your health care provider.",

And communities of color, unfortunately. have very good reasons to be historically skeptical of the medical community and interventions that are suggested. Additionally, the closure of pediatric beds happens more in rural communities and lower socioeconomic stature communities. So, that getting to acceptable care is harder for people in those communities. And so, we need to do more to reach out to all the communities and explain to them, what to be worried about. When to bring your child in. And to get all the vaccines that are available to them.",

Is it even possible? DR. RAUCH: There are people working on a vaccine. One of the interesting things about RSV, in particular, is it doesn't promote a lot of immunity even from natural infection. So, your child could get RSV now and in March could get it again. That's how poor the immunity is and that's why we've struggled to get a good vaccine for this. I would tell people to get the other vaccines that are out there. It is worse to get RSV and another virus. The tripledemic that we're looking at now of RSV, flu, and COVID is what we were afraid of when COVID first hit. Thankfully, COVID doesn't seem to affect children as badly as it affects adults. And we didn't see bad flu season the last two seasons. The flu is bad in Australia this year, and that predicts a bad season, typically in the United States. And we're seeing spiking cases of flu now. And there's a vaccine for that starting at six months old. Similarly, get your kid protected against COVID, that vaccine also starts at six months old.",

I think this surge is going to continue through the winter. And we have a health care system for which the answer to surges is heroic efforts by people on the front line.

There's a lot of worried -- I don't want to say, well, but there's a lot of worry not sick enough to show up into the emergency room. Definitely call your health care provider. Your pediatrician or whoever else you are using for your child and run the symptoms by them. This is where a telehealth can really help because if someone can lay eyes on your child and help you through an exam in your home, you don't have to go anywhere. And they maybe able to reassure you enough that you're not going into the emergency room. We also need places that can see kids outside of the emergency room. A lot of pediatric practices limited their sick care visits during COVID and haven't ramped up again. And urgent care also, if there's a pediatrician available who is comfortable assessing your child can be another outlet rather than going to the emergency room.",

So, again, get your child vaccinated and get yourself vaccinated for everything that's available because vaccines work. That's not going to help you over this coming weekend. But you should do that anyway. Standard precautions are important. Wash your hands, wash your hands, wash your hands. Be careful what you touch. Wipe down surfaces that other people have touched. And don't think that just because the person next to you is going to look at you funny that you're doing something wrong. No, wipe things down. If you are going to be in crowded areas, you're going to be on an airplane, you're going to be in bus stations. Masks work. And they don't harm anybody. So, don't be afraid about wearing a mask. And lastly, if you've got the sniffles in a cold, I understand you want to see your family. But it's not fun to spread this stuff.
