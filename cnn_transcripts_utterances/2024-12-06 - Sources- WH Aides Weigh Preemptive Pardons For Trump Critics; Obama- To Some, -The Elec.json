First of all, my understanding of the pardon powers was to allow the President of the United States to put his heart into issues that have been handled only by the head.That is to say, when people are accused or even found guilty of having violated laws and have paid their debt to society and have come back into society making tremendous contributions, that they ought to be considered for forgiveness. And so I think that that's pretty much what it was originally planned to be. But over time, we have to take into consideration that today's processes in politics lend themselves to things like soundbites, to things that the media can sometimes be used in a way it is not intended to be used. If we look at just the press itself, the fourth estate, when we were talking about our government and the role that the press should play, I don't think anybody ever thought that we would one day embrace different sets of facts, alternative facts of what we're now calling it. And so this gives to a different environment. And so we have to use the pardon system or the clemency system to get everything in order to address the current situation that we live in.",

And he is paying a severe penalty because he's the president's son. Now, everybody that I've talked to say to me that this kind of offense has never gotten to this point for ordinary people. And so I'm convinced that were he not the president's son, that one mistake, which had no victim, the gun was never used. The gun was taken from him and thrown away.
