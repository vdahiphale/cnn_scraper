Ahead this week, a TikTok showdown between the lawmakers warning the popular social media app could compromise national security and the tens of millions of Americans who use TikTok every single day.A bill headed to the House floor for a vote this week would force the sale of TikTok, or if its parent company doesn't sell, would then ban the app in the United States. And to further complicate matters, the two men vying to be the next president are now on opposite sides of this bill. CNN's Manu Raju is on Capitol Hill to run us through what we can expect ahead this week. Manu?",

      "sentences": "TikTok may be one of the most popular apps in the country, but it's possible it could be banned in the United States. That's if a new bill that is steaming through the House ultimately becomes law. That piece of legislation would force the Chinese firm ByteDance to sell it. If it doesn't sell TikTok, then the popular app would no longer be allowed in the United States.This has wide support in the House, in fact, passing overwhelmingly 50 to 0 in the House Energy and Commerce Committee just last week. That is unusual. You rarely see that level of bipartisan support. And quickly after, the House Majority Leader Steve Scalise announced it would be on the floor of the House this week. So, it could certainly pass. Then it would go to the United States Senate, which would have to take up the bill, pass it, see if it passes the same version. Ultimately, see if it goes to the president's desk, and whether the president would sign the final version of that legislation into law, which the White House has indicated it does support this measure. Now, that doesn't mean that TikTok isn't trying to stop this legislation. In fact, they are trying to kill it. That's what the top Republican who chairs the Energy and Commerce Committee told me on Friday, that our office is being flooded with phone calls. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNKNOWN: Yes, we've been flooded with calls, record amounts of calls. Any member of the Energy and Commerce Committee that voted yesterday has been flooded. TikTok actually put up a notice where they blocked an individual to actually get on TikTok unless you called your member of Congress and told them not to vote for this legislation. But that's just an example of how they can manipulate data and influence Americans for their agenda. (END VIDEO CLIP) Now, the lawmakers are trying to force ByteDance to sell TikTok because they are worried, they say, about the Chinese government interfering in the popular social media app, taking data and the like on Americans' private information, and they're trying to stop them from doing that. TikTok has denied Chinese government interference in all of this, but that doesn't mean that it won't become law. We'll see how quickly the Senate would take it up after the House is expected to pass it later this week. The president did say, though, if they pass the bill that's before the House, he will sign it. Erika?",

So, when we look at this, I know you've said that you don't think TikTok should be banned. You do, however, support it being sold. So, what does that do in terms of your vote on this bill? Would you vote against it? REP. RO KHANNA (D-CA): Erika, I'm leaning to vote no. TikTok is a platform for 170 million Americans and many who are registering political dissent, both from the left and the right, calling for a better policy on Gaza, calling for affordable housing, saying members of Congress shouldn't trade stocks and get rid of money in politics.

These are offensive missiles that are being used by Netanyahu and extreme right-wing government to kill women and children, to kill over 30,000 Palestinians, many of them not Hamas, and to hit at certain times food convoys that are preventing aid from getting there. So, my hope is that the president can be very clear to say no offensive weapons.

And that's why we saw, you know, overnight, this very dramatic mission, a helicopter flown in under cover of darkness and non-essential U.S. diplomats pulled out of the country. And as well, additional security, U.S. Marines taken to Haiti to help guard the embassy and the remaining U.S. diplomats. It's gotten that dangerous that security needed to be increased. Other aid missions, other embassies also pulling their staff out. There are certainly not enough helicopters to get out. Everybody wants to leave at this point. You know, for the Haitians caught in the crossfire, the thousands, the tens of thousands perhaps, of Haitians caught in the crossfire, there is no chance of being evacuated. Many have had to flee from their homes, don't have any food. Aid agencies are not able to bring in the food because of the danger, because of the gang checkpoints. And it's been over a week since Ariel Henry has been prevented -- we believe he's in Puerto Rico at the moment -- prevented from returning to his country because the airport is closed.

President Biden had said yesterday that there was still a chance that a deal could be reached, pointing to the fact that the CIA director was in Israel talking to the head of Mossad. But the problem is that the Israelis and Hamas are not actually talking to each other.Hamas left Cairo, where the last round of talks was held. They left on Thursday. And the Israelis were never there at all, because they say that Hamas has not responded to its latest demands, which include some pretty basic stuff, like a list of hostages, which ones are alive and which ones are dead, something the Hamas says that they cannot provide. Hamas is also pretty firm in their position, saying that there cannot be a deal unless there is a permanent ceasefire and unless all Israeli troops are withdrawn from Gaza. Both of these things are going to be pretty difficult for Israel to agree to. They insist that the war will continue after hostages and prisoners are exchanged. And they also say that the day after this war actually ends, that IDF troops will have full reign to go wherever they want inside of Gaza. So, the hopes are not looking good. We just heard from the Hamas head, Ismail Haniyeh, who gave a televised address. He says that he is still open to talks. He is pointing the fingers at Israel, though. And he also says that no hostages will be released until there is a deal. And you mentioned, Erica, that the Israelis had threatened that there would be a ground incursion into Rafah by Ramadan, into Ramadan, if there was no hostages released. That has not happened. And so, this is where we're at. There's no imminent signs on the ground that there's any kind of incursion coming. Israel has warned, or had promised, excuse me, that they would evacuate people prior to the more than one million people sheltering there. And of course, plenty of countries in the international community and even some of Israel's closest allies have warned that any kind of military operation in Rafah and the moving of that many people in a place where there is simply nowhere for them to go would be a humanitarian catastrophe on top of the one, we're seeing there already.",

And for voters at the median income or below, that is a big weight that Biden is carrying. I really look at this economic debate that's developing as a contrast between agenda and lived experience. You know, Biden laid out a very populist economic plan in his State of the Union and is continuing to tout it in these appearances that Priscilla noted. And there is substantial support in polling for a lot of the ideas that he's talking about. Medicare negotiating lower prices on prescription drugs, cap capping out of pocket expenses for drugs for all adults, raising taxes on the rich and corporations and using the money to fund a resumed child tax credit, universal pre-care and enhanced subsidies for health care. All of that polls very well. The problem Biden is facing is that most Americans at this point feel that they did better themselves in the economy under Trump than they have under Biden. And what that does, I think, Jessica, is it creates a potential dynamic in which voters, even if Biden convinces voters that Trump's agenda primarily benefits the rich, they may not mind that as much as the Democrats are hoping if they think that they also did better under those policies than they are doing under Biden.",

Great to have you with us today. So, I'm curious, before we get to -- before I get to all your picks, what is the one race that you're most interested in today? The category, I should say, not race. MICHAEL MUSTO, ENTERTAINMENT JOURNALIST: I would say Best Actress because it really is a horse race. Emma Stone, who has previously won for \"La La Land,\" is a great contender for \"Poor Things. He's a reanimated woman who doesn't know how to behave in society. And then you have Lily Gladstone from Scorsese's \"Killers of the Flower Moon.\" She would be the first indigenous actor to win a competitive Oscar, and I think she's going to get it.",
