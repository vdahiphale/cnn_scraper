And also on the issue of humanitarian pauses that you say you have discussed, and I understand that you said you don't know where, how or when, but could you give us a little bit more details on what you mean by that exactly? I mean is it stop bombings or what have you? Could you give us some details on that? And then, last question, very quickly, there was a strike yesterday on AFP's office in Gaza where we have a continued live feed for -- since the beginning of the conflict. The -- apparently a missile strike. There's serious damage to our office there. I'd like your thoughts on that, please. Thank you.",

      "sentences": "Great, Leon. Thank you very much.A few things in response. First, when it comes overall to humanitarian assistance, the Israeli government is committed to providing that assistance or enabling that assistance, more accurately, to get to people in Gaza. And as I said, just over the last two weeks, we've gone from nothing getting in through the Rafah gate to now I think just today well over 100 trucks. And as I said, that's significant progress in the space of a couple of weeks, but it's also insufficient. And there's a recognition not only by us of that fact, but also by the Israeli government, as well as our Egyptian partners, as well as the United Nations. So, we are looking at very concrete, practical ways to widen the aperture, to significantly increase the assistance that's getting in, the food, the medicine, the water, fuel, other critical needs for people who, through no fault of their own, are in desperate, desperate need. And we had a good conversation about that today. Again, Ambassador Satterfield, who's here, is working on this every single day. But I'm confident, based on the conversations we had, that you'll see a further increase in the assistance that's getting in to people who need it. With regard to humanitarian pauses, again, we see this as a way of further facilitating the ability to get assistance in, to make sure that the resources are in place as well to absorb the assistance coming in, to make sure that it gets to the people who need it. We see it as a way also and very importantly of creating a better environment in which hostages can be released. And this is a very important piece. So, as I mentioned already, and I won't -- I won't repeat it, there are a number of very important practical questions that go along with this that we've agreed to discuss and work on. We've agreed that our teams will continue to talk about this in the days ahead. And from our perspective this can be a critical way to advance many of the interests that I - that I discussed earlier. I haven't seen the details about the - the strike, Leon, that you alluded to that hit the AFP office in Gaza. And let me just say, and say again, that as we stand strongly for Israel's right and obligation to defend itself, we also believe that it's vitally important how Israel does this, including with the highest regard for the protection of civilians and that of course includes journalists. Journalists who are doing extraordinary work under the most dangerous conditions, to tell the story to the world. Something that we deeply admire, deeply respect and we want to make sure that they are protected.",

      "sentences": "Let me take the second question first.There are no guarantees about anything, as a general proposition and maybe even more specifically in the context of the fight against Hamas, but we are absolutely focused on getting hostages back and getting them back to their families in safety. And we believe that, among other things, a humanitarian pause could help that effort, could facilitate it. It's one of the reasons why we're focused on it. But, regardless, our determination to get -- get people back is manifested every single day in our efforts to do -- to do just that. And as I've said, and said repeatedly, and as President Biden has said and said repeatedly, we stand strongly with and behind Israel in its right and obligation to defend itself, defend its people and take the steps necessary to try to ensure that this never happens again. Nothing has changed and that won't change. With regard to Lebanon, with regard to Hezbollah, with regard to Iran, we have been very clear from the outset that we are determined that there not be a second or third front opened in this conflict. President Biden said on day one to anyone thinking of opening a second front, taking advantage of the situation, don't. And we backed up those words, not only with work that we've done with many partners in the region to reinforce that message, but with practical deeds, including the deployment of two aircraft carrier battle groups to the region, including with action that we've taken, for example, against missiles coming from Yemen in the direction of Israel, shooting them down, including as well with strikes that we took in response to multiple attacks on our personnel in Iraq and Syria who are there, as I said earlier, to try to prevent a resurgence in the region of ISIL, of Daesh. We remain absolutely determined in that effort. And I'm not going to get into hypothetical situations, but all I can say is, we're committed to deterring aggression from any part and will take steps necessary to deal with it.",

And also are there discussions at all to create a multilateral force for Gaza? And if so, would the U.S. be willing to take part in something like that?Thank you.",

And especially with the intense bombardment that we're seeing in Gaza right now, the potential for extremism down the line is high. And so, you know, when you say defeat Hamas, is that being factored in? And what are you doing then to address those issues as well?",

      "sentences": "Yes. Vivian, I - you're exactly right, this is about dealing with Hamas in terms of defeating it physically. That is making sure that it can't repeat what it did on October 7th. But it is also about defeating an idea, a perverted idea, but an idea that we have to combat with a better idea, with a better future, with a better vision for what that future can be, and demonstrating that we're committed to achieving that future, that vision. Because in the absence of that, even after Hamas, those who sign the siren song of nihilism will find open ears. SO, it's imperative, in our judgement, that not only is Hamas dealt with in a way that October 7th can never be repeated, but that we lay out a clear vision and a path to achieve that vision that gives people something to hope for, to buy into, to grab on to.And I believe that there is a broad and strong coalition throughout the region that wants to do exactly that. All of these countries are on one side of the equation. Who's on the other side of the equation? Hamas, Hezbollah and Iran. So, it's incumbent upon us, I think, not only to - to lay out that vision, but to be clear about the ways that we propose to achieve it. This is not flipping a light switch needless to say given how deep rooted and enduring these - these problems are. But they're -- we have to. We have to address this. And we have to address it in concrete ways and with determination because, again, it is coming back to exactly what you said, we have to demonstrate that we have a better idea and a way to achieve it.

We stand behind Israel's right, and indeed obligation, to defend itself and to do everything it can to make sure that October 7th never happens again. And we will continue to stand with Israel to achieve that. As I've also said repeatedly, the way that Israel does so matters. And we've discussed today, as well as in many preceding days, the imperative of doing everything possible to protect civilian, the imperative of doing everything possible to get assistance to those who need it. With regard to extremist violence that we're seeing in the West Bank, this is something that, before October 7th, was a real concern for the United States and one that we've repeatedly raised in our engagements with the Israeli government. And it's an acute concern right now. Look, I don't want to speak for the Israeli government, it's not appropriate, but I think it's fair to say that what -- what I heard today was a clear commitment from the government to deal with extremist violence in the West Bank, to commute it, to take action to prevent it, to take action against those who perpetrate it. So, this is important. And we will be looking closely to ensure that our friends make good on the commitment.",

He said, in Blinken's word, \"we are determined that there not be a second or third front opened in this war.\" He repeated President Biden's words just in the days after October 7th, warning with that word, if you're thinking about getting involved, paraphrasing, don't. That President Biden's words then. And then Blinken noting, the U.S. carrier groups now in the region, two of them. And also a U.S. destroyer that you'll remember shot down missiles aimed at Israel coming from Iran-backed Houthi rebels off of Yemen.So, you have the U.S. secretary of state coming to the region in effect repeating that. And by mentioning the presence of U.S. forces here, you might say backing up that warning with that presence. Not saying explicitly, but saying, or signaling, right, that those forces are at hand if a second or third front is opened up in the war. It's interesting, I will just say to you, Kate, as I was listening at the same time to Secretary Blinken's speech, and Hassan Nasrallah's speech in Beirut, I'm standing on a hilltop here in Kiryat Shmona, which is a town in northern Israel. It's been a target in the last 24 hours of attacks by Hezbollah, and other groups in southern Lebanon. Rockets coming across that hillside there from Lebanon, one striking the city. And you can't see them, but just to note, around me here are Israeli soldiers positioned on this hilltop to look out for the possibility of another strike coming in. So that gives you a sense, as you hear those words from the U.S. secretary of state warning against another front opening up, that folks here in this part of the region are watching very closely for exactly that.",
