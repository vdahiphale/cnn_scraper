And the campaign saying that they will forego the traditional debates held by the Commission on Presidential Debates. Jen O'Malley Dillon, the Biden campaign chair, sent a letter to the commission today informing them that they will not participate in the three debates currently scheduled in the fall. And instead, the Biden campaign is proposing two dates for debates. One in late June and another in early September.Biden spoke a little bit about his challenge to Trump in a video posted on social media. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

The campaign is proposing that there be two debates, one in late June, after former President Donald Trump's criminal trial in New York City concludes, and then another in early September. They also are proposing a vice presidential debates in late July after the Republican National Convention takes place. They want these debates to be one-on-one, in essence eliminating the prospect of a third-party candidate like Robert F. Kennedy Jr. potentially participating in a debate.And importantly, they are foregoing this Commission on Presidential Debates format. Instead, they want to organize these debates with the broadcast networks. One argument they're making is that there should be a broadcast network who conducted a debate in the 2016 Republican primary and the 2020 Democratic primary so that both candidates have participated in those debates so - potentially to eliminate any, you know, opposition to organizations that could propose debates going forward. Now, one of the campaigns arguments is that they believe that they need to have these earlier debates because early voting is already getting underway when the CPD debates are currently scheduled to be held. In this letter to the campaign - to the Commission on Presidential Debates. Jen O'Malley Dillon also talks about how some of these debates have turned into entertainment spectacles. They want to eliminate that possibility. Instead, going back to models where these debates are taking place between two candidates and a moderator in a television studio. Of course, all of these details are simply just a proposal from the Biden campaign and it is still something that Trump's campaign would need to agree to. But the Biden campaign is laying out their terms for what they are hoping will be two debates but could start in just a matter of weeks.",

      "sentences": "That's right. And Donald Trump had some pretty tough words for Joe Biden as well. We just got a response from him on Truth Social. I'm going to quickly read for you just some of what he said. But the crux of it is that he accepts.He wrote, quote, \"Crooked Joe Biden is the worst debater I have ever faced.\" The post goes on to say, \"I am ready and willing to debate crooked Joe at the two proposed times in June and September. I would strongly recommend more than two debates and, for excitement purposes, a very large venue.\" It goes on to say, \"just tell me when. I'll be there. Let's get ready to rumble.\" Now, I also spoke with a senior advisor shortly after this proposal was publicized, Sara, and they said they're still going over the terms. Obviously, they need to work out the exact details of this. But they are very eager to have this matchup between Donald Trump and Joe Biden. And its interesting because some of the things that Joe Biden and his team are pushing for in this proposal are the same things that the Trump campaign has argued for. One is that they also want earlier debates. They think that they need to have these sooner before voters can actually start going to the poll and counting for early voting. The other thing is, they argue that they don't really care, from my conversations with them, who is the one holding these debates, whether it's the Commission for Presidential Debates, or whether it's a network, they are eager to have this matchup on stage between the two men. Now, I also want to point out that, remember back in 2020, we saw Donald Trump and Joe Biden on the debate stage then. And if you remember, Donald Trump was very aggressive. He repeatedly cut Joe Biden off, barely let him get a word in. And we saw, shortly after that debate, the polls actually fell for Donald Trump. It boosted Joe Biden's poll numbers. However, when I talked to Donald Trump's campaign, and this is something that both campaign managers Chris Lacivita and Susie Wiles believe, is that they think it's entirely different type of scenario this time around. They think that Joe Biden is a much weaker debater. They think he's more feeble now and they're hoping that having these two men on stage will show that contrast. So, from all of my conversations with the Trump campaign, they are genuine and sincere in their desire to have these debates. They think that Joe Biden will appear like the weaker candidate if they can get these two men on stage. Sara.",

And that's a perfect example.The first two questions that Todd Blanche asked right out of the gate were both objection sustained. The first one, as you said, was irrelevant. What Michael Cohen thinks about the lawyer has nothing to do with this case. What Michael Cohen thinks about the defendant, Donald Trump, is very relevant to this case. And then Todd Blanche asked the question about some comments, some bizarre comments Michael Cohen had made publicly about the jury, which was also sustained. So, you never want to stumble out of the block going zero for two. I re-read the transcript last night, Sara. There are some important points that are starting to shine through that were not really hammered home that I think they're going to need to focus on tomorrow. But there are long stretches of that cross that I think are more or less pointless. The whole thing about, you used to really like and respect Donald Trump. OK, I mean, fine, do it in a couple questions, but it goes on for pages and pages. So, I think Todd Blanche needs to focus up here and hit the high points.",

I would want the jury to think, this is a person who is obsessed and possessed with taking down Donald Trump. And, two, all the lies. I mean Michael Cohen has lied to Congress, to DOJ, to the FEC, to banks, to the IRS, to his family, to everyone you can name. Now, I suspect they haven't gotten there yet. I mean they're definitely going to spend a lot of time tomorrow on the lies. But, again, that was only sort of loosely brushed by. So, I would be thematic. Every question out of my mouth would be, he's a liar. He hates the defendant. You cannot take his word. As for how long it takes, I don't think longer is necessarily better. I would take as much time as it took to drive that home. I mean a full day of cross is a lot, Sara. Obviously, this is the key moment of the trial. We do expect Todd Blanche to take most or all of the day. SIDNER: Yes. And then there will be redirect. And we will have to see if that is when the prosecution rests. But a lot more to go for tomorrow. I know you will be sticking around for that and watching every detail. Elie Honig, thank you so much for joining us this morning. I really appreciate it.",

And let's have those debates before people start voting in - with early votes so that people can see these two men, have this conversation about, you know, I think what we'll see is revenge and retribution.

So, that's a huge win sort of strategically for the campaign, showing that, you know, the - that Trump is leading the conversation and Joe Biden is following. The second thing, two debates, you know, without an audience? You know, it's - it's - it's bad for Biden. It sort of demonstrates weakness and it shows people - it shows the voters he doesn't want to be in front of them and be held accountable for his inflation economy. I mean, let's be honest, these debates are going to be primarily about inflation because that's what the people - the American people are looking at and saying, you know, four years with Trump, four years with Biden, the economic numbers are pretty clear that - that if you want prosperity, you have to vote for President Trump in 2024.",
