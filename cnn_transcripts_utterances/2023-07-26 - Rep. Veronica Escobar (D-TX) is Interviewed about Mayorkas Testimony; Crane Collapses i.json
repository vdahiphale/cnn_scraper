I mean this is, again, an area of Manhattan which is very busy for two reasons. One, obviously, the time of day that it is. People are going to work. But also this is near the mouth of the Lincoln Tunnel. So, a lot of traffic it flooding into -- around this area. It's about ten blocks from where we are sitting at this very moment. It's an area in Hudson Yards, if you're familiar, with a development that's happening here. We're seeing a lot of cranes at this moment. But this is - this is incredible to see this.As Erica just narrated there for you, it hits that side of the building and then ultimately collapsed on 10th Avenue of New York City here in midtown. And what I'm learning from sources is, just right now it appears there's two injuries. One is of a firefighter and one is of a civilian. Now, when we say civilian, it's unclear yet, from my sources, is it someone who was on the ground? Is it someone who was in a car? Is it someone who was operating this crane or on that construction site. So that is very unclear. I also don't quite know the extent of those injuries. I was just told stable condition from my sources. So, if you're familiar, stable isn't really a condition, it just means that they're - you're not, you know, getting worse or better. They're -- but it's unclear if - is it serious, is it critical. So, again, at this point, the mayor's office, the FDNY, the Department of Buildings with New York City, they're all sort of flooding to this area, which is a very intense scene right now with all these departments sort of trying to figure out exactly how this happened, if there's more injuries, and it's very possible there might well be because of the busyness of this hour.",

And while we have nine women returning, if you will, it still makes sense that it didn't quite flow as well. Although, we won.I think tonight we will see a much more sophisticated attack.

So, while we are looking at this much, you know, bigger event of large sharks coming across bales of cocaine, what we're now looking at in the scientific community are actually the effects of pharmaceuticals that we're taking, legal or illegal, that are making their ways down through our streams, though our wastewater and into the oceans.
