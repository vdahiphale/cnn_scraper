Her body arrived back in Turkiye from the West Bank yesterday.An autopsy was performed and her parents are deeply unsatisfied that the IDF, which has -- which is carrying out the investigation into her killing, is capable of carrying out an independent and fair investigation. That's something that U.S. senator Bernie Sanders seems to echo, because he has called for the U.S. Department of Justice to carry out its own investigation into her killing and the killings of a number of other Americans over the past couple of years in the West Bank. The IDF has said that she was shot when protesters that she was with presented a threat to the troops who were nearby. It doesn't really match with what the activists who were around her said. And President Biden has weighed in on this very forcefully and very clearly, saying that there must be full accountability, that this was a tragic accident that resulted from an unnecessary escalation in the use of force, which is something that the secretary of state, Antony Blinken, has echoed. He has said that there must -- these shootings must stop, that protesters must be allowed to protest without being shot. Now President Biden is saying that so far the IDF has shared the preliminary results from its investigation. But the United States will draw its conclusions over whether or not this is fully accurate, fully accountable. As they say, only if the IDF continues to give the U.S., the embassy here, other officials, full access to all the steps to the investigation. Only transparency in the IDF investigation they're indicating will provide that accountability that the Eygi family so feels is lacking at the moment as they lay her to rest. And the funeral in the West Bank today, the first UNRWA worker to be killed by the IDF there in 10 years in disputed circumstances. UNRWA says that this was a sanitation worker who was drinking coffee on the roof of his house when Israeli snipers shot him three times in the chest. The IDF has said, this person has a track record connected to terrorism. And they've been on an increased number of operations inside the West Bank, particularly the past couple of days. The IDF saying they've killed 10 terror suspects. Palestinian Islamic Jihad have said that five of their fighters were killed by the IDF as they were planning attacks for the IDF. But for UNRWA, this is very unwelcome news, not least because they've lost a staff member but because it reflects a growing trend of what's happening in Gaza, where more than 220 UNRWA workers have been killed in controversial circumstances. And again, the IDF, in some of those cases, most recently, six killed in a U.N. school a couple of days ago in Gaza, the IDF alleging that some of them were members of Hamas, something UNRWA rejects.",
