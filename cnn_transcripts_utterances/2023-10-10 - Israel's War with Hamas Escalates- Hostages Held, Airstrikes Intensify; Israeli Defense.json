More than a thousand targets have now been hit, according to the IDF, all of them linked to Hamas, the Gaza-based militant group which carried out a surprise attack over the weekend, the deadliest on Israeli soil in 50 years.And this is just the beginning of an Israeli response which Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has warned will resonate for generations.

That's pretty much what we've gotten used to in recent years where there've been these rounds on average about every 24 months or so. We would hit them, they would hit us back and forth, and it would last a few days only from the air, only rockets, an occasional tunnel that they would try to cross through, but that would be it.In this case, Israel has to go into Gaza because it has to push back Hamas, right? The line of contact, for people who understand military terms, is currently inside Israeli territory. Israel has to go into Gaza to create a new line of contact inside Gaza because the fence, the barrier is completely breached. So it has to push back Hamas and prevent more infiltrations that can cause more massacres by these barbaric terrorists as we saw on Saturday.

They -- you know, the people, the civilians are the ones that are going to suffer at the end of the day. The -- Hamas, the Iranians have -- they're more interested in a cause than in their people. And at the end of the day, there's an indifference. They're willing to see their people suffer. You see that with the protests in Iran, and see how they're suppressed. Hezbollah has put the Lebanese population in danger at times, due to ISIS bombings. And there's a possibility it could put them in danger here now as we've seen some kind of developments along the Northern border with Israel. So at the end of the day, it's the Palestinian civilians that are going to pay the price. And I think part of the problems with this is that Hamas has sold a bill of goods to these people, a bill of goods that is maximalistic. And you know, maximum outcomes. And I think we saw this with Arafat. We're seeing it now. Is that, you know, there's an expectation amongst the population that they're going to get a lot back, when you know, probably in a day, they can only expect, you know, so much.",

Palestinian residents say buildings have been hit without warning, and Hamas has threatened to kill hostages in response to Israeli strikes, without warning, on Palestinian homes. Israel is now putting Gaza under siege, cutting off food, and fuel, and electricity supplies. The sheer scale of Hamas's incursion into Israel Saturday morning by land, air and sea, saw militant fighters breach barriers, invade numerous Israeli towns, murdering hundreds of civilians and taking hostages.

They range from up in the North, by the Erez Crossing up there. You can see this video here, released by the armed wing of Hamas on Saturday, showing militants storming that border post. And then down as far South, as well, as close to Sufa, near the Egyptian border. [00:45:02] The IDF even reported an attack by sea, militants landing on the beach up here at Zikim. The worst violence so far, well that was here near Re'im, a kibbutz, or agricultural community. It was an outdoor music festival. You can see some of the aftermath here. As of Sunday morning, at least 260 bodies have been found, according to Israeli authorities. That's kind of a broader picture of indiscriminate killing and hostage taking, as militants advanced several miles into Israeli territory. The IDF having to evacuate more than 20 border communities. Well, this has not just been on land. Rockets have been fired,   multiple rockets from Gaza towards the coastal towns of Ashdod and Ashkelon. Hamas is also claiming to have fired rockets towards Ben Gurion Airport, which is just outside Tel Aviv. And sirens have even been heard in Jerusalem. Well, now the focus shifts back to Gaza and that promised mighty vengeance from Israel. The moment in this video -- you'll see it in a minute -- of an Israeli airstrike on Gaza. Hundreds have been reported dead after Israeli strikes pounded the strip, leveling, in some cases, entire apartment blocks. Now there's already no way out of this territory for civilians, and Israel has now promised to cut off both food, fuel, and electricity. But the concern now is also for the broader region and potential spillover. Hezbollah has already claimed that it targeted several Israeli positions up here near the Northern border on Sunday morning, Israel firing back. Two Israeli tourists were also shot dead Sunday in the Egyptian city of Alexandria. Now Iran, which supports Hamas and Hezbollah, denies any involvement. And the U.S. says it has no direct information linking Iran to the Hamas attacks. Now this is also thrown into U.S. diplomatic efforts to bring Saudi Arabia and Israel closer together. The U.S. now turning to more practical measures, it says as a deterrent to prevent further attacks. Deploying an aircraft carrier strike group right there to the Eastern Mediterranean.
