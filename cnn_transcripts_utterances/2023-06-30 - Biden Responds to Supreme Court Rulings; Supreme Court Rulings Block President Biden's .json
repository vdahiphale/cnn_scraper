What the Supreme Court decided today is that Joe Biden went beyond what is authorized by Congress. Now, the original attempt the one struck down today, Biden based that on a 2003 law called the Heroes Act, which was passed after 9/11 and said in times of national emergency, the secretary of education can make certain modifications or waivers of student debt. What the Supreme Court said is, this contemplates smaller measures, the kind of measures, in fact, that Joe Biden just laid out at the beginning of his speech but not a mass spend of $400 billion. Now what Joe Biden is apparently saying is we're going to try again but we're going to use a different law. This is broader law, the Higher Education Act, that gives the secretary of education not limited to national emergencies certain authority to waive certain loan obligations. But it's important to know this. First of all, that process that putting those regulations in place is going to take many months. It will certainly be challenged, and those legal challenges will take at least a year. Quickest scenario, that comes back to the Supreme Court for the next term, which will conclude about a year from now.

Two batteries are here, this is the team. The billion dollar battery that is crucial to protecting Ukrainians from Russian airstrikes, it's been incredibly effective. They took down the first hypersonic Kinzhal missile, the ones that go ten times the speed of sound. These are the two that were responsible for taking that down. And here's part of our discussion today with that missile. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

I do think it's important to note that it covers a time period during the Trump administration, and the Biden administration, saying, quote, that the report found that during both administrations, there was insufficient, senior level consideration of worst-case scenarios, and how quickly those might follow.And, of course, when those did follow, the report gets into some specific things, that the Biden administration and State Department did not do. For example, on the seventh floor here at the State Department, that's where the secretary of state says. It says that there was no singular person who was dealing with crisis management on that floor. There was also no singular person at the department who was coordinating with the Department of Defense, who had already stepped up and non competent process evacuation for this. So it was sort of unclear. You know, who was the lead of the department dealing with the Pentagon? There is also criticism of the fact that this department wasn't a -- was putting out messages that were deferring about who of the Afghans was actually eligible to come to the United States, which created some confusion. So, there's a number of things that they pointed out, the department didn't really do well, while this was unfolding.",
