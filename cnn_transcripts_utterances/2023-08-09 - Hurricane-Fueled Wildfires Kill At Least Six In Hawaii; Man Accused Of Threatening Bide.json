But with that high there and that low there and the funneling effect, it wasn't. 82 miles per hour was the highest gust.But there finally goes Dora, 130-mile-per-hour storm. It's going to get into some cooler water and die off. But the farther it goes away, the more the winds will die off. We are going to really lose some of that difference between the high and the low pressure, all of the smoke coming off of Maui in the overnight satellite picture. I looked at this this morning, and I saw all of these orange spot, Wolf, and I thought, oh, we must be looking at a forest. This must be some burning trees. Now, in the dead of the day, we are looking at those spots being homes that are no longer there. It really does look like something out of a wildfire in Southern California, not something you would certainly expect in Hawaii. New report from the Hawaii Wildlife Fire Management says that about 25 percent of all the grasses there now in Hawaii are not native.

The disaster is very deep and broad. Thank you for your condolences. And so the county is still fighting the blaze and the search and rescue part continues.

But, finally, after this last thread where he talked about Biden coming to Utah, that he was going to be digging out his ghillie suit and dusting off his M-24 sniper, that they finally decided that they needed to move in to arrest him. They went to his home this morning at 6:00 A.M. when they encountered him, and that is when they shot ask killed him. I am told he was armed with a handgun at the time, but this threat was so serious, certainly for the FBI this morning, as the president was getting ready to go to UTAH, FBI SWAT members and agents were suiting up to go and take him off the street. Now, this man has made other threats, according to the FBI. He made threats against FBI agents who visited him back in March after they learned of online postings that he had previously made. They went to his home to talk to him. And just days after this in March, he's posting threats against the FBI. He also posted other threats saying that the was getting ready for the elections in 2024, that he had guns and that he was getting ready. That is a photo from his Facebook page that the FBI released of the guns that he had in the house. And then, finally, what really started all of this, Wolf, was that there was a threat made against the Manhattan district attorney who has been investigating former President Donald Trump. That's what set all this off. This man claimed that he was going to come to New York, kill Alvin Bragg, shoot him. That is the post that has ultimately led to the FBI opening an investigation against this man. They had him under surveillance. And then, finally, after this last threat just days ago, saying that he was getting ready for the president's visit and that he was going to have his gun, that they decided to move in and tried to arrest him and then this happened this morning.",

We're letting you know about it.The other thing really what's going in this is his talk about former President Donald Trump. There are very clear indications that he was a supporter of the former president. In fact, when the FBI went to visit him to say, hey, we're on to you, we know what you're doing, he was wearing, they say, a hat with Trump's name on it.

Now, it's unclear if the former president will be charged, but his own team has said that they expect he'll be charged in Georgia.

I'm sure that the prosecutor in Georgia is proceeding under Georgia law. Now, there's some overlap because we do know that there was an effort to have fake electors submit bogus certificates.

And pro-choice -- the pro-choice outcome has won every single time. We saw it was a big motivator for people in the midterm elections. We saw it was something that brought out not only traditional Democratic voters but independent voters, women, suburban women who really turned out in droves because Republicans were advancing this -- the fact that they were going to take away the healthcare rights, they were going to say that the government was not going to allow these women to be able to make their own healthcare decision. So, we have this is a huge motivator. I think what we saw in Ohio wasthat even as some of the Republican presidential candidates, Mike Pence and Vivek Ramaswamy who we just saw released videos. I think the pro-yes organization, organizational effort spent about $11 million trying to get this passed and couldn't, and we still saw enormous turnout. So I think this is a two-pronged messaging problem for the Republicans. One is the issue of choice and the fact that they're telling women that they can't make decisions for themselves about their bodies. But it's also this issue of governance, of the will of the people, of people being able to go out to the ballot box and trust that their vote is going to count. And so what they're hearing consistently from Republicans and what they heard in Ohio through this measure was we're going to reduce your voice, we're going to make it so that your voice doesn't count as much.

Again, a Iskander missiles hitting here, regular, frankly, response from Moscow because it seems the pressure they're feeling on the southern front line here, and one that led Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to say that they needed more air defenses and pledged to Ukrainians that they would see F-16 U.S. supplied jets in the skies here soon. That's a number of months off, but it really speaks to a key issue Ukraine is currently having in their southern counteroffensive. We saw parts of that firsthand, some of the first journalists trying to get to the front line, and the real key focus of Ukraine's push south. The troops there really struggling to make the progress they want to, Western analysts being critical of the slow pace that they're seeing on the front lines there. But the real issue they're facing is Russian air superiority. Russia is able to drop half-ton bombs on their positions on the town that they're trying to coral troops in. And that is setting up the pace of that counteroffensive. They're also seeing mine fields, deep Russian trenches, and at times the troops said to us seeing a Russian force that's actually better equipped, better trained and more able to hold those positions than they had in fact expected. So a tough fight author them certainly. But they were very dismissive of the criticism of the pace that they'd currently managed to gain so far in the counteroffensive, Wolf.",
