And we begin with breaking news in two separate New Year's Day attacks in the U.S.President Joe Biden says investigators are looking into whether there is any possible link between a ramming attack that killed dozens of people in New Orleans and a Tesla truck explosion outside the Trump Hotel in Las Vegas. Multiple law enforcement sources tell CNN the suspects in both incidents had military backgrounds. But first to New Orleans where the FBI is investigating the ramming attack in the historic French Quarter as an act of terrorism. Police say at least 15 people were killed when the suspect drove his truck down Bourbon Street at high rate of speed at about 3 A.M. local time. He's been identified as 42-year-old Shamsud-Din Jabbar, a U.S. citizen and army veteran. They say he made recordings on the drive from Texas to Louisiana about joining ISIS and killing his family. We should warn viewers much of the video from the scene is graphic. Police say they found an ISIS flag on Jabbar's truck along with improvised explosive devices which they believe were made at an Airbnb rental. According to the FBI, searches are underway in multiple states in connection with Jabbar. A video shows the white Ford F-150 making a sharp right turn onto Bourbon Street past police barricades and onto the sidewalk. The driver continued down the street for several blocks mowing down pedestrians. (VIDEO PLAYING)",

Shamsud-Din Jabbar served as a human resources specialist and information technology specialist on active duty from 2007 to 2015, deploying for nearly a year to Afghanistan.Jabbar served in the Army Reserve until 2020, and in a video posted on YouTube that same year, Jabbar described himself as a professional real estate agent based in Houston, Texas. Well, joining me here in London, CNN international diplomatic editor, our Nic Robertson. So Nic, as this story continues to develop, let's look at some of the key facts flagged here by the authorities and the investigators. First, perhaps to the motivation we were hearing there, that obviously there was an ISIS flag found on the truck. The FBI have indicated that this was an individual who was inspired by ISIS. What more are we learning about his potential links to that terror organization?",

They will be looking, obviously, at his, you know, who he's been talking to on the phone recently, what his electronic footprint was in terms of social media presence, but particularly, perhaps, what he's been -- what he's been searching for on the internet. So, all of these things the police will be doing, and we're seeing that they're doing some of them. Obviously, some of those events are happening, and the FBI and the police are not talking publicly about it yet.",

Did he have housemates in the house that he was living in in Texas? And who had he been in contact with? So, these could be very physical people in proximity to him.Look, the number one concern for the authorities at the moment is going to be, is there going to be another follow-on attack? Are other associates about to perpetrate another attack? That's the primary thing. And then it will be getting to that network of people that he may have been associated with electronically over the internet that might have provided inspiration, that might have helped provide motivation, that might have pushed him along this particular path. Because he is somebody, and this is again something the police will look at, who until a couple of years ago seemed to be a quiet, respected professional -- business professional. Then his life starts to fall apart. His running up debt, he says. His marriage -- his second marriage is on the verge or going through a divorce. So, there are these emotional burdens and pressures on him. And those sorts of pressures are the sorts of pressures that can turn somebody from being what appears to be a normal citizen into acting in a completely terroristic and irrational manner, as is done now.",

      "sentences": "Look, I think the analysis on that is really ongoing. The answer may well be the security should have been better, that those barriers, barriers, look, we know that ISIS and Al-Qaeda, for a decade and a half now, have told their supporters that the easiest way to attack people is pedestrians in a pedestrian area, use a vehicle, get to high speed, cause maximum casualties.So, these barrier systems have been put in place to mitigate against that, and they didn't work. And why didn't they work? Because they weren't ready. Why wasn't there an alternate while the new ones were being upgraded? I think those will be the questions that will be asked. But it's no surprise that we see an attack using a vehicle. It happened in Nice 2016, 86 people killed. Berlin, the Christmas market there 2016. Barcelona the following year. We've witnessed them here ramming vehicle attacks in London outside Westminster, the House of Parliament. New York, eight people killed in 2017, and again another Islamist car ramming attack. And right-wing activists also using them as perhaps what we witnessed in Germany in a Christmas market just a few weeks ago. So, that method of attack is screaming to the authorities that this is something you need to protect against. So, I think there will be a lot of focus on why those barriers weren't there.",

Me and my friend living here kind of knowing what's what and things that have been on the news. We didn't take any chances. We ran upstairs to the balcony area that we knew was there. And when we got up there, it wasn't anyone chasing anybody. It was just unimaginable casualty. I mean just the disfigurement and the body's strong. Something you can't unsee, you'll never forget. Directly, I think, was definitely a mother, twisted up, obviously deceased. We counted around eight bodies very quickly right in our area. One gentleman, crushed, had tire tracks across his back. Once they rolled him over, he had tire tracks on his front. He was completely crushed. Another girl, young small girl, was dancing when we were coming up the street. And she was just completely flat in the middle, dead center. Another woman just brutally run over but still agonizing. I'm certified in CPR and first responder training and they wouldn't let us help. They locked us all inside, which is understandable, but nobody else was helping. So, that was even tougher.

It turns in here 3This is where the attacks seem to begin in the sense of people being hit, but really the truck, if you look at the pictures, didn't seem to stop until about here. If it had continued up into here, there would have been -- I can't imagine the count of people who would have died in that circumstance. It hit that large red crane-type device and stopped. Nonetheless, this is one of the reasons that we need clarity on whether or not people can simply grieve this terrible event and look for answers, or whether they need to be concerned about somebody else being out there, because look at all the other areas so close by -- Jackson Square, Cafe Du Monde, right down here, so many people have visited. It was right up in here, so many people have visited that. That's merely blocks away. Preservation Hall, a great tourist attraction. Pat O'Brien's, a bar so many young people go to there. Canal Street over here we mentioned, huge. A lot of Mardi Gras parades there. They had a parade for the Sugar Bowl in this area just before this all happened. And of course, the Superdome right over here. You could walk from here all the way over here to Jackson Square in 30 minutes easily, in a very relaxed fashion. And this is a town that has lots and lots of people around it, and they've taken security seriously. They've been aware of threats. There are very serious questions now as to what maybe wasn't done right here. First of all, we have the Sugar Bowl, that's happening right now -- 75,000 people maybe inside the Superdome, maybe more. Watch parties all over town. Mardi Gras technically starts next Monday with the first parade. That'll go on for about two months. About a million people will come to town for that. Jazz Fest, we'll get a half million or more in town. That's coming up a little bit later this spring. The Super Bowl in just a little over a month. These are huge events, all of which, if there is a threat out there, are all in a position of having to be concerned about it. And in fact, the NFL put out a tweet saying, \"Deeply saddened by the news of this devastating event in New Orleans, thoughts with the victims, the community, and all those involved.\" And the NFL and the local host committee have been working collaboratively with local, state, and federal agencies the past two years to develop a comprehensive security plan.

He went to college. He went to Georgia State University. The university confirms that he did graduate with a bachelor's degree. He worked in real estate in Texas for four years. And then things started to change. There are divorce records that show in 2012, from his first wife, she sued him to try to get child support. And then in his second marriage, there was a filing that the suspect, the would-be suspect, would eventually file, saying that he was tens of thousands of dollars in debt from his business, that he was at risk of foreclosure, and that he had credit card debt.

And then, of course, the attack coincides with New Year's, which is a global celebration. So the attack was designed to kill as many people as possible. There were a lot of revelers still at that early hours of New Year's Day. Keep in mind that you also had the major sporting event of the Sugar Bowl. So there would have been a lot of tourists in the region as well, from Notre Dame and Georgia University. That game has also been suspended. So, on the one hand, the attack was designed to kill and maim. The second was to also have an economic repercussion designed to create consequences, psychological, the sense of fear and impact that was there. So, this attack was certainly well planned.

Just a few days before this Christmas, a car slams into a Christmas market in Magdeburg, Germany, killing at least five people, injuring more than 200. The suspect, a doctor originally from Saudi Arabia who'd expressed anti-Muslim, far-right views. Like Magdeburg and New Orleans, other cities have experienced horrific vehicle attacks during holidays. November 2021, a suspect with a long criminal history drives an SUV through the annual Christmas parade in Waukesha, Wisconsin, killing six, injuring more than 60. Berlin, December 2016, a tractor trailer rams into a crowd at a bustling Christmas market, killing at least 12 people, injuring dozens of others. The suspect, a rejected asylum seeker, was later killed in a shootout with police in Italy. And the deadliest vehicle attack ever, July 14th, 2016, Bastille Day in Nice, France, a Tunisian-born French resident drives a 20-ton truck nearly a mile through a crowded seaside promenade, 86 people killed, more than 200 others wounded. ISIS claimed responsibility. Why do these vehicle attacks often seem more deadly than other tactics?",
