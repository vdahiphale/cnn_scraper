But not all deep fakes are as targeted. Manipulated images are all over the Internet, some showing celebrity endorsements that aren`t always true. (On camera): Many experts aren`t as concerned about fake celebrity endorsements. They`re worried that manipulated content online will confuse voters, or in some way, keep them from going to their polling stations. And it`s incredibly easy to make manipulated images. I`m going to use a program to manipulate a real photo into showing something that didn`t actually happen. So, I`ll take this photo. I`m going to say, show me a car crash. And here we go. What could be taken -- several options of what could be a real car crash between two vehicles. Now experts are worried that somebody might take an image like this and share it online and say something along the lines of, \"The polling station is closed because of this severe car crash that took place.\" And that might not actually be true, but that could keep people home. (Voice-over):  So, this election, be aware and always double check what you see online with your state`s election officials. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

      "sentences": "Pop quiz, hot shot.In physics, there is only one particle that is confirmed to have a mass of zero, making it massless. Which is it? Neutron, quark, photon, or antimatter? Ding ding. If you said photon, you are correct. Photons are the smallest possible particles of electromagnetic energy that include radio waves, gamma rays, and visible light. While photons have no mass, there`s another mysterious particle out there that has some mass, but scientists still don`t know exactly how much. Scientists in China are on a mission to study neutrinos, high energy cosmic particles that are tiny, vaporous, and can pass through any kind of matter. It`s no wonder they`re sometimes called ghost particles. These ghostly particles almost never interact with other matter, including the tens of trillions of neutrinos from the sun that stream through us undetected every second. CNN`s Marc Stewart shows us how scientists plan to unravel their mysteries. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

For a decade, these scientists have been constructing Juno, an underground observatory. With construction almost complete, they`re ready to execute their plan to better understand neutrinos. These tiny subatomic particles are among the most abundant particles with mass in the universe, and they move at nearly the speed of light. Neutrinos are all around us, even passing through our bodies, and scientists need to know more about them.",

They`ll measure neutrinos emitted by two nuclear plants located about 50 kilometers away. Knowing what makes up the fundamentals of neutrinos can open the door to learning more about the past and future of the universe, and discover the nature of matter and energy. China isn`t the only country working to understand these tiny particles. Other countries are in the race to be the first to solve the enigma.",
