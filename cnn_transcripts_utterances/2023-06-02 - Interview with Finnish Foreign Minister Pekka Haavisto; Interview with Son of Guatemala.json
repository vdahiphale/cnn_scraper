U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken visited Finland today to welcome NATO's newest member and launched a message across its 832-mile Russian border. Putin's war of aggression against Ukraine has been a strategic failure. Greatly diminishing Russia's power and influence. Blinken called for diplomatic efforts from any quarter to end the war while keeping Ukraine's sovereignty secure. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ANTONY BLINKEN, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE: The United States has been working with Ukraine and allies and partners around the world to build consensus around the core elements of a just and lasting peace. To be clear, the United States welcomes any initiative that helps bring President Putin to the table to engage in meaningful diplomacy. Will support efforts whether by Brazil, by China, or by any other nation, if they help find a way to adjust in lasting peace, consistent with the principles of the United Nations charter.

That is what we're hearing from many of your allied nations there. That having been said, what will it take for Vladimir Putin to withdraw his forces permanently? Because we've already seen sanctions leveled against the country that we have not seen any time in the recent history by multiple nations. That hasn't stopped. And the death and casualty rate of perhaps 200,000 or more of his troops has not stopped him.

      "sentences": "Well, let me tell you why the idea of Global FoodInstitute right in Washington, D.C. at George Washington University, that happens is when the universities in America that addresses politics and food policy like no other university. So, close to Washington D.C. power, White House and the capital. Today, we see a world in the United States and countries everywhere where food seems -- is always an afterthought. Where the different apartments of agriculture almost seems, sometimes, they're running to see food as a commodity. Where often is not solving the issues that people face. Today, planet earth produces enough food to feed all of humanity, two, three times. But still, we have hundreds of millions of people that go to bed hungry. We need to start creating a smarter policy, smarter bills that becomes good politics in bipartisan ways. We need to start considering food that's a national security issue, and we need to start thinking that the presidents of every country will have a national food security adviser. Why? Because time is precious. We have, right now, time had changed that this is affecting crops every country around the world. We have drought stat distant time. We have plagues that right now are attacking entire countries in the heart of Africa. We have wars. We have mass migrations happening. If we don't start taking food more seriously, I'm afraid that we're going to be very close to one of the biggest migrations in the easter of time. And then today, we feel food. It's available to all of us. One day we may wake up, one day, and we're actually, actually is not enough food to feed everybody. That's why we need to create this Global Food Institute -- to start putting more importance into the into the World Food. Every politician running for president, for governor, for -- senator or congressman, in America, around the world, is going to have to have, what is their food policy. How are they going to be thinking of food in the way they do politics? That's what we hope to achieve in at this institute.",

And at the end, ifyou start thinking, you start off with distribution. Every -- we have enough food in the planet, but we have people hungry. You will agree with me that the -- about distribution. We've seen what's happening in the last week in Washington, that you see Republican and Democrats, they've been negotiating about increasing the debt. One of the names of the issues they've been talking all the time has been about snaps. Do we cut the SNAPs, what we call, in more practical terms, food stamps -- which is a supplement that is given to American families that may have a difficult time putting food on the table. The way we are doing the stamps right now shouldn't be about if we cut it or not. But the conversation by Republicans and Democrats should be about, how do we improve it? Very much the SNAPs is an old program that has proven very effective, but that has, in a way, not modernized itself. Why we don't make sure that we increase the SNAPs but -- to buy fresh fruits and vegetable from different farmers in rural areas that in the process of keeping those families fed. We help the local rural economies in the process of solving the problem of hunger in American families. We increased the output of further money that goes to invest at the rural areas. All of this time, we solve the problem, but in the process, we help rural economies that sometimes they fall behind do better. Why we cannot use the SNAPs in local restaurants or diners? Why do people that received the SNAPs benefits that usually they leave in some of the poor communities in the cities in America? Cannot be spending that money in the same community they live? They usually have to go so -- other community because in the communities they live, sometimes they are so poor that there is no restaurant, there is no supermarkets. Let's make sure that in the process of helping the American families, we don't throw in the problem but in the process, we encourage economic growth by opening diners. Opening food trucks. Creating jobs endorsed for communities. Opening markets that sell actually fresh fruits and vegetables. You see, if we have a smarter policy, smarter bills, all of a sudden, we have start solving problems one at a time.",

But very often, especially since we were founded -- I founded it over 13,14 years ago. And especially I would say, right after Maria, that this one we had the very big growth. I said before, big problems have very simple solutions. And everybody always asks me, Jose, where do you guys get the food? I'm like, in the food warehouses and in the supermarkets? They are there. They may not answer the phone, but the food is there. What we do is fairly practical. When you have to stop a fire, who do you send? You send firefighters. When you have to take care of the wounded, who you send? Nurses and doctors. When you need to be feeding people, who do you sent? Well, you send cooks and people that think -- like cooks. Even in Central Kitchen, this organization that this -- a big team of people that they are beyond cooks. But really, to feed, you have to cook. What do you do? You find restaurants, restaurants that survived the hurricane, or restaurant that survived the earthquake, and they are strategically located. I don't need to build a field kitchen if I don't have to if I have restaurants that are available. So, let's use their assets that they have in place. If we activate food trucks because they're available, they happen in Florida in Fort Myers. We may be activating 10, 20, 30, 50 if we don't have a kitchen like what happened in Bahamas in Abaco, because the entire island was underwater. There, we bring it initially by helicopter or by boat to every island. We did more than 80,000 meals a day in the early weeks until we built a field kitchen in Abaco while the situation improves. You see, we adapt. And usually so with local people that want to help. Usually so with local assets and restaurants and food trucks that we can activate immediately. And usually, it's always warehouses full of food. And if not, we bring it with us in a case of hurricane, we can predispose food trucks all across with food and refrigerators, generators, everything running. Again, the only thing we do is that we show up and do it. We don't -- we always say, we don't like to meet too much, but we like this to start cooking. Going in the field, and then start looking for one community at a time. In the process, you keep increasing the output every day.
