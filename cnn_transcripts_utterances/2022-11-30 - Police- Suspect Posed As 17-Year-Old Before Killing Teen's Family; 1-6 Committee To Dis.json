That's when someone is communicating with someone else online pretending to be another person. Authorities tell us that this former officer was trying to convey that he was a 17-year-old, a teenager. He makes a drive from Virginia here to Southern California, and Friday is when tragedy strikes. Police say that a neighbor called 911 after they saw this 15-year-old minor being led to a vehicle in a suspicious manner. Authorities were later able to locate that vehicle. They engage in an altercation with the suspect. He is shot and killed. Again, the 15-year-old was not physically harmed, but they're still trying to piece together how this relationship began, and the exact nature of this relationship.

That's something that the Justice Department believes is a civil rights issue for the African American community in that city. So, those are two things that the attorney general has on his mind.

This is a fascinating turn for the Republican Party because in the Republican Party that we knew in the Cold War, and even the post-Cold War period, they would have been the first and most vociferous of pushing back at Vladimir Putin. And in fact, during the Obama administration, argued that Obama wasn't doing enough after the takeover of Crimea. But the party is now gone through four years of Donald Trump's America Firstism. And I think there are some led by speaker -- future speaker McCarthy, who basically take the view that we've spent enough. And so, the Democrats suddenly are going to become the hawkish party on Russia, and the Republicans, I think are going to be split. Does that mean that there's going to be greater scrutiny? I'm sure there is in a place like Ukraine where there's been a lot of corruption historically. I'm sure there's a need for a lot more oversight.
