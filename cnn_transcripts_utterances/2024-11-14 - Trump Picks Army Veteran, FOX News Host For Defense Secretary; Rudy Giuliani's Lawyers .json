Part of this reason that this is a problematic situation, is because it pulls the military into a political sphere.So you're not likely to hear directly from the military members about things like that because, that's the beauty of the military, they are apolitical. So what I've been hearing is, of course, there are concerns, but it's very unlikely we're going to hear a lot publicly from these individuals for the very reason this is a problem. Politicizing the military disrupts our government. It really is not something we should be looking to do. And in fact, it's something we really need to be careful to avoid.",

Listen to this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KENNETH CARUSO, RUDY GIULIANI'S LEAD ATTORNEY: People seem to think this is final. Rudy Giuliani's going to give up everything he owns. But if, as I believe, we're going to have that verdict reversed, it's all going to come back. As I said to the press in one of my rare comments, stay tuned. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Let's get the latest from CNN's Kaitlyn Polantz, who joins us now with the details. Katelyn, Giuliani has a big deadline for tomorrow to turn over some of his possessions. Why is the attorney, the two attorneys trying to get out right now? KATELYN POLANTZ, CNN CRIME &amp; JUSTICE REPORTER: We don't have the details on exactly what happened between them and Giuliani. But the big picture is that if Rudy Giuliani doesn't meet this deadline tomorrow set by the court to give over a lot of his valuables, furniture, watches, a car, keys and title to a Mercedes- Benz in Florida, if he doesn't give these things over, him and all the other people involved could face sanctions in court, contempt of court. Theoretically, that's where people can be locked up if they -- if they're not doing what the court says until they're willing to do what the court says. We don't know if it's going to get there with Giuliani. But things are going badly for him. These lawyers have been arguing in court. They we're just in court last week with the former mayor there in person at that hearing. And Giuliani is telling them clearly in here, he's whispering, and telling them to do certain things. And Ken Caruso started -- during the hearing started making arguments he had already lost weeks ago in this case and the judge kept saying, no, this is ridiculous, this is farcical, it's not going to happen. So now, these attorneys filed these notices last night with the details about what happened with Giuliani redacted. What they have said is that they're following the ethics rules for lawyers that say that they may need to take themselves out of a case, quit, if they have a fundamental disagreement with their client or their client is uncooperative or they're being asked to contradict the law. So exactly what's happening there, we're going to see what's happening tomorrow, if Giuliani gets his things over to Ruby Freeman and Shaye Moss, $150 million. All remains to be seen. It is a tense moment for the former mayor of New York.",

I feel like we've talked about this sort of thing before and you've expressed skepticism. I wonder what you made of these hearings. ADAM FRANK, PROFESSOR OF ASTROPHYSICS, UNIVERSITY OF ROCHESTER, ASTRONOMER &amp; AUTHOR: First of all, I always want to begin, transparency would be great. You know, getting a handle on what the government actually knows and doesn't know about UAPs is a good thing. But I'm going to express the exact same skepticism that I expressed last time. As you heard, one of the speakers say, well, anecdotally. These are always stories about military or intelligence people who have heard from somebody else, who's heard from somebody else. I've got to tell you, as an astronomer whose job is all about finding life in the universe, it's very frustrating. Because these are spectacular claims. And listen, I kind of hope they're true because the most important question for me is, is there life in the universe? But there's never any actual data that a scientist can work with. And it's been decades now that we've been hearing these stories. And there still is no actual data. So I still have the exact same skepticism. You know, show me the spaceship. Until then, it's a lot of stories.",

I mean, you know, so the first UFO craze happens in 1947.Actually, the guy, the military guy who was in charge of -- the officer in charge of the first investigation in the early '50s afterwards, after he left the investigation, wrote a book where he claimed there was a special report that showed these things we're interplanetary, because no one was thinking interstellar then. But, of course, no one's ever found that report. This goes back decades. For every military and intelligence officer who says there is evidence, the government is holding it, you can find one who says it isn't. For example, Sean Kirkpatrick, who just recently stepped down as the head of the government program studying these things, said there's no evidence. He talks about what he calls \"the circular conversation.\" That for decades now, you've got people who will claim something is true talking to other people, maybe the next generation, the younger generation, and then they talk to the next generation. So it's this circular conversation among people who believe this. I'm sure they believe it earnestly. But we never get the actual data. You know, my colleagues and I hope that we'll soon have data where we can make a claim there's alien life. And we expect -- you know, our colleagues are going to come at us hard. If you make a claim that's extraordinary, you need to have pretty strong evidence. Because you know, we are -- human beings are very good at fooling themselves, especially about things they want to be true. So we invented science so we would have a way to know what's really true. I'm bothered by people making these incredible claims as if, that's enough, now we know. And we don't know. Just is just believing. I don't want to believe. I want to know. I'm a scientist.",
