Officials are warning residents to leave with evacuation orders in place for several counties along Florida's west coast. And many of those communities are actually still reeling from Hurricane Helene, which battered the area roughly 10, 11, 12 days ago.Let's turn now to meteorologist Elisa Raffa who's tracking the storm in the CNN Weather Center. Elisa, what can we expect over the next few days?",

One hundred and seventy-five-mile-per-hour winds in that perfectly symmetrical eye. It's got that buzz saw, doughnut-shaped classic textbook on satellites sitting 700 miles southwest of Tampa.The rapid intensification today has been one for the record books, intensifying among one of the fastest on record. It was a tropical storm yesterday. I went to sleep, it was a Category 1 hurricane. And now we're dealing with one of the strongest storms on record, top 10 when it comes to that wind speed. We are looking at it scraping the Yucatan Peninsula as that Category 5 hurricane. It heads towards Florida. Notice again the intensity wanes a little bit. There's some dry air. There's some wind energy, things that will kind of chip away at the intensity some as it heads towards Florida. But we're still looking at a major hurricane making landfall, a Category 3 or 4. You have hurricane watches in effect all in the pink for that Gulf Coast area. We were looking at devastating, damaging winds, 110 miles per hour or greater from Tampa down to Sarasota and Fort Myers. Notice the entire peninsula getting in on tropical-storm force and hurricane- force winds. Now, the Tampa area, we're watching that storm surge forecast very closely. Right now, the forecast is for eight to 12 feet. If that eye goes just to the north of Tampa Bay, that will bring in some of the biggest storm surge that the Bay has ever seen. If it goes just to the south, that will alleviate some of that storm surge for them. But again, you're still looking at storm surge up and down the west coast of Florida. When it comes to history for Tampa, they have missed major hurricane passes in the last 100 years. This could be the closest call for them since 1921. So again, really worried about that storm surge. It could be unprecedented. Boris, Brianna?",

All of this is going to potentially become flying debris with, you know, 90-mile-an-hour winds.And so I think if you are able to get out, if you are able to evacuate to a local shelter, they've closed schools yesterday so that they could open them up for people who need a place to stay, I would highly recommend getting out if you are able to get out. But, you know, this area, there are some issues. You know, we're not even close to recovering from Helene, and now trying to evacuate and make preparations for Milton has been challenging.",

And so I think the safest thing is just to bite the bullet and get out, get to somewhere that's safe, where if there's a problem, that you can get help.And, gosh, a lot of the people that passed away in Pinellas County were people that didn't leave, you know, in the storm surge, and maybe they had issues with evacuation. And my heart goes out to them and their families. But this is another very different storm, a very dangerous storm, and I would highly recommend everyone get out if they're able.",

It's going to get larger. And we saw this in Helene. These big storms, these large-sized storms, produce more impacts. So this growth in size is going to more than compensate for the reduction in intensity, and it's going to cause problems because you're going to get a broader swath of impacts.

Some 250 were taken hostage, and it's believed that more than 100 are still being held captive.We're joined now by Gil Dickmann, who's had several family members killed and taken hostage by Hamas. His cousin, Carmel Gat, was among six hostages in Gaza, killed in late August after being held hostage for nearly 11 months. His aunt, Kinneret Gat, was murdered by Hamas terrorists on October 7th, and his cousin's wife, Yarden Roman, was taken hostage but released in late November.

She survived, and we had so many opportunities to get her back.She was supposed to be on the list for the eighth day of the ceasefire, then the ceasefire collapsed, and they went back into fighting. And after that, there were so many opportunities for Prime Minister Netanyahu to get her back. And I heard him specifically stating to me in Washington, one month before she was murdered, that he refused to sign a deal that will get her back. So, this is the worst missed opportunity that I could ever think of, and her ending was our worst nightmare. But after she was murdered, still, there are 101 hostages in captivity, and it seems like for our prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, it matters more to keep the war going forever than to get hostages back.

They were able to jump out of the car, and they started running the other way around.And Yarden handed her little child, Geffen, to her husband alone and told him run. And he ran and she stayed behind. She only learned that they remained alive when she accidentally heard on the radio, in captivity, my voice. And I described how much we miss her, how much we miss Carmel and how much we miss my Aunt Kinneret. And I didn't mention Alon and Geffen, that's how she learned that they survived and that they were alive. She's a hero. Yarden is a hero. And there are so many heroes here in Israel who survived October 7th, who survived captivity and now they deserve to rebuild their lives. They can't do that as well since there are still hostages in Gaza. And I'm afraid that our Prime Minister Netanyahu believes that his own political gain lies in continuing the war on and on and on to eternity, a never ending war for his own political gain. But being pro-Israeli is not being pro-Bibi right now. Being pro-Israeli is also being pro the people of Palestine and being pro a deal that will bring peace and tranquility to the whole area. This is exactly the opposite of what Prime Minister Netanyahu was doing, but that's what 75 percent of Israelis believe and also the people who survived October 7th.
