I apparently a high profile conservative judicial activist arranged for the wife of Justice Thomas, her name is Ginni Thomas.So we paid tens of thousands of dollars, but that there should be \"no mention of her\". This is how it all worked according to The Washington Post, the conservative judicial activist known as Leonard Leo, who plays a high profile role in many Republican circles. He advises a network of conservative non-profits, including one known as the judicial education project, and 2012, the same year that non- profit filed a brief to the Supreme Court in a landmark voting rights case. Leonard Leo told Kellyanne Conway of course, who later became a Trump Adviser that he wanted to give Ginni Thomas another $25,000 with quote \"no mention of Ginni\". Of course, that day her company billed the judicial education project for $25,000. And that money was for Ginni Thomas. Documents reviewed by the post show that Conway's company paid Thomas's firm $80,000 between June 2011 and June 2012. It's still not fully clear what exactly Ginni Thomas did for Conway's polling company or for the judicial education project. The non-profit did file a brief in Shelby versus holder where the court invalidated key parts of the Voting Rights Act of 1965. Justice Thomas wrote an opinion in that case that was consistent with judicial education projects position. Here's how literally I was responding to all of this reporting, \"The Work Ginni did here did not involve anything connected with either the Court's business or the other legal issues. Knowing how disrespectful, malicious and gossipy people can be, I have always tried to protect the privacy of Justice Thomas and Ginny\". You should know the post did not receive responses from Justice Thomas from Ginni Thomas his wife or from Kellyanne Conway in this.",
