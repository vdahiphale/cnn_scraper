The common element of all of this was the president expressing his dissatisfaction that the Justice Department, in his view, had not done enough to investigate election fraud. TAPPER (voice-over): But they were investigating. The Department of Justice had been debunking Trump's wild election fraud lies one by one. But President Trump chose to not listen. On a December 27th phone call with Rosen and Donoghue, President Trump said the department had an obligation to, quote, tell people that this was an illegal, corrupt election, despite no evidence of widespread fraud. Trump also pressed them to publicly, quote, just say the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen.",
