DeSantis specifically referred to the crisis in Haiti and the potential for a new wave of migrants from the Caribbean nation trying to get to Florida by boat. This is part of what he had to say.

But as voters cast their ballots, the Kremlin is going after those who staged small acts of protests at the polls.This is a polling station coming into us live right now from Moscow. We are keeping an eye on the pushback at some of those polling stations. Prosecutors have opened 15 cases against suspects who reportedly tried to set fire at polling stations or put dye on ballot boxes. The widow of opposition leader Alexei Navalny has urged voters to come out Sunday and send a clear message to Mr. Putin.

So, this will be the number that the Kremlin uses to prove the legitimacy of Putin's continued tenure, his entry into what we expect to be a fifth time.As of now, the Central Election Commission is providing regular updates. It's over 60 percent. Now, the magic number here is 67.5 percent, which was what was achieved six years ago in 2018. So, certainly, it seems the Kremlin will be looking to surpass that, to show that, as Putin has said outright, that the majority of Russia's people support him. Now, that may be true, but, of course, we are seeing as well this undercurrent of opposition sentiment coming to the fore with these various acts of vandalism and civil disobedience at polling stations. That certainly, given the climate of repression in Russia, this very tough legal system, new laws coming in since the start of the war to prevent acts of opposition, is perhaps more than expected. So, that is something that we are watching very closely, as well as the call from, as you noted, from Navalny's team to come out at noon and show support for this sort of opposition movement. We've already seen images coming out of eastern regions. So far, it just looks like people turning up to vote, but the big cities are where we expect to see the majority of that opposition sentiment right now. It's just after 10:00 A.M. in Moscow, so this is something we'll be watching closely in the coming hours. Lynda?",

      "sentences": "That's right, Lynda. There were two protests, certainly in Tel Aviv. There were two different lots of protesters. As you say, one lot was demanding that Prime Minister Netanyahu step down and that fresh elections be called, elections that opinion polls suggest that Netanyahu would not only lose, but elections in which he would be trounced. And then the other lot were protesting to put pressure on the government to try to get them to do a deal to bring back home the 100 or so hostages believed to be alive and still being held captive in Gaza after being kidnapped on October the 7th as part of the Hamas-led terrorist attacks.Now, they do overlap somewhat, both physically, because they're both happening in downtown Tel Aviv, and also ideologically, because some of those demanding that Netanyahu stepped down are doing so because they believe that he is now an obstacle to bringing the hostages back home, because so long as the hostages are still being held by Hamas and others in the Gaza Strip, and so long as the war with Hamas continues in Gaza, then Netanyahu will be able to say that it's impossible to hold elections and he will remain in office and won't have to face the polls. So, that is why some of them are calling for Netanyahu to step down. But as you say, it wasn't just Tel Aviv. There were protests in Jerusalem and by Prime Minister Netanyahu's private residence in Caesarea. There were some arrests. There was a little bit of violence with fires being set on the Island Highway, the main highway that kind of splits Tel Aviv, that runs through Tel Aviv. And, of course, this all comes ahead of a war cabinet meeting due to take place at 10:00 A.M. Eastern Time, 6:00 P.M. local time today, followed by a full cabinet meeting, during which they are due to discuss Israel's position in the face of Hamas' new proposal. Its demands seem to have softened a little bit, but Netanyahu is still calling those demands absurd. And then, of course, also to decide what David Barnea, the head of the Mossad, who is Israel's main point man in these truce negotiations, what his position ought to be when he goes to Doha, which is expected to happen either later this evening or tomorrow, to resume those talks, to try to get a truce, a ceasefire, a six-week ceasefire in place, get those hostages, at least some of them, back into Israel, and that would also require the freeing of a number of Palestinian prisoners and more humanitarian aid going into the Gaza Strip.

And while it was at the gate, this was a flight from San Francisco to Oregon, and it was a Boeing 737, but it was a previous generation, so not the MAX that's been in the headlines recently.It had 145 passengers and crew members. And according to United, those crew members did not declare an emergency while they were in the air. United now saying that they're reviewing and trying to figure out exactly how and why this all happened, but, unfortunately, it's not the first incident that they're dealing with. They have been under scrutiny for several incidents, including one where the engine ingested bubble wrap. That all caught on fire midair. And another incident, well, that after takeoff, the plane lost a wheel and crashed into some cars below it. Now, United has said that they're reviewing all of these incidents separately, and I also want to point out that there was another incident, so not with United, a separate airline, a different incident, but also involving a Boeing aircraft. This time it was LATAM Airlines, where, on Monday, passengers on that plane experienced a midair drop. About 50 passengers were injured after all of this. And Boeing putting out essentially an alert and recommending checks to these airlines on the switches on the pilot seats. After all of this happened, American Airlines, for example, also saying that they've identified a potential hazard on those switches on the pilot seats, which they believe possibly caused that midair drop on that LATAM flight. And so, again, a lot of different issues but a lot of people asking for accountability. This is something that the FAA says they're looking into, specifically that advisory from Boeing. And they say they will continue to monitor this incident. Camila Bernal, CNN, Los Angeles.",

But she is there to assure that that is well aware, that the employees are well aware that they can go around their direct supervisor and bring up safety issues. So, that's step one. However, in any manufacturing process, any company, really, you have to be concerned as an employee, I'm bringing up something that can cost the company money. So, it really has to be emphasized and there has to be a safety valve to allow them to do this without any retribution whatsoever, and I think putting Kate in this position at Boeing has really made a big difference, and I think also the FAA being more participating in the line, on the line of assembly is going to make a big difference as well. I'd love to see the fact that they're going back to this more participating role and allowing the employees really to be the quality control, the people that really are there looking at it to say this is an issue, and now they need to be sure they emphasize the ability for them to go around their direct line of supervision and go above them and go straight to who's going to make a difference.",

And the wider question, the word that came up a lot in that seven- minute announcement from the Niger military junta was sovereignty. And they feel that the U.S. presence in their country violate their sovereignty.This is a word that you've heard a lot from the military junta, it's not just in Niger, but it was in Burkina Faso, in Mali, in Guinea. It's a common byword because the popular thing to say in these moments. But make no mistake, this is an embarrassing development for the United States, especially because it comes after a high powered U.S. military and diplomatic delegation just left Niger trying to avoid this outcome. And now the Nigerians are saying they don't want the U.S. military and they have to leave immediately. Pay attention. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

They say they have a state-to-state deal with Russia to acquire military equipment, to deal with terrorism there. And they condemned some claims from the U.S. delegation that they had signed a similar deal with Iran. They say in their sovereign nation they can do what they want.And the U.S. operates two bases in Niger, including one in Central Niger, which was built at a cost of about $100 million. It's a drone base that's been carrying out operations all across the Sahel region. The belief from the U.S. and many of the western countries is that their presence in Niger was central to their counterterrorism operations, to tackle these armed insurgencies operating all across this region. And so this is a major blow to that, but it's not new. The Niger military junta also kicked out the French military, and they last -- they finished that withdrawal in December. There's a few German and Italian troops that remain in the country, but for the most part, this junta does not like foreign troops on their soil. And they know that's also a popular thing among the population. So, they know doing this helps make them look good with the wider population, Lynda.",

Larry Madowo for us, good to have you on the story, thanks so much.Well, Thailand is trying to find its way out of a thick blanket of smog after one of its top tourist hotspots is recently ranked as having some of the worst air quality in the world. The haze is posing a serious health risk to everyone, especially vulnerable populations like children and the elderly. Our Michael Holmes reports. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MICHAEL HOLMES, CNN ANCHOR (voice over): Not the view some tourists had hoped for, a thick layer of smog covering the city of Chiang Mai in Thailand. On a clear day, this overlook is usually a popular photo stop, but haze is once again obscuring the view, perhaps not surprising since Chiang Mai ranks as one of the world's most polluted cities, according to IQAir, a website that monitors air quality. But the smog isn't just unsightly, it's unhealthy. IQAir says the level of cancer-causing pollutants in Chiang Mai's air is more than 20 times higher than World Health Organization guidelines, and people are getting sick from it. A Thai government report says more than 10 million people required treatment for pollution-related illnesses last year, with many people wearing masks to protect themselves.",
