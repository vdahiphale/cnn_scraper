That SWAT vehicle just covering sort of that part of the van that we were looking straight at, at the moment. So I'm seeing that the law enforcement agents at the back of that BearCat. And then we also saw the drone coming closer to the ground. So I'm not sure if it landed or not but I was seeing the drone, and it appears that many of these law enforcement officers here are watching what was going on through video of the drone.As you guys have been mentioning, it has not looked urgent in any way over the last couple of minutes that we've been here. It has been a slow process and a lot of the things that my colleague Josh Campbell mentioned, just so many law enforcement agencies working together, expanding the crime scene. We got here a while ago and they have moved us multiple times because they have tried to expand the crime scene telling us to be extremely careful because they were just not sure what was inside of that van. So, again, we saw the last vehicle that got here sort of circling around the van multiple times. We were watching all of this happening and, again, they essentially parked right in front of me. So they blocked my view. But it could be because, of course, they're in there and they don't want us to see what is going on behind the van. So you may have aerial views that are maybe a little bit better than what I'm seeing here. But, again, not a lot of urgency.

And of course we understand that. They have to make certain that what they're telling us is accurate. But it does appear at this point, Chief Ramsey, that there has been some resolution brought to the situation. Officers have certainly neutralized this vehicle and if our viewers are just tuning in right now, just in the last 10 or 15 minutes we saw these tactical officers with the L.A. County Sheriff's Department surround this vehicle, smash the passenger side window, open up the side doors of that vehicle, and then go inside and make sure the scene and the situation there is neutralized.

There are going to be false positives. That happens.And then, of course, you know, people wonder why are they doing this. This is just the nature of a false positive. When you ask communities for more information, you will get some of this. And it is an important given what's happened in the community that it's taken seriously. We are obviously much more focused on what we saw a couple of minutes ago. And at least the sheriff's statements about an individual in that van, and then of course returning back to Monterey Park and what that community is facing today. Look at this. I'm from this area. You don't get no traffic like that. This whole area is completely cleared out. We have now the aerial view.

Police have made entry into a white cargo van, actually two white cargo vans now in Torrance, California, where there may have been a standoff between the suspect in the Monterey Park mass shooting and law enforcement.You're looking at aerial images right now coming in from KABC. The reason why the helicopter shot here is zooming out and then zooming over to this white van, that is the van where at the top of the hour police smashed the passenger side window and entered the van and may have encountered somebody who is deceased in the driver's side of that vehicle. We did briefly catch a glimpse of that. But then in just the last several minutes, armed tactical police officers with the L.A. County Sheriff's Department entered a second white van. And that is what you're looking at right now. They've made their way to the back of this van, to the backdoors of the van, the shield. You could see the other officers armed there, aiming their rifles at the back of the van. That appeared to be just a check of another similar vehicle in that area. We haven't received any definitive updates from the sheriff's department as to what they were doing with this other white van. But our John Miller was positing just a few moments ago that obviously if other reports are coming in of suspicious white vans that may or may not be connected, police are going to go check those out. And these vans appear to be maybe a half mile to a mile apart from one another. But police, as you can see in this video, went into the back of this second white van and appeared to have determined there was no problem, nothing inside and then went about their business. But CNN's Camila Bernal is with us now. She's with us. Very close to that first white cargo van that we were just telling you about a few moments ago where there appears to be a very real situation going on there and that this may be the suspect connected to the mass shooting in Monterey Park. The L.A. County sheriff was telling reporters about half an hour, 45 minutes ago, yes, quote, \"possibly, this may be the suspect,\" but, Camila, what you could see from your vantage point now? This white van is kind of by itself with the contents spilled out on to the parking lot.",

And trying to make sure that this person who was inside doesn't pose a threat to the community anymore.But we still don't have any conclusion as to whether or not this is indeed the suspect from the Monterey Park shooting. And I suppose that's what comes next. They I.D. the person. They look at person in the driver's seat and take it from there.",

Certainly, the individual -- if there is an individual in the car, I don't know if that's been confirmed or not. They'll certainly I.D. that individual.The reason they went after the second van is because they had not yet verified that this is, in fact, the van that they're looking for. It almost reminds me of 2002, when I was the chief in D.C. and he had the beltway sniper. And we were looking, initially, for a white box truck. I mean, we stopped hundreds of box trucks. And the most common color for a cargo van or a box truck is white. And so, you know, hopefully this is the right one. It is the only one. But as you start to see more and more people come to that van, you see detectives there now, if you see mobile crimes show up, all of those kinds of things, that is a strong indication that this is, in fact, the van that they were looking for.",

With them considering this van, trying to figure out, is it rigged with explosives? Is the individual inside perhaps not dead but still armed and waiting them to make entry to ambush them.They had to go through all of those possibilities. They had to examine different modes of entry. And they made their decision which was to do the entry they did. And then, what you saw after that is they pulled the things out that are blocking their view of what's in the van. They've got a body in the van. And now, they've established there is nothing else that is a threat inside of the van. So, the shift now is from the tactical scene to the crime scene. And that's why you're seeing the tactical teams finish up, put their stuff away, and move out. Because, now, you've got steps. First, sheriff's homicide has to show up at the scene, and we're starting to see them now. Then, the L.A. County coroner is going to have to arrive and establish the identification of the deceased individual who is in that van. That's a critical moment. Because then they'll determine, is this the individual that they're looking for? They do have a named suspect. He's a male in his 70s. He lives about two hours east on the 710 Freeway. And he has been the focus of the investigation since earlier this morning. If they determine that the individual, who's deceased in the van. That they tried to do the car stop on. They heard a single gunshot. And then, it turned into this standoff until they could render that van safe and make entry. If they determine that that is their suspect, then they're in a much better position to say, OK, we have the person we're looking for. Now, we've got to fan this out and determine, is it just one person? As the sheriff said earlier, are there others involved? And this is the process. But what you're watching is a very controlled tactical scene slow down into the homicide investigation that this is at the center of.",

These people pouring out, seeing gunshot victims. They went into this dance hall, saw gunshot victims there. Ten pronounced dead on the scene. Five women, five men. And then, the sheriff says 20, 30 minutes later, a dance hall in Alhambra, a city to the north of us, a description of an Asian male suspect there as well. With people actually wrestling and tackling him. This time, taking control over his weapon. And So, the police have recovered the weapon from that scene. And when asked for more details about the weapon that they have from Alhambra and what they believe from what they're seeing here in Monterey Park, the sheriff would only say that he does not believe it was an assault weapon.

Trying to understand why this person would have done this and how safe they are going to other lunar new year festivities for rest of day. Perhaps the other things happening this week. This is supposed to be the time for the largest parties in Asia. This is the biggest holiday of the year. So, a lot of people having a long, long break, like my dad.
