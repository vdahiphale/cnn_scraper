Pecker was part of an effort to stop Daniels from going public.Fast forward now. Here we are in 2023, and prosecutors seem to be moving forward. The New York Times reporting the Manhattan DA actually began presenting to a grand jury yesterday. Joining us now, Federal Criminal Defense Attorney and Columbia Law School Lecturer at Caroline Polisi. So, Caroline, this is maybe the longest running criminal investigation for the former President. The payment happened years ago. Why do you see this move happening now to go to the grand jury?",
