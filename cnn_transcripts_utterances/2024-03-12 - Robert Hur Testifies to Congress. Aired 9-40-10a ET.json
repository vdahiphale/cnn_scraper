And we should note in moments Robert Hur will face Congress as a private citizen, having finished his work with the Department of Justice.And he just arrived -- you're seeing some pictures right there on your screen -- up on Capitol Hill. He will argue that he, quote, \"did not disparage the president unfairly,\" end quote, by calling him a quote, \"elderly man with a poor memory.\" That political bombshell was dropped in Hur's damning report that concluded Biden did mishandle some classified information. Hur, of course, decided not to pursue charges. That enraged Republicans, who wanted to see the president indicted in the case, and Democrats accuse Hur of taking cheap shots at the president's age and argue the Biden case was never as serious as the allegations against Donald Trump, who was charged over his handling of classified documents. CNN's Paula Reid and Kasie Hunt are here with me up on Capitol Hill. Good morning to you guys. But first, let me start with CNN's senior justice correspondent Evan Perez. Evan, you just got access to transcripts of President Biden's interview with investigators. I was just flipping through some of this. This is very, very interesting. What did it reveal?",

      "sentences": "Well, Jim, I mean one of the things that come - we come away from is, obviously, the president repeatedly says that he doesn't remember how boxes of documents ended up at his home in Delaware, his rented home in Virginia, or his private office in -- in the University of Pennsylvania here in Washington. He said he left it to aides to be able to handle some of these things.But obviously the big -- the big thing that stood out from the report, the Rob Hur report, at least a few weeks ago, was a mention that he didn't seem to remember what year his son, Beau Biden, died. Obviously, that's a big part of the biography of President Biden. And I'll read you just a part of what - what -- how that interaction went to provide a context of that. You know, it's part of a discussion of how did he keep track of documents that he was using. This is at the time that he had left the vice presidency. And Joe Biden said, you know -- puts the context of 2017, 2018. And then he says, \"remember, in this timeframe, my son is either deployed or is dying.\" Again, he's the one that brings up Beau Biden in this context. And then he says, \"what month did Beau die? Oh God, May 30th.\" And then someone in the room - several people in from say \"2015.\" And, you know, what comes across there is, obviously, he doesn't -- he doesn't say the day, but he is the one that brings it up. And he's also the one that -- that says May 30th. And, you know, as you look through this this transcript, again repeatedly he says he doesn't know how things got to where they - where the FBI found them when they did these searches. He says - there's another interaction with Rob Hur where Rob Hur says, do you remember how these materials got into this box and then how that box got into the garage?\" And Joe Biden says, \"No, I don't remember how it got -- I don't remember how a beat up box got in the garage.\" The tone of the interview. Jim, I should make clear, again, this is from the written transcript, is generally very genial, right? He jokes a lot. There's laughter in the room. It doesn't really come across as adversarial. And I think that's one of the reasons why there was so much surprise by the people around the president at what they saw in the report.",

It was reviewed by the top career people in the Justice Department. And they clearly defended it when the president's lawyers wrote to dispute some of it.And, you know, one of the things that's interesting to me is that, you know,  you've seen a parade of cabinet officials, people around the president, Democrats come out and talk about their interactions with Joe Biden, saying he's very lucid, he's very in command, he's on top of things. [09:45:05] We haven't seen anything like that from Merrick Garland, the attorney general. And I doubt you will. It's just not his style, but I think people around the president have noticed that and I think the fact that, again, the Justice Department has not distanced itself from this report I think speaks loud volumes that they stand by the work of Rob Hur.",

But as we see in this opening statement, he said, look, I had to, quote, show my work. Now we also know Republicans are going to be mad at him because he didn't charge Biden, right? They're going to make the comparison with Trump. I'm told that he is going to remind them that he did not find Biden innocent, but did not believe that he could win at trial. And he believes - Hur believes that if everybody is mad at you, you did your job as special counsel. ACOSTA: Yes, but, you know, Kasie, you know, lots of things should be pointed out here, I suppose. First of all, we have to say this for the, what, ten thousandth time that Biden, when asked for the documents, they got the documents back to the government. When Trump was asked for the documents, lots of other things happen. That did not play out.

That's what was going on here.And, you know, I think, for the Biden team, I mean, my big question is - goes back to that press conference that the president had when this first came out where he was clearly angry, clearly wanted to go and do that, but had he not, would we have been more focused on the substance of what's in here, which is that they ultimately didn't charge him. And, you know, it is worth, I think, especially in light of that, you know, incredible, exclusive that our colleagues Kaitlan Collins and Polantz had, where you have a Trump -- one of the Trump employees in that indictment talking about moving -- talking about essentially what was the cover up, right? And I think the clearest contrast here between the Biden and Trump cases around classified material is, what did they do once it was discovered, right?

They went through the exact chain of command to get those back to where they belonged. They consented to searches and then allowed Biden to do a voluntary interview. Whereas former President Trump, not only did he refuse to give the documents back for months, he allegedly tried to obstruct efforts to get them back. So, that's how he describes the difference.I think there's also differences in the volume of material that we're talking about, but he doesn't get as into that in his report.

I mean words on a page or one thing. They can be misconstrued. The tone is always going to be important. Contexts is going to be very, very key here.I want to hear exactly how the president was actually saying things. What was the climate like in the room in terms of how it was being received. Did Hur have immediate misgivings about the nature of his memory issues? Were there, in fact, memory issues or simply turn of phrases that led him to believe that he was not going to be precise in his testimony or that he couldn't convince a jury. As a lawyer, I want to know, is this witness going to get me where I need to be to meet my burden of proof? Are you going to be able to convey that there is actual criminal conduct afoot, or are you going to be, as he described, a sympathetic, well-meaning elderly man with a poor memory who I cannot assign nefarious actual motives to. That's really important here. And also important I want to find out about is, just how far deep he goes into the idea of the distinction between the conduct of, well, Mike Pence, for example, of Donald Trump, and, of course, Joe Biden, because this is all about what you intended to do here. You can't simply sort of pull the okey-doke on these well-seasoned prosecutors to suggest, oh, were their national security issues in these boxes? I had no idea. He would have to have clear and convincing evidence to suggest that I don't have enough to run on, to go on, and why he said, even if he were not running for office, even if he didn't have this DOJ memo of a sitting president, I still wouldn't have prosecuted him.

John Durham, the last special counsel, did so for a big reason, it allows him to bring in his own private counsel in a way he could not if he were still a Justice Department attorney. So, he sort of gets to speak his mind here.So, a few things jumped out to me from his opening statement. Number one, here, he talks about the independence and how they are separate from the Justice Department and not - and not reporting to the attorney general. Talked about accuracy and fairness and sort of boring Justice Department and prosecutor buzzwords that everybody says and nobody kind of believes. But the big one, he really does take on the memory point, almost recognizing that this was going to be a central point at the hearing. It is but one of hundreds of pages of -- that at one point in the hundreds of pages of his report, but he chose to latch on to that and devotes a few paragraphs to saying, the president chose to make his memory and issue here. I think he's just trying to preempt in anticipating that it's going to be the source of a lot of questioning. And more to the point, he seemed to make an issue of the president's memory because that largely was the reason why, at least according to the report, they did not choose -- charge the president because they felt that the president's ability to testify as a witness would have been compromised because he couldn't have -- they couldn't have established a crime. I - you know, I think it's important for all of us to step back and not fixate on this president's memory issue and focus more on the point that they did not think they had a provable crime. Whatever the basis was, and whatever the reasons are, when a prosecutor doesn't think they can charge someone with a crime and win, they don't bring charges. And I think a lot of this political noise has clouded the way people have approached this report.",

So, you have the idea of the absence of that here. That would have been part of the consideration of this special counsel because, you know, when you have somebody who's committed a crime, you normally do not bring that person -- if it's a criminal context -- before the grand jury. You get everyone around them to figure out what they have done, build your case, and then the time you hear from them is if they want to take the stand in their own defense.",
