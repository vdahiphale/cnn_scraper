It's going to be an easy winter here. Tell us what we can expect.DR. ASHISH JHA, WHITE HOUSE COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS RESPONSE COORDINATOR: Good morning, thanks for having me back. So, yes, so this is obviously a concerning situation, right. We're seeing the rise of three viruses, circulating of three viruses at increasing levels, RSV, influenza, and COVID. The good news here is that we're now powerless against this. For two of them we have very high quality vaccines, both influenza and COVID. So the first and most important thing people can do is go out and get vaccinated because that will keep people, kids, adults, everybody out of the hospital at very high rates. So that is probably the most important thing. And then we know how to manage RSV. Most children, most adults, it's relatively mild. And then small number of kids who did end up getting sick from it, we can take care of it. But we need to make sure those beds are open for those kids, which is why it is really important to protect yourself against influenza and COVID as well.",

What worries me is if we then add influenza and COVID on top of that, that's where I think we can start getting into trouble, but we don't have to. And this is why it's been so important. Look, we can't control everything, but there are things we can control. The two most important things right now are going out and getting the influenza shot, the flu shot, and going out and getting the new updated COVID shot. If people do those two things, then that really reduces the burden on the healthcare system and allows us to focus on taking care of kids with RSV. KEILARsubvariants you're tracking?",

The good news is that they are -- the ones that are circulating and growing here in the United States are all derivatives of BA.5. We have built a BA.5 vaccine. So there is a brand-new vaccine, some people are still learning about it, this is a new bivalent vaccine, and it actually targets BA.5. So I remain pretty confident, I'm very confident that the new vaccines will hold up against the subvariants. But if you're relying on a vaccine you got six months or nine months ago or an infection you got a year to get you through this fall and winter, there is a pretty high likelihood that the new subvariants are going to escape immunity from that.",

I actually have to because my hospital where I used to work required it. Getting a shot once a year, that's for flu, for most Americans, COVID shots now once a year, I think if people did that, they really don't have to think about this as much. They can get through the holiday season safely.

The individual had almost a dozen 30-round high capacity magazines on him. So that's a whole lot of victims there.

This is not a forensic debate where you get scored on points or cogent arguments. It is about voter expectations. And in this debate, because of the health issues that John Fetterman has had, he has very low expectations. Oz, because he is a television personality, has a lot of experience on T.V., has very high expectations.
