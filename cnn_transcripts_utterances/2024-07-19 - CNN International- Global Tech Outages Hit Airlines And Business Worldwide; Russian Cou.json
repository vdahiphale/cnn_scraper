      "sentences": "Well, Fred, I think the big issue here in Asia, like most of the world, is with air travel. There are reports of problems at airports throughout the region, in particular, in Australia and New Zealand. We saw some issues in Hong Kong, especially with these electronic kiosks that we so often use to check in. Also getting some reports of issues at the airport in Taiwan, one of the airports there.A lot of flights operate at this time. It's just after eight o'clock in the evening here in China, after nine o'clock in Japan and South Korea, and there are a lot of these transoceanic flights to the U.S. that depart around now. I don't have specifics. But, do not be surprised if some of those flights are delayed, and then therefore cause delays in the United States. It's something we are monitoring. Some progress appears to be made here and there. But, at one point, major carriers such as Cathay Pacific, which is very dominant in this part of the world, they were experiencing some issues. The other thing I should point out too, Fred, is that it was around two o'clock in the afternoon when a lot of people were working on their computers in their offices across Asia, and they saw this blue warning screen and that is when we got indication here in China, at least, that there was a problem. The good news is, despite some disruptions, especially on the consumer level with -- in Australia, for example, some of the grocery store chains there were having some issues, as you can see, the iconic Skyline here in Beijing, the lights are on. Just a short time ago, a colleague and I, we went out of the Bureau to get something to eat, something to drink, the digital payment services such as Alipay and WeChat Pay, which are so prevalent here in China, because for the most part, this is a cashless society, they were working. Nonetheless, I don't want to make it sound like that everything is OK. The air travel issue in particular, Fred, is going to be a big problem tonight and likely probably tomorrow morning, at least here in Asia.",

And I think this will be very concerning to people that the NHS was deeply impacted, as we understand, the NHS saying that all of their booking systems have been impacted, their GP appointments today, anybody who is going to GP, which is your regular practice doctor that's in your neighborhood, anyone who is going there today could potentially be impacted. One of Europe's largest medical facilities, it's in Germany, it has cancelled all non-emergency operations. I mean, people are talking about how doctors are now just prescribing pen and paper. So, it really is taking you back not having these systems. And yes, as you heard there from Marc, things are starting to resume.But, as you know, here in England and other parts of the country, there has been backlogs when it comes to the NHS and when it comes to medical care. So, again, just like what you're seeing with the airports, that means that waitlist for people grows. Now, we do understand again, things are coming back up. People are beginning to be able to get to see their doctors if they need to, but it's those non-emergency services that are still in process.",

There are some carriers still not really up and running. How bad is the situation right now? What do you think carriers are doing right now to go out and get back up and running again? MARY SCHIAVO, CNN AVIATION ANALYST, &amp; FMR. INSPECTOR GENERAL, U.S. DEPT. OF TRANSPORTATION: Well, the carriers are trying to put the software patch and to fix it. The good news, of course, is this not a cyberattack, but they're trying to get back up and running. Some airlines are back up and running. Some still have a ground stop. And so, at this point, the number of cancellations is under 10 percent. But, given the volume of travel, I mean, every day, we know the millions of passengers in the U.S., that's quite a hit and the lines in certain airports are literally out the door. So, it's having a pretty big impact. People are getting clinging to hope that the fix for the computer problem has been put in place. But, literally, you cannot fly without them. Even though the aircraft and air traffic control have backup systems, you have to have redundancy in the systems more than one computer to do the scheduling, keeping track of the planes, the pilots and flight attendants. I mean, other than putting a bag tag on, it's all computer.",

They were keeping track of bag tags, etcetera. But, it's really not possible because of the laws concerning scheduling of pilots and crew. Literally, even the sequencing is, who gets what takeoff and landing slots, that's all done by computers. So, while people on the ground at the airport can do their best to help people, try to do whatever they can for them, literally, getting a plane off the ground without a computer is virtually impossible. And also in the U.S., there are laws and there are a lot of crackdownsrecently by the United States Department of Transportation that if you do not fly the flight, you must give a full refund. There are deadlines to do that. You must assist with rebooking, etc. So, at least passengers have a few more opportunities for some relief than they had just a couple of years ago. But, it doesn't help because there is no excess in the system. If you miss, if your flight doesn't go, it could be days before you get another flight because there is just no excess capacity anymore. In the olden days, planes would be half full. Now, they're overbooked. So, it's going to be real difficult to cure this.",

Now, for the patches, for the software fix, obviously, they not only have to get it back up and running, but they have to check with all the systems because they are so interrelated with the -- not just the scheduling, but the safety parts of the airline as well. So, even though they get the system back up and running, they could have tens of thousands of passengers to try to rebook.And a phenomenon now in the U.S. is, as several airlines are no longer interconnected with other airlines, they don't have airline agreements. So, if you're booked on one airline and that airline can't get you rebooked for days, you can't just have an airline agreement and use your ticket on another airline. They have to give you a refund and you have to try go book on another airline yourself, and that says somewhat -- that's different in the United States and it had been in the past, but it's allowed by law.",

Moments ago, a Russian court found him guilty of espionage. You can see Mr. Gershkovich there inside of that glass box that they stick people into in Russia, found guilty of espionage and sentenced him to 16 years in a maximum security prison. Moscow had accused Gershkovich of spying for the CIA. The Wall Street Journal and the U.S. government strongly denied those charges, continue to do so, and Gershkovich pleaded not guilty.Salma Abdelaziz is still with us.

Who does Russia want in exchange for Paul Whelan and Evan Gershkovich, as you mentioned?

Now, this complicates negotiations further, because if indeed that is the individual that Russia has determined that they do want in exchange for the journalist, for Evan Gershkovich, well, that involves a third country now having to step into these negotiations. So, it becomes extremely complicated.But again, we did see these prisoner swaps occurring 2022. You'll remember, of course, Brittney Griner, the basketball star, being released. We've seen other releases. So, it is possible. And his lawyers have expressed hope. But, it is about that continuing relationship between Moscow and D.C. Does this disintegrate further? Does it put more Westerners at risk? Does this in a way de facto make this prisoner swap deal, something that we continue to see in the future?",

And it's also important to understand when it comes to journalism, when it comes to the media, the restrictions that have been put on them inside Russia since the start of the Ukraine war. So, how much more difficult will be in the future to report out of Russia when we see cases like this, Evan Gershkovich, over a year now in prison, now facing 16 years, potentially, in a prison colony in Russia, awaiting, of course, that promise from the White House to bring him home.",

And it's hard to imagine, isn't it, being thrust into that position.And so, under those circumstances, I expect that Evan Gershkovich has suffered a great deal of stress. And to some extent, I think it showed on his face. I mean, he has obviously lost weight quite a lot from when he was first detained. His head, when I last saw him, was shaved. I think it is now as well. When I tried to sort of speak to him in the court, he was sort of paraded as the accused often are in that fishbowl, the aquarium, as people call it inside Russia, inside the courthouse, and you're not allowed to say anything to them. You just have to stand in front of them and sort of take photographs and you're not allowed to engage. And so, that's when -- when I attempted to do that, I was kicked out of the courtroom. But, yes, I mean, look, the fact that I think that probably if he is going to stay positive in all of this, he has to focus on the fact that there are contacts that have been underway for some time, they're continuing now, between the special services of the Russians and of the United States to try and broker some kind of an arrangement, some kind of deal to get Evan Gershkovich out. That -- in fact, the verdict has come down, let me reiterate that, sort of removes a bureaucratic obstacle that the Russians had put in place to allow that to happen. And so, that's a good thing.

And so, when you write a piece of software and you kind of -- it's designed to upgrade a system, what it effectively does is overwrite the code that was already there. So, our phones are upgrading all the time. If you've got an Apple or you've got an Android, it kind of updates itself and it can never see any problems. It just goes through without any issues. In this case, this is a piece of malware -- it's a kind of antivirus software. The irony of that is quite interesting. It's a malware -- anti-malware package, which just didn't update properly. And when that happens, the system is kind of like, oh, which piece of software should I be running? Is it the new one? Is it the old one? And it gets confused, and it just fails to function.",

And I -- we presume that they've got backups, and that they can just go back to the backup. In many cases, that doesn't take long. It can be five, 10, 15 minutes. But, in some cases, it can be a lot more complicated than that. For example, if it's a server, rather than just a typical Windows machine, it will take a lot longer than five minutes to go backwards to the version that was running last night, get that backup, reboot, and fingers crossed, it should all be backup. So, I've got an easy answer for that, probably five minutes for some systems. It could be hours for others, I'm afraid.",

Moments ago, a Russian court found Evan Gershkovich guilty of espionage and sentenced him to 16 years in prison. Moscow had accused Gershkovich of spying for the CIA. He is the first American journalist arrested on spying charges in Russia since the Cold War. The Wall Street Journal and the U.S. government strongly deny those charges, and Gershkovich pleaded not guilty.Back to American politics, for the third time, Donald Trump has accepted the Republican nomination for President. He did it on Thursday night with the longest nomination speech in U.S. history, breaking his own record from 2016. Trump's spoke for more than an hour and a half, and largely avoided naming his rival Joe Biden directly. He began his speech by calling for unity after recounting his near- death experience over the weekend. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

With me, what's going on in Israel never would have happened. Hamas' attack never would have happened.
