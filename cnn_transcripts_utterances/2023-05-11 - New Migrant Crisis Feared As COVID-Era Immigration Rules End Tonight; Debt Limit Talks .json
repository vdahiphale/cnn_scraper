The White House is taking unprecedented measures as federal and local officials are preparing for the worst.Also this hour, high-stakes debt limit negotiations between President Biden and congressional leaders have been called off for tomorrow. We're going to tell you what we're learning about the postponement as the country is another day closer to a potential default. And new Republican reaction in Donald Trump's controversial positions and brazen lies at CNN's town hall in New Hampshire. The state's governor, a Republican, Chris Sununu, weighs in as a prominent Trump critic and a potential 2024 rival. Welcome to our viewers here in the United States and around the world. I'm Wolf Blitzer. You are in THE SITUATION ROOM. The countdown is on at the southern border, the Trump-era immigration policy known as Title 42 ends in less than six hours. We have correspondents on both sides of the border. Rosa Flores is in Texas. David culver is in Mexico. Rosa, you have been following the story closely.

But the Biden administration has been preparing for this for more than a year now. They have implemented a variety of policies, the app, there is various parole policies.Now, there is a lot of minutia. I will boil it down to this. There are a lot of policies that the Biden administration has launched that what they do is they provide legal pathways for migrants to enter into the United States. But here is the thing, it also has built in legal consequences for these migrants. And DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas says that the message is very simple. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Now, I'm told in terms of what has been happening in these early stage negotiations that, really, this has been focused on trying to narrow the scope of the negotiations, to try and more clearly define the contours around where a deal can be achieved in terms of potential spending cuts going forward. As part of that, I'm told that the White House has been making very clear what they will not negotiate on. And at the top of the list of the items that they are taking off the table is the president's landmark Inflation Reduction Act, which made historic investments in combating climate change that House Republicans have already targeted as part of their bill. Student debt forgiveness, Medicaid and SNAP benefits, I'm told, are also things that the White House considers as off the table here. But, ultimately, there is a growing acknowledgement in the building behind me, Wolf, that they will need to accept spending cuts. They will need to come to some sort of agreement that results in the federal budget having less money over the next coming years. But the White House also wants to ensure that they don't find themselves right back here next year. And so they are pushing for a debt ceiling increase that would last at least a year. But, again, as part of that, they are willing to entertain some kind of spending caps, but not spending caps that would last for ten years or something long-term like that. Wolf?",

They've also talked about trying to expand Medicare's ability to negotiate drug prices. That could also result in more savings for the federal government. But what's really interesting here, Wolf, overall is that, look, the president is still maintaining this line that he will not negotiate over defaults. He will not negotiate over the debt ceiling. And yet, in parallel, we are seeing these very intense negotiations taking place over federal spending. And that is ultimately where a potential agreement could come here. McCarthy is going to continue to say that he is negotiating over the debt ceiling, and as part of that, he is going to get spending cuts. The White House is going to be able to say that they negotiated purely over the federal budget, not the debt ceiling. But at the end of the day, if there is an agreement, it will be along the lines of the kind of the spending cuts that both sides are clearly looking at here. Wolf?",

Congressman, thanks so much for joining us. With a few weeks until a potential, God forbid, default of the nation's debt, how concerned are you to hear tomorrow's planned meeting between President Biden and the congressional leadership has now been pushed back? REP. ADAM SCHIFF (D-CA):  Well, I'm mostly concerned with the Republicans that continue to insist that they will default on the debt if they don't get the draconian budget that they want. They are more than content to have the debt ceiling raised while Trump was president. They weren't threatening to derail the economy at that time. But now they want to use this as a big bludgeon and their continued insistence on that really threatens from the perspective of Californians the social security checks of about 6 million Californians. Their budget alone would threaten millions of visits to the V.A. in California by veterans. So, they're basically saying, pick your poison. We can cut veterans' benefits, we could cut food for people who are hungry or we are going to take the economy over the cliff and cost Californians and people around the country about 20,000 of their retirement savings.",

We just need to be able to vote. He should schedule a vote on a clean debt ceiling and that would resolve that and, separately, we'll debate the budget.

That would be a disaster for the country, indeed.Turning to the end of what's called Title 42, Congressman, the Biden administration is known for two years that this policy would eventually end. So, why are they just now scrambling to implement new measures to deal with this surge? SCHIFF:  Well, there was some uncertainty in the courts about when it would come to an end. Now, I favored it to coming to an end. But I think that what they are trying to do in surging -- you know, surging folks from the guard to the border to help with ministerial tasks, not with law enforcement, will provide additional resources. We are also going to have to surge resources to some of these communities along border that, for a long time, have been, you know, making their shelter and food and other humanitarian supplies available to migrants. These communities will also need help. And we ought to be treating migrants, you know, which, I think, warm hearts because of what they have gone through to get there, I don't think we should be treating them like criminals. So, it's a big task. It's been big for the last couple of administrations. But what we need most of all is a comprehensive approach to our immigration policy that reflects the values of the country and that we have been pushing as Democrats for a long time, but we haven't found a willing partner in the GOP.",

Their border plan would just go back to the Trump-era of trying to build a wall, trying to separate kids from their families, trying to turn people who are fleeing to this country because it's unsafe for them at home into criminals. This is certainly not the answer. But it's the only answer they have been giving now for years.I do wish there was some good faith like there was back in the days of George W. Bush and a realization that the system is broken. It's going to take both parties to fix it.

So, the calculus is, number one, what happened prior to the video that we've all seen and what was the scene that led up to this? Number two, what was going on sort of in the circumstances around involving other people and so on? What jurors and prosecutors are going to have to assess here is the reasonableness, and that's a word out of the New York State law, of the actions in taking someone's life.

Did he have other choices? Could he have removed himself from the situation rather than using this chokehold, a chokehold we know that has been outlawed by police departments, including in New York City? And I have a real concern, Wolf, about the way this case is being reported. So much evidence -- not evidence, so much information about Jordan Neely, his mental health issue, his criminal background, but not very much information being told about Daniel Penny. It's almost as if Daniel Penny had this information when he made the decision to put Jordan in the chokehold, and we know he did not.

He was saying -- he was yelling, according to the witnesses' statements to police, I don't mind going to jail, I don't care if I do life, I'm hungry, I'm thirsty, he takes off his jacket at some point and throws it on the ground and then balls his hands into fists, according to the reports that were taken by police from the less than a dozen people that were in that train car. And according to the statements of Daniel Penny, he says, when I saw him ball his fists up, I thought he was going to hit somebody and I sought intervene.I mean, I think Elliott's point and Areva's point is the grand jury or a petty jury is going to have to decide what was going through his mind and did he intend to kill this man or did he have reckless regard to the idea that this sustained chokehold was going to lead to his death. One of the factors you will hear about in this case from a defense, as it goes forward, is that that's how he was trained as a Marine to knock someone out, not cause their death, which is documented in the training material.

That seems at this point to poke holes in the self-defense argument. But, again, all we've seen here is what appears to be a three-minute video of a seven-minute confrontation, based on some estimates. So, there is still more evidence that needs to be filled in.
