CNN has confirmed this through an analysis of satellite images. But the whereabouts of Wagner's leader who staged a brief rebellion against Russian leadership last month remains unknown. Meanwhile in southern Ukraine, Russian forces have launched drone and missile strikes overnight against the Black Sea port city of Odessa. It came after Ukraine used naval drones to attack the bridge connecting mainland Russia and occupied Crimea. And Russia ended the Black Sea grain deal.

      "sentences": "First actual view of what we believe to be Wagner fighters. I want to show you some of the images so as to try and explain what we're seeing. This is satellite imagery that shows -- I think you can see sort of the road looping around that -- that's an off-ramp from a highway heading into this military base in Belarus there. You can see a line of cars along that straight road through the middle of the picture heading into the base. We believe those are cars related the Wagner private military company because our team was managed to match them up with social media video, previously posted, showing a line of cars, a convoy -- this is it -- stopped at a highway in Russia flying Wagner flags.Now what's striking about this one, the shear number of these vehicles that we think there's about 115 different vehicles in this convoy. Separately from that, we've been able to geo locate two more social media videos showing new convoys, each of them with around a hundred or so vehicles on highways in Russia heading we believe toward Belarus. So this suggests that Wagner fighters are now building up their numbers at this previously abandoned camp in Belarus. Our team has visited this camp just a couple weeks ago and that there weren't any Wagner fighters there at that point. So this appears to be a relatively new development. We did have reporting around this. Ukrainian border guards have in fact believe that Wagner was already in Belarus. Belarus itself has said that Wagner was training its forces. But is important because even though, you know, President Putin says Wagner doesn't exist, it hints at potentially, you know, they're now close to the Ukrainian border -- a future role in the conflict. Also a destabilizing force in the region. So it doesn't even say I'll keep watching.",

Saying that Russia -- Russia's goal is to, you know, inflict world hunger. Odessa is of course, the biggest port in Ukraine. It was one of the three ports that were included in that grain deal. Six Kalibr cruise missiles -- according to the Ukrainian military -- were launched at Odessa. They say that they shot them all down along. They say they also shot down a number of drones north of Odessa and Mala Vyska -- another grain producing region. Damage caused were reported to the city's private homes. One man hospitalized in Odessa.So a relatively large attack although most of it appears to have been thwarted. But it speaks to not only this ongoing pattern that we see from Russia of attacks but also potentially this revenge that Putin hinted at on Monday for the attack on the Kerch Bridge. And the fallout from this grain deal international alarm is mounting. Though of course Russia has left the door open to potentially rejoining they say if their conditions are met. We just don't know exactly what the threshold of that would be.",

She is going to oversee this case from here all the way through a possible trial. And every decision that she makes could impact how this case ultimately turns out.Now Tuesday's hearing is focused on how classified material is going to be handled during this case. But she's also told the parties to come prepared to talk about a possible trial date. Right now there's a tentative date for next month on the calendar, but that's not realistic. It's just a place holder. The special counsel has said it is ready to go to trial in December. But defense attorneys for the former president say it's premature to even schedule a date. They would like to delay this until after the 2024 election. So all eyes will be on Judge Cannon for which way she leans on that question. Now, the special counsel has also asked the judge to rule on some rules and guidelines about how classified evidence should be handled. Like any case, prosecutors have to hand over all the evidence they've collected to defense attorneys as part of the discovery process. But here in addition to the usual evidence, you also have classified materials. Prosecutors want some restrictions on the extent to which those materials can be shared with the defendants. But defense attorneys have raised some objections. It's unclear though what exactly they object to. But the longer it takes the parties to agree upon these guidelines for how classified materials are shared, that could potentially delay this trial. And of course that would be a win for the defense attorneys. So all eyes are on Judge Cannon on Tuesday. Paula Reid, CNN, Ft. Pierce, Florida. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
