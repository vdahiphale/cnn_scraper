Those charges include wire fraud, money laundering, theft of public funds and making false statements to the House of Representatives.Prosecutors say he solicited funds under false pretense and he used the money for personal expenses, such as designer clothing and credit card payments. For more on what the indictment includes, I want to get to correspondent Brynn Gingras. She's been outside of the courthouse this morning, where Santos has been taken. What else does this indictment, which is 20 pages long, say?",

      "sentences": "Yes. It's very detailed, Sara; 13 pages, as you said. It is anything from fraud to money laundering. It is the culmination of a months long investigation and, again, it is quite detailed.Some of the allegations are surrounding his 2020 run for Congress, which he didn't get the seat, and the 2022 run for Congress, which is why he is now the third district congressman. And in those allegations and in that indictment it says he operated a company and using a consultant which basically encouraged political supporters to contribute to his campaign. But instead that money would go to his personal benefit. He used it to make a car payment. He used it to buy designer clothing, as you said. Other allegations in this indictment unfold about personal -- I'm sorry, unemployment benefits he received. Meanwhile he was holding a $120,000 salary from a job but still getting unemployment benefits from the State of New York, totaling about $24,000 during the COVID pandemic. And then there are also allegations in this indictment and charges regarding a financial disclosure statement made to the House of Representatives, falsifying those statements and sometimes overinflating what his salary was; other times, underestimating what his salary was. So pretty detailed and in it you can see that prosecutors and investigators used text messages to support their claims, also had informants who appeared before the grand jury. And this grand jury returned that indictment just yesterday with these 13 charges. What we know about George Santos currently is that he turned himself in, according to my colleague, Mike Morales, to the Mineola FBI Department here, not far from where we are. And he was brought here to the federal courthouse, where we expect to see him in front of a judge on these charges. I want to read you a statement from the U.S. attorney, Breon Peace. It says, \"Taken together the allegations in the indictment charge Santos with relying on repeated dishonesty and deception to ascend to the halls of Congress and enrich himself. \"He used political contributions to line his pockets, unlawfully applied for unemployment benefits that should have gone to New Yorkers, who had lost their jobs due to the pandemic, and lied to the House of Representatives.\" So that pretty much sums it up there.  And this after all the lies that have been just following him, right, Sara, ever since last year, where there are now constituents who, before and now, are doubling down, saying he should leave office.",

He raised money from donors, saying I need your donations, and then he basically pocketed it. It's wire fraud if you use any sort of telecommunications device -- a phone, email et cetera. So that's one group of charges.Money laundering, he took some of that money and he wire transferred it over to his own bank accounts. And that means he's intending to cover up what happened. Third, unemployment fraud, this is really remarkable. He ripped off a fund set up for people who were suffering because of COVID financially, said I'm not working when he was working. I think the papers will prove that out. And then finally made false statements to Congress, at various times overstated and understated, different instances, his sources of income.

Our use of our immigration enforcement authorities under Title 8 of the United States Code means tougher consequences for people who cross the border illegally.Unlike under Title 42, an individual who is removed under Title 8 is subject to at least a five-year bar on re-entry into the United States and can face criminal prosecution if they attempt to cross again. Smugglers have long been hard at work, spreading false information that the border will be open after May 11th. It will not be. They are lying. To people who are thinking of making the journey to our southern border, know this:  the smugglers care only about profit, not people. They do not care about you or your well-being. Do not believe their lies. Do not risk your life and your life savings only to be removed from the United States if -- if -- and when you arrive here. Today, we are beginning a new digital advertising campaign in Central and South America to counter the lies of the smugglers with accurate information about U.S. immigration laws. This campaign adds to our extensive, ongoing communications efforts in the region. As you can see by the images before us of removal flights and encounters with our Border Patrol agents, we are making it very clear that our border is not open, that crossing irregularly is against the law and that those who are not eligible for relief will be quickly returned. Do not listen to the lies of the smugglers. This is what will happen to you. You will be returned. Today, alongside the Department of Justice, we are finalizing a new rule to encourage individuals to use available, lawful, safe and orderly pathways to enter the United States. The rule presumes that those who do not use lawful pathways to enter the United States are ineligible for asylum. It allows the United States, it allows us to remove individuals who do not establish a reasonable fear of persecution in the country of removal. Non-citizens can rebut this presumption only in very limited circumstances; for example, if they have used our lawful pathways or sought asylum or protection in another country, through which they have traveled and were denied. This rule goes into effect once the Title 42 public health order terminates tomorrow on Thursday at 11:59 pm Eastern time. What I have just described are only a few elements of an expansive effort that began in 2021 to prepare for this transition from the Title 42 public health authority to our tougher immigration enforcement authorities. In addition to obtaining the first increase in Border Patrol agent hiring in over a decade, the first in over a decade, we are in the process of surging personnel to the border, including more than 1,400 DHS personnel, 1,000 processing coordinates and an additional 1,500 Department of Defense personnel. All of these individuals will allow our law enforcement officers to stay in the field and focus on their critical mission. We are delivering on tougher consequences for unlawful entry, including the return, removal and expulsion of more than 665,000 people during the first half of this fiscal year. We are conducting dozens of removal flights per week and we continue to increase our removal flight capability. We are increasing our efficiency and reducing processing times at the border. We launched the CBP1 app, which, in its first four months, helped 83,000 individuals schedule an appointment at a port of entry. And we are taking steps to expand available appointments. We bolstered the capacity of local governments and NGOs. Just last week, we announced a distribution of an additional $332 million to support communities along the southern border and in the interior of our country. [11:20:00] MAYORKAS:  We are leading an unprecedented law enforcement disruption campaign that has led to the arrest of nearly 10,000 smugglers, who profit from vulnerable immigrants. Knowing that this is a regional challenge that requires a regional solution, we continue to work with countries throughout the Americas to deter irregular migration. This includes a coordinated campaign with Colombia and Panama to prevent individuals from following ruthless smugglers into the very dangerous dead end. And we are working with our partners in Mexico regularly on a range of issues. We are a nation of immigrants. We are also a nation of laws. Our immigration laws today are outdated. The solutions we are implementing are the best available within our current legal authority. But they are short-term solutions to a decades-old problem. The kind of migration we continue to see today requires more resources, resources we have requested and have not received; clearer authority and modernized processes that only Congress can deliver. We urge it to do so. Now I think we'll take some questions.",
