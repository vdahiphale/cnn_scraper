They say three armed men opened fire on people who were stuck in a traffic jam near an Israeli settlement. Both Hamas and Islamic Jihad have praised the shooting. Neither, though, has claimed responsibility. The region massively on edge as raids by Israeli forces have increased over the past few weeks. Meantime, as the war in Gaza rages on, the head of the CIA is expected to fly to Paris on Friday, with sources saying that he will take part in talks to secure the release of hostages held in Gaza. The U.S., in partnership with Egypt and Qatar, is working to reach a deal before the Muslim holy month of Ramadan begins next month. Israeli war cabinet minister Benny Gantz says there is potential for a deal to move forward. But added that Israel will push ahead with a ground operation in Rafah in southern Gaza if there is no breakthrough on hostages. Jeremy Diamond is in Tel Aviv with the latest while Katie Bo Lillis has reaction from Washington. I want to start with you, Jeremy. I actually want to start with you on the West Bank incident, the deadly incident that we've been reporting on. What are the details as we understand them?",

We do know that there may be -- just may be some progress now on a potential for a temporary truce and the release of hostages held in Gaza, mainly by Hamas but also by other militant groups. What do we understand to be the details as we speak? Certainly we know the progress is sufficient, it seems, for the CIA director to be flying to talk to mediators in Paris this weekend.",

The Israeli government has said that they will commence a ground operation into Rafah if a deal is not reached by the beginning of Ramadan on March 10th to release additional hostages held by Hamas and others. Of course, there are 1.5 million displaced Gazans who have fled to Rafah since the beginning of hostilities in October. And one diplomat familiar with the negotiations told my colleagues, Alex Marquardt and MJ Lee, that, if that ground operation does go for forward, quote, \"we can forget about a deal happening.\" So the stakes really could not be higher here, which I think is part of the reason why you've seen President Biden dispatch his CIA director, Bill Burns, yet again to be the point person for these negotiations. He really has been on a rotator flight back and forth in between Washington and Europe and the Middle East, too, to meet with his Egyptian, Qatari and Israeli counterparts, the Qataris being the key mediator with Hamas. We also have seen a real flurry of other senior national security officials from the Biden administration traveling to the region to work on this issue. White House Middle East coordinator Brett McGurk was in Cairo yesterday and is in Israel today, meeting with prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu, also working on this issue. Now the United States has emphasized to Israel that, if you move forward with this ground operation, you need to guarantee civilian safety in Rafah; an almost impossible thing to guarantee in practical terms in the real world. So there really is no plan B here. We do understand that some progress has been made in negotiations. There is sort of a series of proposals that negotiators have been working on. But all sort of coalescing around this idea of a series of phased pauses in exchange for releases. But still lots of sticking points here, in particularly the Israeli willingness to accept some of Hamas' demands. And so we will see what comes out of this meeting on Friday -- Becky.",

And if you do anything to sort of support the war, support the Ukrainians in the war in Ukraine, then you can open yourself up to charges of treason, which is exactly the situation it seems that has Ksenia Karelina has found herself in. I mean, it's also more worrying because as a U.S. joint citizen, Russian joint citizen, U.S.  diplomats aren't able to get the kind of access to her that they might normally be able to get to it, to a U.S. citizen because Russia regards her as Russian.

But we do know the president has some very stark differences and critiques when it comes to Russian president Vladimir Putin. Just these comments came last night in an off-camera fundraiser in San Francisco. Oftentimes, the president tends to speak a little bit more freely in those types of venues when the cameras aren't rolling and he can be a little more unplugged. Now the president was speaking about the threats facing the country, including the threat of climate change. And then he veered off course a little bit to make the reference to Putin, calling him a, quote, \"crazy SOB.\" But it really comes on the heels of a few moments that the president has expressed quite a bit of frustration toward Putin about. First, it's the war against Ukraine, which is set to hit its two-year mark over the weekend, and most recently, the death of Alexei Navalny. President Biden has specifically blamed Putin and his thugs for that. And he's also trying to use this moment, drawing on Putin, putting Putin in the spotlight, to also draw a sharper contrast with former president Donald Trump. The president has really a portrayed Trump's approach to Putin as shameful, dumb and un-American. He's taken personal insult to the fact that Trump has said that Putin should do whatever the hell he wants to NATO countries not meeting their obligations. He's also frustrated that Trump has not called out and condemned Putin specifically for the death of Alexei Navalny. That is something President Biden also spoke about in his remarks last night, saying that he -- that Trump is essentially comparing himself to Navalny. And saying that, because our country's become a communist country, he was persecuted just like Navalny was persecuted, where the hell does this come from? So it all comes as he's trying to draw this contrast with Trump over his approach to Russia, over his approach to Ukraine. Of course, as you noted, the Kremlin did not respond too kindly to the president's remarks.

The biomass is over 1,000, I think 500 kilos factor, which is well-above a healthy baseline for a reef. ASHER (voice-over):  But the protected status doesn't restrict visitors from setting foot on the island. In fact, it relies on them. TAYLOR (voice-over):  The idea is that we consume these areas for education purposes so that we can bring schoolchildren, community members over to Chumbe to learn about the natural environments. ASHER (voice-over):  Guests from around the globe are welcome to visit and stay on the island too. And here you won't have to worry about beating the crowds.",

And the idea is that a roof is all one rainwater harvesting collection system. ASHER (voice-over):  From water supply to solar powered electricity. TAYLOR (voice-over):  So you see the wall is covered in this. It's not paint, it's chalk. So the idea is the chalk goes into the environment. It's completely inert. ASHER (voice-over):  Everything is designed with sustainability in mind. TAYLOR (voice-over):  Ecotourism means that you're looking at ways that you can reduce your energy, reduce your water consumption, reduce your impact on the environment. All of these three things are really important for conservation. ASHER (voice-over):  According to its official website, Chumbe Island Coral Park was the first financially self-sustaining marine protected area in the world. A model they hope will encourage those who visit and beyond. TAYLOR (voice-over):  So them coming to Chumbe and seeing the ecoarchitecture, seeing the rainwater harvesting, seeing the solar panels, it's all really important that they can then go home and say, you know what, I can get solar, you know. Or maybe I can get an electric car or maybe I go and support the local tree planting organization in my hometown, something like that. And that's at the heart of Chumbe, which I think is very unique.

Hear it from the man behind the magic himself, the director, Denis Villeneuve, and two of the film's stars, who I got to sit down with to share what was a magical experience. Have a look at this. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) (MUSIC PLAYING) ANDERSON (voice-over):  An ethereal masterpiece, one of the most highly anticipated films of the year, \"Dune:  Part Two\" has landed and is already making waves -- or should I say sandstorms. The second part of Denis Villeneuve's adaptation of Frank Herbert's 1965 novel is being described by some as one of the science fiction films of all time. And creating magic like that isn't easy.",
