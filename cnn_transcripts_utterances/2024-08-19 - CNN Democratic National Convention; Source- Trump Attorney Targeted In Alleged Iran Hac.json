I'm Jake Tapper, live here at the Democratic National Convention. Vice President Kamala Harris, assuming the Democratic mantle, officially, president Joe Biden, about to relinquish it. Today, Biden will ceremonial -- ceremonially hand the reins of the party over to his vice president after an election shakeup for the ages, which believe it or not occurred only for weeks and one day ago. Mr. Biden just landed in Chicago for his big speech. We're some reporting that the president (AUDIO GAP) it all went down. We'll see tonight if any of that is discernible in his address. The White House says Biden will sketch out his view of the stakes of this election night and call out his predecessor, Donald Trump, by name. As he once again makes his case that Trump is a threat to democracy. President Biden is expected to ask Americans to help defend democracy, one more time in November. The Harris campaign says Biden speech tonight will allow Democrats to celebrate him in his accomplishments. Harris, who became the Democratic nominee, only two weeks ago, will be here in the convention hall tonight to watch Biden as she continues to ride a wave of Democratic momentum to this event. New poll numbers show that Harris is now putting key Sunbelt states back into play and has a narrow lead nationally outside the margin of error for the very first time. Will we see her numbers grow even more? (AUDIO GAP) in the spotlight. And my colleague Erin Burnett is also here in the convention hall -- Erin.",

Shell be speaking and then it will be Ashley Biden, their daughter, and then President Biden will come out and give his speech tonight.And obviously, this is all pretty run of the mill stuff, having the president come out and do a walk-through. But none of this is really because it is just so different than what they thought it was going to look like about a month ago. And what this convention was going to look like and how quickly they've changed it. I will note, you see the first lady as she's standing here right to her right is going to be the California delegation, but straight ahead will be Pennsylvania and then Delaware is right behind that. Typically, these groups have chairs are reserved for the nominee. It's where their home state is, but given the unusual nature of this convention, you are seeing President Biden's home states right there as well. And so, you're looking at the first lady. I can see President Biden from my line of view. He is standing just off to the side watching her as she is getting a feel for the prompters and where shell be standing and just a few hours from now to introduce her husband in a highly pivotal speech in his political career, one of the biggest moments seeing him take the stage, President Biden just waved at me. He's about to walk up to the lectern as well. And I will say, Erin, what we've been hearing from the White House is that he's been fine-tuning this speech all weekend. Obviously, he had a pretty good idea of what it was going to look like a month ago. Now that speech has changed and is going to be focused on his vice president and making the case for her being the nominee. And how quickly he got behind her played a huge role in how quickly she was able to get the party to coalesce behind her to come around her within hours of President Biden announcing a month and a day ago that he had exited the race.

Obviously, it's going to be a very different speech. He said it's going to be a memorable moment. He said he was feeling good about his speech and what it was going to look like.And as we're standing here, the question I asked him was about what his predecessor Donald Trump has been saying about what we are witnessing here, that it is no longer Joe Biden at the top of the ticket, that it is Vice President Harris. Trump has been claiming that it is essentially a coup as he has phrased it, that those are his words, and that they push Biden off the top of the ticket. He's even claimed Joe Biden was going to crash this convention. Obviously, he's appearing to speak here tonight and make the case for his vice president. President Biden made a joke about stability when I asked him about Donald Trump's claims. We couldn't quite hear exactly what he said. But it does speak to what we're about to see here tonight and just how different this moment is going to be. That than what it was a month and a day ago and how different this speech is going to be and obviously as its coming, its not a farewell speech as his aides have underlined for us in multiple moments leading up to this, but it is going to be a moment. He stood up five months left in his presidency. He's obviously still doing a lot of work when it comes to the hostage talks and the ceasefire negotiations that are happening overseas, Erin, but it is a moment where he is essentially passing proverbial torch to his vice president. And I will note that this is the only night you'll see President Biden at this convention. He is leaving after this. He's going on vacation and spending time with his family and just having him here is notable after all, 1968, when Lyndon B. Johnson jumped out of the race, he did not attend his party's convention that year. Obviously, history will be looking very different tonight, Erin.",
