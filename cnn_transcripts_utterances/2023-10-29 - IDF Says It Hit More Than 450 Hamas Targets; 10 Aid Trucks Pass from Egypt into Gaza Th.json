Jim we'll get to in a minute.We're tracking new developments in Gaza. Just moments ago, Israeli military officials said they now believe there are 239 hostages held captive by Hamas. That update comes as Israeli forces enter an expanded second phase of the war against Hamas. Gunfire and explosions heard across Gaza as Israeli troops continue their advance. The IDF says airstrikes hit more than 450 Hamas targets in just the last day including command centers, observation posts and missile launch sites. We're also seeing dramatic scenes from Gaza's second large hospital. The Palestinian Red Crescent said nearby Israeli shelling has caused extensive damage even as 12,000 Gaza civilians are currently sheltering there. Today President Joe Biden spoke with Israeli Prime Minister Benajmin Netanyahu. It was their first conversation since Israel launched its ground operation in Gaza and it comes as U.S. National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan warns there is an elevated risk of the conflict expanding into other parts of the region. Sources tell CNN the U.N. Security Council will hold an emergency meeting tomorrow about Israel's ongoing ground invasion. Meanwhile, more humanitarian aid is slowly making its way into Gaza. Today another 10 aid trucks were able to pass through the Rafah Border Crossing, while communications in Gaza had been partially restored. Our Jim Sciutto is watching the developments play out from Northern Israel. Jim, to you.",

We have since learned from the IDF that there was fire coming into Israel or attempting to come into Israel from Syria. That's just to the northeast of here. And that Israel responded, Israeli forces responded to that with their own strikes.That is the back and forth we've witnessed all day today and throughout the day, the last several days. Crossfire from Lebanon into Israel, Israel into Lebanon, and also back and forth in and to and from Syria. A sign as to how this war could expand into another front. We're watching it closely up here as my colleague Jeremy Diamond is watching things closely from Southern Israel, in Ashkelon with a view into those Israeli operations inside Gaza. What are you seeing and hearing tonight there, Jeremy? We're hearing reports of additional airstrikes.",

I have watched multiple military campaigns in Gaza through the years, and there are similar language used. The thing is that those centers, whether they be tunnels, command centers, rocket-making factories, they may be eliminated, but then they're built again. And those leaders might be killed but then they're replaced.And I wonder, as described, is the Israeli military objective a credible one?",

I mean, this is a problem that the U.S. saw with its own action against, for instance, ISIS. Kill one leader and then another replaces them. That said, U.S. Military operations against ISIS in Iraq and Syria did significantly degrade the group for some time.So I wonder, by what measures will we know if these Israeli military operations, which by all accounts will be bigger, and it seems more lasting, by what measures will we know if they've achieved something new, something different?",

And not just the spectacular raid on October 7th but also things like the rocket attacks that Hamas has been able to do for years now against Israel. So when that kind of thing stops, when those kinds of actions stop or at least become far less frequent, that is a measure of success.The other thing, of course, if the political leadership of Hamas were to change or if that political leadership were to be eliminated, to borrow the Israeli phrase, that would of course change the calculus on the ground as well. But I believe, you know, as you said earlier, that is something that is basically unrealistic because once you eliminate one leader, another one will pop up. The bench is pretty deep in Hamas' ranks and that is something that the Israelis have to take into account. So the measure of success will be a degree of security, a heightened security for the southern part of Israel and really for the entire country, and in order to achieve that, we may not know that they've achieved that success for some time. Things will be quiet for a while, and then if they don't ramp up again, that might be a way to measure that success but it's certainly won't be helpful from a political standpoint for any of the political leadership in Israel or frankly even in the (INAUDIBLE). SCIUTTO: Right. Hezbollah has been showing its presence at least by firing across the border with regularity. Many times a day. Sometimes striking targets. There are also missiles coming into this country from the north and from the south that somehow get through Iron Dome. When you look at Hezbollah, how do you judge their calculations here as to why they haven't come in more forcefully, opened up northern front, or what might trigger them to do so? Because the thinking had been, if Israel goes into Gaza in numbers, then Hezbollah might open up a new front.",

      "sentences": "Yes, this is going to be a very interesting to watch, Jim, because Hezbollah is taking a look at what's going on with Hamas, and Hamas interestingly enough sent a message to Hezbollah begging them to open that second front. It appears that Hezbollah, at least for the moment, is content with just sending a few rockets into Israel at certain moments where they think they can be somewhat supportive of Hamas.They don't want Hamas to fall. They don't want it to disappear because it's a useful counterbalance to what they're doing. But it is also something where Hezbollah believes that at a moment in time, they might feel it's advantageous for them to move forward more aggressively. What we don't know is exactly when that moment in time is. And Hezbollah itself may not know. But between Iran and Hezbollah, they will probably make a decision saying that at this point they will make some specific attacks, they will conduct some specific attacks against Israeli towns or perhaps Israeli military installations. That might be the kind of thing to watch for. The other thing of course to watch for is attacks or continued attacks on U.S. installations or at least installations within our U.S. troops presence in the Middle East. If that continues, then that opens up a whole another series of questions and potentially forces of actions where we really don't know what the end result will be. But they could -- they want to make clear that they don't go into something that results in a reaction that is worse than their action, and something that they can't recover from. They want to avoid that.",

This is an investigation being handled by the Los Angeles Police Department. But a source telling CNN that there is no foul play suspected here. The 911 call came in at 4You mentioned the \"L.A. Times,\" they are reporting that he was found unresponsive in his hot tub. But no official cause of death has been released and normally a complete autopsy and toxicology report could take several weeks. Now his family did release a statement to \"People\" magazine saying they are heartbroken by the tragic loss of their beloved brother and son. And then they went on to say in that statement that he brought joy to the world, not just with his acting, but as a friend. And look, Matthew Perry was someone who wanted to be remembered as someone who helped people. He said he shared a lot of these struggles he had with addiction in order to help others. He detailed them in his memoir that was released in November of 2022 but he was also openly talking about it in interviews as he was emotional and discussing that he was willing to share these things to help others. He also said in interviews that he wanted to be remembered as someone who lived well, someone who loved well, who was a seeker but of course many of us remember him by his acting career. He started out with small roles then landed more prominent roles, and really it was Chandler in \"Friends\" that made him famous, who he was when he died. And so it was that very funny charismatic character and his facial expressions and the way he made people laugh that many are remembering today. The cast of \"Friends\" very close on and off the screen. We have yet to hear from any of the cast members. But there are others in Hollywood who are reacting saying they are devastating, that they are heartbroken. It really was shocking for a lot of people because this is not the news they were expecting, so you're seeing many of the fans paying their tributes and posting them online and really saying that he will be missed. Not just in Hollywood, but by so many who often laughed as they watch \"Friends,\" and you know they're still watching it today because the replays are available. So many, many are able to still laugh with the work that he has left behind -- Fred.",
