I mean, when a killer leaves any sort of message or indicator at a crime scene that might speak to their motive.[20:25:13] KRIS MOHANDIE, FORENSIC PSYCHOLOGIST: I think it speaks exactly to his motive that he has a deep seated grievance may be very well be personal, as it relates to insurance company perhaps even this one. The fact that he said \"delay,\" \"deny\" that you know, obviously relates to how many people experienced insurance companies when it comes to serious claims. And then the fact that he mentioned \"depose\" suggests that he may have been involved in litigation as he sought to pursue, you know, his rights in that system. So, we're talking about a man with a grievance, and I believe it's a personal grievance. I believe he's going to have a connection by virtue of a family member or a loved one who may have been in his perception, is ground up in that system, maybe even died or experienced harm. So, it's very important for this man to get his message out there in this dramatic fashion and to punish the person he's affixed blame to, which is the CEO of this company who he sees as a symbol of these oppressive practices that have resulted in harm to somebody that he loves. So, I think that what we're going to find out about him is that that there is a connection, or at least an identification with that connection. But I think it actually is a personal connection that there was litigation. There's a lot of litigation that goes on with people in these companies and for many people, it's an option of last resort and then they're left with now what do I do when they've lost everything or they perceive that they've lost everything. So, this is a man with an agenda, with a grievance and it was important to get that out there and to leave this behind. And my concern is, is he done? And is there anybody else that he may be wanting to continue this mission with? And all I can say is I'm sure he's out there watching the news, that his best chances of being heard at this point is for himself to turn himself in so that, you know whatever it is that he needs to communicate can be communicated in a more pro-social way rather than this method.",

So, some people will call in. Some people won't. Remember the guy, Frank James, who shot 10 people on the New York City subway two and a half years ago? People didn't call in from Milwaukee or Philadelphia saying, that's Frank James. People called in and tweeted on social media pictures of him walking around the street saying, I don't know who he is, but he just walked by me. So, people react in different ways. I was in the police department and from Shimon Prokupecz got the tweet saying, are you guys seeing this? And we sent units into Canal Street and within a couple of hours had him at the McDonald's.

Now, Daniel Penny, we can say he would not have been the one who would have been directly threatened. There were older people, there were one woman -- young woman who testified was basically crying and had her head down and never experienced anything remotely like that. So he put himself in between Jordan Neely and innocent people on the subway and he may very well have had a knife or a gun or something like that. The problem that Penny had is once he decided to involve himself, it's kind of like in for a penny in for a pound.Once he grabbed the guy, then he doesn't know if the guy's going to pull out a gun or a knife or something like that. So it's like when you look at the video that was entered in evidence, you know, one minute, good guy. Neely is still violently struggling. Second minute, good guy. Third minute, fourth minute, well, maybe not so good. By fifth minute, we're going to prosecute this guy for manslaughter in the second degree and maybe take his life away, maybe send him to jail for 10 to 15, five to 15 years. So I think that's the type of thing the jury is really struggling with right now and they should be struggling with right now. And that's why we ended up today with the jury not being able to reach the verdict for manslaughter in the second degree. And then the D.A. wanted to keep the case alive.

The first thing is I think there's one or more or a faction who say this is self-defense and he was completely justified, that is the defendant in this case, engaging in the action that he engaged in to protect others. And I don't care what you tell me. If you charge with murder, he was justified.If it's manslaughter, justified. Criminally negligent homicide, justified. I think the second issue is there was a lot said in terms of the expert testimony. One of the things you have to prove, as a judge will tell you, is causation. What caused the death? And there was the medical expert from the city who indicated it was a chokehold. And then, of course, the defense said, no, it wasn't. It was the K2, synthetic marijuana, in addition to schizophrenia, in addition to other issues, sickle cell, right, the struggle itself. And as a result of that, there's no causation. So I think there's two built-in problems. And then the second thing I'll say quickly is that, listen, even though they're now deliberating on the criminally negligent homicide, lesser standard because it involves negligence, carelessness, right? The bottom line is I think you're going to still have that faction. And I think we're going to see a similar result to what we saw today, just with respect to a jury being very trouble in making a decision. COOPER: You know, Judge Grasso, as a New Yorker, it is, you know, you're on the subway and you're on one of those cars. And if there's somebody on the car who is, you know, screaming and threatening, it's a scary thing. And as a New Yorker, you know, you want citizens to stand up and help other New Yorkers.
