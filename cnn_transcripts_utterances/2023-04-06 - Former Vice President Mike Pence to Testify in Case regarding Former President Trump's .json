A spokesman for the former vice president says he will not appeal a judge's ruling and order that he must appear before the grand jury that's investigating the insurrection and Trump's efforts to overturn the election. That means Pence could testify about the one-on-one conversations he had with Trump leading up to that day, including what we know is a heated phone call that happened the morning of the riot when Pence refused Trump's efforts to get him to try to block the certification of President Biden's.Plus, a CNN exclusive this morning, as sources are telling CNN that former national security officials have testified that Trump was repeatedly warned he didn't have the authority to seize voting machines as some were encouraging him to do so. CNN's senior legal affairs correspondent Paula Reid is tracking all of this. Paula, Pence going to testify could be potentially game-changing in this investigation.",

He can talk about conversations he had with the former president. And, as you noted, one of the conversations that's going to be a particular interest was that really heated phone call that he had with the former president around the time of the insurrection. Other witnesses we know have discussed that and the grand jury would like to probably hear that particular evidence from his perspective.Now, this would be the first time that he would be cooperating in a criminal investigation against his former boss. Though, it's interesting, he has been given at least one carve out, so questions that he won't have to answer. He won't have to discuss anything related to his official role as president of the Senate on January 6th. That was something that his lawyers had fought for on constitutional grounds. He considers getting that carve out to be a constitutional victory. It's one of the first times the courts have weighed in on this. At this point, we don't know when he will testify, but based on my reporting, I don't expect the former president to appeal this on executive privilege grounds because, as you know, so far, they've been unsuccessful on that pursuit.",

This is an incredible escalation to what we've been seeing here over the past few days. The big question is who is behind these rockets? How many of them have been fired, whether they have caused any damage or injuries?But this is literally happening as I'm speaking. I can feel my phone vibrating with these alerts going off now. Now, I do have to say, a lot of people when they hear southern Lebanon, they think of Hezbollah, but in that part of southern Lebanon, southern western Lebanon, there's quite a few Palestinian refugee camps, so these could be coming from Palestinian militants. But these in the Israeli military's eyes, anything that happens in southern Lebanon happens with the tacit approval of Hezbollah, of course, which is very much backed by Iran, a militant group and its own right. And whenever I speak to Israeli security officials, their biggest concern about security in this region is Hezbollah and is a major confrontation with Hezbollah. So there is a big question right now, who is behind this? Will the Israeli military respond? And not even will they, but how will they respond? And could this escalate into the full out war with Hezbollah that all the security officials I speak to are so concerned about. The reason being Hezbollah's arsenal is much more powerful than what we see with the likes of the Hamas militant group from Gaza. This is the major concern -- I cannot overestimate how this is the major concern for Israeli security officials is an all-out war with Hezbollah. So we're going to be watching this space very carefully. But as I as I'm seeing it right now, a barrage of rockets coming from southern Lebanon into northern Israel as we speak, Don.",

These are very real political implications of her move and a very rare political defection. In announcing that she's going from Democrat to Republican, it gives much more control to the Republican Party in this state. Now, in her, making this big political announcement was interesting to note that she somewhat blasted the Democrats in the state saying she went -- alienated from the Democratic Party, feeling -- saying that she felt like it was unrecognizable to her, intimating essentially that the party she believes has gone too far to the left. Now, this does hand Republicans much more power in the statehouse. This now secures Republicans having a veto-proof supermajority in the house. They already had that situation in the Senate. So, this assures now that both chambers, the House and Senate, in the North Carolina State House has the ability to override vetoes from the Democratic governor. This essentially sets Republicans up on a glide path to get their legislative agenda passed. And we'll see that power dynamic really starts to shift very quickly.
