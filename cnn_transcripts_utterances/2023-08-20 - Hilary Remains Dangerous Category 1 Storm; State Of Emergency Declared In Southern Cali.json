ALLISON CHINCHAR, CNN METEOROLOGIST: Right. So we're still continuing to see the storm weaken as it gradually pushes into those colder waters that was expected. That's going to continue to be the forecast as we go through the rest of the day today. Sustained winds right now 85 miles per hour. It's picking up its pace now moving 21 miles per hour to the north northwest. It's going to continue to weaken, like we said, moving through those colder waters so that by the time it does cross into California, we expect it to just be a tropical storm. Now what that means is you're still going to have some of those gusty winds late this afternoon starting to kick up 40, 50, even 60 miles per hour. It will likely stay that way even through Sunday evening. But by the time we get to tomorrow afternoon, we'll finally start to see those winds beginning to calm back down as the center of the system begins to spread north. But the biggest concern absolutely out of this is going to be rainfall. You're starting to see that surge of moisture continue to spread not just into California, but even farther north into Nevada, into areas of Oregon and Idaho. The heavier rain is going to really start to push into southern California and western Arizona. Once we get into this afternoon and continue through the evening and overnight time frame, you're looking at widespread areas about 2 to 4 inches, but there will be some spots that pick up 6, 8, even 10 inches of rain in total when this is all said and done by the time we get through on Monday. The track of this, again, there you can see a lot more of those heavier bands setting in this afternoon. It starts to spread more into other areas, Nevada, eventually into Oregon, Idaho. So even though they are well away from the center of the storm right now, they are still likely going to have some similar impacts too. It's just going to take longer to get up to some of these areas. We've already set two rainfall records so far, one in California, the other in Las Vegas. We anticipate setting even additional rainfall records going forward. We will have a bigger breakdown of the actual rain and what is forecast coming up in just about 20 minutes.",

California is one of those states with a lot of resources, a lot of capabilities. I am concerned and this has been something we're seeing repeated over and over again.There's extreme weather in areas that have never experienced it before. And what we don't know, what we don't know. Our infrastructure wasn't built for it. You know, comparing it to other types of different disasters doesn't always tell us what's going to happen. And I think the big concern is people underestimate how deadly this flooding can be, particularly if they've been in an area that's not usually seen this and drive outthinking that normal areas would be OK finding them underwater and try to drive through them and drown. WALKER: Yes, you know -- yes, that's definitely a concern. And, you know, I think what's at the top of mind for so many people is this climate crisis, right? We're seeing disaster after disaster, obviously, fueled by climate change. And the impact that we're seeing is FEMA's resources being drained. We heard from, you know, Deanne Criswell, FEMA's administrator, who said that their disaster fund is nearly out of money. It's only August, which means the peak of hurricane season is not even here yet. When you hear that and it's going to cost about $6 billion, that's what we're hearing in terms of the estimate, in terms of, you know, Maui's wildfires and the response there, what could this mean for the future?

And the other thing we're seeing is combined with the insurance crisis because FEMA only reimburses for uninsured losses.So we see more and more people underinsured or without insurance, more and more governments without insurance. It increases the tax bill for you and me and this is increasing. So again, Congress -- I'm not worried about FEMA running out of money, but I do think we need to be concerned as a nation that if we're not investing more and buying down our risk and making more investments and building resilience for future, not past events as taxpayers, we're going to continue to pay the bill.",

And again, the president's role -- I can almost tell you what the president's going to say is that, you know, FEMA and the other federal agencies are going to be there long after the cameras go and you're not forgotten.

So before we get to Thursday or Friday, we've got a big event on Wednesday, that's the first GOP debate.And the former President, it's clear now, at least from the latest reporting, could always change, that he's not going to be there and that he is going to try to upstage them maybe with an interview with Tucker Carlson. Washington Post is reporting that it'll likely be taped the night before, unsure where it'll be released. Does a taped interview with Tucker Carlson maybe posted on X somewhere, really steal the spotlight from the event? TIA MITCHELL, WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT, ATLANTA JOURNAL-CONSTITUTION: I think it steals some attention, particularly people like us, who have no choice but to pay attention to what former President Trump does as the leading Republican presidential nominee. There's also kind of the audience of X, the audience of conservatives who are very active on social media. They might be more inclined to pay attention to a Trump and Tucker Carlson video that drops, as you said, on X or maybe a similar platform. However, I think your average voter, your average person who isn't glued to social media, who isn't a news junkie, and who probably finds the debate a little bit more accessible for them on their TV or their cable channels, that might not have as much impact. I mean, for example, Tucker Carlson himself isn't as visible as he was when he had the Fox News platform. So it would be the same for anyone he chose to interview at this point.",

And therefore, amongst those Republicans, I think a Kemp endorsement or a Kemp co-sign could indicate that a candidate is of that ilk.He's the type of Republican who can be conservative, lead the party, and help them move beyond Trump. However, we know that as of right now, that is not a majority of the Republican Party. So for those Republicans who are still Trump, Republicans who are still pretty MAGA, so far, Kemp has been perceived as someone who has fallen out with President Trump, but, generally speaking does not directly challenge President Trump. He has not necessarily traded barbs with President Trump. Now, he did rebuke President Trump more recently, but that was considered a departure from Kemp. And again, Kemp has said that even if Trump becomes the nominee, he will support him, he will vote for him. So there's risks there if Kemp has a clean break by endorsing someone else. Marjorie Taylor Greene, for example, made that very clear last week. So, number one, I don't know if Kemp's going to choose to do that, but if he does, that could really turn off the MAGA base of the Republican Party, which would then be counterproductive for anyone who received Kemp's endorsement.",

Now, we take a look where the rain is now. You're starting to see a lot more of that rain surge back in, not only to California, but also Nevada, areas of Arizona, even Utah. And eventually, it will spread into the Pacific northwestern states as well.The overall threat, again, is very widespread. Places like Los Angeles, Las Vegas and San Diego under a moderate risk for excessive rainfall. Las Vegas, one of two places that and Bishop, California have already set record rainfall amounts that was from yesterday. More records are likely to come in the next 24 to 48 hours. But it's this pink area here, that's a high risk for excessive rainfall. The highest category you could be. And that included Death Valley National Park and places like Palm Springs and Palm Desert. To put this in perspective, this is a photo from last summer, Death Valley National Park, all of these cars trapped after a severe flooding event took place and they had mudflows subsequently afterwards. This was caused by less than an inch and a half of rain. OK. Less than an inch and a half. And that's because this area only sees about two inches roughly every year. The forecast for the next 36 hours is two to four inches. So, you are talking a year's worth of rain in a short period of time. And even last year when we had significant flooding problems, they only got less than that. So, again, we are likely going to see those problems not just in Death Valley, but really for a lot of these areas of Southern California, Nevada, portions of Utah, Arizona and then even spreading farther north. That's why you have all of these flood watches in effect. Another concern also is severe thunderstorms.

While they control Urozhaine, the Russians do everything they can to make it a nightmare for the Ukrainians to be there. WALSH (voiceover): The unit showed us the intense fight captured by drone. This is their tank advancing, dropping a string of anti-mine explosives behind it, they said, which then, once it turned, detonated. The unit released a video of them in the town, Wednesday, of how they turned their fire power on what was once a Russian stronghold that shelled them. The company commander recalls many more Russians hidden there than he expected. Very many died, he says. Especially when they started to run. And when they held houses, lots of them died there. But they were caught as they fled. The smoke around Russians, likely made by cluster munitions. Ukraine has said it is already using some rounds controversially supplied by the United States.

I don't understand it, he says. That side is using whatever they want. Our people are dying from all this and it's OK. When the other side die, it's not? I don't understand. This footage shows how young some in the assault were. He has no time for western analysts who say this should be moving faster. I would say they can always come to me as a guest and fight with me, he says. If someone believes that you can fly over the minefield on a broom like in \"Harry Potter\", it doesn't happen in a real fight. If you don't understand that, you can sit in your arm chair and eat your popcorn. Out here, the last month of advances feel both empty and grueling, littered now with Russian dead. They haven't moved perhaps as far as it is felt.",

So much damage done, it's hard to imagine what plans Moscow had for here at all had they kept it. (END VIDEO CLIP) WALSH (on camera): Now, look, in the punishing heat in which Ukraine is trying to prosecute this counteroffensive, they have this obvious major issue of Russian air superiority. Yes, they have things they can field around to try and reduce that, but fundamentally, Russia can drop half metric ton bombs on their positions as they move forward. That's why the discussion around Ukraine getting F-16s is so urgent for them now. Indications from the country's defense ministers today that some of the training on Ukrainian pilots may have begun, that's likely to be Denmark, maybe the U.K., possibly the Netherlands involved in that in the near future. But they can't get them fast enough. They need them, they say, right now to tackle that Russian air superiority, to give Ukraine the change to bomb back and push their counteroffensive forward. And look, important to remind people, this is an essential war, frankly, for European and NATO security. A Russian victory here would have far-reaching consequences for Europe and American security in the decades ahead. And many analysts think, if Ukraine doesn't see some significant progress in the two or three months ahead, we are in for a very difficult winter where Russia may well settle in, concretize its conquest so far and proclaim that some kind of win.
