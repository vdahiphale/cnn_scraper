I think of North Korea as this poor place. But most homes, if not every home and every public space has a television because of the power of having this propaganda on 24/7. Keeping the Kims in power is crucial -- information is crucial, so Peter says he watched this for one full day, dreamt about it two nights in a row, and he's in Canada.

He was president, you'd think he would know what this nation's highest award for valor is actually called.It dates back to the Civil War. It's given in the name of Congress. The Presidential Medal of Freedom is the country's highest award for a civilian and that dates back to the early 1960s. Now, why the former president felt the need to say that the Presidential Medal of Freedom is better, because often those who received the Medal of Honor had been wounded or killed is unclear. Today, a campaign spokesman told \"The New York Times\" that Mr. Trump's comments last night referred to, \"How it can be an emotionally difficult, experience to give the Congressional Medal of Honor to veterans who had been wounded or tragically killed defending our country as he proudly did when he was commander-in-chief. Now, there's no record of Donald Trump making inappropriate remarks at those ceremonies, but there is a long record of what he said about military service, wounded, and fallen troops.

But I see it differently, of course. I know you're playing a bunch of stuff, a bunch of old clips, but talking about today, which seems to be the headline, I actually see where it was coming from quite frankly, these are two very different things. I had been in the room with President Donald Trump for a couple Medal of Honor ceremonies. I've been with him in Dover at a dignified transfer to receive the body of one of my fallen brothers. I've seen him. I think he has tremendous respect for our military. I've also been there with President Obama not with him, but he was there as well, a dignified transfer in Dover who was also, as Adam said, didn't understand like sort of military culture and uncomfortable But I wouldn't say that he didn't have respect, of course, for the fallen. But when you look at these two different ceremonies, I see what the president was trying to say that look, the Medal of Honor is somber, it's sad, it's stoic. The Presidential Medal of Freedom of course, the ceremony that's celebratory. People are happy they're joyous. It's a different thing. And let me tell you something else and I hope to God that none of your audience ever has to attend a Medal of Honor ceremony or has to attend a dignified transfer in Dover.",

Let's now leave that up to his own troops to discuss that and give their opinion on that, nor many others who have opinions on that on both sides. But I watched many videos of Governor Walz, who again, I think is a nice guy, I served with him in Congress. We worked on one of my veteran's bills that we passed together, but that was before I saw all of these videos where he's very clear saying he carried a gun in combat, which of course is stolen valor, of course and when he said so many times in so many videos that he retired at a certain rank that he did not. So, I'm not questioning whether he can retire or not. I will say as a former junior enlisted sailor, that when you're doing a workup, when you know you're deploying, you're looking up to the senior enlisted folks for confidence, for training, for leadership. And when you're senior enlisted guy, is training with alongside you ready to go to war and then he just bails on you. That's pretty bad. That's not good. That wasn't my biff though. My biff, of course, is the fact that he's on video numerous times claiming to do things that he did not do. And to me, that's stolen valor.",

The envy of the world, if you quote \"The Wall Street Journal.\"And the other thing I thought that was interesting is she's really becoming more aggressive on the issues that aren't really working as well. To the point raised before, price gouging. The fact that families are being squeezed on both ends. She wants to be more aggressive about addressing that versus where she has been so far. The other thing is expanding this issue of housing and affordable housing. We know there's too many people from millennials, Gen-Z that are just priced out of the market. And so, addressing that is going to be very important. So, the way that I see this plan is she had to go big. She did. She doubled down on what actually is working and expand that and then aggressively address what isn't working as well, and that's to lower these costs for the American public. I will also add, too, there's been a lot of successful policies that the Biden-Harris administration has passed, including capping insulin, and other issues that have really cut down on the cost for everyday Americans.

They have to ride that horse. They don't know what that means. They don't know what his issues are, or how he's going to address inflation.

There are still people, families out there who are still concerned about the price of school supplies out there. But we also understand context and that is why I think that a lot of individuals just to now, when Republicans say, well, this went up under your watch or this went up under your watch.

It was profoundly divided in the Democratic Party, and the Chicago police were not trained as I hope they are now.But what happened to me when I think about being there, I was just a White House fellow at that time working for Lyndon Johnson. And I went to the convention with my friends. I was on vacation. I was doing nothing official. And it was very confusing for me because I'd been an anti-war activist. I absolutely respected what LBJ was doing domestically and he never changed my opinion about the war. But I was beginning to feel confused as I saw what was happening there. The police were in a riot in many ways against the protesters. It was on the screens. We were watching it. And one night when we were watching all the -- we would go out in the day and watch what was going on and then come back to our hotel suite that night. I was with six friends and somebody answered the phone and said the president's on the line. And I thought it was joking. And I went and he said to me, I have a favor to ask you. And I thought, oh my God, he's going to ask me to do something official. And now I'm so confused about how I feel about this whole war. And he said, when you were here last week, you borrowed my flashlight and I can't find it. Where is it? I was so embarrassed what I was thinking, what was going on in my mind. But then I finally said to him, well, how are you? And he said to me, how do you think I am? I've never felt lower in my life. It was his 60th birthday that day. And he had been planning to go to the convention to give a valedictory speech. And he'd been working on it. It was going to have a huge cake. They were had a split suite was reserved for him. And then the people at the convention told him you cannot come. The turmoil is too great. It will only exacerbate it. So they had to just put together a small party of 20 friends who ended up just watching the convention at the ranch. So then I felt so sad for him. I felt that other kind of feeling of empathy for him. So it was a really confusing time, I think, for everybody there.",
