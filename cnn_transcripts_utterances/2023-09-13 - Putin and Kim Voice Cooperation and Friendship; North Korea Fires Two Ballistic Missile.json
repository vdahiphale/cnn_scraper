This is obviously two leaders who are notgoing to do a press conference, they're not going to give a statement as to what they've agreed. There can just be assessments by the West, by the U.S. and its allies. There are concerns that there has been some kind of an arms deal agreed on. We heard from the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, saying the talks were very productive. There were over five hours in all between these two leaders of very isolated and heavily sanctioned countries. And the very location that this meeting started and shows the military focus of their talks. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) HANCOCKS (voice-over):  Kim Jong-un is given the red carpet tour of Russia's successful space program. According to one reporter present, he asked, quote, \"a lot of very detailed questions.\" KIM JONG-UN, NORTH KOREAN LEADER (through translator):  Is it eight meters in total?",

VLADIMIR PUTIN, PRESIDENT OF RUSSIA (through translator):  The leader of North Korea shows great interest in space, in rocketry and they're trying to develop space. We'll show them our new objects. HANCOCKS (voice-over):  North Korea's last two attempts to put a spy satellite into space have failed. Putin showed Kim his presidential limousine, manufactured by Russian luxury automaker Aurus, reminiscent of former U.S. President Donald Trump showing off The Beast to Kim during friendlier times in Singapore. Kim praised Putin for standing up against hegemonic forces, a thinly veiled swipe at the United States and the West, even appearing to toast Russia's war in Ukraine. KIM (through translator):  I firmly believe the Russian military and people here inherit a shining tradition of victory and demonstrate their dignity and honor on the front line of military operations. HANCOCKS (voice-over):  U.S. And South Korean intelligence predict an arms deal, including North Korea providing Russia with much needed ammunition to use in Ukraine. The symmetry and their weaponry means certain ammo could be used immediately by Russia. Another possibility, the very public meeting could be sending a message.",

Thank you very much indeed.Stay with us because, next hour on CONNECT THE WORLD, I'll be speaking with the former Libyan health minister, Dr. Reda Al-Awakali (ph) as the country tries to make sense of what has been the unthinkable scale of devastation since the flooding there just 48 hours ago. Well, until then, for a deeper dive into this developing story and other important issues from the region, do stick with CNN, of course. Well, Putin took a hit in his war overnight. We will get to Melissa Bell for more on that in Ukraine momentarily. First off, it is now one of the deadliest floods on record in North Africa. The death toll from that catastrophic flooding in Libya has soared to more than 5,000, with double that number missing. These before and after satellite images of hard hit Derna give just a glimpse into the scale of the devastation. I have to warn you, some of the images coming in from that city are graphic. Hospitals are no longer functioning. Bodies, sadly, line the streets as morgues there are full. Meantime, there are major blockades, both physical and political, for aid trying to get to where it is needed most. We can now hear from CNN senior international correspondent, Ben Wedeman, with this report. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BEN WEDEMAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  A wall of water rushes toward the eastern Libyan city of Derna. Upstream, two dams have burst, tens of thousands of people now in mortal danger after a freak storm dumped eight months of rain in a single day. An army spokesman said entire neighborhoods in Derna were washed out to sea. Officials fear as many people may have been killed by the floods in eastern Libya, with many more unaccounted for.",

WEDEMAN (voice-over):  Dozens of bodies covered with blankets are strewn about outside Derna's morgue, now full to capacity. Communications with the city are spotty. Storm Daniel knocked out many of the cell phone towers and rendered many roads impassable. Libya was convulsed by the 2011 uprising against the rule of Muammar Gaddafi and ripped apart by civil war. After years of human folly, preparing for nature's wrath may not have been anyone's top priority. Turkey has dispatch search and rescue teams and emergency supplies. Italy is also sending in teams to assess the damage. But the level of death and destruction may be more than Libya can handle. Tuesday afternoon, a simple message appeared on the Facebook page of the Derna municipality. \"The situation in the city is out of control,\" it said, \"international intervention is needed.\" (END VIDEOTAPE)",

What we are talkingabout is talks that could lead to Russia getting its hands on some of that much needed ammunition, the artillery shells that it needs so much on the front line. Already, from the point of view of Ukrainians, this is a war in which they are so often outgunned and outmanned. And as we keep hearing, whenever we head to the front lines of this war, it's ammunition that they desperately need from their Western allies. The idea that Russia should be getting its hands on more of that, of extreme concern. It will make a big difference if it makes it to these front lines. That is, of course, the plan that Russia should be able to get some of the very basics that it needs for a war. Remember, from a country itself that has not been at war since 1953, Korea has a lot -- North Korea has a lot of these stockpiles left, in exchange, of course, for that much more sophisticated weaponry. From the point of view of Ukraine, these are extremely worrying and significant talks, Becky.",

Still with the death toll there nearing 3,000 and entire villages decimated, the humanitarian need, of course, is vast. CNN's Nada Bashir has been speaking with some of the many overwhelmed survivors. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) NADA BASHIR, CNN REPORTER (voice-over):  High in the Atlas Mountains, the solitary village of Dinisct (ph), seemingly abandoned and almost entirely flattened. It is hard to imagine how anyone could have survived the destruction here. But amid the rubble, signs of life.

BASHIR (voice-over):  Above the crumbling remnants of this now destroyed village, more than 40 victims lie buried. Each grave left unmarked. The smell of death is still heavy in the air. The overwhelming loss of life in this village, too much for anyone to bear. Zinah (ph) tells me her best friend is buried here too but she doesn't know which grave is hers. Getting aid to this village has taken days and supplies are minimal. There are, of course, no homes to return to here. Instead, families take shelter amid the sprawling olive groves.",

Headlines this hour:  North Korean leader Kim Jong-un appeared to endorse Russia's war in Ukraine when he met president Vladimir Putin in eastern Russia earlier. The two leaders voiced solidarity and cooperation during what were five hours of talks. Kim said Russia will defeat and punish, quote, \"evil forces.\" The death toll from catastrophic flooding in eastern Libya has soared to more than 5,000 with twice that number still missing. Hospitals in the hardhit city of Derna are no longer functioning. The morgues are full and some neighborhoods have now resorted to mass burials. South Korea says it's donating $2 million for earthquake relief in Morocco. That's as successful rescues there, sadly, slow. More than 2,900 people are known to have died so far.
