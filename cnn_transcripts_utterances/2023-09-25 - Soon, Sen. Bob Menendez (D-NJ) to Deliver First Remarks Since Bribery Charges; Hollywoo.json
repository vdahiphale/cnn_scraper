And every statement a criminal defendant says publicly is potential evidence.And let's, you know, unpack some of the things here. Imagine if he were to just-- if he's asked a question about the gold found in his house, and he says, well, that's my gold, you know, it's personal property, and it's not unlawful to have it. Fine, it's a truthful statement. But he also just admitted to something that prosecutors are attempting to prove. Anything-- anytime he contradicts a prior statement of that he's made, prosecutors can use that against him.

And one of the writers I talked to told me, I'm ready to go back to making magic and telling stories.But the union here is saying you have to wait. No one is allowed to go back to work right now. They're working through some of the fine print. They're saying that they're dotting every I. So, they're working through the legal part of this contract. And after that's done, we expect a vote that will happen as early as tomorrow, and that's a leadership vote. After that leadership vote, then some of the details will be made public to us and to the writers. They'll be able to ask questions and see whether they like the deal or not. And then they will have to vote to ratify this deal. Now, after that is ratified, if that's the case, you're going to likely start to see people beginning to work. You're likely going to start seeing some of the daytime television, the talk shows, and also the late night shows back on the air. But the question is, what happens to the rest of the T.V. this year and really movies next summer. Actors have to come to an agreement with the studios as well. They are also on strike. And so the question here is, how long is it going to take the actors to come to the table with the studios. It could be a while. So, we may not see productions really going back to normal in Hollywood anytime soon unfortunately. It's been really difficult over the last five months or so for the entire industry and it's sort of a domino effect, so many people impacted by this strike.

At this point should Americans simply expect that there is going to be a shutdown? REP. HALEY STEVENS (D-MI):  I don't want to encourage a shutdown, and I really believe that it can be avoided particularly if we adhere to a plan to pass a continuing resolution 30 days, 45 days. This is something that the speaker of the House even said that he'd be interested in doing. And we all know that a shutdown is just economic damage, it's economic collateral. We have working families relying on daycare assistance that's going to expire, we have food security issues, we have the running of our airports and the hard men and women who make it work for so many Americans. And I don't want to see those people furloughed. So, if we can do the continuing resolution, buy some more time, stop with the perfunctory actions of individual spending bills, I think we're going to come back to the House and see that take place, but we just know that's wasting time when we need to be delivering for the American people.",

When the Democrats were in charge, we were passing a CHIPS Act, we were doing infrastructure, we lowered the cost of prescription drugs. Let's get our act together for the American people.

He has been one of the most pro-union presidents. His administration has clearly had labor at the table, starting with the infrastructure bill all the way to the CHIPS Act. And he's going to be listening to the hardworking men and women of the UAW. That's what this moment is all about, elevating those voices, showcasing solidarity. We want a strong auto industry. We don't have that if workers aren't dealt in. And so I'm going to be all ears for the president's inspiring message.
