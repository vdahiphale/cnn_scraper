A high- altitude picture of the mid-air encounter between an American drone and Russian fighter jets. The declassified video shows Moscow putting the drone in its crosshairs, igniting a cloud trail of jet fuel, then buzzing the drone twice.Plus, our banking system remains strong. The treasury secretary tries to calm nerves. She's up on Capitol Hill today, assuring Americans, your money is safe. And today, the Senate barrels toward a vote on undoing the use of force authorizations against Iraq. Yes, against Iraq. It happens two decades after the run up to shock and awe. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GEORGE W. BUSH, 43RD U.S. PRESIDENT: Tomorrow is a moment of truth for the world. Saddam Hussein and his sons must leave Iraq within 48 hours. At this hour, American and coalition forces are in the early stages of military operations to disarm Iraq, to free its people and to defend the world from grave danger. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Today the Pentagon declassifying this, surveillance footage from that MQ-9 Reaper drone, taken as Russian pilots harassed the aircraft over international waters. That is jet fuel you see sparked by the SU27's afterburner, splashed on the drone in an attempt U.S. official say to blind it.On a second, high speed past Russia flying too close, clipping the Reaper's propeller, knocking the video feed offline. The damage though clearly visible when the camera kicks back on. Washington and Moscow now trading accusations and blame over which side is at fault. And the White House gave the green light to release that video. So, you can see the aggressive Russian behavior. Let's begin at the Pentagon this hour, with CNN's Natasha Bertrand. Natasha, the video is wow. I guess the big question is what now?",

      "sentences": "It's a great question, John. And we are not necessarily seeing any escalating rhetoric coming from the U.S. vowing consequences for example, but this video really is kind of a response in and of itself to the statements that Russia has put out over the last several days, denying that those Russian fighter jets ever came into contact with that U.S. drone over the Black Sea.As we can see quite clearly from this video, the pilots do actually make contact with the drone, causing that propeller of the drone to be damaged. Now U.S. officials say, really that damage could have only happened by a direct impact from that fighter jet. However, you Russian officials still denying that their pilots acted irresponsibly or recklessly. The U.S. now is saying that they do not believe necessarily that they're going to be able to recover the wreckage of this drone, because they do not have any naval assets in the area that would be readily available to actually collect the debris. The Russians meanwhile, we are told have already arrived at the crash site. Unclear whether they are also going to be able to pick up that debris just because the water there is so deep and the U.S. officials who spoke yesterday at the Pentagon said, that they do believe that this drone actually broke up when it hit the water. But the U.S. is also telling us, U.S. officials are also telling us that they did take steps to wipe that drone of anything sensitive. But I should note, John, that in addition to the Russian denials about their pilots acting irresponsibly, and about any direct contact with this drone, we were also told that this order to harass the drone actually did come from senior Russian officials within Russia's Defense Ministry. So, this was not pilots going rogue here. This was actually a direct tasking from the Russian Ministry of Defense, John?",

Can you pick up maybe communications, can you try to go back and scrub all the intelligence to see if there's any radio traffic back and forth that answers that question. And number two, from your perspective as a military man, what now? What happens if this doesn't happen again? The Pentagon says, they'll send the drones back up, they'll do the surveillance. But what happens if Russia downs another one?GEN. WESLEY CLARK (RET.) FORMER NATO SUPREME ALLIED COMMANDER, EUROPE: So, first of all, obviously, we're looking at all of the communications and intercepts. It's hard to believe that that wasn't intentional. Because what's the advantage for the pilot to get that post to the drone, he tried to bind it with the fuel. It could have been an intentional takedown of the drone. It's happened before we had a Chinese pilot 20 years ago, who got close to a U.S. Navy intel platform out in the Pacific and actually hit it and it landed and the Chinese got a bonanza of intelligence from it because the system wasn't completely sanitized when they landed. Now, hopefully, this drone has been totally sanitized. As to what happens next, well obviously, we're going to put more drones up there. Do they have to be protected? Is there some way to protect them? Non kinetically in international airspace. Can you put another platform up that warns the Russians to stay away from it? Can you activate the hotline if it starts to happen before the Russians interfere with it? All of those options will have to be considered.",

General Clark, another thing, the Pentagon number one, the White House National Security Council, the Pentagon debating whether to release this, declassified this video. That in and of itself is a pretty remarkable step that Pentagon and the White House warning to say, look, what the Russians are saying is simply not true. They did act aggressively. They did act recklessly.They also this morning released this map with locations on it, showing they are saying that the drone was operating in this area, the Black Sea. You see Crimea over here, Russia proper is way over here. Take us inside these kinds of deliberations about we should - whether or not to release this information. Obviously, if you look at where it is in the Black Sea, the Russians say the United States shouldn't be there in any circumstance. The United States has to bad international waters. When you look at this map, what is the value of the Pentagon putting this out essentially, to say the Russians are lying? GEN. CLARK: Well, I think it's important both for our allies to see it. And it's also important for the, let's say, the Global South, and the fence sitters and the people who might be inclined to take the Russian side on this. You know, there are a lot of nations in the world have not sided with the United States on this. So, I think this is important. And I think it's also important for some members, some people in the United States who may doubt about what's going on in Ukraine and may think this is some kind of justified territorial dispute to understand the recklessness and the inappropriateness of the Russian behavior. And this is clearly international waters. The Russians have said, no, no, we're going to do military exercises. Sure, they'd like to say that, but it's not legal and it's not justified in this case. So, we're clearly within our legal rights. And it's very important that the Pentagon released this information and the map information.",

Because even at that distance, we can optically take great pictures of Crimea, and the whole battlefield in the south, the supply lines.We use that information. We give it to the Ukrainians. The Ukrainians use it just to fire off high mars, they use it to plan a spring offensive. So, the Russians who see this as an existential war, see this as a threat.

There's been a bit less calm on Wall Street. You look at what the stock market's doing, specifically bank stocks, regional bank stocks, they've gotten clobbered in recent days.First Republic Bank, that is a San Francisco bank lender, you can see down 19 percent. As we speak, PacWest down 12 percent. But what's notable is that in the last few hours, the Wall Street Journal's reporting that First Republic Bank is in talks over a rescue, a rescue from big banks, including JPMorgan and Citigroup. And reportedly, this rescue would include a sizable cash infusion. Now, the bank itself is not commenting. But this is a big deal. And even just the report of a potential rescue from Wall Street is lifting the broader stock market. As you can see, the Dow was up over 150 points. And we've seen the S&amp;P 500, the NASDAQ up even more on a percentage basis. Now, we've already seen a rescue of sorts mounted in Europe, where the Swiss central bank provided a $50 billion lifeline to Credit Suisse, after that banks stock fell sharply. What's interesting, though, John, is that despite all these concerns about the banking system, the European Central Bank went ahead with a big interest rate hike today. The question is whether or not the U.S. Federal Reserve is going to do the same thing next week.",

This bank here, this Silicon Valley Bank is the same problem that we dealt with in first Pennsylvania in 1979, when Paul Volcker was chairman of the Fed, I was at the FDIC.First Pennsylvania did the same thing that Silicon Valley Bank did. And we thought we fixed those problems. We thought we would remember them always. And then Silicon Valley Bank turns around and does the same thing. I don't understand.

So, the administration announced this last night, this ByteDance. The company issued a statement and now the Wall Street Journal has an exclusive interview with TikTok CEO.
