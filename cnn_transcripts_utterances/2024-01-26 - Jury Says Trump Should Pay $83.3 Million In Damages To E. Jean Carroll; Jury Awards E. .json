They're awarding her $83.3 million, and here's how it breaks down.The question of compensatory damages, of how much emotional harm that E. Jean Carroll faced and what she should be paid for that, they awarded her $7.3 million. They said they were giving her $11 million to repair her reputation and punitive damages, that is the punishment factor to Donald Trump, that was the biggest number. They awarded E. Jean Carroll $65 million for punitive damages. And this is Carroll's argument during this whole trial that the only way to stop Donald Trump from continuing to repeat the defamatory statements was to hit him in the pocketbook, and that is what the jury did here. Trump's attorney, in their closing arguments today, were arguing that Trump shouldn't be held accountable for mean tweets that E. Jean Carroll received. The jury clearly not buying that side of the argument and instead finding in Carroll's favor, hitting the former president in the pocketbook and awarding her this significant award of $83.3 million, Wolf.",

Jean Carroll but also because, typically, what his responses and his reaction it just initially in something like this is to go on the attack. That is what he's been doing to E. Jean Carroll. That is what brought them to the courtroom that they were in today as that verdict was read, his attorneys, at least I should note, given Kristen just noted he was on the plane.And he's kind of not left with that option here because the reason he's being ordered to pay over $83 million is not for what he was found liable for by a previous jury, which is sexually abusing her, but it is simply for defaming her and for the comments that he made about her. And so it does kind of get in the way of what his initial response is, which is to attack, attack, attack. And he did not mention E. Jean Carroll by name in that statement. He'd been attacking her on social media relentlessly throughout the week and the judge here as well. And so I think that's a big question here. And I think the other part of this, when I saw that $83 million number, which is way above what E. Jean Carroll's attorney had been asking for, but she was asking the jury to send a message with it, is Trump is not someone who likes to part ways with his money. He does not do so easily. You can ask anyone who's ever worked for him, certainly attorneys who have worked for him. And so I think the number is particularly damaging to him because, one, he doesn't like to pay anyone anything, but certainly not E. Jean Carroll in this situation. So, I think it raises a lot of questions about what this appeal process is going to look like. But the number itself is just incredibly damaging to him.",

There was an opportunity for him last year to actually do the defense that he attempted to raise in this particular phase of the trial.Kaitlan is exactly right. This was not a moment for him to go back and try to re-litigate the issues of whether in fact he had committed that assault. That is already in the rearview mirror because a jury found that he had. And the opportunity he had to appear and come to his defense and raise all those arguments is now long gone. This was the penalty phase. And the message being sent from the $5 million ordered just last year to now over $80 million compensatory and, of course, punitive damages sends a very clear message that he was aware of the comments that he was making, he was aware of the fact that this was they believe done so with malice or this was done in way that he was aware should not have been done and chose to do it anyway. And so when we look at whether to review a jury's decision on how much money to award, you look primarily to figure out how exponentially higher is the award for, say, the punitive versus compensatory. Do they match up in some way? Are they so far apart as to be a message that says this has nothing to do with the underlying conduct any longer and instead simply a public litmus test in some way, shape, or form? This is not that far apart. And so now his appeal, Wolf, will really focus on whether there was an issue of a ruling from the judge not about the facts in this case and certainly not about whether he wants to re-litigate the issue of an earlier jury finding.",

But they never sent a note, they didn't ask for any testimony or any additional evidence. So, whatever they were working on behind the scenes they came to this decision unanimously and together. And this was a jury of seven men and two women, a unanimous verdict. What's interesting in the previous trial which involved the allegation of sexual assault and defamation for statements made in 2022, that was a jury of six men and three women. So, a similar split and significant award here for E. Jean Carroll. Throughout the trial, I did see some of the jurors taking notes. They were very observant to the witness testimony and watching the proceedings, fairly engaged. We did have a break in this trial because some jurors had become ill, so there was a break in testimony for about a week. So, it wasn't a short cohesive case, but, obviously, they were engaged.

Jean Carroll and attacked her at length. That was the day after the jury had found him liable for sexual abuse, and he did not stop then. I think what has changed here now is there's a price to those statements that he is been making, as you noted many times on social media in person, outside the courthouse, as her attorneys played in the closing argument. So, I think that's the question here of whether or not it stops him. And if it doesn't, what the next step is by E. Jean Carroll's attorneys.

He did that even tonight in a statement, this is a civil defamation case in New York and he was saying it was done at the hands of President Biden. He's been calling all of his legal issues election interference.And the thing I noticed when I'm traveling with him is that people believe it, his supporters believe it. A lot of Republicans believe it, not even just, you know, his rabid base, that this is somehow a politically-motivated thing that is happening to him. Now, the other question here is whether or not he can continue to not attack E. Jean Carroll. As we said, it's very striking that he didn't go after her in his posts tonight.

What they were deciding now was based on reputational harm, whether the evidence suggested that she had a reputation at one particular level. It was lessened by the statements by Donald Trump, whether the statements, in fact, led to actual monetary damages. Now, she claimed that prior to all this happening, she received hundreds of emails responding to her asking her for advice as a part of her advice column. It dwindled down to just ten, I think, a month at one point in time. She talked about the threats that were made to her, death threats and beyond.

And there has always been when you're talking about victims of sexual assault and abuse. Unfortunately, in our society we do have a tendency to discredit out of the gate and then try to force somebody to prove their case later.Now, in this instance it was years and years after, and so the credibility arguments that were already there were already problematic, in addition to the delay of reporting. This tells you that when somebody went forward on this claim that was helped by the fact you could have a limitations period that could have told in prior years because New York had changed their laws could still go forward, this is a very powerful statement about how people now view even delayed reporting. But, ultimately, it is also the testament to the idea of power dynamic at play. Can there be any bigger pulpit from which one can assert statements or make statements that defame than the bully pulpit of the president of the United States and beyond?

Jean Carroll but these jurors, the judges, the judge's law clerks, all these people that are involved in the system of justice to uphold the rule of law, to rules of evidence, facts, and law-based reasoning, and how, on the political side our political leaders are not doing the same. They're not having that kind of courage.

We know that the CIA director, Bill Burns, is heading to Europe this weekend for meetings with his Egyptian and Israeli counterparts, as well as the Qatari prime minister. That comes on the heels of a several meetings earlier this week in both Cairo and Qatar by the most senior White House official, who is in charge of the Middle East.Brett McGurk earlier today, we heard from the White House saying that McGurk's meetings were a good set of discussion. So, Bill Burns will be looking to build on that progress and bridge the gap between the Israeli and Hamas positions. And, Wolf, that gap is substantial. We do understand what we think the outline of a deal could look like, this is according to sources, that those Israeli hostages were still in Gaza, there are more than 100 of them, that they would be released in phases, initially women, children, and the elderly. That would be followed by IDF soldiers and the bodies of the hostages. But, Wolf, Hamas wants to see this war end while Israel wants to see a temporary ceasefire and then continue with their efforts to eradicate Hamas. Wolf?",

This is a preliminary ruling on South Africa's accusation of genocide by Israel, a case the court refused to throw out. The final decision could take months or even years. The court also urged the immediate and unconditional release of all hostages being held by Hamas in Gaza. Let's bring in CNN's Chief International Correspondent Clarissa Ward. She's in Jerusalem for us. Clarissa, CNN has been investigating the Israeli military's actions in Gaza. You're getting new information. What are you learning?",

We flew here to Israel to try to sit down with the IDF to present our footage, present our findings on or off camera. They declined to meet with us, but they did provide us, Wolf, some hours after our report was first published with this statement. They said, quote, CNN refused to provide the footage in question prior to the broadcasting of the article as the IDF requested to receive in order to thoroughly examine the incident and provide any sort of comprehensive response. CNN's hesitancy to share the materials discloses the partial nature of their report, doing a disservice to the complex nature of the operational reality on the ground. The incident is being examined. Wolf, they don't say exactly which of the incidents that we talk about in this investigation is being examined, and I do want to reiterate that we said again and again to the IDF that we were willing any time, day or night to come present our footage, present our findings well before publication to give them a chance to explain what's been going on, Wolf.",
