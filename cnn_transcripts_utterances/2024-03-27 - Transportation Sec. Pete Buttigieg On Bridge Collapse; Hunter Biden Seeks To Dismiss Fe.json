And again, that's part of what the law enforcement and NTSB investigations will determine. But we can't wait for that to play out to get to work right now to get this up and running.So what we know is that we've got to tear down every obstacle -- physical, financial, administrative. That means using all of the tools that we have as a department and very likely, working with Congress as well. And that was the commitment that the president and that I made yesterday with Gov. Wes Moore. We were with him and his leadership team. So were the congressional delegation of Maryland, clearly determined to make sure that every resource is made available. I've never seen anything quite like this. But there have been experiences in the U.S. that we are drawing from, including the 2007 Minnesota bridge collapse where, really, the federal government and the whole country stepped up to get that reconstructed. We're learning from that and a lot of other moments in U.S. history as part of the playbook on what to do next. So much depends on getting that bridge back up and that port back open quickly.",

There are bigger ships than this. There are a lot bigger cargo vessels than this. How concerned are you about bridge safety in the rest of the country? I know the Delaware Memorial Bridge, not terribly far from where this accident is, is actually going under a multimillion-dollar refurbishment to put some fenders around the base.",

And that's for all kinds of design issues and resilience issues that are at stake.For example, we're doing a seismic retrofit right now on the Golden Gate Bridge to make it better able to withstand earthquakes. We're designing the new I-5 bridge that's going to go in the Pacific Northwest to make sure that it is more resilient for the future. And after a collapse in Tampa -- the Tampa region in the 1980s, there have been new elements of bridge design that have been added in the newest, latest, and greatest engineering since then. Again, it's really too soon to speculate on whether those designs or any designs would have -- would have changed the outcome here where you had a vessel. It's really difficult to express the physics -- the mass of this. We're talking about 100,000 tons, so two million pounds of force hitting that support pier that is critical to the entire structure.

Is the GOP looking at a big warning sign for this November? (COMMERCIAL) [07:41:12] WHITFIELD:  A courtroom showdown in Los Angeles today. Attorneys for President Biden's son, Hunter, will try to persuade a federal judge to dismiss felony tax charges against him. Special counsel David Weiss charged Hunter Biden with nine tax offenses in December. He has pleaded not guilty. His lawyers say he is, quote, \"being targeted because of his political and familial affiliations,\" and contend that Weiss caved to pressure from Donald Trump and congressional Republicans. CNN's Katelyn Polantz is joining me right now. So, Katelyn, what are we expecting in court today?",

Now, if the judge will buy those arguments remains to be seen. But this is the stress test of the indictment that special counsel David Weiss filed against Hunter Biden.It is the type of hearing that typically happens in one of these cases -- in a criminal case -- before it goes to trial. So it is a big opportunity for Hunter Biden's team. One of the things that makes this hearing a little bit unusual is that Hunter Biden's team is going to be pulling at the threads in this case that make the prosecution of Hunter Biden unusual. They're going to be talking to the judge about how they don't believe that this case should ever have been charged because he had a plea agreement with the Justice Department or an agreement with them previously that fell apart. They are also going to be arguing that he shouldn't be charged out in federal court in California because he didn't live there at the time of the alleged tax evasion violations. And then, they're also going to be talking to the judge about how they believe politics spoiled this investigation and revealed too much about Hunter Biden and his private tax business that shouldn't have been revealed. So all of those challenges will be before Judge Mark Scarsi. We will see how the judge reacts, though we don't expect a decision today on whether this case can move forward.",

It wouldhave to be certified by the courts in California if that's what the judge decides the penalty should be for John Eastman for the work he did for Donald Trump after 2020. But this is one of those trials where you're seeing the consequence of 2020 and that election -- the efforts of lawyers on behalf of Donald Trump -- play out even well before those cases go to a criminal trial.

And so, I think you're seeing, at least in the fundraising that I'm -- we -- our firm -- my firm does a lot of fundraising for progressive and other groups.

This campaign and this administration is in overdrive trying to convince Americans that the economy is good, the border is secure, and our nation is safe -- and none of that is true. They're even spending millions of dollars, Fred, on trying to shore up Hispanics and African American voters -- really, part of the heart and soul of the Democratic Party. And they're spending money to keep those people on board because they're losing those to the Trump administration. So there's no amount of money that's going to make people feel as though their economic situation is better. They don't feel that way and the polling indicates this. And you look at every battleground state poll. The RealClear Politics average shows Donald Trump ahead of Joe Biden in those polls, and that's a major factor for this Biden administration. They've got to raise a lot of money to turn things around. And there's no amount of star power that's going to make Joe Biden any younger and make people feel like the economy is good when it's not.",
