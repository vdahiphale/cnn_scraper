So, there's a question about what North Korea claims they launch versus what they actually launched. The South Korean Joint Chiefs of Staff saying they're working with the U.S. to further analyze the details of the launch, saying they tracked at least one submarine-launched missile of an unidentified type. So, not even acknowledging that it was a cruise missile or that it was two missiles that North Korea claimed.It is worth noting that cruise missiles or other types of missiles except ballistic missiles are not a violation of UN Security Council resolutions, so they're not viewed as escalatory as a ballistic missile launch. Of course, this is North Korea, so they did carry out a short-range ballistic missile launch just last week that was viewed as not a threat to the U.S. or the U.S. territory by the United States. It's also worth noting that ahead of the exercises, none of the exercises have started freedom shield that is, North Korea claims that they will counter -- to carry out the toughest counteraction yet, Kate.

Now, Trump was invited to appear before the grand jury investigating his alleged role in a scheme to pay hush money to Stormy Daniels way back when. Kara Scannell has this new detail and much more on Trump's response. Kara,I thought it was really interesting. His attorney did not hold back this morning when he's speaking to George Stephanopoulos.
