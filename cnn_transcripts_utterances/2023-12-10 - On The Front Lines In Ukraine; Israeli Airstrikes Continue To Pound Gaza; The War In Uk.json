I don't put any weight into his statements.But on the issue itself, it's important to understand, there are now tens of thousands of Israelis who have left their homes in northern Israel on the border with Lebanon, and they will not go back home as long as Hezbollah is on the border. That's just a fact of life. And if Hezbollah does not withdraw from the border area, either by the course of some diplomatic action or military action, then these people will not go back home. And no country can accept the reality in which tens of thousands of people are uprooted like that from their homes and cannot go back. I hope there can be a diplomatic solution and I think there is a great responsibility here for the Biden administration and for other countries that have relationships with Lebanon, France I know is involved in trying to help to solve this diplomatically.
