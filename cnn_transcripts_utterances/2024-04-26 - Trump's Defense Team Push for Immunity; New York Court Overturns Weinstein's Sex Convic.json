MICHAEL DREEBEN, FORMER U.S. SOLICITOR GENERAL: His novel theory would immunize former presidents for criminal liability for bribery, treason, sedition, murder, and here, conspiring to use fraud to overturn the results of an election and perpetuate himself in power.

Starting with David Pecker as a way to start telling this story to the jury and to the public. AREVA MARTIN, ATTORNEY &amp; LEGAL AFFAIRS COMMENTATOR: Yes, the testimony of David Pecker has been really, really surprising on so many levels. Think about the irony of Donald Trump, who coined the phrase fake news. And what we learned from David Pecker is that Trump and Pecker and Michael Cohen were actually engaged in creating fake stories, suppressing stories about Donald Trump that they deemed harmful and promoting stories, in some cases, fake stories about his opponents in order to embarrass and to humiliate them. The testimony has been in some ways riveting.

It is very clear, though, that no matter what this court does, Donald Trump is not going to stop talking about the witnesses, stop talking about this trial despite the gag order, putting the court in a very difficult position because essentially Donald Trump is allowed to do things as a criminal defendant that no other criminal defendant in our legal system would be or as would be allowed to do.",

And I'm also somewhat comforted by the fact that Harvey Weinstein was also found guilty by a California jury and has been sentenced to 16 years. So, no matter what happens in New York, he still will not be free from prison. So very disappointed in the New York appeals court. But this case, I think once retried, will have the same outcome.

For instance, not that serious, but still. So it's, of course, is a push to organize. And as you mentioned, there are still some things which are not there, for instance, there is no demobilization for those who are serving for more than two years. But the most important is to understand that prior to the first Russian invasion in 2014, the Ukrainian army was around 70,000 people. Later, it was built up to for 300,000 people. And since the full-scale invasion, it's over the million. And most of these people are regular civilians who, you know, never fought. We never really had a strong army. So, a lot of people joined.

Earlier today, Wang Yi characterized the U.S.-China relationship as a relationship that is at a crossroads. Take a listen to this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) WANG YI, CHINESE FOREIGN MINISTER (through translator): Should China and the United States keep to the right direction of moving forward with stability or return to a downward spiral?

And since then, the friction has eased. But there is a list of unresolved issues.And let's bring it up for you. And these issues include China's support of Russia and the war in Ukraine, China's assertions of sovereignty in the South China Sea. They include America's forced divestment of TikTok. The fate and future of Taiwan, especially as a new president, is about to be sworn in. Human rights, the flow of fentanyl, precursor chemicals, as well as trade and Chinese overcapacity. That was discussed on Thursday in Shanghai when Blinken raised concerns about Chinese trade practices when he was meeting the top official in Shanghai. Blinken's visit, it comes after the U.S. President Joe Biden and the Chinese leader Xi Jinping held that phone conversation in April. That was their first conversation since their historic summit in November. But whether Blinken will meet with Xi Jinping, that is an open question. Wait and see. Back to you.",

They said a ruling by the judge would have allowed for cross-examination by prosecutors to focus on what all of the prior bad act witnesses testified to as well as other bad acts in his life that had nothing to do with sexual crimes just workplace situations that weren't favorable and the court said that this is not right because Weinstein may have not taken the stand because of that ruling and therefore the injury ways deprived of hearing important testimony they called it from the defendant himself.Now, accusers of Harvey Weinstein have been stepping forward saying they disagree with this ruling, this is not good for the #MeToo movement, this is not good for the fairness of this situation but this is the highest court in New York and this ruling will stand.
