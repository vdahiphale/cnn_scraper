But it's not the only place that can put on an oppressive show. Officials in Rio de Janeiro say about 2.5 million people crowded Copacabana Beach to see the midnight fireworks.The city also hosted multiple concerts with bands playing at 13 different locations. The parties, no, they did not stop there. We will have more on New Year's celebrations right around the world later in the show. But we do go to Puerto Rico, where a not so festive and bright lead up to the New Year. A critical failure in the island's power grid caused a massive blackout leading up to New Year's Eve. And at last check, more than half of all customers were still without power. Sherrell Hubbard brings us the story. (BEGIN VIDEO TAPE) SHERRELL HUBBARD, JOURNALIST (voice-over): A massive power outage in Puerto Rico has its population scrambling. The power went out 5:30 a.m. Tuesday, leaving island dwellers waking up in the dark. Residents spent the better part of Tuesday getting gas to run generators. Some expressed their frustration, saying the outage is affecting them at an inopportune time. UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translation): I understand it's a critical situation. A day like today, New Year's Eve. Well, we'll be in a difficult situation. HUBBARD (voice-over): Puerto Rico's governor says a critical failure in the island's power grid caused the blackout. He said the government and providers are working to restore service as quickly as possible. Luma Energy, a power company responsible for power distribution and transmission on the island, says it'll take up to 48 hours to reach full restoration. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (through translation): Complete frustration. Frustration, disappointment in the government, in the institutions and everything. HUBBARD (voice-over): Power outages on the island have been an ongoing source of frustration throughout the years. The island's inconsistent power system has faltered before. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (through translation): More than the holidays, what worries me is this country's development. I work here in the pharmaceutical industry. No industries that really want to invest in this country will come here if we don't improve the infrastructure. I'm Sherrell Hubbard reporting. (END VIDEO TAPE)",

OK, the -- this company just care about the profit. They don't care about the people. And they are not half of what our public servants used to be.

The U.S. Central Command says it launched multiple precision strikes over the past two days against Houthi targets in Sana'a and coastal areas that housed missiles and drones used in recent attacks against the U.S. and the Red Sea. Washington says the strikes are meant to deter Houthi's threats to America's partners and the trade ships that pass through the region. Black trade, of course, is vital to the global economy. A Houthi spokesperson says Yemen will continue to defend itself against such attacks.
