We saw police use the live rounds while the protesters breached defense of the national assembly. And that's how some of them were able to get inside the Kenya's parliament. And as  protesters were getting closer, overwhelming the police, some of these security officers, some of the men inside Kenya's parliament, we saw them using live rounds. And after that, we saw at least two bodies lying here on this street. This is called Parliament Avenue, goes right in front of Kenya's parliament. And this is the bill the houses brought the national assembly and the Senate. There's still a standoff here between the protesters on that roundabout over at the end of that road and the police trying to hold them back there. But part of the wall has been breached and protesters made it all the way from the cut into the cafeteria and inside the floor of the national assembly and made of the maze, they were trying to get it through these through the fence. And they kind of broke it into two. And they got out with the arm of the maze for the rest of it remains inside parliament. So the most dramatic scene I've seen covering protests here in Kenya for a long, long time but also the two bodies we've seen, those are the ones we personally saw as CNN. The protesters tell us they've seen other bodies in other parts of the city. They were largely peaceful protesters and they are angry that police appear to be using live rounds to beat back and to disrupt peaceful protesters. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

They tell us, because while they're being peaceful and President Ruto himself, admitted that they had come out peacefully, they had come out without reference to tribe (ph), to hear them, to hear the other voices heard.

First a U.S. military video showing an Apache helicopter mistakenly gunning down two journalists and several Iraqi civilians in 2007. Next was the release of tens of thousands of classified military documents related to the war in Afghanistan revealing more previously unreported civilian deaths? Documents on the Iraq War followed, suggesting widespread abuse and torture by Iraqi security forces. Then the leak of cables from U.S. embassies and diplomatic missions around the world as far as claimed his mission was to shine a light on evidence of war crimes and abuses of power. J. ASSANGE:  And that's how people can really understand what is actually going on and whether they choose to support it or not. SEBASTIAN (voice-over):  As the world watched for WikiLeaks, his next move in November 2010, Sweden opened an investigation into allegations of sexual assault against Assange and issued an international arrest warrant for his extradition. Assange denied the allegations claiming it was retribution for his political work and orchestrated to pave the way for his extradition to the U.S. because of the leaks. He turned himself in to London police and was later released on strict bail conditions. Then, in an unexpected twist, he entered the Ecuadorian Embassy in London in 2012 and was granted political asylum at the start of a seven year diplomatic route. J. ASSANGE:  Courageous Latin American nation took a stand for justice. SEBASTIAN (voice-over):  Still, Assange was able to reveal details that rocked the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign. DONALD TRUMP (R), FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT AND 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  WikiLeaks, I love WikiLeaks. SEBASTIAN (voice-over):  WikiLeaks published hacked emails from DNC staffers and Presidential Candidate Hillary Clinton's campaign. Over time his relationship with his host soured. Ecuador revoked his asylum in 2019 and London police arrested him on an extradition warrant from the U.S. Justice Department to face a conspiracy charge. 17 new counts under the Espionage Act followed accusing Assange of publishing information that risks the lives of confidential U.S. sources and endanger national security. The Swedish charges were dropped later that year but Assange was sentenced to prison for violating his bail conditions and spent five years fighting his extradition to the U.S. mostly isolated at Belmarsh high security prison. Two years ago, he married his lawyer and mother of his two children, Stella Morris, inside jail. His plea deal with the U.S. on a remote Pacific island a final twist in this tale, a recognition that he has paid his dues -- Clare Sebastian, CNN, London. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

The United States increasingly dependent on its allies in the Pacific because of its increasing tensions with China and the future of Taiwan. And Australia is offering larger naval facilities to the United States. It's tied up an important nuclear submarine deal in recent years.

Unfortunately, in this conversation today, he's asking Kenyans, he is asking young people, he is asking the women of this country to tighten their belts. And we are not seeing the same austerity measures being exercised in his government. They're not tightening their belts themselves. They're busy and taxes (INAUDIBLE) to enjoy their livelihoods. For example, there are certain taxes that we have resisted for (INAUDIBLE) the tax or rather than the payment for their wife of the prime cabinet secretary, which is the only legal office.

You're watching CONNECT THE WORLD with me, Becky Anderson, live from our Middle East broadcasting hub here in Abu Dhabi,where the time is 6:42 in the evening, Israel's defense minister is set to meet his American counterparts in Washington today. Yoav Gallant is holding what his office describes as critical meetings with top U.S. officials. On Monday, U.S. secretary of state Antony Blinken emphasized the need for a post-war plan for Gaza and to avoid a further escalation intentions with Hezbollah along Israel's northern border with Lebanon. CNN political and global affairs analyst Barak Ravid joins me now. He is also the politics and foreign policy reporter for Axios. It's good to have you, Barak. You've been -- you've got new reporting. Let's start on the northern border. You got new reporting on Israel's northern front, where President Biden's envoy, Amos Hochstein, has been telling Lebanese officials on his trip to the region last week that Hezbollah is wrong to think that the U.S. would be able to stop Israel from invading Lebanon. It feels like every day we're watching a preview of war but that everybody in some way is trying to avoid a war actually happening. Is it imminent at this point, do you think?",

And then the IDF is going to move to what it calls phase three of the Gaza war, which is low intensity fighting, which means the IDF will stay on the Philadelphi corridor on the border between Gaza and Egypt. The IDF will stay at the -- what's called the Netzarim corridor, which basically divides Gaza to half, two parts, a northern part and southern part, and prevents people from moving north and south. IDF will stay in those two places. But other than that, all the forces are going to come out and they will only continue in very specific raids and airstrikes against Hamas leaders or Hamas targets. And you, you're not going to see the high intensity fighting we saw in the last almost nine months.",

So let's say now that it's like a semi ceasefire and use that to start diplomatic negotiations on calming the border in the north. Second thing they're going to try and do is, starting northern Gaza, to start doing what they call humanitarian bubbles, which means to find local elements in Gaza to distribute the humanitarian aid under protection of the IDF. So basically, the IDF goes in, stays on the outskirts of a specific neighborhood. And inside the neighborhood, the IDF does not go in and only prevents Hamas from attacking that neighborhood and attacking the local elements that are sort of replacing Hamas rule. It is a -- it's more -- it's easier said than done. It's very complicated to do that. Nobody knows if they will manage to do it. But Israeli officials believe that, if they can start doing those small humanitarian bubbles, it will also put pressure on Hamas.

But this building now engulfed in flames. This is a serious fire. There's still no fire brigade here. It's not clear if there's any people who are still left there. But at the back of the building, some people were getting help to escape the fire just as we came in. This has been burning now for a few minutes. There's no emergency response as yet. And the fire appears to be getting worse. This is the latest in this escalation between protesters and police in the nationwide protests we've seen in Kenya over the finance bill. A lot of the young people out in the streets, angry about overtaxation by the government of President William Ruto. And now this scene here, Becky.",
