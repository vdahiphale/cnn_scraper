The Black Sea fleet dealt a severe blow with a reported killing of its top commander. In fact, this would be the first admiral killed during combat since World War II. Vice Admiral Viktor Sokolov was allegedly killed Friday during that massive and devastating strike on the fleet's headquarters. A strike that apparently took out not only Sokolov but according to Ukraine 33 other officers as well. Russia's not denying this tonight. The Kremlin is simply not commenting. And this strike and reported killing of the top commander and 33, I mean, I should keep saying that, 33 other officers matters. The Black Sea fleet is the pride of Russia's navy. And on top of that, Sokolov himself was put in place last year to bolster up the navy after a series of embarrassing setbacks including, remember, the sinking of the warship, the Moskva. And adding to the challenges that Putin is facing on the battlefield tonight, Ukraine is now in possession of 31 American-made Abrams tanks. These are highly maneuverable. They have wanted these for a long time. The announcement of their arrival was huge, and now they're there. Same tanks that renowned Russian war correspondent warned could cause our troops a lot of trouble. Sam Kiley is OUTFRONT tonight.

He's been fine there for the entire war, he's fine there for six years before the invasion, right? And suddenly, he's killed by a Ukrainian strike, along with they say 33 other officers. I mean, it is pretty stunning in its scope. How difficult is it to pull something like this off? LT. GENERAL MARK HERTLING (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST: Extremely, Erin. And there are no safe places on any battlefield. But what we're talking about is Ukraine's ability to conduct what's called targeting operations, deciding, detecting, delivering, and assessing. That's the military acronym or the approach that they use. So the Ukrainians have decided to hit these kind of targets strategically. They detect them, when was the admirable there, what kind of things were going on? Then they delivered not only munitions toward the headquarters, the Black Sea fleet, but also several other capabilities, the communications and the signals capabilities that transcribed data from the fleet to the ships at sea from the headquarters. So, you're talking about great assessing of a good target by the Ukrainian military, and they are getting better and better at this with input of intelligence from other sources.",

They can't spread that across the front line. So what Ukraine is going to do, in my view, is they will use that at a key location, when they finally subjected the Russian front lines, the defensive belts to a breach.

You then put on top of that what we saw last week with President Zelenskyy in town, the Republicans making it very clear that the U.S. Congress is not going to indefinitely write a blank check. Putin is watching that. Putin understands that the most valuable weapon he has is time, and that if he can keep this war grinding and grinding and if it doesn't look like there can be a decisive all-out military victory for the Ukrainians imminently that Zelenskyy will start to face some pressure from his allies to make some kind of concessions or some kind of a political settlement.",

And it ticks a lot of boxes for Russia, because, on the one hand, it gives sort of geostrategic heft. It gives them a seat at the table. On the other hand, it also gives them the opportunity to diminish the influence of France, the U.S. and the West with this propaganda empire. And on top of that, it gives them access to natural resources. They prop up these unstable regimes, in return they get concessions, mining, diamonds, timber, you name it.

The Taj Mahal provided a romantic backdrop for the couple who told the \"New York Times\" they met in December 2018 at an IHOP in Union City, New Jersey, where Menendez grew up and previously served as mayor.

And I was so angry, and I also felt just as someone who is senior staff in the White House thinking about the environment of what women faced in the Trump White House and also just someone who is starting out in their career, that's the last thing that I want someone like Cassidy to face.But, unfortunately, this was the environment that we were in. And it was very misogynistic. It doesn't surprise me. I sat in meetings with the president himself where he would pretty much examine every woman in the room. He would look at us from head to toe and look at what we were wearing. Rudy Giuliani, similar personality, as well as Peter Navarro. They're out there still today this past weekend referring to us in very derogatory terms. This is how these men view women. And I just want to say, look, when it comes to Cassidy Hutchinson, she was one of the most critical members of the staff in the west wing regardless of what they may try to say and however they may try to paint us. That's how they do it. They try to be disparaging in these terms. So when these attacks come out against her and they refute these things, she doesn't have a reason to lie. She was critical. She would call staff in the White House. She would call me who is senior staff on Mike Pence's staff and task me at times. Because when she called she was speaking for mark meadows. I'm just saying this because she was of critical stature in the west wing and this operation. And I believe everything that she says because she's lived it.",

But I've never seen that on the state level in Georgia. But he's installing timers. Plan is to give, at this point an hour to each side for each 12-member panel. So, my guess what will happen is he'll bring in the group for the day, he'll read the indictment to them, he'll qualify them on the first initial statutory questions. They'll bring in a 12-person panel, give an hour for the state for them to do what they want to do. And then we're done in two hours and moving on to the next panel.

Those are the words Paul Joyal heard from his assailant outside his Maryland home just before he was shot in the gut, assailants he was convinced were sent by the Russians. The attack happening days after Joyal, a Russian intelligence expert, appeared on NBC's \"Dateline\" in February 2007, accusing the Russian government of poisoning former Soviet spy Alexander Litvinenko, which the Kremlin denies, saying, quote, a message has been communicated to anyone who wants to speak out against the Kremlin.If you do, no matter who you are, where you are, we will find you and we will silence you. So, that's what he said appearing in a \"Dateline\". Four days after he said that, Joyal he's in the hospital, in critical condition from punches to the head and a bullet to his stomach. Official says the shooting appears to be random. But Joyal is not alone in his suspicions. Many prominent news outlets at the time questioning what happened. Rampant speculation remains. Recently, at least 14 prominent Russians have died under mysterious circumstances which include falling downstairs, out of a hospital window, off of a boat, and, of course, in the case of Yevgeny Prigozhin, falling out of the sky. The Kremlin also denying, of course, that it assassinated the Wagner chief. Now, Joyal is fighting for more agencies to get involved when their suspicious crimes could be related to foreign governments. His shooting remains unsolved. Paul Joyal is OUTFRONT now. And, Paul, I just want to get a chance to understand here exactly what happened as you recall it. The Kremlin never commented on what happened to you or on your belief that Russians were behind it.
