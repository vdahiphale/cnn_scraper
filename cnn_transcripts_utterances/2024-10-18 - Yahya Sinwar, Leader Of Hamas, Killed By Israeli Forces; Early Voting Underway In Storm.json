Now a warning, we're about to show graphic images of his remains. Sinwar who took over Hamas in August, is the alleged architect of the October 7 terror attacks. He hadn't been seen in public since before then, and was believed to be hiding underground in Gaza's tunnels.His body was found Thursday in a pile of debris in the city of Rafah. Israeli authorities say they used dental records and after that DNA to confirm his identity, but CNN cannot verify it's actually him, and no word yet from Hamas itself. Now, the Israeli military released video that it says shows some of Sinwar's final moments. Take a look. It was filmed by a drone that entered a damaged building where a person who the IDF says is Sinwar was seen sitting in a chair and then turned away. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MAJ. GEN.

Israel is the one that once wore and does not want to return the displaced people or meet the demands of the resistance and Qatar. DIAMOND (voice-over): Sinwar evaded the Israeli military for more than a year, moving from place to place inside Hamas' vast network of tunnels, according to U.S. and Israeli officials never once emerging publicly since the October 7 attacks. Sinwar became Hamas' leader in Gaza in 2017 after spending 22 years in an Israeli prison. He was released in a prisoner swap deal in 2011 alongside more than 1,000 other Palestinian prisoners in exchange for the Israeli soldier, Gilad Shalit. But his enduring legacy came last year when thousands of Palestinian militants stormed into Israel, killing more than 1,200 people and taking about 250 hostages at a music festival in people's homes and as they fled into bomb shelters. Now with Sinwar dead, questions about the fate of the remaining hostages and whether the war in Gaza will finally end. Jeremy Diamond, CNN, Tel Aviv. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

The Israeli military says these are the last moments that that he was seen alive, Sinwar. And you can see the drone goes into the shell of this badly damaged house in Rafah that's in the south of Gaza. There's a man sitting in an armchair there, they say, that is Yahya Sinwar. He's injured, they say, shot through the hand, and his face is covered with a keffiyeh, Palestinian keffiyeh. And then he picks up a piece of what looks like wood and hurls it at the drone, missing it. They say he is subsequently killed by a tank shell, and it wasn't really until the next day they say that he was identified as the leader of Hamas and the alleged mastermind of those deadly October 7 attacks that triggered this year of unprecedented violence in Gaza. The Israeli military says he was found with a weapon, with a gun, and with some 40,000 Israeli shekels. It's a bit more than 10,000 U.S. dollars. They say that he was planning to move north through Gaza. And there were two, at least two other dead men found with him, one that they did not name, but they said, was a commander of a Hamas fighting brigade. The reaction, of course, there have been commendations coming from the Israeli government and military commanders and Western allies like U.S. President Biden, the French president Emmanuel Macron, mixed responses from Israeli President -- Prime Minister Netanyahu, saying the war will continue, whereas other Western leaders, like Biden are saying this is a time to push ever harder for a ceasefire and release of hostages within the Gaza Strip. Also mixed reaction, of course, you have more than 42,000 dead Palestinians in the Israeli onslaught since the October 7 attacks and widespread reports of hunger and disease there among the civilian population. Take a listen to what one person in Gaza had to say about this.

So that's leaving a huge leadership void here, which is particularly important if you are one of the family members of more than 100 hostages currently believed to be held by Hamas.Who do you negotiate with? There had already been reports that communication between the negotiators who have been conducting months of talks mediated by Qatar and the Egyptians, where the U.S. has been involved, as well as Israel, that communication with the Hamas leadership has been slowed down by the sheer fact that much of Gaza is now in ruins. Who do you talk to now and how much command and control is there to figure out where the individual hostages are right now, who can speak for the entire organization right now when, again, much of Gaza is now smoking ruins.

So even when Israel succeeds in decapitating these armed groups that it is fighting on different fronts, they do not stop fighting against Israel, which then leads to the question, what will Netanyahu do? Will he continue, as he has said, saying that the war will continue, or he will he take it as an opportunity to try to wind down a year of unprecedented violence that has led to so many deaths.",

Protesters in Tel Aviv reacted to the reports of Sinwar's death with some saying it represents an opportunity for a hostage deal and end to the war. Others though expressed worry over the uncertainty in the conflict. But they stood united as they repeated their call for all the hostages to be released immediately and urged officials to reach agreement. Israel's military shared video meantime, on Thursday reportedly showing Sinwar during his final moments. You can see the video there, it's a drone camera that captured this going into a damaged building where a person that the IDF says is Sinwar -- you see him there -- sitting alone in his chair, his face obscured and appears to be looking toward the drone. Israel says he was trying to escape north when he was killed by IDF troops. Here's how top European officials reacted to his death. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And now that focus right, going rightfully back to the hostages and their families and what now? RONEN BERGMAN, STAFF WRITER, \"NEW YORK TIMES MAGAZINE\": Quite a lot here to cover shortly, but let's start with what happened. Good night to you. [01:34:53] BERGMAN: The area, Tel Sultan area in Rafah in the southern Gaza strip was considered to be where, by Israeli intelligence, where the late Yahya Sinwar, the leader of Hamas might be hiding. they have tried to attack few gatherings of Hamas militants throughout the last two months where they thought Sinwar is but he wasn't. They were working in that area. We also need to bear in mind. This is the exact area where the IDF uncovered a tunnel where six hostages were executed by Hamas. And in that exact tunnel they found traces of the DNA of Yahya Sinwar. So he was either in contact with the hostages or he was in that tunnel. So another hint that he was there. They invested massive efforts, only a fraction of the much more massive efforts that were invested throughout the last year to find Yahya Sinwar but he was found by accident. A group of trainees not more than ten months in the military training to be spot (ph) commanders were working, were going in a patrol to take care of some bomb that was -- that has a main function. They were afraid that the explosive in that bomb will fall in the hands of Hamas. They wanted to pick it up. And then they started to exchange fire with a group of four to five Hamas militants with one of them was shelling grenades at that group. They sent a drone. This is the exits of that video that you showed from that. One of the people -- one of the villagers, his face covered was trying to throw stones and sticks at the drone which was kind of silly because it didn't work. They reacted with fire, with small missile, and with sniper rifle that was able to shoot the one of them, the person with his face covered, two bullets. Then another drone came and artillery and they collapsed the building. Later, only a day later when they came to see what were the results of this exchange of fire, did they find Mr. Sinwar dead, killed by these two bullets.",

Israel says the strike targeted a command-and-control center used by Hamas and Islamic jihad terrorists. Almost since the start of Israel's war against Hamas, emergency officials and humanitarian agencies have repeatedly warned of dire food and medicine shortages in parts of northern Gaza.

For example, a few months ago we did some reporting about how McDonalds was offering meal deals which are very popular in the United States, bundles of food for cheap price to try to get people back in the restaurants. We've seen Apple having to be very competitive with its pricing because of competition from Chinese brands. It's important to emphasize the Chinese economy is growing. It's just not growing as fast as we have seen as in the past and by such a large amounts.

And right now, the response has been very piecemeal, but markets don't like that and we've seen some ups and downs.
