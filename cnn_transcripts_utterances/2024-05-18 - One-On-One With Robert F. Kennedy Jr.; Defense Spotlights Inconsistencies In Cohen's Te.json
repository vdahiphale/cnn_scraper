By now you know, the candidates reached an agreement this week they will debate outside the framework of the Commission on Presidential Debates. They'll square off twice. First in June then in September, potentially with a vice presidential debate in between. It seemed quick and organic. But I have my doubts. Two weeks ago, co-founder and co-chair of the Commission on Presidential Debates Frank Fahrenkopf, was my guest here. I asked him if he'd heard from either campaign. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) FRANK FAHRENKOPF, CO-CHAIR, COMMISION ON PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES: Other criticism that we just heard from the Trump campaign with regard to trying to move, you know, the baits earlier, which we think we've answered as best we can, we can answer it. We've had no contact with either campaign, which is not unusual, Michael, we normally don't have contact with the Republican and Democrat and other people who may be able to be on, for example, the Green Party will probably qualify, and Jill Stein will be their nominee. We don't talk to them until after their nominating convention. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Cohen testified under oath that the call was about payments made to Stormy Daniels. The jury was later presented with evidence of text messages between Cohen and Trump's body man from that exact day, proving their conversation was centered around a prank and harassing telephone calls that Cohen was experiencing.Joining me now is Elie Honig, the former federal prosecutor and CNN Senior Legal Analyst. Elie, we both get so far into the weeds on this. But let's give the stand back explanation.

Up until now, all the cross examination of Michael Cohen had focused on the fact that he had this long history as a liar, that he had this personal hatred towards Donald Trump, all of which is irrelevant, but none of which went to the actual payments at issue here. This piece of testimony by Michael Cohen, he got on the stand on direct when being questioned by prosecutors a few days ago, and he said, there was this call 8OK. Fast forward a couple of days to cross examination. And it turns out, there's a whole text chain right before and right after that call that shows the purpose of the call was that Michael Cohen was getting harassed by this 14-year-old over text and Michael Cohen wanted to essentially sic the Secret Service on her. And Cohen was on his heels when he got hit with that. And he tried to spin and say, well, maybe we discussed both things, or maybe it was some other time. The problem is that's not what he said on direct. That's not what he said to the grand jury. It's a major problem for his credibility.",

But you don't know how it's playing in the courtroom.Anderson came out and gave us his take, which was very similar to what we heard minutes later from Kara Scannell, one of our reporters from a retired New York judge who has been coming out and giving us interviews, and to me, that tells a lot. And by the way, when a core witness gets blown up like this in such spectacular fashion, even if it's only one part of his testimony, that can resonate with the jury so powerfully. They will be instructed by the judge probably later this week, that if you find that a jury lied to you, in part of his testimony, you have the right, you don't have to, but you have the right to reject his testimony wholesale.

This inverted flag is used as a symbol by some Trump supporters who challenged the legitimacy of Biden's victory. It has become a recurring prop of the Stop the Steal movement. The photo was captured by neighbors. It's unclear how long the flag was flown outside of the justice's home. But in a statement to \"The Times\" Alito said, quote, \"I had no involvement whatsoever in the flying of the flag. It was briefly placed by Mrs. Alito in response to a neighbor's use of objectionable and personally insulting language on yard signs.\" Fox News host Shannon Bream revealed in a series of tweets that a neighbor of the Alitos reportedly had an F Trump sign within feet of where children wait for the school bus. Mrs. Alito brought this up with the neighbor who then replaced it with a sign personally addressing Mrs. Alito and blaming her for the January 6 attacks. Things escalated further. Justice Alito said, at one point, the neighbor engaged in vulgar language directed at Mrs. Alito including use of the C word. Justice Alito claims the flag was his wife's response to these very personal and political attacks.
