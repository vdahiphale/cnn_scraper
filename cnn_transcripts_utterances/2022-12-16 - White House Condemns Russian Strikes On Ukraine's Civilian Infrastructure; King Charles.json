This is one of the most advanced aerial defense systems the U.S. has and Ukraine has been asking for it for months. It would essentially sit on top of the capabilities they already have, a long range air defense system that would go on top of the NASAMS that were provided a few months ago, as well as the shorter range Stingers that were provided way at the beginning of this conflict back in February, March in that timeframe. Now, Russia has said there would be \"unpredictable consequences\" if the U.S. provided Patriot missiles to Ukraine, but the Pentagon basically dismissed that saying, Russia won't be dictating what aid the U.S. is willing to give to Ukraine. It's also worth noting that what these Patriots are designed to take out, that is Russian drones, Russian missiles, Russian rockets are exactly what other systems have already handled, that is the NASAMS, the Stingers. So it's the same target set and that hasn't proven to be escalatory. Ukraine has already shown they're quite capable at air defense of those 70 or so missiles that were launched, Ukraine says they took out some 60 of those. But as you can see, even when a few get through, it can have devastating consequences for Ukraine. Bianna? Victor?",

What we learned is that the investigators did a bunch of searches on email accounts, specifically the email accounts of three different people who were allied with Donald Trump right around the election and afterwards and were really working to try and help him hold on to the presidency.Those email accounts, those were - those people were Jeffrey Clark, who was a Justice Department official, Ken Klukowski, who was a deputy of his and John Eastman, who was a private attorney for Donald Trump at the time. So that's the emails that they searched. And then once the Justice Department got a hold of those emails, they were going through them and there were specific things they went to court to get access to. The first thing, they were trying to get access to emails that these three men had with Republican representative, Scott Perry, who was also in line with them, with their thinking trying to keep Trump questioning the election publicly. So Scott Perry's emails with these three men was something that a judge did give them access to. The other thing they got access to, Victor and Bianna, was of several pages, drafts, that Jeffrey Clark had wrote for his own autobiography, an outline he did. And in that, he had written six different chapters about the 2020 election.",

Mark Meadows was the White House chief of staff at the time of the election, and afterwards, Rudy Giuliani was also acting as a private attorney for Donald Trump. Those are four people that the House Select Committee could refer over to the Justice Department. But, of course, remember, this would just be a political decision that they would be making.

We've spent the past couple of weeks talking about what could happen if these referrals are handed down. But let's play the opposite perspective here. What happens if there is no criminal referral, at least specific to the former president? What would lead - what would that do, in your view?",

I think the concern on the Committee's end is if they finish up all the work, they've done all the hearings, they've put on all the really quite compelling evidence and then don't make a criminal referral. I think there's a concern that there'll be some sort of negative inference.Well, the Committee must not think any crimes are committed. You've heard members of the Committee say something to that effect. And for that reason, I think it's very likely consistent with our reporting that they will make a referral and Donald Trump will be one of those people named.",

I am sure as heck going to go through that report every page, every word of that report, looking for evidence.We know, by the way, Victor, that the Committee got to plenty of evidence that DOJ either didn't have or the Committee got to it first. For example, we know the Committee interviewed and got testimony from Cassidy Hutchinson, from Pat Cipollone and from others before DOJ got there. So if I'm a prosecutor, I'm going through that report with a fine tooth comb. I'm seeing is there information and evidence in here that I can use in my investigation. And by the way, Merrick Garland said that in his statement a couple of weeks ago. He said, we want, we need all their evidence because we need to consider it in our investigation.",

That time is valuable time because the closer you get to the 2024 election, and remember an indictment is just the start, you got to try this case even if there's an indictment. That's another year out.The closer you get to 2024, the more difficult it gets to convince a jury to come back with unanimous verdict. Now, there has been a noted change the last four to six months, DOJ now is starting to look at higher level players. Katelyn's reporting just now is a perfect example of that. They're looking at Jeffrey Clark, they're looking at John Eastman, they're trying to get these - they did get these emails involving Rep. Scott Perry. And so I think there's been a notable change in the pace and focus in direction of the investigation. And if anything, I think that has been accelerated in the last almost a month now since Jack Smith was named Special Counsel.",

For one thing, Ways and Means Committee had to go to court to fight for their right which they won, to get these individual tax returns. It went all the way up to the Supreme Court, Ways and Means won, they should have won.In that legal battle though, Victor, they specifically said we are doing this for a legislative purpose. We're not doing this because we want to investigate or expose Donald Trump. We're doing this so we can craft legislation. So it will be somewhat inconsistent with that promise they made to a court to then release the records. The other thing is the very law that Ways and Means relied on here says generally speaking, if Ways and Means gets an individual's tax returns that should be maintained confidentially. So again, Ways and Means could be asking for a bit of trouble here if they just come out and leak or publish Donald Trump's individual tax returns.",

Under Joe Biden's leadership, this Congress has passed the most impactful legislation on climate change in history, the most substantive legislation on healthcare since President Obama, the most impactful legislation on infrastructure since FDR and the list goes on and on.And Joe Biden has led this country in the last two years, with dignity, with a plum, with empathy, with compassion, enduring some of the most challenging and divisive environments that we find ourselves in, except - not counting the Civil War. And he, frankly, bring about even with his low approval ratings, incredible successes for the Democrats during the midterm elections. He also has been one of the most underestimated presidents in history, which I think will work in his favor. So, of course, Sen. Schumer and Speaker Pelosi said what they said, hell, he should run. Absolutely, he should run. With those types of accomplishments, Victor, no one would say anything else. I don't understand this poll. I have to tell you. I also think he should run and especially if Trump is the one who's going to win on the Republican side and right now there's every chance that he will, if President - if Trump runs again, President Biden should absolutely run because he will win reelection.",

And what's the first thing that Kevin McCarthy announces? Investigations. Possible impeachment. And what this tells me and we've actually seen him do it in the light of day is that he is involved in a corrupt bargain with the most extreme leaders, members of Congress of the MAGA caucus, because there's no other way that he can get to 218. He is selling his votes left and right. And what Democrats are worried about and they're going to try to stop every step of the way is that they are going to prioritize investigations instead of legislation and the American people deserve better.",
