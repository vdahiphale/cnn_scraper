And the winner of Japan's oldest beauty contest reignites debate about what it means to be Japanese. It's 9:00 a.m. in Gaza City where authorities say they expect the death toll to rise after another attack has claimed the lives of civilians. The Hamas-run Palestinian Health Ministry reports at least 20 people were killed, as many as 150 injured when Israeli forces fired on people lining up for food. CNN has reached out to the Israel Defense Forces for comment. The attack is just the latest in an especially bloody day in Gaza where the Health Ministry reports at least 200 people were killed. The Director-General of the World Health Organization choked up while talking about the situation. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TEDROS ADHANOM GHEBREYESUS, DIRECTOR-GENERAL, WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION:  If we look for a solution, it's always possible. It's only the will that's required. And I'm a true believer because of my own experience that war doesn't bring solution, except more war, more hatred, more agony, more destruction. So, let's choose peace and resolve this issue politically. I'm struggling to speak because -- because the situation is beyond words. (END VIDEO CLIP) COREN:  Well, meanwhile in the Netherlands, the International Court of Justice is set to deliver its initial ruling in a genocide case against Israel. Let's get more on that from journalist Elliott Gotkine live from London. Elliott walks us through the implications of the expected ruling by the International Court of Justice later today.",

CNN's Ben Wedeman has details and a warning, his report contains graphic video.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BEN WEDEMAN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Once again, the wounded are sprawled on the floor of Al-Shifa hospital in Gaza City. Victims of what a civil defense official says was Israeli tank and machine gun fire on a crowd of people waiting to receive desperately needed humanitarian aid. People were going to get food and flour because they have nothing to eat, he says. Then suddenly tanks appeared and started firing shells at people. Mohammed Al-Rifi was injured in the hand and leg. They shelled us four times, he says. Wednesday at the same spot at the Kuwait Circle (ph) in Gaza City's southern outskirts, there were scenes of panic when, according to eyewitnesses, Israeli forces opened fire during the distribution of aid. CNN has reached out to the Israeli military for comment, but has not yet received a response. To the south, thousands are streaming (sp?) out of Khan Younis where intense fighting has been raging for days, moving however they can, traumatized by what they've seen and what they've lost. This is the third time we've moved, she says, all they have left in the world piled onto a shopping cart. This is as far as you can get safely from Khan Younis. Between a sea of tents and the sea, some supplies are available. Close to 90 percent of the people of Gaza are now displaced, many now living like this. Winter rains have turned parts of this makeshift camp into a muddy pond. I'm looking for our things, he says. What they have found is anger at the men who pose as their leaders. Look Ismail Haniyeh (ph), let him see us, shouts this man, referring to Hamas's political leader living in Qatar. The war has raged now for more than 110 days. For three and a half months we've been on the run, says Iyad Abu Wasaid (ph). Let us go back to our homes, we're sick of this life. Death would be better.

It's unclear who is responsible for the attacks. Well, voters in Russia are braving the country's legendary winter to ensure an anti-war presidential candidate has enough signatures to take on Vladimir Putin in the election in March. CNN's Clare Sebastian has more on this peaceful defiance and the man inspiring it. CLARE SEBASTIAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  Under heavy snowfall and amid the chill of ever tighter limits on freedom of speech, this is a rare spark of Russian public opposition to Vladimir Putin, patiently lining up to try to get an anti-war candidate on the ballot in upcoming presidential elections. This is the only candidate that wants to stop the military action on someone else's territory, says Anatoly (ph). For some, it goes even deeper than the war. I feel that my rights may be infringed says Nasha (ph). I don't feel safe sometimes. The candidate is Boris Nadezhdin, a 60-year-old physicist, former MP and adviser to the late opposition leader Boris Nemtsov.

It's -- Tuvalu is recognized since its independence in 1979. So that's the geopolitical battle between Taiwan and China, then, of course, you have the West looking on -- not so much about recognition. Most countries in the world recognized China, what they're very worried about is if Tuvalu should shift, and that is not a foregone conclusion. But if it should shift, what are the implications for the way in which China may be able to engage with MPs, influence international voting, possibly get access to telecommunications or those very lucrative and large maritime zones as part of its economic exclusion zones that have important sea lanes that go through them.

But there's some very attractive aspects of that agreement, which includes a climate migration pathway for up to 280 a year. It includes 6, 7 times an increase in climate adaptation funding and a promise -- a legally binding promise that should there be a crisis, climatic or otherwise, Australia will come to Tuvalu's assistance.
