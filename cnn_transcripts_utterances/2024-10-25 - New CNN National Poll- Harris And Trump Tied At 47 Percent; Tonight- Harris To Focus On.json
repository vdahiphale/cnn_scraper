A part of this is because Trump himself knows that he used a lot of this language in the lead-up to the 2016 election and he won then and he thinks it helped him then and it can help him now.And so they say there is no plans to lean away from this language.

AMANDA ZURAWSKI, PLAINTIFF IN THE ZURAWSKI V. TEXAS CASE: It's very good to be with you, Boris. Thank you so much for having me. I am so excited that Kamala Harris is here today in Texas. I think it just highlights how she has, time and again, shown up for reproductive freedom and for women and women's rights, and families in this country, because this is a family issue. And the fact that she's in Texas which is ground zero for the harm that we're seeing as a result of Donald Trump and his bans is just indicative of how important this is to her and how important it will continue to be to her and Gov.

These are the districts they think they can most likely flip, and that is Congressman Anthony D'Esposito, a Republican who represents the Long Island area, and Congressman Brandon Williams, who represents Upstate New York and Syracuse.These Republicans flipped these districts two years ago. Democrats are targeting them, thinking that they can flip them back. That's largely because D'Esposito and Williams represent districts that are home to more Democrats than Republicans. If you look at voter registration data from 2023, D'Esposito represents a district that's home to 78,000 more Democrats than Republicans, and Williams, there's about 23,000 more Democrats than Republicans there. So in a presidential election year, in a state that - like New York, which historically votes blue, Democrats who I speak to often just point to the fact that New York is a state that often votes blue, and they're hoping that those blue voters coming out to vote for president are going to help momentum on these down-ballot races to help flip the script and flip these districts. And that's why the stakes could not be higher here, because both parties know that the balance of power for the House runs through the districts like these. That's why we see - it's not a coincidence that Donald Trump is going to Madison Square Garden on Saturday. Both sides are pouring millions and millions of dollars into these races, especially in the final weeks. And, you know, as we talk about these House races more in the final 11 days, I just want to kind of take a step back.

He also decided to run at a very old age when the - when how fast he would age was completely unpredictable. And he basically only gave her 90 days to run a reelection. On the other side, she's raised over a billion dollars. She hasn't really had to deal with a lot of scrutiny that you would have to deal with in a two year campaign.
