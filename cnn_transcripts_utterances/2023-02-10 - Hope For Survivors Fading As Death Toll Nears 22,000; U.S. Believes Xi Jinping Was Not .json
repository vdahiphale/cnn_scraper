What could Mike Pence tell the special counsel about Trump and January 6? And the fight over America's social safety net. Both sides ignoring the cold hard truth, not touching it is not an option. Welcome to our viewers in the United States and around the world. I'm Christine Romans. This is EARLY START. We begin with the earthquake disaster in Turkey and Syria, where they are clinging to hope that survivors can still be found alive after four days buried in the rubble. That hope fading with each passing hour. Still, there are miraculous stories of survival. Overnight, two teenage sisters were pulled from the rubble in the 99th and 101st hour since the quake. The staggering death toll now approaching 22,000. The number of injured in these two countries near 80,000. CNN's Salma Abdelaziz is live in Istanbul and that story of the sisters is a heartwarming amid all this tragedy. And a secondary disaster now looms for survivors, many are homeless, they're forced into the freezing cold. What's being done about that?",

Turkish authorities, of course, scrambling to try to help the many, many, many people made homeless, hundreds of thousands of people, you have to remember now, do not have homes to go to. And some are too scared to even go back to their homes, if they are standing.I have some satellite images I want to show you. They come from two of these cities in this affected area. You can just see those satellite images completely leveled. It looks apocalyptic, just pancaked buildings. When you look at those images, remember, those are people's homes, those are apartment blocks, all of those families need a place to sleep. We have updated numbers for you right now that we have from the Turkish authorities. They say, so far, they've been able to evacuate some 75,000 people from that affected area, get them to other places, get them to safety. But again, 75,000, that's just a fraction of the number. Turkish authorities also telling us that 140,000 tents have been shipped in. Again, that's not enough. The sheer scale and scope of this disaster is too big. The number of people who need roofs over their heads are just way, way greater than that. And then, of course, further south to Syria, there again, the situation even more dire compounded, of course, by the civil conflict that's ravaged that country now for nearly 12 years. There, we understand also tens of thousands of people have been made homeless. There, of course, you have two different authorities on the ground. The Syrian authorities on one side of that area, of that affected area. They are able to get some aid, some help, but still saying that some 300,000 people are displaced in those regime areas. And then you have the rebel-controlled regions where we've only seen the tiniest drop of aid, some tents being shipped in by the United Nations just yesterday in this six-truck convoy. But again tens of thousands of people potentially just sleeping on the street in freezing cold conditions. Christine.",

We know that investigations, of course, are underway.Now, we have also been closely monitoring Beijing's ever changing messaging and its strategy about communicating about this balloon, you know, it initially expressed regret, but China's rhetoric hardened after the balloon was shot down by the U.S. military and accused the U.S. of overreacting. And we've been noticing today and yesterday that Beijing is now trying to deflect, deflect attention away its surveillance program and towards America's security practices. I want to show you this. This is according to this statement tabloid called the Global Times. They said this, quote, \"The U.S. is the most unstable factor in international security. It is ridiculous for such a country to use a civilian balloon to play up the China threat to the world. And its attempt to confuse the public is unlikely to succeed.\" Beijing continues, of course, to insist that this balloon was a civilian vessel that blew off course. The US says this was spy craft. It was part of this broader Chinese military surveillance operation that spanned more than 40 countries in five continents. Now, we also heard earlier today from China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and it firmly opposes the U.S. resolution that was passed condemning the Chinese balloon, calling it pure political maneuver.

But authorities in at least six Ukrainian regions say that air defense systems were in action in those areas.And in fact, we know that one missile, at least one missile, crossed into Moldovan airspace, according to the Moldovan authorities who are now summoning the Russian ambassador to complain. And this has happened before. It was just last month, actually, the debris from a downed missile ended up landing in the northern part of the country. Ukraine's energy provider says that there have been an electrical infrastructure hit in the West south and eastern parts of the country. And Ukrainian Air Force says that there have also been confirmed hits in the regions of Kharkiv and in Zaporizhzhia. And they say that the types of missiles used in these cases were surface to air missiles. So normally used to shoot down incoming missiles, but the Russians, throughout this war, have been using them to strike targets on land. That's significant because the Ukrainian say that they cannot easily shoot down this kind of missile. Those missiles are also not terribly accurate when they're used for this kind of a purpose. And so even if they are only aiming at electrical infrastructure or even more legitimate military targets, it is almost certain that there's going to be collateral damage, and we have seen it many times before on civilian infrastructure. It is not clear right now the extent of the damage, but electricity providers have already preemptively gone and made power cuts overnight and into today in anticipation of these kind of attacks.
