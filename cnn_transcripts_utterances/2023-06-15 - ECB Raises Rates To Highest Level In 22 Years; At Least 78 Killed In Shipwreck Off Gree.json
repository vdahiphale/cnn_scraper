It is Thursday, June 15th. I'm Zain Asher in for Richard Quest, and this is QUEST MEANS BUSINESS. Tonight, the head of the European Central Bank says it is too early to even think about a pause. The ECB raised its benchmark interest rate by a quarter of a percentage point. It is now three-and-a-half percent, the highest since May 2001. The Eurozone inflation fell last month to 6.1 percent. ECB president, Christine Lagarde says it is projected to stay too high for too long, so that means more increases are on the way. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And moreover, a lot of that high headline inflation is being driven by food and energy due to the war in Ukraine, but even if we strip out those components and look at core inflation, even there, we're still not seeing a really clear trend that core inflation is coming off. So my sense is that those two data points have high headline inflation and high core inflation are concerning to the ECB that that could potentially push up nominal wages further and just prolong this period of too high inflation. And so to guard against that, they decided to continue to raise interest rates at today's meeting, and also, as your clip show, to very clearly signal that they see more of those interest rate rises in the months to come.",

One of them is demographics, that's been well telegraphed. But for the first time in its recent history, the Chinese population is now actually shrinking, its labor force is declining. No country in the history of economic development has been able to grow at a rate of more than two percent when its labor force has been shrinking, especially as much as China. The second issue has to do with the fact that China has massive levels of debt, debt levels that are even higher than a developed country, such as the United States, if you look at the total debt, and that is also weighing down on the country. In a way, it has already borrowed a lot to grow in the past, but it has borrowed from the future. So I think that you have the structural headwinds out there, and a lot of people haven't quite adjusted their expectations to that, which is why I believe that the underlying trend growth in China this decade, is likely to be in the two to three percent ballpark, rather than the five percent target that the government has set, and also what many observers of China just like to follow whatever their government in China says.",

The stakes are just a bit higher here. Yale asked over a hundred CEOs a simple, but scary question: Does AI have the potential to wipe out humanity? And the good news, relatively speaking is that 58 percent said no, no way. That's not going to happen. But what was really startling for me to see is that you had eight percent who said yes, this could happen potentially five years from now, and 34 percent who said yes, potentially in 10 years. So here you have 42 percent of CEOs saying that AI poses an existential threat not decades from now, but in the not too distant future. Yale professor, Jeff Sonnenfeld, he told me that he found these findings to be \"dark and alarming.\" Now, none of this of course, is to say that AI itself is evil. We know it has enormous potential here to transform health care and education and transportation. I think anyone who uses ChatGPT for just a few minutes can see the potential here. But we are hearing more warnings from business leaders and tech experts.

My average federal government agency probably has a hundred cybersecurity vendors within their environment, which weren't designed to work together.

Some of them were leaving drinks or thank you drinks. One of them had 200 people invited to it who were told to bring their own booze. The committee who decided this and came up with this report that was more than 100 page long was made up of seven people. Four of them, by the way Zain, were from Boris Johnson's own party and ultimately they found that Boris Johnson did in fact mislead parliament and he had a pretty loose interpretation of his own rules. The rules that he helped to write. For instance, he continues to insist that despite the lockdown rules at the time that these social gatherings were, in fact, essential work functions. So the committee actually wrote that some of Johnson's denials were so disingenuous that they by their very nature were deliberate attempts to mislead. They also wrote this in part. I'll read a segment of it. It says the contempt was all the more serious because it was committed by the prime minister, the most senior member of the government. There is no precedent for a prime minister having been found to have deliberately misled the House. He misled the House on an issue of the greatest importance to the House and to the public and he did so repeatedly. He declined their invitation to reconsider his assertions that what he said to the House was truthful. He released, Johnson himself, having released his own statement on Friday when he resigned as MP released another one in response to the official release of this report where he said, in part, for the committee now to say that all such events, thank you's and birthdays were intrinsically illegal is ludicrous. Contrary to the intentions of those who made the rules including me and contrary to the findings of the Met - meaning the Metropolitan Police, and above all I did not for one moment think they were elicit at the time or when I spoke in their common. So as you mentioned Zain, the sanction here which has been suggested or recommended is 90 days suspension as a sitting MP which would potentially or likely trigger a buy election for his own seat and potentially put him out of office for much longer.

As you mentioned the Wall Street Journal now reporting that the Department of Justice is - has notified the PGA Tour and Liv Golf that it is looking at this merger for potential anti-trust violations. Now when I spoke to our legal analyst Shan Wu about specifically what they could be looking at, he kind of boiled it down to me in simple terms. He said basically the - the whole point of having an anti-trust system in the United States is that if you have an industry with major players that merge together, it basically knocks all the competition out of the room. And according to our laws in the United States and the way the U.S. economy is set up, it's set up so that the most people as possible can compete in a given sport or given business arrangement, or business situation. So that's what they're going to be looking at, basically at it's heart did this deal, kind of, knock all the competition completely off the board and according to the Journal, they - they site something very interesting. They say that anti-trust lawyers have been pointing out that a potentially problematic aspect of this deal are statements like the one that the PGA Tour Commissioner Jay Monahan made earlier this month, when he said that the deal would be good for the tour to quote, \"take the competitor off of the board to have them exist as a partner and not an owner\" end quote, that was from the PGA Tour commissioner. So when he says things like that, openly saying that this is designed to, kind of, merge forces and take all the competition out that's what the Department of Justice may be looking at, but also according to our analyst Shan Wu, it's possible - possible that the Justice Department will be looking at the aspect of this where the PGA and Liv, if they - if they merge together and they hold tournaments together. A lot of tournaments are played near military bases and that could be looked at just from the status of a potential national security concern, so and I asked Shan flat out could - could all of this maybe kill this merger. He said it conceivably could, now of course, you know, the PGA and Liv will fight this. They'll - they'll litigate this but they're already involved in so much litigation over all of this Zain that, you know, it's probably not something they - they need right now but if they Department of Justice is going, kind of, you know, bring them forth and, kind of, rake them over the coals for this it's going to be tough for them to negotiate this process.",
