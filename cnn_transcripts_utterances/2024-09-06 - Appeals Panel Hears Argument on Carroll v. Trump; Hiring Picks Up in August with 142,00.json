The Republican presidential nominee is in the courtroom and he wants the court to overturn what is $5 million verdict after being found liable for sexually abusing and defaming Carroll. Well, this could be a big day in another case involving Donald Trump. Judge Juan Merchan is expected to decide whether he'll push back Trump's sentencing in the Stormy Daniels hush money case until after the election. And the clock is ticking, of course, towards that election. We are 60 days to go. Let's bring in former state and federal prosecutor, David Weinstein, currently a partner with the firm, Jones Walker, and criminal defense attorney and former prosecutor, Bernarda Villalona. Bernarda, let me start with you. What is the defense case as we understand it today in court and what can we expect?",

So what Donald Trump is claiming is that he received an unfair trial, that the judge in that case made some evidentiary rulings that were not correct. And therefore, it lead to a jury finding him liable for sexually abusing E. Jean Carroll, specifically he is objecting that there were witnesses that testified specifically to women that Trump supposedly sexually abused them and that this was so prejudicial that it led to this jury coming back with a verdict in favor of E. Jean Carroll. Also, as to many objections that he made throughout the trial, for each of those objections, he did preserve the record to appeal if there was a judgment in the case.",

Unless they can present something with him other than, look, he's running for election and you shouldn't sentence him before then, he's not going to postpone the sentencing. He's got a motion he needs to hear with regard to their arguments based on the Supreme Court decision, a prosecutorial immunity. I think that one falls flat on its face and then it's time for sentencing and defendants have to answer. He's not going to go into jail even if he gets jail time. They'll allow him to stay out pending the appeal. He's already been convicted. And so the only argument on Trump's side is that, well, having him sentenced would influence the election. That's not what this judge is concerned about. He's concerned about putting an end to the proceeding in front of him and letting the appeal take place. So, again, at best, 50-50.

So in terms of New York onSeptember 18th, I do believe that sentencing is going to move forward. They have already litigated the Supreme Court decision on motion papers, and Judge Merchan is going to make a decision. But just like David said, I do agree that whatever sentence that is handed down Donald Trump is going to ask that that sentence be stayed, meaning that he doesn't carry out that sentence or begin that sentence where there's probation, community service, a fine, or even a jail sentence, until he exhausts all his appeals. Now, in terms of what happened with his D.C. federal case. Now, in that case, we know that Judge Chutkan has already set aside a motion scheduled to determine how does presidential immunity actually affect this indictment and the evidence that is to be presented if this case goes on. Are you going to see a trial in that case before the election? Highly unlikely, but what we will see is a mini-trial in the sense of that it's going to be played out in motion papers and you're going to see the prosecution, the special counsel, provide the evidence that they tend to put before a jury if this case were to go forward. And possibly even an evidentiary hearing that maybe you will hear testimony if needed in that case. Florida, you already know how that turned out.

To the other side in the Trump campaign, he can also argue that, hey, look, the jobs market is slowing and we can do something about that. So to the point I made, there should be something in that, what this doesn't address, and I'll give you a bit more of the details, I think is what the Federal Reserve ends up doing on September 18th. I went out on a limb in the last hour, Becky, instead, I think they'll cut a quarter of a percentage point and the feel-good factor attached to that, arguably again, should help the incumbent or the Harris campaign, I think, as people see the borrowing costs come down. Very quickly what we saw and you mentioned it, less jobs, net overall added in August than we were expected. We also got revisions lower to the prior two months, so we are significantly below the number of jobs added average over the past 12 months. But we know the job market is slowing, Becky. What it's not doing I think is collapsing and this is the critical question we had carried over from last month. The underlying details of this are still strong, I think. Wages popped up a little bit high, nothing to worry about on the inflationary front. We also saw the hours worked by those that are working stayed strong. So slowing, not collapsing.

Why did the judge come back in to correct that record? A couple of legal necessities. Number one, the record is the record. So that is the official record of the case. He needs to set -- he needed to set that record straight. And the defendant is entitled under law to be in the courtroom when those things are occurring. So setting the record straight, he'd have to be there for it. And number two, he had to make sure that the defendant heard that the record was set straight, that he was not facing the death penalty because if he had that knowledge in his head and then was offered a deal to plead guilty for life imprisonment or something like that, the death penalty would be a factor that he was weighing in the back of his mind in that thinking.
