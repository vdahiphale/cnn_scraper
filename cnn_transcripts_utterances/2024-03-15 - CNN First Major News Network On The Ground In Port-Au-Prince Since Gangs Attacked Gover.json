ANDERSON COOPER, CNN HOST, \"ANDERSON COOPER 360\": Tonight on 360, CNN's David Culver, the first U.S. television correspondent on the ground in Haiti. What he is seeing with armed gangs controlling the capital and the World Food Programme, saying a third of the population is now experiencing acute hunger. Also tonight, the judge ruled and Fulton County DA Fani Willis decided she is staying on the Trump case, but her lead prosecutor and former romantic partner has quit. Take a look at what happens now. And key voters in a swing state. What undecided women in Arizona told our Randi Kaye about the issues they're weighing in picking the next president as part of our election year series on women voters, the 53 percent. Good evening. We begin tonight with Haiti and CNN's David Culver, who has been trying for days to get into the country and has just now arrived. The country is in chaos with Prime Minister stepping down, gangs now controlling the streets and ordinary Haitians, millions of whom are going hungry, trying to survive. CNN is the first major news network to make it into Port-au-Prince since this latest outbreak of violence. David Culver joins us now from there. What is the situation like on the ground there?",

It's tense, but there's also this eerie quiet that you feel as you're making your way through the streets and we were only driving for about 10 minutes or so. And compared to when we were here three weeks ago, I expected to see at least some livelihood out on the street, some activity. There were no street vendors. Folks were hurrying along, and one local Haitian told me it's because we were getting close to curfew, six o'clock.And you run the risk, if you are out after curfew, not to be ticketed or cited or anything, but rather potentially to have police open fire on you. I mean, that just tells you the type of situation that this city is dealing with, and really this country has found itself in. It is a crisis that they have not faced in years. It is unprecedented for many aspects of the city in particular. And then when you look at some of the most difficult aspects, you're talking about food insecurity and health care. So if you break down the health care, it's 80 percent, according to one local hospital executive, of hospitals in the city that are shuttered. And many of them have been ransacked, they've been looted. Some of the medical workers themselves have been targeted by gang members, so they're living in fear. And then the food insecurity is a growing concern. You have officials who are saying that you've got about a million people who are a step away from famine. Why is that? Well, we experienced it just in the logistics of trying to get to where we are now. And that is you've got roadways that are blocked by gang activity, depending on the hour. You have to reroute and figure out another way around. It just shows you how quickly evolving this situation is, Anderson, and you've even got communities that have started to barricade themselves even more so than we saw three weeks ago and have created essentially self-defense brigades, according to locals, and are carrying guns more than I've seen on the streets here, certainly from the last visit, just to make sure that the gangs don't get any closer and try to take over territory.",

And in the last RICO case that I'm aware of, DA Willis taking to trial with 12 defendants, she was able to get a jury in about four weeks. So I think that's the precedent that we should be looking at. Now, true. There are a lot of other cases and matters that may shift the time frame, but she has unequivocally said she is ready to take this to trial. That has been her mantra since the beginning.

And that's the most important practical bottom line. She's still on the case.But Fani Willis' credibility is in tatters in a way that I've never seen from any prosecutor. She's now been reprimanded twice by two separate judges. And the language in this opinion, you never see this. I've never seen a prosecutor admonished like this by a judge ever. I mean, the judge said there's seven or eight attacks on her credibility founded by the record. He said there are reasonable questions about whether the D.A. testified untruthfully. That means the judge is saying there's a realistic probability the district attorney got on the witness stand and committed perjury and so I think that's going to manifest a couple ways. One, we're all watching. The public's all watching. That's your jury pool. And second of all, it's going to undermine the legitimacy of this prosecution going forward, and that matters. We care about our prosecutors abiding by the rules and staying clean of conflicts like this. COOPER: Jeff, this trial would be televised.

Notably, that suggestion was missing from the non- disqualification order today.So if it was my case, you'd - I think you'd start to look and see how strong is your case without these six charges, whether you would go forward. It does not dismiss any defendants from the case. Everybody is still tied under the main charge, the RICO charge in this matter. And it's very easy, as your guests in studio know, very easy to indict at the state level.

He did not mention that his old boss egged on a mob bent on murdering him on January 6th and who got within a few dozen feet of him and his family as they were hustled away to safety. Nothing about that. He would not say who he'd vote for, only that it would not be Joe Biden. He also suggested that he would not back a third party candidate. With that in mind, there's new battleground state polling that shows how competitive things are and how complicated, too, because of high interest in Robert Kennedy Jr. and other third party options.

At this point in 1992, Ross Perot was polling about 20 percent. So the disaffection, the disillusionment, the search for another candidate is not quite that high. But look, Robert Kennedy Jr. getting 10 percent in Michigan, 10 percent in Arizona, 9 percent in Pennsylvania. Add in Jill Stein is running for the Green Party nomination. Cornel West is running SES (ph), we'll see if he gets on the ballots. He says he's running as a third party candidate. Justice for All, I believe, is what he calls his new party. Seventeen percent in Michigan right now looking for an alternative, 13 percent in Arizona, 11, 12, 13 percent there in Pennsylvania as well, so yes. Yes, people are looking for other choices. Those are pretty significant numbers. The question is, where does it go from here? If you think just about independence, right, we think about the middle of the electorate. Everybody always says in a close election, independents settle it. That's true. You could say it's the suburbs. But this is a key group just among independents. This is Robert F. Kennedy Jr., 16 percent in Michigan, 25 percent in Arizona, 21 percent in Pennsylvania. So the self-defined middle of the electorate don't belong to any party. They're looking for somebody else, Anderson.",

People realize, you know, they're not going to win. I need to vote for a winner. Perot, though, remember, got 19 percent. So we have to watch this and see, is this traditional or is it like 1992? We've got to watch it play out.So look just in Arizona. This is Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s support among Hispanics, Latinos, 19 percent. That mostly hurts Biden, right? Because that's traditionally a more Democratic constituency, although there has been a little trickle back to Republicans in recent cycles. Younger voters, he's getting 16 percent. Again, your reflex is that hurts Biden, right? The Democrats mostly get younger voters. Independence, as I said, that's a bit of a draw. There are independent Republican-leaning independents, Democratic-leaning independents. But look at this. Joe Biden needs Democrats in the cities, right, urban areas. Robert Kennedy's get 11 percent. But rural voters, that's traditionally a Trump base. Robert Kennedy's getting 13 percent. So both campaigns are going to have to study. That's just Arizona. I'll bring up Pennsylvania to look at it as well. In these key states, absolutely critical to getting to 270, Kennedy gets 6 percent of Biden voters in Pennsylvania. So if your Biden campaign you say that's a problem, well, he's getting 9 percent of 2020 Trump voters in Pennsylvania. In the cities, 9 percent; in the suburbs, 7 percent, but again, a lot of Trump voters in those rural Pennsylvania counties, he's getting 10 percent. So the key thing is, Anderson, both campaigns, eight months, they're going to have to study. In which state is he hurting me, in which state might he - and the others, don't forget the others - be helping me. And guess what? Money you think Trump would spend his money just against Biden? Biden just against Trump? No, watch. Pretty soon, there'll be some ads against Bobby Kennedy. You can count on it.",

In the city of Voronezh, an old lady is being held by election officials for doing the same thing. You can see the ruined votes, stained bright green.

The country is very different. I mean, Russia was not involved in a full scale war with Ukraine back then. Alexei Navalny was still alive. There was an opposition which was, you know, kind of repressed, but it was still able to operate inside the country. Now the opposition has been silenced. There's been a brutal campaign of repression. Opposition leaders have been exiled, jailed. We're in the case of Alexei Navalny. I mean, he's dead. He died in an Arctic penal colony last month. And so, you know, the context of it is very different. It's much rarer now to see protests like this and much riskier. And it points to the real frustrations that are simmering beneath the surface in Russia. We'll see, you know, what happens over the next couple of days. The results are expected to be announced perhaps on Monday, because it's a three-day voting process.
