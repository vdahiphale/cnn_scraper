This is EARLY START.Just hours from now, one of the most important Federal Reserve decisions in years. We'll hear from Fed officials for the first time since the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, the sale of Credit Suisse, and the lifeline extended to First Republic. The big question, will the Fed raises interest rates to try to fight inflation, even in the midst of global banking turmoil, and if so, by how much. Today's decision could affect the interest rates on your loans on your credit cards, the price you pay at the store and even potentially the bank where you keep your money. CNN's Anna Stewart live in London for us. Anna, we've been saying this is a delicate balancing act for the Fed here. I mean the options are they pause, they raise rates 25 basis points, or they follow in the footsteps of the European Central Bank and fight against inflation by raising a big 50 basis points.",

So that is certainly one of the options out there. But the risk, of course, is you spoke with markets, particularly with the uncertainty around the banking sector. That middle option the smaller hike a quarter of a percent. That seems to be what is priced in by investors, and certainly what I'm seeing in terms of analysts' notes in terms of their expectations. Which is act on that data, but maybe also kind of read the room of the markets. So, the third option do absolutely nothing. This would be perhaps the fed deciding that really going to take this seriously, they're going to pause while they focus on the banking sector. But, of course, that suggests that maybe they're not taking inflation seriously enough, so that could also have a negative impact on the markets. It's not just the rate, though, is it? It's the messaging around it that will get today and also the so called dot plot, the quarterly summary of economic projections, if they release it. There was a suggestion that they might hold off, but I think that's going to be really interesting in terms of where people are seeing rates go beyond this.",

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) PAULA REID, CNN SENIOR LEGAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  This was the day former President Trump claimed he would be arrested on charges related to a hush money probe, but there is no sign yet of an arrest or even an indictment. Still, law enforcement continues to prepare for possible protests. In Washington, D.C., barriers erected around the capital. In New York, police officers told to be in uniform and ready for deployment. So far, officials say there are no credible threats despite online chatter calling for civil war if Trump is indicted. Today, small groups gathered outside Trump Tower and Mar-a-Lago. There has been no word from the Manhattan district attorney after a last ditch effort by Trump to avoid charges.

So that is coming up pretty fast.In terms of the reason why they were able to accelerate, well, they're saying that the Ukrainian soldiers already had a baseline knowledge of air defense systems, and we're quick at learning, so they're able to whittle down that 10-week training period eight weeks and get this done faster, so it's sort of public praise for Ukrainian soldiers also good news for Ukraine. In terms of the M1 Abrams battle tanks, those main battle tanks that were so sought after by Ukraine, that timeline also being accelerated, according to U.S officials. That was originally thought to be set to take more than a year to get those tanks to Ukraine with the most sophisticated model needing lots of refurbishment, perhaps even building from scratch lots of training. They have now decided to send a slightly older model, which will need less training less preparation, and that will mean they say they can get those tanks to Ukraine by the fall. So that is another boost for Ukraine. Now, of course, the reason not such good news is that the U.S. believes that Russia may be getting ready to mount a new offensive in the coming weeks. John Kirby, the National Security Council spokesperson telling CNN, he thinks the next weeks and months will be crucial and overnight Christine yet more evidence of the need for sophisticated air defense in Ukraine, the air force there saying that 21 drones were fired at the country of which they shut down 16.",
