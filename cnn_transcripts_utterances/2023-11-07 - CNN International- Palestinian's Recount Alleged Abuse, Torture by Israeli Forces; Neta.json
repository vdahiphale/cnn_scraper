And in a new interview, he also said that Israel will have what he calls overall security responsibility in Gaza after the war ends.Our colleague Rosemary Church spoke last hour with H.A. Hellier, a senior associate fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, about what things could look like going forwards. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) H.A. HELLYER, SR. ASSOCIATE FELLOW, CARNEGIE ENDOWMENT FOR INTERNATIONAL PEACE: The Prime Minister, of course, Benjamin Netanyahu has said many times on the record that he opposes a Palestinian state. He has many in his government that are openly opposed to a Palestinian state. And on the contrary, I've said on a number of occasions that they see the existence of Palestinians even in their own country, Palestinian-Israelis, Palestinians with Israeli citizenship, to be there by mistake because they weren't all pushed out in 1948 by Ben Gurion, the founder of the State of Israel. Of course, East Jerusalem is annexed. I don't think they're interested in annexing Gaza, but it still remains an occupied territory. But one that they don't want to have to deal with. So your reporter did mention the idea of, you know, indefinite security control, indefinite security control, but without occupation. Of course, that's completely contradictory. They will remain legally speaking in occupation of the territory. The question then becomes who's going to govern? Because they're destroying every semblance of government structure within the Strip right now. Health infrastructure, electricity infrastructure, educational infrastructure. So I'm not sure what's going to be left to govern in that regard. There'll be people but they'll be people who have to, you know, spend years if not decades trying to recover, let alone the human cost, of course. And again, I'm not sure who's going to want to step in. It's going to be a mammoth effort and one that, again, the international can -- at least the regional part of the international community suspects greatly that part of the policy of the Netanyahu government right now is making so difficult for people in Gaza that they are forced to flee, go to Egypt, and then never be allowed to return by the Israeli forces. And the Jordanians are worried about this, the Egyptians are worried about this, and it's been roundly condemned by regional governments. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
