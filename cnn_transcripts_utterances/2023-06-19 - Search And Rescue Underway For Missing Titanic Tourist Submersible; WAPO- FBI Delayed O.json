We also have new pictures of the sub before it was launched on Sunday.There it is there in the water. You could see flotation device several of them around the edges on the ocean. The pictures were posted on a dive participant's Instagram page with the caption \"had a successful launch and currently diving.\" Right now Coast Guard officials are racing to find the missing crew members before - and this is crucial, of course, their oxygen and power run out. CNN Anchor and International Correspondent, Paula Newton, joins us now live from Ottawa with details. Paula, I mean, the difficulty of this, right, 2.4 miles deep. That's how far down the Titanic is.

They continue to search with now three assets on scene. What's interesting here is the fact that Canada and that is specifically the Halifax research coordination and rescue center has sent up a P-8 Poseidon. And what can that do?That can look from the air to look for a submersible in the seabed. But as you just pointed out, Jim, what is so difficult is the depth. They have no way of knowing if they were on their way back up and lost communication or if they were somewhere in the depths of this wreckage, which as you say is almost 2.5 miles beneath the ocean. We need to say here that they do have about four days, 96 hours of oxygen and fuel, things that will protect them as the search continues, but obviously it's incredibly difficult. It could just be a communication problem at this point in time. The other thing that they are looking for is the weather which will impact the search and rescue obviously. But again, three assets the U.S. Coast Guard says is on the scene right now, more to come. And I should also say that they continue to pool expertise from all over the world, Jim. That issue here is that this kind of deep sea rescue is incredibly difficult, even if they locate them. If they can't come to the surface, then the issue is how you get them to the surface and that's what the U.S. Coast Guard is working on right now.",

It perhaps gives some advantages here in terms of searching underwater, particularly at those depths.Oren at the Pentagon, thanks so much. We also have CNN Correspondent, Tom Foreman, here in D.C. Tom, I wonder, as we're looking at this here, what's the difference so we understand it between a submersible and a submarine?",

      "sentences": "They're all submarines. But submersibles are a particular type of submarine and that will speak to what both Paula and Oren just mentioned about why this is difficult to do.If you think about a submarine, it's a big vessel. It's meant to be underwater for a long period of time to support a crew of hundred, 130 different people. That's what we see with military submarines. And in truth, they don't tend to operate that deep in the water, maybe two tenths of a mile, under a quarter mile in any event. So if you're looking for military subs, they're fairly close to the surface. Submersibles - and there are robotically operated ones, there are those that are autonomous that operate on their own. But a human submersible like this goes much, much, much, much, much deeper. And yes, it's a much smaller profile vessel. It's only meant to be down for a limited period of time compared to a submarine, which we've been around for a very long period of time. It only supports a limited number of people on board. And although it has very good movement horizontally and the ability to come up and down, that's - it's limited scope here. So think of it this way, imagine if you had a very, very, very tall building and you were searching for something in the top few floors of it, that's where you're looking for a submarine as we normally think of a submarine. When you talk about a submersible, you would have to go down through all the floors all the way to the bottom to maybe find that submersible. That's a difference in depth. And as you can even see in these pictures much, much smaller. So the chief difference is a submarine can stay down a long time and support a whole lot of people and it stays relatively close to the surface. A submersible can go very, very deep, with very few people on board and it's a small target to look for in a great big ocean.",

And I think that both of them over the weekend, and I know Bill Barr, he's been on the air for several days now talking about this indictment, very critical of Donald Trump and also warning about what a potential 2024 return to the White House could be for Donald Trump and arguing that they don't think that he should be trusted with the nation's secrets.

And that was really the key motivation going into these two days of meetings for the Secretary of State, can the U.S. and China get in the same room and really have a real honest dialogue face-to-face about the issues, the challenges at play in the relationship between these two superpowers.Now, when it comes to progress, the Secretary of State said there was progress on some fronts. When it comes to the fentanyl issue, the synthetic opioid issue in the United States, it really affects Americans. It's a major killer of Americans, ages 18 through 49. There was agreement between the U.S. and China to stand up a working group to address that issue, because a lot of the inputs for fentanyl actually come from precursor chemicals that are produced in China, so that's significant. But what the Secretary also said, Brianna, is that progress takes time and that these two days weren't going to be some salve to all of these issues between the two nations. One of the major issues that the Secretary set out to address was trying to stand up regular military to military channels of communication between the two countries and the Chinese did not agree to that. So the fact that they didn't make that agreement, that's a challenge for the Secretary heading back to Washington. He said that he raised it multiple times in his meetings. And that is something that the U.S. is going to continue to push China on. Now, when it comes to Taiwan, it's clear that there are remaining tensions between the U.S. and China really unsurprisingly. We heard from the Chinese Foreign Ministry read out of one of the meetings that they made demands of the U.S. when it comes to Taiwan, they said it presents the most pronounced risk to the U.S.-China relationship. And the Secretary of State basically said that the U.S. position on Taiwan remains the same. Here's what he said in the press conference earlier today. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
