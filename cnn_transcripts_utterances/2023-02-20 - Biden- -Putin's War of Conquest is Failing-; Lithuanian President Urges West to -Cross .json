Lithuania started, even before the war to deliver stingers; it happened two weeks ahead of the war broke out. And this is very important that the cross these red lines, which are in our minds, and do not really exist. And maybe sometimes Russia tries to set up those red lines instead of us. But we should not waste the time because we are wasting the time trying to cross these red lines and every day of the war in Ukraine brings more and more casualties, killed people, destroyed civil infrastructure, and destroyed the Ukrainian economy.

Normally, a lot of people are involved; it's this big effort to make sure that they've crossed all the T's dotted all the I's. But for one of this sensitivity, it is very close hold. And so we are told that last Friday, President Biden huddled with his aides inside the Oval Office. And that is when he made the final call that yes, he was going to go into Kyiv just days before that one-year anniversary of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. And so he departed Washington at about 4 am local on Sunday morning. He wasn't actually scheduled to leave until much later tonight, from Washington to come here to pull him that making that trip only two reporters were on the plane. Only a handful of the President staff, a small medical team, a photographer, that was really it that was traveling with President Biden, in addition, of course, to the Secret Service and the security part of this trip, and he now made that trade right in to Kyiv, we'll learn more details about what exactly that planning looks like. But given he is very much still in Ukraine and is on his way out. The White House is keeping those details private for the moment because of course concerns for his security. And so while he was there on the ground, you did see him announced that half a billion dollars in aid to Ukraine. That is going to include a lot of the weaponry that we've seen the United States seen before the Javelins, the Howitzers. The big questions remain, though about what the U.S. is going to do on the F-16 fighter jets are those longer range missiles that you've seen. The Ukrainians say that they so desperately need to turn the tide of this war to break the kind of log jam that it's been in. But this was a symbolic trip at a critical moment for both President Biden and President Zelenskyy and the Ukrainians. And so we'll see what President Biden says about the trip overall, when he arrives here in Poland, which we expect in the next several hours or so.",

Technologies are helping scientists mapthe deepest depths of the ocean and understand the dangers that underwater volcanoes may pose to island nations. CNN Meteorologist Allison Chinchar has the story in our new series Transformers. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ALLISON CHINCHAR, CNN METEOROLOGIST (voice over): Late December 2021, in the middle of the South Pacific, an underwater volcano is active once again. Two weeks later, a series of eruptions will reverberate around the planet and be visible from space. Tsunami warnings were issued across the Pacific. And the next afternoon, a series of waves hit the island country of Tonga. Some as high as 15 meters, killing three people and leaving mass destruction in their wake. When the dust had settled a few months later, a ship from New Zealand's National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research or NIWA set sail to find out what had triggered the eruption. Marine Geology Technician, Erica Spain was on board. DR. ERICA SPAIN, MARINE GEOLOGY TECHNICIAN AT NIWA: The voyage up to Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha'apai to map the volcano was really exciting to multidisciplinary voyage. So you've got multiple science streams working together to try and figure out what was going on and why erupted so violently? These are the multi beams on --. CHINCHAR (voice over): Spain's mission was to map the seafloor around the volcano using a machine called a multi beam echo sounder.",

      "sentences": "And then we have hydrophones or a listening ear that receives that echo and from that we can determine how deep the sea floor is and build upan idea of its shape and geometry. Every volcano has a different trigger in terms of when it might erupt. And by mapping Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha'apai and then comparing that to other volcanoes, we can begin to build up a better image of what these triggers might be or what they might look like on the seafloor. CHINCHAR (voice over): Mapping, taking rock samples, and filming underwater, all help build a bigger picture of what happened here.",
