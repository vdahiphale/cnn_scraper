With less than a week to go until election day, we have brand new CNN polls, showing Kamala Harris with a slight edge in two of the must win Rust Belt states. CNN David Chalian is at the Magic Wall to break down the impact for both campaigns.Plus, he is known for pushing dangerous conspiracy about vaccines, COVID 19, anti-depressants. Now Donald Trump is promising to put Robert Kennedy Jr. in charge of public health. What would that mean for you? We have brand new CNN reporting on that. And rivals turned partners. I'll talk to a House Democrat battling an aggressive neurological disorder and the Republicans she once unseated about why they're now working together to try to elect Kamala Harris. I'm Dana Bash. Let's go behind the headlines at Inside Politics. With just six days left to win votes, Kamala Harris and Donald Trump are all over the battleground map. Both candidates have events in North Carolina and Wisconsin today, while Vice President Harris has an extra stop planned in pivotal Pennsylvania. Winning the blue wall state is still Harris' best path to 270. On that note, we are unveiling a new CNN poll from Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan. David Chalian is where else at the Magic Wall to break it all down. David?",

      "sentences": "Three polls for you today, Dana. Yes. These are our final set of battleground state polls, and today, we're focusing on those blue wall states. Take a look at the overall numbers, among likely voters in Pennsylvania, dead heat tie. 48 percent to 48 percent in the biggest electoral college vote prize of the battleground map.In Michigan, slight edge for Kamala Harris, 48 percent to 43 percent. In Wisconsin, we also see a slight edge for Harris, 51 percent to 45 percent. I will note in these two states, the Supreme Court ruled that it's going to stay this way. Robert F. Kennedy Jr. remains on the ballot, and his presence there may be putting some downward pressure on Trump's numbers there. Let's look at the gender gap across all three states. You see here, I'll start down here in Wisconsin. Trump is up 12 with men. Harris up 21 points with women in our poll. That's certainly helping her there. The gender gap is helping her in Michigan, men are tied between the two candidates in Michigan in our poll, whereas Harris has an eight- point advantage with female voters in Michigan. But then take a look here. There isn't really much of a wide gender gap. Trump has got a four-point edge with men in Pennsylvania. Harris has a three-point edge with women. That certainly helps explain why the race is tied there. African American voters. Now I just want to say, here we're comparing likely voters in a poll which is different than actual voters that show up in the 2020 exit poll about how the electorate sort of shaped itself and how they voted in Pennsylvania. But as a comparative point in our poll among likely voters in Michigan, Harris has a 71-point advantage among African American voters over Donald Trump. Joe Biden in Michigan four years ago, according to the exit polls, won the African American vote in Michigan by 85 percentage points. So, a little bit under performance there in this poll, but much more dramatically in Pennsylvania. Harris's lead with African Americans, among likely African American voters in Pennsylvania, in our poll, is 55 percentage points over Trump. Biden in 2020 in the exit polls, won African American voters in Pennsylvania by 85 percentage points. That is a potential warning sign in places like Philadelphia, Pittsburgh for the Harris campaign to take a look at. And then, interestingly, this is Donald Trump's base, Dana. As you know, white non college educated voters, and it is still his base, but he's not performing as strong as he did four years ago. If you compare now in Pennsylvania, as a 27-point advantage with white non college voters in our poll among likely voters, but back in the exit polls, four years ago, he actually won them in Pennsylvania by 32 points. You see it in Michigan, 17. Back then it was 21 points. In Wisconsin, in the poll, he has an 11-point edge among white non college likely voters, but in the 2020, exit polls, he won them by 16 percentage points. So, a little bit underperforming with his own base, Dana.",

One former administration official telling CNN, clearly frustrated, they said they were -- they found the entire episode infuriating, and they even said nobody wants him out there about the president. Look, I think the bottom line is that the campaign is anxious. They very much anticipate that this election is going to be incredibly close. And they do not want any kind of unnecessary distractions and any ammunition, fair or not, that Donald Trump and his campaign might seize on.
