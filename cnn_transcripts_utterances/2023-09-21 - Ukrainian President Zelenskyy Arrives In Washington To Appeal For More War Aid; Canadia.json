He is hoping to keep the military aid flowing into his country, and he's also addressing criticism that the U.S. isn't seeing strong enough results for its money -- that it is not getting its money worth. Here, he is arriving at the Pentagon, a short time ago with Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin. In the coming hours, he's going to be meeting with President Joe Biden who is trying to shore up support for a $24 billion aid package for Ukraine. Earlier, Mr. Zelenskyy met behind closed doors with lawmakers, some of whom were particularly Republicans, have lost their appetite in terms of backing a war with no end in sight. But the other believes that not defending Ukraine will effectively hand Russia a win. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) CHARLES SCHUMER, U.S. SENATE DEMOCRATIC LEADER:  The effect on Ukraine would be very quick and devastating. We cannot let Putin win. Without aid, Ukraine could run a very strong risk of being defeated. JOSH HAWLEY, U.S. SENATE REPUBLICAN:  They want $25 billion more now. They're going to ask for more later. There's no end in sight. We were told this could literally go on for years. It's another forever war. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

So, Zelenskyy arrived just a few moments ago, about a half an hour ago, and wasimmediately greeted by Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin. Austin knows very well and has openly made the case for more Ukrainian aid. Of course, it's not Austin that Zelenskyy has to convince. It's the lawmakers across the river. He will also meet with Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, General Mark Milley. This is an important meeting as well. It will be the most substantive meeting the two have had, and it comes just eight days before Milley retires. Milley also very much a proponent of more aid to Ukraine. And then Zelenskyy will make another very important stop. He'll visit the 9-11 memorial on the far side of the Pentagon from where we're sitting, and there he will lay a wreath at that memorial. So, not a very long visit here. He's only expected to be here for something like 45 minutes to an hour, but a critical visit, especially at this time during the war. It's worth noting this is only his second visit to the Pentagon, his first since the war began. Zelenskyy was here back in August of 2021, a very different world at the time. There weren't even really rumors that Russia was getting ready to invade Ukraine, so that meeting didn't get nearly as much fanfare as this one. Meanwhile, my producer Haley Britzky was out there as Zelenskyy arrived and said she hasn't seen a crowd like that for a visiting dignitary in years. So, that gives you an idea of the importance of this visit and certainly we'll be waiting to hear what comes out of those meetings before Zelenskyy heads over to the White House. All right, so a warm welcome as you point out at the Pentagon. As your producer pointed hand, she saw it first-hand. Arlette, let me bring you in, because there is a lot of skepticism, Arlette, especially among Republicans, just in terms of whether or not the U.S. is really getting its money's worth, in terms of continuing to pump money into a war that, you know, there's clearly no end in sight right now. What did Zelenskyy say to lawmakers? Was he able to convince them? Was he able to change anyone's mind?",

He repeated his earlier claim that there are credible allegations, this is according to Justin Trudeau that New Delhi had a possible role in that June assassination. His remarks in New York moments ago come amid an escalating diplomatic route between the two nations. Earlier, India's foreign ministry leveled explosive allegations, calling Canada a safe haven for terrorists. Both countries have expelled senior diplomats and taken other measures, too.

And as you just alluded to, they are accusing Canada of harboring extremists and terrorists. Justin Trudeau, facing all of this as he learned the information in the last few hours, is at the U.N.

Will you show both Canadians and the international community the evidence you have of this?

Kyiv's mayor says a nine-year-old girl was among seven people who were injured. And for the first time in six months, Ukraine says Moscow is targeting its energy grid just ahead of winter. Meantime, Ukraine is taking credit for its own attack on Russian military base in Crimea Wednesday. And that's according to sources in Ukraine's security services. CNN's Investigative Producer Katie Polglase is following all the developments and she's joining us from London. So, Katie just explain to us what happened because details at this point are still sparse in terms of Ukraine possibly attacking a Russian air base in Crimea. What more do we know at this point?",

      "sentences": "Well, Zain, what we know is that they are claiming, and this is all from sources that we have with theUkrainian security services, nothing officially on the record from public statements. But from our sources, they are claiming that this is the Saki airbase that has been targeted before, and they're claiming 12 Russian military aircrafts were at the base that was damaged. And also, it's an airbase that Russia uses quite a lot for training people to use drones, particularly the Mujahid-Iranian drones, apparently, that have been used quite frequently in this conflict and we've reported on before a lot of the damage that these attack drones have done to various areas across Ukraine including civilian infrastructure. Now, this is part of a strategy we've been seeing quite a lot in the last few weeks in terms of Ukraine targeting specifically Russian infrastructure in the Crimea. We were reporting just last week on an attack in Sevastopol on the port there. There was a ship repair facility. Ukraine took credit for the missile attack that they launched on that area, huge fires as a result and damage to ships facility. Now, the strategy is clearly to target areas where Russia is launching this invasion from, areas they are storing ships, areas they are storing ammunition, areas they are storing all kinds of military equipment to then continue this offensive. This is clearly part of a strategy from Ukraine alongside this counteroffensive, potentially because of the marginal gains, the slow land progress they're making. This is another area that they are employing as part of their strategy. That's also worth noting the kind of equipment used to make these attacks. They're likely to be long-range missiles. And again, this is something that Zelenskyy -- President Zelenskyy has been arguing for in his conversations in the United States to get more U.S. aid. Because specifically, long-range missiles are something that they claim can target behind enemy lines and therefore are crucial for Ukraine's counteroffensive going forward. We've noticed just in the latest aid package promised from the White House that long-range missiles from the U.S. are not currently included, these ATTACOMs, Army Tactical Missile systems. This is another indication as to why Ukraine is wanting to use them so badly because these kinds of attacks on the Saki airbase, on Sevastopol last week, are clearly very damaging to the Russian offensive and the Russian war effort going forward. But clearly a lot still going on while diplomacy is playing out in the United States at exactly the same time. Zain.",

All right, now to some blockbuster news about media. Rupert Murdoch is stepping down as Chairman of Fox News and Fox Corporation, too. Fox News announced the retirement of the 92-year-old media magnate, saying his life's work has left an indelible imprint on the global media landscape. Murdoch says the time is right for him to take on a different role. His son, Lachlan, will become sole chairman of both companies. Murdoch launched Fox News back in 1996 as a competitor to CNN pushing a conservative agenda. CNN's Anna Stewart is tracking the story for us. I mean, it is quite, it is some legacy that he leaves. I mean, he's been in the business for decades, I think about seven decades. He's 92 years old. But I will say that if you look at Fox News and the tumultuous time that Fox News has had over the past few years, that has been a problem, especially the Dominion lawsuit certainly comes to mind after the 2020 elections.",

So, this is an empire that has been built very steadily. Lots of bits have been sold off and carved out at various times. So, the empire that you see today is actually much leaner in many ways, there was even a few years ago. There have been so many mistakes along the way. Perhaps unsurprising when you own that many different newspaper outlets and media brands. I mean, there was the phone hacking scandal in 2011, which saw Rupert Murdoch testifying in British Parliament saying this is the most humble day of my life.

And that was really the idea of today's speech. Charles really talked going back to the war and how they were indispensable allies in fighting back the Nazis, for example. And this is where heads of state monarchs really have a role, not getting involved in all the minutiae of recent political events, but talking about the deep, long-standing relationships between two countries. And his speech went down incredibly well. There was more than a one and a half minute standing ovation for King Charles in the Senate. Extraordinary response really. He couldn't sit down until it was over, so he almost looked lost at one point. It went down far better than even he expected and this is obviously something that both governments wanted to see to show that France has big supporters in the world but also the U.K. needs France, as well, to plow forward in the future. There was also something quite distinctive that we saw in his speech, which you wouldn't have seen with his mother, he threw himself into climate as a topic, which is quite sensitive considering some of the debates going back in the U.K. right now, but also firmly on the side of Ukraine, saying Ukraine has to win this war to protect the freedoms that we fought for over time. So, I think, you know, we talk about royal soft power. I've talked to you about it before in the past. This is what the U.K. deploys. It's one of its great weapons in its diplomatic armor. But I think Charles is changing it slightly. He's more willing to delve into some of those international issues which his mother stayed well clear from because she didn't want to cause controversy.

Assad is seeking to end his diplomatic isolation after more than a decade of civil war. British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak insists the U.K. will meet its climate commitments. This comes one day after he announced a rollback of green policies specifically delaying a ban on sales of new petrol cars, moving it from 2030 to 2035. Britain has a legally binding 2050 net zero emissions target. More than a dozen African nations are addressing the U.N. General Assembly today, including leaders of the Central African Republic and South Sudan, as well. Some of the issues they have raised include, of course, climate change and the natural disasters faced by the continent, and also the migrant crisis in the Mediterranean. In Libya, a slow-moving tragedy is still unfolding more than one week after catastrophic flooding there killed thousands of people. The U.N. is warning that a disease outbreak could create a second devastating crisis, as well. In Morocco, meantime, survivors are coping with their own heartache after a powerful earthquake killed nearly 3000 people just days before the tragedy that I just mentioned in Libya. And to the south, the war in Sudan is now in its sixth month, with no sign of fighting ending anytime soon. But as world leaders meet for the U.N.

We can go off grid, not even have to attach ourselves to the central grid and go through the phases that predecessors have had to go through, but we can just pop up some solar panels and suddenly have solar powered wells, you know, suddenly have the ability to run hospital clinics and make sure machinery doesn't have to run off generators. So, we see huge opportunities. And I met, yeah, just back from the General Assembly and met with President Ruto. He's making the shift to renewables and the provision of energy, even for Kenya's neighbors, a major feature of his leadership. But I will say one of the challenges is governance, as well, in sub-Saharan Africa. We've had a lot of military takeovers of late in a way that is really destabilizing, that deters investment. So, you know, a lot of leaders who might be less democratically inclined, you know, want to have the economic benefits of transitioning to renewables, of having energy renaissance without tending to the fact that we also need to see democratic accountability, the rule of law, checks and balances that will give those who might provide capital for those kinds of projects the confidence that their investments will be well spent.",

As CNN's David Culver reports, the suspension comes as the number of migrants trying to cross into the U.S. has spiked again. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) DAVID CULVER, CNN SENIOR U.S. NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  With the growing concerns over a rising number of migrants trying to cross into the U.S. through the southern border, one of Mexico's largest freight rail operators, Ferrmax, has halted several northbound trains. Now, these are the freight trains that migrants jump on to and they ride for days amid really treacherous conditions. It takes them from places in southern Mexico closer to the U.S. border. In May, my team and I went aboard and rode only just a small portion of what some refer to as La Bestia, the beast, given how dangerous and deadly it can be for migrants.",

He's going to show me the little things he brought with him. This is everything he has right here. From yesterday, this is what he's got. Now, he finished his food, but he has a little bit of water left. He wants to work in the U.S. when he gets there. He wants a better future, a better life. I asked them, where are they going then? And they said, they really don't know. But as of now, they're basically just going with no idea as to what's next. Getting all their belongings out of what they have with them. Adios. Animo. (END VIDEOTAPE) CULVER (on-camera):  Now, the trains were halted to protect the migrants, according to the railroad operator. Mexico's president has said he would assure the routes continue. But it speaks to not only the pressures for U.S. border officials, but the growing number of migrants flooding into Mexico. It's something we saw firsthand this summer. Five hundred miles from the U.S. southern border, encampments filling Mexico City. The country's capital struggling to deal with the influx. Shelters overcrowding. We noted at the time the number of migrants entering the U.S. was decreasing after the Title 42 ended. It by no means has stopped the flow. Those migrants still desperate, still determined to reach their end goal, which for most is the United States. David Culver, CNN.",

And that's only because of family things that were going on this past year. And had I known that I would have had to miss those very important events, I just would have had to say thank you, but no thank you. But once you commit to the mission, once you're part of the training, I would have been committed to the mission. By the time Rubio returns to Earth next week, he will have been in space for 371 days, longer than any other American in history.
