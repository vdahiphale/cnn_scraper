Hi there. I'm Brianna Keilar with Boris Sanchez back here in Washington. And there has been a second tragedy that is rocking Japan in as many days. Just one day after that 7.5-magnitude quake on its west coast, the country is now mourning five members of its Coast Guard killed in this, a fiery plane crash at Tokyo's Haneda International Airport. This was around 4:45 p.m. local time today, a camera catching the moment of contact, you see it there, as Japan Airlines Flight 516 hit a smaller Coast Guard plane that was actually headed to help with that quake recovery. Japan's public broadcast reporting the Coast Guard captain is now in critical condition.",

Eight babies were among those evacuated. It really is an unbelievable escape. Video shows smoke entering the cabin, one passenger telling CNN they didn't actually feel a shock or anything, as he was not scared. He -- quote -- said: \"We could smell smoke, but passengers were not panicked.\" You hear some of the fear in their voices, despite that quote there, though. Let's get to CNN's Richard Quest. He's an aviation expert. Richard, it is astounding, 369 passengers, 12 crew, a huge flight, and they all made it out.",

Here, you have the plane landing on the runway, hits the Coast Guard aircraft, and then sets on fire. But the plane, with its composite materials, its fire- retardant fabrics, the entire structure of the aircraft is designed to withstand those flames to allow those on board to get off. Now, if you are in one of those fairly rare scenarios, survivable accidents, then you have got 90 seconds. The regulations say the plane needs to be evacuated within 90 seconds of all passengers where half the doors are inoperable, and that seems to have been what happens here. Because of the way the flames were coming from, they were told they could only open those doors at the front of the aircraft. And we have seen it before, Air France landing in Toronto some years ago. It was a very similar situation. Plane caught on fire, everybody got off. The issue here will be why the A350 and the Dash, Coast Guard Dash, were both on the runway at the same time. That is the cause. That's what's going to be investigated.",

Those are all still the questions that are still being asked by both federal authorities, like you just saw there, members from the Joint Terrorism Task Force, as well as the FBI and local authorities there in Rochester. But in that news conference that we had earlier this morning, we did learn a lot about Michael Avery, 35-year-old from Syracuse, New York. Investigators say he traveled from Syracuse on December 27, checked into a hotel -- there you see it -- on December 27 in Rochester, then rented an SUV from a nearby airport car rental place and then, on the day of the attack, actually went around to several different locations by himself. You see in the surveillance video right there -- or picture right there purchasing gas canisters and the gasoline. And then what authorities say happened really just an hour into the New Year's Day, when these concertgoers, about 1,000 of them, were leaving the venue, authorities say he plowed into that crowd, hitting a rideshare car carrying two people, who were killed immediately on impact. With all those gas can and canisters, there was this huge explosion. So, a lot of questions still here. We know that search warrants have been executed on the hotel room, on the vehicles involved, and still nothing is really pointing to a motive here.

It was really right-wing activists who feel that a lot of these Ivy League presidents are too liberal. And so that's where some of this initial concern about her academic writing came from. And to your point about the brand, the Harvard brand, we did see that early applications to Harvard, they fell by 17 percent year over year. A lot of the other schools, including even the University of Pennsylvania, they didn't see that kind of a drop. Now, we should note that the cutoff date for early applications at Harvard, that was November 1. So that would predate the hearing that has gotten so much attention. It would also predate the plagiarism issues. But, still, it does sort of raise this concern about what all of this attention, all this controversy has done to the Harvard brand.

One must not forget that the U.S. Congress -- and I don't know what year it was, certainly long before I came around -- delegated the responsibility of elections to the states. And in the state of Maine, we delegated the election responsibilities to our secretary of state. And then we crafted laws that told her what -- her or him or whoever -- what they had to do when there was an example of someone applying or running for a certain political office. In this case, Mr. Trump came in to run for president. She certified his application because he had enough petition signatures. But then, when we complained, which we were allowed to do under our constitutional rights and under Maine state law, she had a hearing, which was very fair, of which, interestingly enough, they brought no witnesses in. They had very few pieces of information they came, and they objected to her participating after the hearing record was closed. I sometimes think they took us for granted, but, at the end of the day, she's simply following law. So what's going to happen in Maine is that, because of Title 21A, it will now be referred to the Superior Court. And that now captures what has to be done. The superior court will take the arguments from both sides. And I was told today that, by January 17, the Superior Court will make a decision one way or the other.
