The head of Americas and the global chair. It has all to do with their new headquarters. The market is now closed. A tale of two markets, AI versus everything else; and Boeing down seven percent in terms of cashflow. The markets and the main events of the day. NVIDIA shares just go higher after they announced stellar earnings, and then there is that ten to one stock split. The revenge of the Swifties. The US sues to break up Ticketmaster's owner, Live Nation for violating antitrust. And China launches military drills surrounding Taiwan. Well, is it punishment for known as separatist acts. Live in New York, Thursday, May 23rd. I am Richard Quest, and yes, I mean, business. A good, day to you. We start with the AI rally as it shifts into overdrive. It does so as the broader market is sputtering out. Investors have been digesting last night's blockbuster results from NVIDIA. And as a result, the stock shot -- well, it just surged past the key $1,000.00 milestone, and the rally adds around $200 billion to the market cap. If this continues, NVIDIA could soon over take Apple and Microsoft as the world's most valuable company. The rally though, most certainly could not save the broader market. It is one of the few reasons the S&amp;P 500 hasn't fallen further down, but of course, it is not in the Dow, so take a look, that's off 600 points, 1.5 percent and NVIDIA probably propping up the NASDAQ as well. Boeing is largely to blame. Boeing as you see, is down seven percent. Now, Boeing is not the powerhouse in terms of down numbers on the price weighted index it used to be, but even so, when you've got that sea of red and Boeing warning, the CFA warned about cash free flow negative. Kristina Hooper is with me, chief market global strategist at Invesco. Right, let's pull this apart a bit. The market was down today largely just more temper tantrums about interest rates, they're not going to get what they want as quickly as they wanted, is that right?",

We got some hawkish Fed rhetoric, and that certainly threw a lot of cold water on markets. Luckily, we were distracted by great NVIDIA earnings, but we were reminded again today about the potential at least for the Fed to take longer to start cutting because we got the PMIs. We got initial jobless claims and there was a sense on the part of markets that maybe it is going to take longer for the Fed to be comfortable. So having said all of that, I am not sure that it really will take longer for the Fed to cut rates. I still think there is a possibility of a rate cut in July.",

So I don't think they would believe it is in the best interests of fighting inflation to do a symbolic rate cut. I think they want to be very, very comfortable.

Washington is accusing Live Nation, which is the parent company of Ticketmaster of running a monopoly. In doing so, it squeezes out the competition and exercises unfair advantage over consumers, artists, even the venues themselves. So the US government is launching a landmark lawsuit to rein it in. Essentially, if you bought a ticket in the past few years for a concert or an event, it has probably been in some shape or form through Live Nation selling for concerts and events in the US, Europe, Middle East, and Asia, and then striking deals with venues for exclusive rights to sell tickets for major events in that venue. Live Nation merged with Ticketmaster in 2010 and has faced a string of controversies. Its CFO faced a Senate hearing last year after it completely cocked up the ticket release for Taylor Swift's Era tour. The Attorney General Merrick Garland says the Live Nation monopoly must end.

Live Nation has been out there today saying publicly that this is not going to lower fees, that they don't take that much of a cut of the service fees that they foist upon ticket buyers, people who go to concerts at their venues. But the Justice Department is boiling down a lot of this lawsuit. They have issues with a lot of things -- venues, concert venues, how the Live Nation is treating artists. But they are primarily talking often about a Ticketmaster tax, essentially service fees that stack up when people buy tickets because Live Nation is the concert promoter, Ticketmaster is the people that sell the tickets. The company that is owned by Live Nation and they lock in venues so that nobody can use anything to sell their tickets about that essentially. That's where it boils down.

It said, \"They were authorized to shoot me.\" In the e-mail, Donald Trump goes on to falsely claim he nearly escaped death when the FBI searched Mar-a-Lago. He said the agents were locked and loaded for deadly force and had authority to shoot to kill. Sounds very serious, except what he's referring to is the standard boilerplate language in every FBI search warrant that allows the use of force. And it basically says they can use force if necessary to protect their lives. What Trump is trying to do is suggest that by -- he was trying to kill him, Biden was trying to kill him. The U.S. attorney general responded sharply. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MERRICK GARLAND, U.S. ATTORNEY GENERAL: On that allegation is false and it is extremely dangerous.
