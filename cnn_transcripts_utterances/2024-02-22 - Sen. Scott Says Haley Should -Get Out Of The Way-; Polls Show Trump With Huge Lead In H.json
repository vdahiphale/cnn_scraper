In fact, this is the last day of early voting in the presidential race, and there's been a steady stream of voters coming in here to cast ballots, as we've been talking to them, for Nikki Haley and for Donald Trump.Of course, Senator Scott is now a big supporter of Donald Trump. He cast his vote for him. But we asked him about the trajectory of this race, and if he believes Nikki Haley should step aside after Saturday. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. TIM SCOTT (R-SC): The one person that stands in the way of having a conversation between Joe Biden and Donald Trump is Nikki Haley. And so getting out of the way is incredibly important, not for the party, but for America's future. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

She appointed him to his position more than a decade ago, but they were rivals on the presidential campaign trail, and they really have been in other ways as well.So he's urging her to step aside. She, of course, has been saying she is going nowhere. She is competing very aggressively for this South Carolina primary. She said she's going on to Michigan next week onto the Super Tuesday states the week after that. But Dana, the big question here hanging over this race, can Nikki Haley slow the march to the nomination of Donald Trump? Can she slow some of his rise? So much has happened really since the New Hampshire primary, of course, on the world stage as well as in the courtroom here at home. So many voters we're talking to are saying that they are indeed following them. So the question on Haley's voters' minds is what comes next for her. Many believe she should stay in this race. Others say if she gets out, they're not sure they can vote in the November election. But for her part, all systems are campaigning until Saturday. She's really aggressively trying to get out the vote. And as of now, the early vote about 165,000 people have voted so far on this final day of voting here. So she's not giving up by any stretch. She believes South Carolina is still very competitive. We'll see you on Saturday, Dana.",

What do you think some of the answers are to the questions that Jeff just posed down there from South Carolina voters? We're hearing this nationally from Republicans, which is, she's adamant she's staying in the race. What's the end game? GOV. CHRIS SUNUNU (R-NH): Well, again, you know, I'm going to start with Tim Scott's comments, right, which is Nikki Haley is in the way. Well, that means the process is working, right? Because the process shouldn't just be garnering and granting a nomination to someone because the party elite say or just because a couple of states say you got to let the process and the process is the voters, right? So whether it's South Carolina going into Super Tuesday. Nikki has been raising money like crazy. She's got resources. She got a lot of folks behind her. In a lot of those Super Tuesday states, they've barely even started campaigning, really, so that she has the ground troops there working with Americans for prosperity, all these other conservative groups that have gotten behind her. So there's a path. And it's not just slowing the former president down, that's not what it's about, it's about actually making her case. Why, you know, this isn't just about the nomination, but winning in November, having other seats win in November, the value that she brings to the entire ticket and moving the entire party forward from a generational standpoint.",

If you based everything on religion, your own personal religion behind the bench, it would be chaos everywhere, right? Everyone would just kind of make up as they go and whatever they believe in the moment.There are rules. You have to make sure you're following the law and that's what the court needs to do. So I can't speak to that too much other than to say, I don't think that would fly in a place like New Hampshire and in most states. But, again, the voters have a say. The voters can say, look, this is not the leadership we want.",

And when it comes to what Donald Trump and Republicans in Congress are saying about Russia, Ukraine and NATO, he says it very forcefully.For instance, at a fundraiser in San Francisco yesterday, he went off on Trump comparing himself to Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny. Quote, \"He's comparing himself to Navalny and saying that because our country's becomes more communist country, he was persecuted just like Navalny was persecuted.\" Biden added that if he had said that, you'd all think I should be committed. Biden also went after hardline Republicans for stalled Ukraine aid. Now, the reason why you're seeing that in a quote and not hearing him say that is because he was talking in a behind closed doors, on the record, off camera, at a fundraiser. And CNN's Arlette Saenz is here. Arlette, you're going to give us some new reporting. And as you bring that to us about how aggressive he's being, I'm interested in hearing what you're hearing from your sources about the avenues and the venues that he's using places where there are no cameras.",
