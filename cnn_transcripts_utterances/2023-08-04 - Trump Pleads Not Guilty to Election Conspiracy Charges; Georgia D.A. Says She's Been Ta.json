The scheduling for the trial that was laid out a Thursday suggests that the presiding judge intends to stick to the Constitution's promise of a speedy trial.More now from CNN's Paula Reid in Washington. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) PAULA REID, CNN SENIOR LEGAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Former President Trump in federal court Thursday, pleading not guilty to those four felony counts that he is facing and, going forward, it appears that this could be a rocket docket. The judge who will oversee this case through a possible trial, giving just seven days it did tell her when they are going to be ready to take this case before a jury and how long that jury trial could take. Now, defense attorneys are supposed to give her the same information just a week later, so that she can possibly set a trial date at the next hearing, which is in August 28th. That is a pretty quick turnaround for these kinds of decisions, suggesting that the judge would like to move this along quickly. Now, it is unclear at this point if this case really will go to trial before the 2024 election, one of the big outstanding questions that could really impact a possible schedule is if the special counsel intends to add additional charges or additional codefendants. We know from our reporting that they will continue to interview witnesses over the next several days, suggesting that there could be additional charges, which could impact that timeline.

      "sentences": "All of these criminal cases involving Trump can be dizzying, so I want to updating you on the cases and what lies ahead.There are a total of four criminal cases that the former president has been investigated in, three of them where he has been formally charged and pleaded not guilty. The January 6th case that he was just arraigned in on Thursday, where he is charged with four counts including obstructing federal proceedings and conspiracy did for the government. Then there is the Mar-a-Lago documents case, where he faces 40 counts related to the allegedly illegal retention of documents as Florida state. There is the New York hush money case brought by the Manhattan D.A., where he faces 34 counts of falsifying business records related to hush money payments to Stormy Daniels and Karen McDougal. Those are the cases where Donald Trump is already been indicted. Then there is the Georgia case, where an indictment could come soon. That case focuses on Trump's alleged efforts to overturn the 2020 election results in that state of Georgia. Now let's look at what happens next on the calendar. In just about a week, August 10th, he will be arraigned on three additional charges brought in the Mar-a-Lago case, although he is not expected to attend that hearing. Also likely in August, it could be a decision on an indictment in the Georgia case. Now, as far as when the actual trials in these cases will begin and how they square with the election calendar for next year, well, two of the cases that he has been indicted in are scheduled to start in the middle of the primary season, Super Tuesday is on March 5th, 2024. And there are several other primaries during that month of March. And the first criminal case to began, the Manhattan D.A.'s hush money trial, is scheduled to start about three weeks after Super Tuesday on March 25th. In the Mar-a-Lago documents case, a pre-trial hearing is scheduled for May 14th. The trial itself could begin as early as May 20th, on the election calendar. There are several primaries in the month of May and the Republican properties nomination deadline is 11 days after the Mar-a-Lago trial is slated to begin. That deadline for the nomination is on May 31st, but that Mar-a-Lago trial, we need to point out, it could easily slide until later in the year. As for the case that he is just been indicted in, the January six case, the start date could be set during the next hearing in that case, which is on August 28th. Brian Todd, CNN, Washington.
