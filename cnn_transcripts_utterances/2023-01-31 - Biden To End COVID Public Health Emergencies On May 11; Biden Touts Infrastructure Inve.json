Here's Marjorie Taylor Greene tweeting, too late, Republicans already announced we're declaring COVID is over. The GOP is leading on this issue. Biden is trying to take the credit. There is no question. Again, you could fact check that and maybe massage it a little bit. But Democrats in touch with the White House saying, Mr. President, maybe we don't want to take this vote.",

I mean, Democrats did not like the idea of having to vote against repealing these public health emergencies or explain why without the White House coming forth and saying, this is going to happen eventually pretty soon. It's not totally clear why Republicans are so keen to end them because there aren't any mandates that come with these things.There are a lot of policies that do come with it, including funding for vaccines and testing. But anyway, it's clearly a symbolic message, as are the other moves that they're planning this week to lift the vaccine mandate on health care workers and also to change telework rules. This is getting at, this is Republicans trying to get at the deep discontent that still exists in this country about schools closing down and the federal response to the pandemic that they argue was a total overreach. But there are many Republicans also who are vaccine deniers. We're going to hear a lot of conspiracy theories, I'm guessing, on the floor today. And so they also need to get their message straight. So that's -- it's been a challenge for them to do that as well. But they're clearly again to try to push this.",

How will this affect you if you don't care to follow the politics of it all that much? Not all testing and treatments will be free anymore. Most people can still get vaccinated, most, at no cost. Most people hospitals whose financial support from the government.So there are some public health professionals who are a little queasy about this saying, yes, we're in way better shape than the last two COVID winters, but is it a little too early?",

If conditions change, they could change their intentions as well. But certainly the politics were that the President needed to get out. The administration needed to get out and say, no, we really do see an end in sight. I mean, the President months ago said the pandemic is over, and by that he meant the acute phase of the pandemic was over.But a lot of policies, as you say, rest on these declared emergencies. I mean, to be clear, there are declared federal emergencies about all kinds of things that the American public has no idea exist, and they just get renewed. And, you know, we get a notice sent that comes from the President and goes up to Congress. You get this notice and you're like, I didn't even know were in that emergency.",

It's not healthy in the country that COVID has been so caught up in politics that sometimes common sense get shoved aside. Sometimes just basic facts of numbers get cast aside. That's one of the points our CNN contributor Dr. Jonathan Reiner made in a tweet on Monday. He says, I know many people desperately want to declare COVID pandemic over and the infection officially an endemic like influenza. The problem is, two times as many people are still dying every day from COVID as die daily from influenza. So whether you call it an emergency or not, one of the problems with COVID politics is we can't agree on simple basic facts.",

And the President and the White House had this push during the fall trying to get more people to get their shots, to get updated booster shots, and that really fizzled out. And it seems like everyone is moving on, not only with the White House and the President sort of catching up to where the Republicans in the House are, but also on the Republican presidential side.You have this fight going on between Donald Trump and Ron DeSantis about, you know, COVID and who was more harsh and who was following the science. And something tells me that even after this public health emergency ends, we're still going to have COVID as part of our politics and our presidential politics both this year and 2024.",

Well, the former president also facing new and important scrutiny in two separate ongoing grand jury investigations. One is here in Washington, where two people who found classified documents at Trump's Florida storage facility testified under oath yesterday before a federal grand jury.The other grand jury is in Manhattan. \"The New York Times\" reporting a big escalation there with prosecutors now presenting evidence about hush money paid to the adult film actress Stormy Daniels. She, you might recall, threatened to go public with an alleged affair with Trump just weeks before Election Day back in 2016. And CNN reports that David Pecker, who's the ex-publisher of the National Enquirer, is expected to meet with those prosecutors this week. Our legal affairs analyst Carrie Cordero joins our panel. For people at home, it's investigation after investigation after investigation. You can get lost in the details that you have these two grand juries where the pace at least seems to be accelerating, tells you what? CARRIE CORDERO, CNN LEGAL &amp; NATIONAL SECURITY ANALYST: Really big difference between these cases. So on the D.C. case, this is a federal investigation related to the classified documents, and all of those events happened relatively recently. Where I'm more skeptical is with respect to the New York investigation, which is the local investigation where the facts at issue were many, many years ago. This is going back to the 2016 election. And so any witnesses that they bring in, you have to start thinking about, are their recollections old and faulty with respect to any documents that they might subpoena in that New York case, phone records, for example, phone companies are only required to keep that information sometimes five years, six years, seven years. So they're really coming at the end of whether some of that evidence that might be available in that New York case is even available anymore. So I just think it's a really long time later from the facts that are alleged to be pursuing that New York case.",

Is there an alternative who can get through a primary with Trump?And I think we're starting to see possibilities here. Obviously, you mentioned DeSantis earlier. There might be, but that's what it's going to take -- it's -- you have to have Trump exhaustion and somebody who's able to capitalize on that. And that's the piece we haven't yet seen.",
