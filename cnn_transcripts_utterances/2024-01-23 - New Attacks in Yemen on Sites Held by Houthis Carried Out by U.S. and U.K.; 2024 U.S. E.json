      "sentences": "There is a reason why Nikki Haley and her campaign have focused on New Hampshire. It is a very different demographic and socioeconomic profile than what we saw in Iowa. Here's the map right now, obviously, not much is filled in. Just one township, Dixville Notch, obviously every cycle at midnight, we see the votes there. Nikki Haley pulling all six of the votes in Dixville Notch. That is not indicative of what's about to happen, Wolf, but it is a good start to the day for Nikki Haley, as she said a number of times.But as the rest of these townships fill in, what you are going to need to watch is a couple things. One, why did the Haley campaign decide that this is where they needed to play? Well, not only did they decide, they spent a huge amount of money. Well, $29 million, almost double what Donald Trump and his aligned groups have spent because they knew Iowa, not necessarily made for Nikki Haley. New Hampshire, on the other hand, very much was. What do we mean by that? Look at the education in this state. Nearly 50 percent of individuals who live in New Hampshire are college graduates, that's about 11 percent higher than it was in Iowa. Also, the income threshold in this state is significantly higher, more than 50 percent make more than $125,000 a year. These are suburban voters. These are educated voters. These are the voters that Nikki Haley believes she can make inroads with. Here's the issues that they will run into. This is back in 2016. Donald Trump won 35 percent of the vote in the state. The person he beat, John Kasich -- well, if you will remember this, he basically took up residence in the state of New Hampshire over the course of the months leading up to the primary. He did win a number of townships. Those are the types of townships when you look over here at the pink where he was able to edge Donald Trump out in various places. These are the types of townships that are demographically aligned where Nikki Haley wants to be. This is Peterborough right here. Not a huge township. You see 274 votes to 269 votes, but this is higher income. This is higher education. So, Nikki Haley not only needs to hit on these counties that John Kasich won back in 2016, but she needs to expand out. And here's where the problem lies if you are the Haley campaign right now, if you go into places like Manchester. This is the biggest population center in the state. It's where a lot of our people are right now. It's where I was just yesterday. This is a place where Democrats in a general election usually win. Donald Trump dominated this township back in 2016. Here's what we're going to be watching for tonight. Flip down just a little bit, one township over into Bedford County. This is where Donald Trump actually won by 12 points, Wolf, back in 2016. If you look at the education makeup of this township, this is prime Nikki Haley demographics right here. 73.6 percent are college graduates. It's higher income as well. Watch Bedford. If Bedford moves heavily towards Nikki Haley, unlike what happened in 2016, that will be a sign that what they were looking for in the Haley campaign is starting to happen. The other thing to keep a very close eye on, Wolf, you'll remember this is now more and more turning into a democratic state. Joe Biden winning handily back in 2020. We're talking about Democrats voting, but where Democrats strongholds are, these types of areas down here where you see the blue. That's where Biden won. That's also where suburban voters are. That's where voters who are undeclared but might want to come out and vote for Nikki Haley. That's where they will -- where they will need to rack up big vote. And that's the final point that I want to make here. When you look at the voter registration, we've been talking about this now for several weeks since we came out of Iowa, and that is there are undeclared voters in this state, and that matters. That means that they are not Democrat or Republican. That means they can walk in with their ballots and decide which way they want to go. The Haley campaign needs this number, 343,000 to break in a huge way because Donald Trump's dominance in this number, the Republican number, is very clear. If that breaks major towards Nikki Haley, there's a possibility of a very real race. If it doesn't Donald Trump is walking away with the second victory.",

Nikki Haley picking up the pace a little bit over the weekend doing a lot of retail stops with the popular governor here, Chris Sununu.

      "sentences": "-- remember that? And it would be a record, and it probably will be a record, frankly, because it's going to be so low on the Democratic side. If you're an independent, you really want to play in this party unless you feel so threatened by Trump as the next president for another four years that you decide, OK, I'm going to send a message and write in Joe Biden's name or vote for another Democrat on that side of the ballot.We -- Emma's right. We've seen less energy than we usually see in presidential primaries in the past because of what I spoke of. But the voters have been coming out for months, and then -- and you have to give them a lot of credit for that. They really checked all these folks out, whether it was Ron DeSantis or Chris Christie or now Nikki Haley. I think the problem always for Nikki Haley has been, if you're running against a frontrunner and you're trying to attract independent voters against someone so popular with the base, you have to find an issue on which you can turn those voters out. John McCain did this in 2000. He talked about the deficit, when people were so upset about the deficit. And frankly, Pat Buchanan did this to President George H. Bush. Buchanan lost the primary, but he got 40 percent of the vote. He talked about jobs being sold to China. All these jobs going on. The economic nationalism messages. It really resonated there. Haley has been unable to create that. That issue that would get people pulling to her because she's such a contrast with Trump.",

We know from polling that we've done at the Globe that the majority of DeSantis supporters told us Donald Trump was their second choice over Nikki Haley, so the numbers would tell us that we, you know, should see them breaking that way.But I also -- I was at, actually, Nikki Haley's event on Sunday when the news broke of DeSantis exit, and folks there were really optimistic that DeSantis voters didn't want to vote for Trump. They wanted someone young, they wanted someone new, and so they're hopeful that some of those people will come their way.",

But they have to -- he has such an advantage among this Republican core base that she needs to win the dependence today, like two and a half to one against Trump in order to eke out a victory here, which would be a complete shock and be unprecedented, by the way, for somebody to get that kind of supermajority support among swing voters against a former president. That's a really high bar.What she also needs today is not a large turnout. She needs a seismic turnout. One that we're not even talking about right now. Secretary of State Scanlan says 320,000. She needs 350,000, 360,000. People who don't even usually vote every four years in a presidential race, in the primary, to get off the couch and say, the stakes are too high, the choices are between two. And what New Hampshire likes to do is not end the race, basically not allow the establishment to decide, OK, it's going to be Trump, or OK, it's going to be Clinton. We like to give people a choice, the rest of America. And Nikki Haley's hoping she gets enough of those votes tonight.",
