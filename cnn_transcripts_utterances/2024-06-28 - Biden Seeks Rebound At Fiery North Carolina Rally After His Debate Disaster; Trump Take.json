He wouldn't give a straight answer on it. And we know that because Donald Trump only accepts elections that he wins, as evidenced by 2020.But what is frustrating for me is that I do think that this is an inflection point for Democrats in the Biden campaign. Look, it wasn't just one bad night. I think that for the millions of Americans who tuned in, it confirmed their worst fears about Biden, that he wasn't up to the job to serve another four years. Look, I believe he's a good man and I believe that he has been a good president. I really do because he came at this time when we so desperately needed him. But right now, it's kind of looking like to me as someone who believes that democracy is on the line, as I know a lot of other Democrats also believe that Biden might need to pass the baton. And I think that there needs to be conversations within the Democratic Party about it, and the fact that all of these Democrats are falling in line and saying, oh, it's just one bad night, I mean, it rings a little hollow to me when they criticize Republicans for not condemning Donald Trump and his unfitness.

Donald Trump's mishandling of the pandemic, his shredding of our alliances and partnerships around the world, the ways in which he left behind a wreck of an economy and a nation deeply divided. All of that is what Joe Biden, our president, has worked tirelessly to address.Just last month, our economy created more jobs in one month than in the entire four years of Donald Trump's presidency. And no president has presided over an economy that created 15 million jobs, just Joe Biden. So, he knows what the risks are. And today, Wolf, the Supreme Court yet again issued a landmark decision overturning a 40-year-old precedent that's a reminder that the conservative majority on the Supreme Court that overturned Roe versus Wade two years ago is hard at work reshaping the law in a conservative direction. So, when Joe Biden thinks about his performance last night, he is taking seriously the risks, but the man you saw on the debate stage -- excuse me, the man you saw give a rally speech today is quite different from the man we saw on the debate stage last night. Everybody has a bad night every now and then. Every Major League player strikes out when they step up to bat, but he is a capable and competent president. That's what we saw in his speech on the beach at Normandy just last month. That's what we'll see this coming month at the NATO 75th summit.

DAVID CHALIAN, CNN POLITICAL DIRECTOR (voice over): It's no doubt a big deal. This is part of what is a moment for Joe Biden, Wolf, in his 52-year career in politics on the national stage that he has never experienced before, this kind of political pressure that is being applied now from editorial boards as prominent as The New York times, from the donor class, from party stalwarts inside the Democratic Party, elected officials. There is this growing course of political pressure, all of which we should note may amount to nothing because Joe Biden is likely to hold his own counsel here, rely on his wife or closest family members in any kind of introspection of this moment, but that isn't going to stop this pressure from mounting. And I know that some people may look at this and say, hey, this is just an editorial board of a newspaper, but this is an editorial board of a newspaper that Joe Biden pays attention to. And so it is not by accident that The New York Times is sort of delivering this and just doing it as their own opinion here from their editorial board. It is a clear letter, basically, to Joe Biden to call him to this moment and see, if according to them, he will reconsider his candidacy. Because as the editorial board puts it, Wolf, they believe that is the surest path to defeating Donald Trump, that Joe Biden being the nominee is no longer the Democratic Party's surest path to defeating Donald Trump, and, obviously, the liberal New York Times Editorial Board is opposed to Donald Trump's candidacy, Wolf.",

There's no evidence of that, that he's actually heeding this call from The New York Times or some others today. But because this is all happening before he is the officially selected nominee of the party, you are right to note the convention will gather iIn August in Chicago.I have a hard time seeing, if Joe Biden remains a candidate, how the convention sort of prize the nomination away from him. However, if over these next weeks, he does decide to leave this race, it will be those convention of delegates that will have the power to choose a nominee moving forward because the primary season, of course, is over. So, voters, Democratic primary voters will no longer be part of that process. Wolf?",

Strong words from The New York Times.CNN's Tom Foreman is joining us right now, taking a closer look, and whether that's even a possibility. Tom, what would it take to replace President Biden on the Democratic ticket? TOM FOREMAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, Wolf, primaries have been held, delegates committed. President Biden is the presumptive nominee for the Democratic Party. Make no mistake about that. Short of a true health crisis, about the only way he loses that slot is, as David Chalian noted, if he agrees to step aside. But even then, the process of replacing him would be full of uncertainty. Democrats could work it out at their convention in August, the way political parties used to. Various names would be put forward, and most likely, the more than 3,900 delegates from across the country would discuss, debate, and eventually decide on a new candidate. All of them right now, almost all of them, are currently pledged to Biden, by the way, and approved by his campaign. But what if they can't agree on a new choice, if it gets really nasty and grinds on? Well then maybe the additional roughly 700 or so super delegates, deep-seated party insiders and elected officials could be key to settling the matter. They normally cannot vote on the first ballot for president if it would change the nominee, but they could vote on subsequent ballots, that's when we'd hear an awful lot about them. But that raises another series of questions, if that scenario played out. Would voters who took part in primaries feel pushed aside and alienated from the party if a new nominee was chosen in this manner? Would a new choice be able to mount an effective campaign in the roughly ten weeks from the end of the convention until Election Day? And, for example, would Donald Trump agree to debate a fresh face at that late date? And who would be the choice? There would be several big names that could likely be considered, but not until the party decides how it feels about Vice President Kamala Harris. Plenty of Democratic voters and party leaders would see her as the natural heir to the nomination. And if she is not chosen, her disappointed supporters could also become a deep problem for the party in November. For now, Biden's advisers and other top Democrats are pushing back, as we've heard in the show already, they're pushing back on the whole idea of him dropping out. But that talk keeps elbowing in and even more now. Wolf?",

Two times that happened because the precautionary measures over concerns of heavy seas and one time because the pier itself was damaged because of heavy seas. And that leads to the question of how viable is the operation itself?The Pentagon points out that the pier has brought in 19 million pounds of aid the shores of Gaza. But as of right now, the aid that was still coming in before today is just piling up on the beach and that's because the U.N. World Food Programme isn't able to distribute it. And get it to the Palestinians and the people who needed because of concerns over the security situation. Wolf, that means it's unclear when and if the pier itself will begin operating again to do what it was supposed to do, get aid to the people who need it.",
