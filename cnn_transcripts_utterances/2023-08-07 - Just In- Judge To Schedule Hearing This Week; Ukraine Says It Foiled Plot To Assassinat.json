Of course, this is also coming, as we are learning more, about a foiled plot, in Ukraine, when it comes to Ukrainian president Zelenskyy. What we are hearing about this informant, who was apparently passing along key Intelligence, about the Ukrainian leader. Also tonight, we have one of the greatest athletes of all time, here to join us. Katie Ledecky has just swum her way, into the World Record books, once again, defeating Michael Phelps, taking out one of his titles that he once previously held. We'll talk to her live, in just a moment. I'm Kaitlan Collins. And this is THE SOURCE. As we noted, tonight, we are waiting to potentially hear, any moment, from the judge, overseeing the 2020 election interference case. As we wait, the Special Counsel's team has just responded, to Trump, and his attorneys, from a filing that they sent in, just about three hours ago, where they complained that his free speech rights could be limited, if there's a non-disclosure order, over evidence, in the case. They want the judge, to put measures, in place, so Trump can't publicly share some of that evidence. Jack Smith is now arguing that the former President's team is basically trying to try the case, in the press, saying, quote, \"The defendant seeks to use the discovery material to litigate this case in the media.\" Smith shared complaints, about the case that Trump's newest defense attorney, John Lauro, made in five different television interviews, yesterday. This all came right after Trump's post, on Friday night, where he wrote in all capital letters, \"IF YOU GO AFTER ME, I'M COMING AFTER YOU.\" Trump's attorneys are now arguing that was a reference to political adversaries, not legal ones. All of this is coming as CNN is also learning, tonight, that security, for Judge Chutkan, has increased, at the Federal Courthouse, in Washington, as Trump is stepping up his attacks on her, publicly insisting that she recuse herself, from his case. We've also learned exclusively that Trump's ally, Bernie Kerik, met with Special Counsel, and their investigators, today. He, of course, is the disgraced New York -- former New York City Police Commissioner. And his attorney says that they mainly focused on what Rudy Giuliani was doing, after the 2020 election. Of course, all of that means this investigation goes on. So, what does this mean for Trump's legal case, and how the judge here is planning to handle it, could say a lot, on how she rules. Perspective now, from retired California Superior Court Judge, LaDoris Hazzard Cordell. Judge, thank you so much, for joining me, tonight.",

It might be deemed to be irrelevant or too prejudicial.So, what Trump's people want is to take all of this information, no matter what it is, whether or not it is admissible, and put it all out there, for the world, to see. And the problem with that, of course, is that what that does is inflame the jury, it gets potential jurors, and it gets them to see information that perhaps they would not ever see, if they were selected of jurors to be in a trial. I presided over nearly 20 years, I was on the bench, over lots of criminal cases. Some of them got media attention.

They say, \"In a trial about First Amendment rights, the government seeks to restrict First Amendment rights.

What the Trump side has said, \"Well, we want kind of a compromise.\" No. Either, in my view, either, the protective order gets granted, or it does not, my view is she will grant it, because it's not an infringement, on anyone's First Amendment rights. COLLINS: When prosecutors were arguing, for this first, on Friday night, as we were talking about, on this show, then, they cited a post that Trump had, from Friday night, the one that we just read that was in all caps, pretty vague, but threatening, saying, mildly threatening, saying, \"IF YOU GO AFTER ME, I'M COMING AFTER YOU.\" I mean, how much does something like that, if you're a judge, making this decision, how much does that factor into her call here?",

It's clearly a threat.And a good trial judge doesn't just look at the law. You use commonsense. And anyone looking at commonsense, looking at what he has posted, and the timing of when he posted it, raises another issue. Whether or not this person and the team should be told, and this is true on both sides, just to say we're going to have a mutual gag order. And I would expect that may come next. And I'm afraid that what after that if indeed, the gag order is issued, which is not a First Amendment issue at all. It's basically saying, \"Don't talk about this outside of the courtroom.\" My guess is Trump would violate it in a heartbeat.

If you had somebody, who tried to steal an election, take over the Capitol, has three open indictments, 78 charges, was released, and then threatened the prosecutors and the judge? Any other defendant would be put in, he would be incarcerated. So, this defendant is already being treated leniently and differently than everybody else.

But the Ukrainian Security Service is saying tonight is that that informant was working to help plan, a Russian airstrike that would kill the Ukrainian leader, and identify the location of Ukrainian ammunition stores. Obviously, that's been a key part of this entire counteroffensive, and war overall. Investigators identified the informant as a former saleswoman, from the region. They say they caught her quote, \"Red-handed,\" attempting to pass Intelligence, on to the invaders. That is a quote, from the Ukrainian Security Service. This is the backdrop of course, as Ukraine's continuing counteroffensive, targeting Russian infrastructure. Authorities in Russia say that two bridges, linking Crimea to the Russian-occupied territory, in Ukraine's Kherson region were hit with explosions, on Sunday. Joining me now, for all of this, is retired U.S. Army Major Mike Lyons. I'm so glad to have you here. You're so good with the big picture of all this. But on this assassination plot itself, A, I don't think it'd surprise anyone that they're trying to kill Zelenskyy. But B, it's that they're making this public, the Ukrainians are. What do you read into that? MAJOR MIKE LYONS, U.S. ARMY (RET.): Well Kaitlan, I think this is a message that they're sending, to this network that likely exists, inside of Ukraine, of Russian spies, and telling them they're going to try to take this network down. This wasn't a plot. She didn't have the weapon in her hand or anything like that. She was gathering that information that you said, very important ammunition stores, as well, where he travels. But he's a target, no question about it. The Russians are pretty good at assassinations. And so, I think this is a signal that the SBU was sending, to the Russian spies, are saying, \"We're on top of this, and we're going to continue to work it.\"",
