I'm Jim Acosta in Washington.While most candidates for the Republican nomination are trading barbs with each other, former president Donald Trump is once again dredging up his lies about the 2020 election just six weeks before the Iowa caucuses. During an event in the Hawkeye State this afternoon, Trump accused President Biden of, quote, \"waging an all-out war on American democracy\", and his campaign handed out these signs, you can see it on the screen right there saying, \"Joe Biden attacks democracy\". This comes after the former president told supporters at another rally today that he hopes judges will let him prosecute the 2020 election and encouraged them to go into ballot tabulating facilities in 2024 to, quote, \"guard the votes. CNN's Kristen Holmes has been following the Trump campaign today. She's in Cedar Rapids, Iowa for us. Kristen, what's the latest?",

He said it's about social media, they're trying to restrict their speech. They're trying to control what kind of cars you drive with the reference to electric vehicles.But most of what he has been focused on, unsurprisingly, is the allegations against him, the multiple indictments that he has faced, and this argument that he has continued to make, Donald Trump, that this is election interference. Essentially saying that Biden is interfering with democracy because of the fact that he has been charged because of these subpoenas, indictments, arrests. That is the core of why he is saying that Joe Biden is having an assault on democracy. I also want to read to you one thing he said directly. He said that his campaign is a, quote, \"righteous crusade to liberate our Republic\". Again, clearly here, a forceful rebuttal to what President Biden has been arguing over and over again, that former President Trump himself is a threat to democracy as well as MAGA Republicans. We're going to keep listening here, he's obviously still going, he seems to be going a little bit off-track, but we'll have our ears open to hear what else it is that he says, messaging a clear pivot to the general election, as he is leading in most polls here in Iowa, just six weeks ahead of that caucus.",

A federal judge ruling the former president is not immune from criminal prosecution, just hours after a separate appeals court had a similar ruling on civil liability. Let's discuss with CNN's Katelyn Polantz and defense attorney and former federal prosecutor Shan Wu. And Judge Chutkan did not mince words in her ruling, guys. Writing, in part, \"Trump's four-year service as commander in chief did not bestow on him the divine right of kings to evade the criminal accountability that governs his fellow citizens. Katelyn, Judge Chutkan almost seems to relish a little bit, sort of getting up in Trump's grill on some of these issues it seems, if I could use nonlegal parlance.",

It's not what the people who wrote the Constitution wanted to allow for presidents. And that if former presidents didn't have the ability to be prosecuted for things that they did in office, then that would not be part of what the Constitution wants us to have as equal justice under law. She says it's essential to be able to bring cases like this to have justice work in this country. And so she denied these claims from Donald Trump, these arguments he was making. That this is a really big issue that has to get settled. And now we have the judge ruling on this and saying, let's go, we're going to move to trial.

But it's so fact-specific to this particular president, I mean yes, it will arise again the next time we have a former president running for re-election who's charged with 91 counts. So he obviously is trying to wield a lot of times the First Amendment as his defense here. It's all pretty much a red herring though because of course, common sense, non-lawyers would say, of course a former president can't have a permanent get-out-of-jail free card as she wrote. It makes perfect sense not to do that. But our legal system tries to be so fair that no matter how off the argument is, you have to wind through the system that way.

There have been up to 400, according to the Israeli military, strikes on separate targets inside the Gaza strip. And, of course, the impact that has on the hostages is something that many Israelis are profoundly concerned about.

And so, you know, at some point, there's going to have to be a meeting again of the various mediators on the various sides to try and hammer out some kind of deal. The sticking point, as far as the Israeli sources that I've been speaking to are concerned, is the ratio, or one of the sticking points -- the ratios of Palestinian prisoners released for every hostage. It's 3 to 1 at the moment. So, ten hostages released, 30 Palestinians released from Israeli jails. When it comes to the men, many of them, who are serving in the Israeli military who are held hostage, Hamas are going to want a much higher ratio. They're going to want more prisoners released than they get for the women and children. And so, that is just one of the obstacles facing the mediators in this current period.",

And too many Republicans were basically accomplices to his crimes by protecting him and keeping him in Congress. Let me point out to you, when I ran, George Santos had been running for Congress for four years. During those four years, the local Republicans never did opposition research or investigated him, though they nominated him. The person who ran before me against him, never did opposition research into him, either, but won that race. And when I ran, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee prepared an 87-page book and they nailed a lot of issues. They missed a lot of issues, too. And I've got through a lot of pints of Haagen-Dazs discussing that. But we took what we could prove and we focused on it in our campaign. Many of the issues -- many of the red flags we turned to the media on. And as many of your CNN contributors have pointed out, who work in the media, the press focuses on the marquee races. And oftentimes, because of a lack of resources, they don't have the ability to do the investigative work that's needed. That's a real problem.

In a gubernatorial year, when I ran, the turnout was 51 percent amongst Democrats and 64 percent amongst Republicans. So, the point I'm making is, when you analyze what we're facing in our Third District, this special election, you have to understand, it's going to be a very close race, a very tough race. This is not the old Third Congressional District that Steve Israel and Tom Swazzy (ph) represented. Due to redistricting, it's significantly more Republican. In fact, we had a Republican landslide in our state, that lost us five districts. In my district, the entire Democratic ticket lost to the Republicans. I proudly ran ahead by five points of most of them. But even Chuck Schumer, the most popular public official in New York State, lost our congressional district. That's how Republican the districts have become. We Democrats have to work very hard at reaching swing voters and bringing out our Democratic voters. And, quite frankly, we have the issues to run on to get that done. I feel like we're going to win, but it's going to be a tough fight.",
