      "sentences": "The unprecedented move to oust Kevin McCarthy as Speaker of the House has set up a leadership scramble. Behind the scenes his successors are trying to see if they can unite a badly divided House Republican Conference, one in which there are raw emotions, feelings bad will. Mostly directed towards Congressman Matt Gaetz, someone who led the charge to oust Speaker McCarthy and got the support of seven other Republicans, eight in total voting with Democrats to push McCarthy out of the speakership, something that has never been done before in American history.But now, where does the house go from here? It is unclear. The House is in the state of paralysis. It cannot move forward until a speaker is named, meaning no legislative action at all. The House is out of session until next week. In the meantime, behind the scenes, two candidates have emerged. Speake -- two speaker candidates, one of them the House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, along with the House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan. Both of whom are trying to secure enough support to become the conference's nominee to be elected speaker. Once they have a majority of votes next week we'll expect that vote to happen. Then there will be a vote on the House floor. But that is the tricky part. Getting 218 votes in the House, more than four Republicans could be enough to scuttle that entire effort. That is the problem that Kevin McCarthy ran into time and time again in the narrowly divided House. But no question about it. Many members pointing fingers at those eight Republicans for a state of chaos that they warned could come back to haunt them in November 2024. SEN. KEVIN CRAMER (R-ND): I think it makes the House Republican rebels look foolish. They look unserious. I think they look like they're more interested in fighting than governing. REP. MAX MILLER (R-OH): Mr. Gaetz is only doing this for himself and I believe that he should be looked at for an expulsion. I have not made- up my mind on if I would vote to expel him. This guy doesn't have his ducks in a row and that's what you see with people who lie, they can never keep their story straight. And that's what Matt is doing right now.
