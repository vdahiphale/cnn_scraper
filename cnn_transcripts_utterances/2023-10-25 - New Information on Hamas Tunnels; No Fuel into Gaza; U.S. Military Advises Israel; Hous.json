This could all unfold before our very eyes after a chaotic three weeks that saw Kevin McCarthy booted from the speaker's chair. Steve Scalise get the nomination but drop out before a full House vote. Jim Jordan get the nomination but lose several House votes. Yesterday, Tom Emmer, he got the nomination. He lasted four hours before he withdrew.It is Mike Johnson's turn. He may be the last man standing. So, how do things look for him. Overnight, in a ballot to see how Republicans would vote today. 22 Republicans voted absent, three voted present. If he loses four of these votes today, that would be enough to sink his efforts to be speaker. And we are getting new reporting on the status of these votes. And we will update you on that very shortly. And we'll explain just who Mike Johnson is. In the meantime, in Israel this morning we have new reporting on the U.S. intelligence on the Hamas tunnels. The vast spider web of tunnels throughout Gaza. CNN's chief national security analyst Jim Sciutto is standing by for us in Tel Aviv for the very latest. Jim, what have you learned?",

      "sentences": "John, there had been some question form the beginning, going back to October 7th, is how Hamas carried out this enormous assault on Israel, highly complicated, without enormous capabilities, without being detected by Israeli intelligence prior. Of course, Israeli intelligence, highly capable, focused on the activities of Hamas in Gaza. And this new reporting gets to some of that answer, noting that what Hamas did is build a, not just a network of tunnels under Gaza, but hard land lines, phone lines, that they used in there to communicate for some two years prior to this assault. Those land lines could not be intercepted by Israeli intelligence, surveillance signals intelligence, which is highly capable, and that appears to be one of the ways they managed to keep this quiet and attack with that surprise, that devastating surprise that we witnessed on October 7th.It's not unlike, John, what al Qaeda, what bin Laden was forced to do after 9/11, relying on couriers, for instance, not electronic communication, because that is something, not just Israel, of course, but U.S. - U.S. intelligence has enormous capabilities. And that's quite a discovery and it speaks to Hamas' preparations for this attack.",

Israel has said it will now block visas for U.N. officials, including the U.N. official responsible for humanitarian aid in Gaza. But it also speaks to a larger political pressure, and that is Israel losing Arab moderates, losing support from Arab moderates, but even from - from some in the west as it contemplates an escalation of the war in Gaza. Those fault lines, they're not entirely new. They've been here for years. But, notably, I think more severe in recent days with those words from the U.N. Security Council and also from Jordan.",

They are begging, they are pleading and this is for a regional director for the World Health Organization who said, we are on our knees. We need access, we need fuel now.Now, as you mentioned, there is, of course, that back and forth that the Israeli military says it will not allow fuel into the Gaza Strip. Its concern is that fuel would be stolen by Hamas. UNRWA, which is the main U.N. agency on the ground, and the one that is most appealing for fuel right now, that says if they don't get fuel by the end of the day essentially that they're going to be forced to shut down operations. They denied these accusations of looting in the past several days. And none of this, of course, bodes well for the 2 million people - more than 2 million people, half of them children, John, that are trapped in that enclave with no way out. And all of this happening, of course, as Israel intensifies its strikes on the Gaza Strip ahead of that potential ground incursion. Again, aid agencies are saying, look, if we don't get this fuel now, if we don't get this help now, this humanitarian crisis that has already been spiraling out of control could really push Gaza into darkness.",

We are going to be watching today at noon. That is when Mike Johnson is going to take this flight to the floor.There were three Republicans who voted present behind closed doors yesterday. That means they were not supporting Johnson. But I talked to one of them, Representative Mark Amodei, who said he had about a half an hour long conversation with Johnson last night after he voted present and that he did make a commitment to back Johnson on the floor today. Amodei argued that he just wanted to make sure because he has not run in the same circles with Representative Johnson in the past, that he was going to be supportive of some lands issues in Nevada that are important to him. Remember, all politics is local and a lot of these guys want to know that the speaker is going to have open communication on issues that are important to them. Amodei said that while there was no commitment made from Johnson, he is going to be backing him on the floor today. That leaves just two other members who voted present. There were a number of absences in the meeting last night, so we're going to be watching very closely for those on the floor. But, look, Republicans are tired. They're exhausted. They are ready to move on from this process. And they know that there is actual governing that has to happen because a spending deadline is coming up on November 17th, Kate. So, I think that there's certainly momentum behind Johnson. A lot can change in just a couple of hours. That's what we saw yesterday with Tom Emmer. So, we never want to say that this is a done deal until it is. But, obviously, headed to the floor, Mike Johnson has broad support from different factions of the Republican conference.

It seems like Republicans keep shanking one another. There's a little infighting. The reality is, both political parties are a coalition. They have sort of factions that make up the diverse political views of the country. Republicans have had a lot of time to kind of work through those. And I think it's not just about a person, it is about a plan. Part of the reason that, you know, a handful of people, unfortunately, vacated the chair and led to this kind of temporary chaos is because people lost confidence that there was really, truly a commitment to the appropriations process. Mike Johnson laid out his plans to get all of our appropriations bills done, not just a giant omnibus, and a commitment to be able to take things in their own measure. So, I think he was able to build a convincing message for the plan.
