And I think this is actually healthy for the Republican conference, that they have this fight. They should have had this fight years ago. It's part of the reason I left Congress, but those of us who are part of that governing wing, that pragmatic wing, who actually wanted to have a policy-based agenda and didn't like this populist, angry, grievance based, noisemaking wing that really didn't have a policy agenda, they really didn't want to do anything except yell and scream.Now we're having this fight. And again, I don't know how it resolving itself, but again, I do think that Democrats will need to come in and provide some help. They don't want to do this, and a lot of Republicans don't want them involved. I don't see a way out. Look how this year has progressed. We needed Democrats, Republican needed Democrats in the House to pass the budget debt ceiling agreement back around Memorial Day. They needed them in big numbers. They needed them to pass this most recent issue to fund the government. They need the Democrats to help them just bring up rules. So they are going to need their help to get a speaker. Unless there's some Republican candidate who can get 217 vote, I don't see the way out. Probably this McHenry issue of putting McHenry, empowering McHenry, is probably the most viable option at the moment. Unless they get white smoke out of the meeting on Monday, but I doubt it.

And you can see that from members. They are all saying it. They're saying it themselves.And so they know they have to get this resolved because there could be political consequences. Clearly, it's a presidential election year in 2024. A lot of things will affect that election. Donald Trump may be the candidate, Joe Biden, that will be the center. But this is not something Republicans are going to be able to run on. Democrats will be able to point and say, see, that's why you needed us. We at least can get our act together and do what needs to be done. And Republicans don't have a good answer right now, obviously.",
