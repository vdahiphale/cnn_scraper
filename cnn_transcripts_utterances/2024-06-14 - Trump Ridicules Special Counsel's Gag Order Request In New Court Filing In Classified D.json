And later, new details on the Princess of Wales' first public appearance since revealing her cancer diagnosis. It's going to be tomorrow and what it could say about the state of her treatment. Good evening, thanks for joining us. We begin tonight with the breaking news on a gag order the Jack Smith says is designed to prevent the former president from making statements that, quote, \"poses significant imminent and foreseeable danger to law enforcement agents participating in the investigation and prosecution of this case.\" A statement such as the former president's false claim that he narrowly escaped death during the search of Mar-a-Lago. His lawyers had until today to file their counter-argument and tonight they did. CNN's Evan Perez joins us now with more. So, what does the filing say, Evan?",

They're calling it an unconstitutional overreach by the by the Special Counsel and they say this is actually a ploy to help Joe Biden in the election. I'll read you some of what this filing said tonight.It says, \"Like Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, Jack Smith is seeking to restrict President Trump's campaign speech as the first presidential debate approaches at the end of the month.\" That's, of course, the debate that's going to be here on CNN later this month. They go on to say the following, they say that the motion is a naked effort to impose totalitarian censorship of core political speech, under threat of incarceration, in a clear attempt to silent presidents silence President Trump's arguments to the American people about the outrageous nature of this investigation and prosecution. And look, what the former president's lawyers are really homing in on, Anderson, is the part of the gag order request by the Special Counsel for this to be a condition of his release essentially putting it in the hands of the probation office and that really - what that would do essentially is it kind of takes it out of the hands of Judge Aileen Cannon who has ordered a series of hearings beginning next Friday. I'll be down there in Fort Pierce federal court where she'll have a number of hearings including one on this request by the Special Counsel for a gag order on the former president.

That's absolutely not true. The language is just standard language. It's actually an admonishment to FBI agents telling them what to not do when they execute a search warrant. It's in every search warrant operations order.The reason it creates risk is for exactly the reasons that the judge just mentioned. We know that Trump's most ardent followers listen very closely to everything he says so when he deliberately goes on Truth Social or in his campaign mailings says things that he knows are false and create the impression that the FBI is out to kill him. He - raises the significant risk that someone might act out against FBI agents or an FBI office anywhere. We know that's happened before.

So that part really doesn't hold much weight for me.But I will say that there are some things that I think the government could have done better here. They filed this motion requesting what is essentially kind of a - an emergency relief. But they didn't request Emergency kind of handling by the court. They didn't request an expedited briefing schedule. I think they just assumed the judge would go along with it. That was probably a false assumption. And to be quite frank, I think their application would have been stronger had they actually included an agent or affidavit from an FBI agent kind of bearing witness to these facts that they assert in the application.

And in fact weeks ago when I asked what the prep was going to look like, a senior advisor actually said we don't use that word, that word being preparation.Now, Donald Trump himself is actually having some versions of debate prep whether they call it that or not. They say things like him taking questions at the turning point event in Arizona as part of debate prep I will let you think about what those questions are and how those might compare to a debate since those are supportive voters that are in that room. But they view all of this as different ways to prepare him to be on the stage with President Joe Biden. Part of the reason that they don't do a traditional debate prep is because Donald Trump isn't known to sit through or have the patience for that. It's not going to be like what we've seen in past years or past cycles where someone sits in for the moderators in this case, Jake Tapper and Dana Bash, sits in for President Joe Biden. Instead, it is going to be these kind of snippets. One of them being this policy session which we know happened on Capitol Hill right after he met with congressional Republicans. They talked about a various number of topics. Marco Rubio was one of the people in the room, as we said senior advisors as well as Sen. Eric Schmitt of Missouri. Now on the topics they talked about one that was very critical, because they believe this is going to be inevitable questions in a debate was about democracy, about January 6, how to answer questions about the attack on the Capitol that day, how to answer questions about what Donald Trump has talked about sense which is pardoning the people who were involved in the attack on that day. Now, obviously, they didn't give us any insight into what those answers might be. But we should expect more of these kind of policy sessions, more of these interviews. They actually said the part of his debate prep would be contentious interviews so far. We haven't really seen that. He's had interviews with Sean Hannity and Dr. Phil, but all of this they say is wrapped into getting him ready to face off with President Joe Biden, Anderson.",

He specifically says things like it's about cognitive ability or it's about mental fitness.HE doesn't talk about age because if Donald Trump is to win in November, he will be the oldest person to be sworn in as president.

Jones has yet to pay Sandy Hook families any of the approximately $1.5 billion in court judgments that he owes them. Today, a Texas bankruptcy judge approved the liquidation of Jones's personal assets. The judge rejected a plan to liquidate his company saying it was in the best interest of creditors to let it keep operating and earning money. Our next guest knows the impact of Alex Jones cruelty and lies, Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut. So Senator, does the judge's ruling make sense to you, I mean, that Alex Jones' personal assets should be liquidated, but that families would be better off if his show basically continued. SEN. RICHARD BLUMENTHAL (D-CT): Anderson, the families have been through a really tough week, I will say. I've talked to a number of them because their children would have graduated this week from high school and a number of those young people who were classmates and the report that you did was absolutely gripping and heartbreaking and moving would have graduated with them. But this ruling makes sense in terms of Chapter 11 bankruptcy law in terms of the ultimate effect that Alex Jones can continue broadcasting his bottom feeding, gutter sniping conspiracy theory. Well, he has a right in the First Amendment to express himself.

I think when she's talking about not being out of the woods, I think it's probably two main things, which is that this chemotherapy. Is it actually doing what they hope it does? Is it really addressing these cancer cells? But the second thing is, you know, when you're taking chemo, you can have a lot of side effects. I mean, not as bad as they used to be 10 years ago. There's a -- we've gotten -- they've gotten much better, but still you can have significant fatigue, you can have significant impacts on the body. So, you know, mood issues as well. And these things can fluctuate not just day to day, but even hour to hour. So, it's a long road, still, is what I think she's saying by not out of the woods yet.
