And here's what else he said, \"The president appeared on Thursday night as a shadow of a great public servant. He struggled to explain what he would accomplish in a second term. He struggled to respond to Mr. Trump's provocations. He struggled to hold Mr. Trump accountable for his lies, his failures, and his chilling plans.

But if things don't turn around in the coming days, or if these calls get broader, more vocal, more prominent Democrats begin to call for him to resign, as he meets with those deep-pocketed donors this weekend in New York City, the same city where that New York Times editorial was posted, if those donors say, listen, I can't give my money away to someone who I think is not going to be able to win in November, that would be a problem. But what that looks like is the question because voters have gone to the polls. They've selected Biden as the nominee in the Democratic primary. So, to change that or to make it a delegate process down to several thousand people instead of tens of millions of people, that's just a big undertaking both the logistics of it, but the politics of it, the messaging component of it.

That's going to be a question. So, it does, does the new definition that the Supreme Court has of the substruction statute cover what Trump allegedly did?

So, it looks like the real devil will be in the details. What is the scope of immunity that the former presidents get? And even more important, what does a trial court have to do to figure that out?

It was not the answer that he and his supporters were hoping for.

He actually persevered, he got through the debate.And as you look at the sort of the start, it was slow, but towards the end of debate, he got better. He actually focused on the issues, and I think there's some wins that he came out of the campaign that the campaign will highlight. Now, put -- park it to the side and go to number two. Number two is that, look, debates don't win or lose presidential elections. I believe that Donald Trump lost every single debate against Hillary Clinton, but he went on to be the president of the United States. And I was so happy to see our former President Barack Obama admit, hey, I had a bad night against Mitt Romney in 2012. He was re-elected. And so, what the campaign's got to do now is to do exactly what they did hit in Raleigh, North Carolina. Two different tales of Joe Biden. I mean, the debate night was not that good.

But of course, we always have to point out the fact that right now, there's also a really volatile situation here in the Middle East with Iran and Israel having been very close to a full-on war just a couple of weeks ago, that could also have had massive repercussions for the United States as well. So, that's sort of the environment that this election was taking place and the two candidates that came in first in this first round of the elections really quite interesting, because the moderates had said beforehand, they believed that there needed to be high voter turnout for their candidate, Masoud Pezeshkian, to have a chance to make it to the runoff round. Well, the turnout was really low. It was 40 percent, which is eight percent less than the last president election -- presidential election, where Ebrahim Raisi was elected, who was killed in that chopper crash. So, really good showing for the moderates, and Masoud Pezeshkian has said he wants better relations with the United States, better relations, also with countries here in the region. Supreme leader of this country, he is been quite skeptical of that. And now, Saeed Jalili is the candidate on the conservative side who got the most votes there. Still, a million less than the moderate candidate. He wants to continue what he calls the path of Ebrahim Raisi, which be mean a really tough line towards Israel, and a really tough line also towards the United States as well. Of course, the Iranians have been threatening the U.S. not to get involved in any sort of issues between Iran and Israel. So, we're going to have to wait and see the thing that it really comes down to is which base is going to be able to mobilize more? That next election coming up this coming Friday, guys.",

DIEGO CARDENOSA, DISTINGUISHED POSTDOCTORAL SCHOLAR: Sharks are going through a global conservation crisis. The demand for their products, the demand for their fins or meat is their ultimate threat. Shark finning is a practice of cutting the fins off, which are used for the shark fin soup, and then, putting the carcass back in the water. If the shark is alive, it will suffocate to death because without its fans, it cannot swim. One of the biggest challenges for law enforcement around the world is that how can they tell whether a shark fin that is coming into their country is legal or illegal? Is from a species that is regulated or not regulated? And you need to do DNA tools or molecular tools in order to identify it. What we have developed is that we take a little piece of this fin, we run it through a machine for two hours, and we're able to tell what species is it without sequencing very cheaply, very quickly. Before we deploy the tool back in 2018, Hong Kong authorities were seizing around five tons of shark fins annually. Now, those numbers have increased to a hundred tons a year. The idea is that, in the long run, those efforts been translated in shark fishing nations to do more sustainable and well managed fisheries. If we don't do something quick to reverse these declines, they were going to see several sharks going extinct in our lifetimes. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Those are the two NASA astronauts that are part of the crew of Boeing's made-in test flight of its Starliner spacecraft, and they have been docked to the International Space Station since the beginning of June. But even though NASA says they are not stranded in space, those two astronauts are still going to be up there at the space station. far longer than expected. There have been several delays of this return to Earth. And now, just Friday afternoon, NASA says there is now no target date for when those astronauts and that spacecraft will return home. The holdup has been some issues with the spacecraft's thrusters, and also a few helium leaks. And so, now, NASA and Boeing are going to shift the testing and the troubleshooting of those thrusters from the actual spacecraft in space to some ground testing on some replica thrusters in White Sands, New Mexico. That is expected to start next week. So, and those tests are expected to take a couple of weeks to complete. So, Victor and Isabel, we are looking likely at mid to late July at the absolute earliest, before Butch and Sunni can return to Earth. NASA really stressing though, that those astronauts are safe. The spacecraft is safe. They have seen no new issues to report, but they really want to figure out what's going on with those thrusters.
