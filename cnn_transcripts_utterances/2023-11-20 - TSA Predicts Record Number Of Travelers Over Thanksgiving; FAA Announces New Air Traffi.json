How busy and how bad will traveling be this holiday season? Well, let's ask the Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg.Thank you so much for being here, sir. You said this morning that officials are anticipating that this holiday season will be one of the busiest on record. What are you anticipating when it comes to what people are going to be doing on the road and in the skies?",

And that means moving around and getting to where those loved ones are.We are expecting about 2.5 million passengers a day. We think the airline travel peak will be on Wednesday. And, of course, a lot of people on America's roads as well. As always our biggest focus is safety. We're asking drivers to allow extra time and be extra cautious because often you're going to a relative's house, maybe down the road, you don't know that well. And then on the aviation side, we're going to make sure that we build on the progress that's been made in the last year and a half. Now so far this year, we've already seen some record breaking volume in terms of some of those summer holidays. And so far the system has held up quite well cancelations this year actually below what they were before the pandemic. We're pressing the airlines and watching closely to see if they can keep that record up.",

On Friday, the FAA announced a new hiring pipeline to try to address that, but are there even enough people raising their hands to join in that effort?[12:35:07] BUTTIGIEG: So we do have a lot of people, thousands and thousands who apply to become air traffic controllers, but not everybody who applies actually gets the job, for very good reasons. It is a very, very rigorous process. Part of what our new FAA Administrator Michael Whitaker has done in very swift response to some of the findings that came back from an independent review is to find more ways to get more people qualified while maintaining that high standard. That includes partnerships with universities and other facilities that are in a position to contribute to and augment that training mission along with our excellent academy in Oklahoma City. And, of course, we're also looking for the budget, for the funding to do that additional hiring. One of many, many things that's riding on this process going on with Congress is making sure that we have the funding to hire the controllers that we need and to get them the modern equipment that they need to handle this volume. Because our expectation is that that record breaking demand that we're seeing for more and more passengers, more and more flights, it's only going to grow in the years to come.",

I would add to that airfares becoming much more reasonable lately. And unemployment that I don't think he's stayed this low for this long in my lifetime. But that doesn't mean you can go around saying, you know, everything's perfect, and we recognize that. Americans have had a rough few years, especially when you think about COVID and what that did to our society and effects that we are still working through. You think about some of the political polarization that's going on. We're not out there saying that all of the work is done. We're out there pointing to the good work that we're doing. And what we found is Americans, even when they feel that we've got a long way to go for things to be really the way we want them to this country agree with the steps that President Biden is leading in terms of how to deal with it. Lowering the cost delivering, lowering the cost of living that, is lowering the cost of prescription drugs, getting insulin down to 35 bucks for seniors.
