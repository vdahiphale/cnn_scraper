That's the request from Donald Trump two days before the historic CNN presidential debate. Trump has been making claims about President Biden needing to be, quote, \"jacked up\" for the big night, suggesting that his rival will be taking some kind of performance-enhancing drug. Again, with zero evidence making these claims. But here they are.

Welcome all. You know, another day on the 2024 campaign trail, another conversation about drug testing for a presidential debate. Isaac, kind of big picture here, what are we seeing from the Trump team and the Biden team, too, if you want to go there, on the preparations here? Because the Biden -- the people that surround Trump, excuse me, do seem to be kind of throwing everything at the wall. EDWARD-ISAAC DOVERE, CNN SENIOR CORRESPONDENT: Yes. It would suggest that they think that there are reasons to doubt how well Donald Trump will do on Thursday night. And this is something that we've seen before. It's every time that there is a moment where Donald Trump or the team around him thinks he's not going to do well, they throw things like this into the water.
