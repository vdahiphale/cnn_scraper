And then his deputy essentially on January 6, Kelly Meggs, getting 12 years.And Rhodes, you know, Rhodes is different than any of the rest. Rhodes is not only the leader, he was the reason that the Oath Keepers were in Washington D.C. on January 6. That was what the judge found today. And he also believes that Stewart Rhodes poses an ongoing threat to democracy. Rhodes made no attempt to try and dissuade the judge of believing that and the judge certainly did say that explicitly after Stewart Rhodes expressed no remorse in court today and continued to be very far right in what he said to the judge and not saying that he believed that he had done anything wrong at all. Now, the other thing with Kelly Meggs, that was the second defendant sentence today, Kelly Meggs was much more remorseful, and Judge Amit Mehta looked at him and reminded him how serious an offense this is, seditious conspiracy. And then spoke about how he found it so astonishing that American citizens who had been upstanding average Americans before January 6, then became criminals. And I want to read for you one of the last things that Judge Amit Mehta said after this marathon day of sentencing these two defendants in court, he said to Kelly Meggs, \"Violence is not the answer. We have a process, it's called an election. You don't take to the streets with rifles. You don't hope that the president invokes the insurrection act so you can start a war in the streets. You don't rush into the U.S. Capitol with the hope to stop the electoral vote count. We will slowly but surely descend into chaos if we do.\" So a reminder that democracy is something that does not involve violence as a way to express your opinion. Jake.",

And you know, I think it's important because even in his -- Stewart Rhodes wasn't contrite at all, claimed himself to be a political prisoner, he was scolded by the judge for that. The thing here, Jake, is that there is an entire kind of news ecosystem right now that is set up to convince these people that they are political prisoners, that they didn't do anything wrong. I mean, think about it, after January 6, there were a lot of people turning themselves into the FBI that were contrite, that were sad at what they did. And then you had this whole again, ecosystem that came around them comforting them and telling them they were political prisoners. I just ask anybody that thinks they're political prisoners, how would you feel if let's just take for an example, BLM or Antifa did exactly what was done on January 6? I would guess those folks would not consider them to be political prisoners. So it's a good start. There's, you know -- I think this still needs to go even higher in this case.",

And I would say to my colleague, Congressman McHenry, if he is so worried about a downgrade and he is so worried about what will happen if we don't default -- if we do default on the debt limit, then they need to give more concessions than raising the debt limit, which is exactly what the speaker said this week, that is not a concession, that is their duty.

You think of hats, t-shirts, mugs, stationery, that sort of stuff. A few of the products were the subject of a ton of misinformation and misleading claims on social media, and it led to hostile behavior from some customers.There were videos on social media of people stomping on merchandise, stepping on signs. And so Target made the decision to remove some of the items. And it said that it was doing that to protect employee safety and their sense of well-being.",

Science was there. But we've seen that the movement to eliminate trans voices and to target students and children and make rile people up against others identities or differences is very targeted. \"The Washington Post\" did a great analysis and investigation that the majority of the complaints against school boards or against books in particular, are driven by just a handful of people, so some of the outrage is manufactured.",

And it's now been -- it's taken out of the elementary section and it's in the, I guess, middle school section or something like that. So it's been banned for grade school kids. She is now apologizing because she had put things on her Facebook page about The Protocols of the Elders of Zion, this anti-Semitic canard that's been around for decades.

And the problem is when lots of people, when institutions are terrified of controversy, they invite controversy because they overreact to things. It sounds to me like Amanda Gorman's book shouldn't have been taken off the shelf.I also think that PEN America and the American Library Association are full of propaganda about the use of the word banned books, you know. Books are not routinely banned in America. If you're talking about taking a book off of a shelf, rightly or wrongly at a library, that is not like banned in Boston, that's like not available for kids through third grade. It's not the same thing as a ban. That said, there is this atmosphere out there. You know, look, I credit Target when they're saying that they were doing all things about keeping their employees safe. But obviously the experience of Bud Light, which you mentioned, is looming over a lot of this. Bud Light has lost massive sales.

The lawmakers, they picked up hoses and buckets and scrub brushes, and they cleaned the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Wall by hand, a solemn, relatively new tradition that serves as a reminder of what unites us instead of what divides.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) TAPPER (voice-over): Etched into these enormous pieces of black granite, which emerged from the National Mall like a wound, are the names of 58,318 servicemen and service women who lost their lives fighting in one of America's longest wars, the Vietnam War. In a town so often divided, today, members of Congress from both parties were united and came together to wash this wall by hand ahead of Memorial Day. Republican Congressman Mike Waltz from Florida is a Green Beret who did combat tours in Afghanistan, the Middle East, and Africa. He organized this bipartisan event several years ago with fellow lawmakers who have also served. REP. MIKE WALTZ (R-FL), WAR IN AFGHANISTAN VETERAN: It's a reminder to us the sacrifices that have been made for this country, and it's a reminder to us, as members of Congress, both sides of the aisle, the end of the day, we're all American. We're all veterans who were willing to die together just a few years ago. Then we can come together, roll up our sleeves, and move the country forward. TAPPER (voice-over): Retired Lieutenant General and Michigan Republican Congressman Jack Bergman is one of only three Vietnam veterans left serving in the House. REP. JACK BERGMAN (R-MI), VIETNAM WAR VETERAN: I normally come here alone. I never -- once I get here, I'm never alone because I know who I'm visiting. TAPPER (voice-over): A wall full of the names of friends and Americans who did not come home. REP. MIKE THOMPSON (D-CA), VIETNAM WAR VETERAN: I have friends whose names are on that wall, people, kids that I grew up with and people that I serve with. And from that perspective, it was powerful. REP. JIM BAIRD (R-IN), VIETNAM WAR VETERAN: The opportunity for he and I to be here is just, I think, very important, and it really pays tribute to what we're here for.
