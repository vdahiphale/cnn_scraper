Let's bring in Will Scharf. He's a Trump attorney, who was just in the courtroom, and also a Republican candidate for attorney general in Missouri. Will, good to see you.So, I want to get your take on the jury's request for rereading the instructions. We know the instructions are incredibly important to their deliberations and of course, the outcome of their case. You're in the room. What do you make of this part of the instructions being reread to the jury?",

      "sentences": "Well, a lot of what the jury just heard relates to evidentiary inferences that they're allowed to make. And then obviously, they also asked to hear David Pecker's testimony read-back to read the tea leaves a little bit. One possible reason for the specific requests they've made is that they may have already made a decision that they consider Michael Cohen to be deeply not credible. And if that's the case, I think this case appears to be on life support, and some of the jurors may be looking for a way out, a way to convict without relying on Michael Cohen's testimony.Overall, I think that's very favorable for our team. I think that's a very good sign. And most of all, I'm just enthusiastic about the fact that the jury seems to be taking its duties very seriously.",

One of the pieces -- one of the instructions that Judge Merchan read yesterday, I don't know if it was reread today, was the idea that Michael Cohen is considered an accomplice and therefore, his testimony alone is not sufficient. They need to have other backing for his testimony, whether it is the testimony of other individuals like David Pecker or physical evidence, such as the checks or the ledgers or whatever. How did you and the defense team -- and Mr. Trump, how did you all take that in, basically, the judge was saying you can't go by Michael Cohen's testimony alone. SCHARF",

Alvin Bragg's -- Alvin Bragg's team has essentially converted misdemeanor offenses into felony offenses -- alleged misdemeanor offenses, I should say, by claiming that the business records fraud was intended to cover up an underlying illegality.This is highly unusual in New York practice. It's a very novel use of this statute. And I think the jury instructions had to accommodate the fact that we're in somewhat unprecedented legal territory here in terms of the use of this particular statute.",

That was really the first time that there was any kind of evidence backing some of what Michael Cohen was saying. A lot of what he said was just based on his own experience.Now, the defense as you said, they tried to undermine it by saying that a lawyer shouldn't be recording his calls. But the other part of what the defense tried to do is talk about how that tape might have been edited. And what they tried to focus on was that it cut off while they were in the middle of this conversation. Now, Donald Trump himself has seized on that saying I was just about to say something really good, which is obviously, true Trump passion there. But the defense tried to say that they -- that Michael Cohen might have altered this tape in some way. The prosecution is saying that was absolutely not true. But this did become part of the defense's case because of this critical piece of audio.",

And they -- I mean, the prosecution even brought on someone who extracted the audio from Michael Cohen's phone to talk about -- he was cross-examined, that's where they were raising questions about the gap in that phone call. But it is interesting that the jury clearly wants to be able to listen to pieces of business there inside that room. And it really also shows just how meticulously they're going over the evidence very clearly. They're not just walking in there, kind of take a straw poll. They're clearly going through what they -- what they heard in the courtroom.",

These are not speakers. The judge even asked are you sure you want speakers? OK, you want headphones.Individually listening, potentially. Maybe not everyone, but several people may be listening to this piece of evidence, think of all the evidence that's been introduced over the past seven weeks. And this really could take a while. But it reminds people of how this process works. I mean, it's pretty remarkable if you think about all 12 people having to go through all of this evidence and then come to a consensus on 34 different counts. Again, I think the headphone request, more than anything else, suggests to me that this could take days.",

So, they kind of might act one way or another. So, none of that is indicative.

And I think he's -- you know, he's got this belief in himself, of course, about his own base, and so forth, still believing that he could likely win the election.But he's got great political instincts. And so, he knows if he comes out of this case as a convicted felon, that could spell doom for him in November because lots of independents are not going to want to put a convicted felon at the top of the U.S. government. So, that's sort of the things that are swirling around in his mind right now. Obviously, he's taking the Truth Social and trying to ventilate some of that stuff.

It's sort of part of that dance move sequence that he does, which looks ridiculous, but for whatever reason, the people that are in his follower group like it.But the accordion move is usually a sign of nervousness. And so, when you find Mr. Trump saying something that he really doesn't believe or he has to dial into a frame of mind to push himself to say something, he does the accordion move. And so, you can see that on full display yesterday with the accordion move. The circle move is when he's speaking more with certainty. So, it's fairly predictable with President Trump. You just have to watch his behavior. He can't hide the shame of what's going on, though. You can see it on his face. He can't really hide the shame. He knows what he did, and he knows what he's in trouble for. He probably thinks the case is ridiculous. And we can debate whether or not the case shouldn't be brought against -- brought against him or not, but it's here now and he knows what he did. And so now he's just waiting to figure out how bad it's going to be. The evidence is out there, Jake. And so, there are 12 jurors who will have to make that decision.

He does not want to do something that is cataclysmic to the overall process because this is a former American president.
