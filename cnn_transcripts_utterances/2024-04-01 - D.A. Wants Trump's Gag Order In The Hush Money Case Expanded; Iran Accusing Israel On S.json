The Manhattan District Attorney is asking the judge overseeing Donald Trump's hush money trial to expand the gag order on the former president to include relatives of people involved in the case. Concerns about Trump's inflammatory rhetoric escalating as he's been attacking the judge and the judge's daughter.Also breaking, an SUV rams into the gate of an FBI field office in Atlanta, attempting to gain entry. The suspect is now in custody as authorities are scrambling to try to determine a motive. And Iran is blaming Israel for a deadly airstrike on its consular building in Damascus, Syria, claiming two senior Iranian commanders are among those killed. Stand by for an update on the strike and the threat of retaliation. Welcome to our viewers here in the United States and around the world. I'm Wolf Blitzer. You're in \"The Situation Room.\" Let's get right to the breaking news in Donald Trump's hush money case in New York. The prosecutor requesting an expansion of Trump's gag order with the criminal trial set to begin two weeks from now. CNN's Kara Scannell is in New York. She has details for us.

And they want the judge to warn Trump that if he violates his gag order, he will get sanctioned.Now, the gag order that was put in place last week said that Trump couldn't make statements about potential witnesses, jurors, court staff members, prosecutors and the family members of court staff and prosecutors. It did not cover the judge and it did not cover District Attorney Alvin Bragg. Now, prosecutors are saying because Trump has made a number of statements beginning the very day after the gag order was put in place, focusing on the judge, calling him compromised, also highlighting the judge's daughter, who works for a political consulting firm, and taking aim at her by name by suggesting that she is biased against Trump. So, in their filing, prosecutors write, \"This court should immediately make clear that defendant is prohibited from making or directing others to make public statements about family members of the court, the district attorney and all other individuals mentioned in the order.\" They also got to one argument that Trump's team had made earlier where they were saying that Trump has a right to political speech and the prosecutors saying in their letter to the judge that what Trump is saying is not protected by political speech. They said it's viciously and falsely smearing the judge and his family. Wolf?",

Because, really, the judge had to give the parties time to brief up this issue. All we had up until today were letters from the two parties' attorneys, like the prosecutors and the defense attorneys just wrote letters to the court saying what they thought. Today, we got formal filings.

There are complicated issues about the First Amendment and political speech, so he will likely want to do a little research into them as well. But he did spend some time on this in the beginning.I mean, at the very start of this case, prosecutors wanted there to be some order or directive toward Trump about his speech. And the judge was very clear at the beginning he didn't want to impose a gag order in this case because he recognized Trump's right to free speech. Now the analysis here, since he did impose a gag order and now the people are asking to extend it, he will digest the law here about what it says about how expansive the gag order can be and whether it should protect the family members of some of these people. I mean, the other thing the judge has considered are the threats that the prosecutor's office had received after Trump made statements last year. I'm sure he'll be looking to see if there's been any uptick in that, you know, as well. He is the one being targeted. He will know what is coming in.

You can't just slap sanctions on an individual. You have to give them a chance to either retract it or explain why they made it or whatever else. New York law requires that.Now, once sanctions are imposed, there is a process whereby the former president could appeal the sanctions and that could go up again back to the judge or to the appeals court for a longer process there.

And so, they're pointing that out and what they argue would be part of their ability to defend against these charges. And as Trump has made claims about there being bias, he has already moved once to recuse the judge from this case for a small dollar donation he had made to Democrats several years ago. And he noted in this filing today that they may seek to seek to bring another motion for the judge to be recused. So, part of their argument here is that there is some bias.

And so those two things are vastly different.There's no question about the ethics of this judge. There's no question about any impropriety on the part of his daughter. And so, she should be off limits. My biggest problem with this, Wolf, and everyone watching this will say that there is a double standard for Donald Trump. I do criminal defense law in my day job. And I can tell you that if I had any -- and I believe Elliot would agree, if I had a singular client that went beyond the pale and did this, they would be hauled in, their bond would be revoked. They would not only be chastised, but they would be under the jail wearing orange and every day have to change into a suit when they come to trial. What we're seeing right now is fundamentally, in the words of my five- year-old kids, not fair. But this is what Donald Trump oftentimes gets. He gets unfair treatment.

Of course, she ought to be recused.I'd be the first person, frankly, as a former prosecutor to say that. But I think, you know, there's a lot of double standards in politics, but I just don't think this is the one. You know, to Bakari's broader point that, of course, Donald Trump's gotten away with a lot and he's a defendant in the criminal justice system. He's allowed to defend himself. He's allowed to push for his rights, but at a certain point.

Last year's final drew 10 million viewers, and that growth in interest in women's college basketball has continued UConn has a chance to go back to the Final Four. In fact, UConn could have two men's and women's and NC State already has two men's and women's in their final four. UConn has won 11 titles. They've got Paige Bueckers, she's a well-known player, Angel Reese and Flau'jae Johnson of LSU, well known. Caitlin Clark, Clark biggest star in all of women's college basketball. But there are other good players on the team Debbie Marshall, for example, in the most recent victory, hit four out of five, three pointers.The quality of the women's game has improved exponentially. This may sound like an odd aside, but some 40 years ago, I did Missouri's men's games on the radio on KMOX in St. Louis. And a lot of times, Wolf, I get to the arena in Columbia, Missouri. And the game would say start at 7 o'clock the men's game, and the women's game would be played at 4 o'clock. And there'd be like 200 people in the arena. And the quality of play was so low that you knew that any pickup team at a high school could easily run right through them. It has improved so much athletically and in terms of interest. And it just keeps on getting better. And LSU Iowa will rematch tonight, even though it's not in the Final Four. It's close. It's in the Elite Eight. And there was a little bit of you know, a little bit of tension between the two teams a year ago that works in the men's game and it's working now in the women's game.",
