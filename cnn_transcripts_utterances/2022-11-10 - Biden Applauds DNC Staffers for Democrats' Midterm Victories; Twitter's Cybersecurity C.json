You know, Boris, it was about a week ago that the president was there really trying to rally those DNC staffers who were deflated, and ahead of what they expected to be a red wave. President Biden taking a turn here and saying that he's celebrating voters and really knocking some of those polls because they defied expectations. And he's thanking voters especially young voters, women, who came out. Calling Tuesday, a good day for America, a good day for Democrats.And that good day really is all about the fact that people accepted the results of the people in this country, and that says something given what we saw in 2020. Let's go to Arlette Saenz who is with the president. He had pep in his step, Arlette. He said he's willing to work across the aisle, but there are some things that are off limits such as abortion, such as cuts to Medicare and Social Security.",

Saying not only was it a strong night for democracy, but also showed that democracy is in action. He noted how this is one of the first major elections since that January 6th insurrection and said that there were concerns over how democracy would fare. But he said that it met the test during this election.Now the president touted some of his Democratic agenda items while also saying that he's willing to work with Republicans. But he's certainly facing a steep hill ahead as Republicans have said they're against many of the president's proposals and also have vowed possibly (INAUDIBLE) to be against his administration.",

Sara Fischer is a CNN media analyst and we hope will make sense of all of this for us. Sara, please, every day since Elon Musk has taken over the company has been chaotic.

And that's why people who work in policy, people who work in things like information security, you noted that their chief information security officer had resigned, as of their chief compliance officer. Those types of people are sounding alarms saying you can't just focus on product and not worry about the safety and health of the community.I think what's next is that Elon Musk is going to have to start to figure out how does he get money into the company? And it's not just going to be a product fix. He has to listen to advertisers concerns. He has to listen to statements from, you know, lawmakers. The FTC called him out today. And so, to figure how can he get Twitter to a place he wants to get it to, without breaking everything in his path.",

There was like a fake Jesus Christ account on Twitter. There was a fake Donald Trump account on Twitter. How does he thread the needle of keeping the social media platform, you know, free and viable and simultaneously fixing it the way that he at least publicly says he intends to?",

      "sentences": "Yes, so the reason he's trying to get people to pay for verification is because he says that Twitter will only survive in an economic downturn if half its revenue comes from subscriptions and half comes from advertising. But the challenge that you just noted, is that if you allow anyone to pay to get verified, of course there's going to be a lot of spoof accounts, fake accounts, et cetera. And the ones that I'm most worried about are not the fake Jesus' and the fake Donald Trump's. It's people faking local law enforcement, first responders accounts. Those people -- those departments rely on Twitter in emergencies to get communications out to their constituencies. That's going to be a huge problem for Elon Musk.",

FISCHERwhat's called a consent decree. Meaning that they are going to do certain things to uphold privacy in the U.S. So, the Federal Trade Commission, as it made a statement today, will continue to put pressure on Twitter to adhere to rules around user privacy. What other lawmakers, it could be members of Congress, et cetera, if can haul Elon Musk in front of Congress, and they can ask him questions about what he plans to do with the business. They could hold hearings. But as far as anything else, I mean, our government pretty much stays out of business with the exception of passing laws. And so, Elon Musk pretty much does have free reign, unless he triggers so many people in lawmakers in the U.S. and Europe that they decide to start bringing him in for hearings and things like that, you know, in order to enforce rules more.",

This was a cooler than expected report. 7.7 percent year over year. I mean, this is not a good number but it is certainly a step in the right direction. And it really is set off an earthquake on Wall Street. 1,100 points, 3.6 gain for the Dow. The S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq, they're on track for their best day in over two years.Now I don't think that we should say that, you know, inflation is going away or is healthy by any stretch of the imagination. But I think investors clearly see this as a sign the Fed may be winning a battle in this war against inflation, and that would obviously be good news for all of us.",
