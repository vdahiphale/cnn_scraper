CNN's Rahel Solomon explains.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) RAHEL SOLOMON, CNN BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: The world's largest economy is still growing but slowing. The latest numbers show that the U.S. economy grew at an annualized rate of 1.1 percent in the first quarter of 2023. Now for context, economists were expecting a figure of twice that or at 2 percent. 1.1 percent is also lower than the previous two quarters. The report from the Bureau of Economic Analysis shows a still remarkable U.S. consumer, despite inflation and despite higher interest rates, continue to spend on both goods and services. Even durable goods. So, big items like appliances or electronics which tend to be a bit expensive, that came in stronger than what we have seen in years. We also see our increases in net exports and government spending at the federal state and local levels. But business spending, they have slowed. We saw a steep decline in private inventory, so this includes all types of inventories from wholesale, to retail, also wholesale manufacturing. And while this report suggests a slowing economy, it's how and where the economy is slowing that could give us a sense of what's ahead. Mark Zandi, the chief economist of Moody's Analytics telling me Thursday: Usually it's the consumer that pulls back, and the businesses respond. This go-around, the things feel a little uncomfortable, is if we go into a recession, it will probably be business pulling back and forcing consumers to follow. In other words, businesses pull back, stop hiring, laying off workers, and thus spark a recession. All eyes now on the federal reserve. It meets for its next policy meeting next week. Zandi tells me he expects another rate hike. But that at this point, they have enough evidence of a slowdown which could soon mean an end to the rate hiking cycle. Rahel Solomon, CNN, New York.
