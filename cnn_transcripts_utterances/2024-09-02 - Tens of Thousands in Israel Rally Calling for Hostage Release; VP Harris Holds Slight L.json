Tens of thousands of protesters filling the streets calling on Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to reach a ceasefire deal following the deaths of six hostages in Gaza.We have the first poll numbers following the Democratic National Convention, what they say and where the candidates will be in the days ahead. And China pushes back on criticism after yet another collision with a Philippine Coast Guard vessel in the South China Sea. Good to have you with us. It is 9:00 in the morning in Israel where Ben Gurion Airport near Tel Aviv has halted departures and arrivals of flights for at least another hour as part of a nationwide strike. It comes as anger and anguish build over the deaths of six hostages in Gaza. On Sunday, tens of thousands took to the streets in Tel Aviv and other cities, demanding Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reach a ceasefire and hostage deal with Hamas. One man who came out to protest explained why so many people feel frustrated and angry. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

On Sunday, Mr. Netanyahu said he was shocked by the cold-blooded murder of the six hostages and said, quote, \"those who murder hostages do not want a deal.\" The Israeli military says it recovered the bodies of the six hostages, including an Israeli- American from an underground tunnel in southern Gaza on Saturday. Israel's health ministry says they likely were killed by short-range shots between Thursday and Friday morning.In the coming hours, US President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris are set to meet with the U.S. negotiating team as the push to reach a deal takes on a new sense of urgency. Both Mr. Biden and the Vice President spoke with the parents of Hersh Goldberg-Polin, the Israeli-American who was among the hostages killed to express their condolences. And CNN's Nada Bashir is tracking development. She joined us now live from London. Good morning to you, Nada.

Yes, indeed, you know, for 11 months of abuse and starvation and torture, all of those six in the Hamas captivity made it. They were alive, they survived, they made it, they were strong, and yet they were murdered, and that's really scary, and that shows that there is no time. And that the decisions of the Israeli government are wrong and it's time to seal that deal. There was a deal since May, and we know for sure that those people could have been home, including my uncle.

And notably, this will also be the first time that the two of them will campaign together since Biden dropped out of the race.Now, where are they off to? Of course, they're going to the crucial battleground state of Pennsylvania. Specifically, they'll be heading to Pittsburgh, but we don't have a tremendous amount of details about what they'll be doing once they get down on the ground in Western Pennsylvania. However, President Biden himself has gone to Pittsburgh for a number of Labor days in the past. As recently as 2022, he actually went there to rally steelworkers. So you can expect we're going to see something similar to what he's done in the past. Now, the Harris campaign clearly sees value in having President Joe Biden on the ground in states like Pennsylvania because he's Scranton Joe and they hope to appeal to that white working class voter that is crucial when it comes to, again, a swing state like Pennsylvania. But we shall see what the president's campaign schedule actually looks like in the future. Biden said on Saturday he plans to be on the road from Monday on. Meanwhile, we've learned that on Tuesday, the Harris campaign will kick off a bus tour starting in Palm Beach, Florida, with a number of surrogates, celebrities and more all on that bus tour promoting reproductive rights. That's an issue that this campaign really wants to focus on. The bus is expected to make about 50 stops and will also try to grow the campaign's infrastructure, specifically by energizing volunteers along the way. All of this, between the Labor Day events and this buster coming up, shows how crucial these next two months are going to be as this most intense part of the campaign season really kicks off.

In fact, some of the language that we have been hearing from the E.U. describing this as unlawful, undermining international law, threatening peace and stability in the region, again, toward the Chinese Coast Guard. Similar condemnation also coming from the United States. It was just last week that U.S. National Security Advisor, Jake Sullivan, was here in China, part of a regular agreement to hold meetings between the two nations. He held a question and answer session with reporters after, and I talked to him about this ongoing tension. He said, first of all, there is a need to de-escalate things, not so much a surprise. Take a listen, though, to what else he had to say from his stop here in Beijing.

Some of the children on the ground there were also wounded in that attack.And this comes after several days that the Kharkiv area and the city of Kharkiv have been targeted by the Russians. On Friday, seven people were killed in a massive attack by aerial glide bombs and on Saturday another aerial glide bomb hit a village in the Kharkiv area killing two people there and the Ukrainians say that the Russians used what's called a FAB-500 bomb that has half a ton of explosives inside it and obviously causes considerable damage. The Ukrainians however appear to be fighting back. The Russians are saying that there was a massive drone attack on Sunday by the Ukrainians against Russian territory. The Russians say that they shot down almost 160 drones in 15 regions across Russia. However, there appear to have been hits namely an oil refinery in the Moscow area and then also an energy facility in Tver that is very far away from the Russian border.

I've really done a good job of turning those into positives. You know, you look at a day like today, I bogey seven and eight, eight with a silly mistake with the shank and bogey  and drive a hole and all of a sudden, the tournaments lot closer now and then I bounce back really nicely there with three birdies on 9, 10, 11 to kind of extend the lead again.So really just overall, just proud of the year, proud of the fight that we put on this a year and they are ready to go.",
