She said, as Kaitlan read, \"And I know it may feel like you're on trial here after cross examination, but are you actually on trial?\" Michael Cohen says, \"No, ma'am.\"\"Is the situation here different from the situation you were in in 2018?\" That refers to the tax charges that Michael Cohen pleaded guilty to back in 2018. \"Yes,\" Cohen says. Cohen says my life was on the line, my liberty. And here I'm just a non-party subpoenaed witness. Hoffinger asks if Cohen had a retainer agreement when he worked for the Trump organization. \"You're an employee, it's not necessary,\" Cohen said. Did $420,000, the payment made, this is the issue at the case, did Donald Trump falsify business records to pay Stormy Daniels, or to pay back Michael Cohen for paying off Stormy Daniels for the hush money payment? Did $420,000 have anything to do with legal services? In 2017, Hoffinger asks. \"No,\" Cohen says. Cohen again confirms he never put together a retainer agreement for Trump when he left the Trump organization and became Trump's personal attorney. This is 2017, quote, \"Because I never expected to get paid.\" That was the point there. This is all a repayment according to Cohen. When you submitted each of your 11 invoices to the Trump organization stating each was for services rendered pursuant to a retainer, that's $420,000 divided by 12, $35,000 a month. Was that true or false? Hoffinger asks. \"False,\" Cohen says. Cohen again says he never retained Costello and never paid him any money. So right now, Laura Coates, what they're doing here is underlying, stop listing to all this other stuff. Michael Cohen's not on trial. The question is, were these business records falsified?

The question before the jury is not going to be, do you believe them that 420,000 was paid to Michael Cohen as a reimbursement for trying to give a hush money payment and try to avoid transparency in campaign finance?It's 34 separate counts. And the 34 separate counts late to the accumulation of $420,000 that had been divided by 12. Now that's important here because Todd Blanche tried to make a lot of different inroads and suggest that there was padding, that there was falsified invoices from Cohen to Trump that represented him getting, you know, him being hustled. But the jury has to now figure out of those 34 accounts, of the invoices, of the checks of the entries in the ledger, well, which ones represent the actual payments made to Stormy Daniels as part of the hush money and which were the padding for Michael Cohen. They have to focus it on the idea of money was paid but now this added element of the hustle of what was stolen adds a different layer for this jury and can they unpack it in a way through instruction or otherwise, that's going to be a challenge.",
