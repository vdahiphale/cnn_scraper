It is Friday, October the 27th, 9Police are looking for this man, 40-year-old Robert Card. He's considered armed and dangerous. He's charged with multiple counts of murder. Officials are telling residents in the areas around Lewiston, Maine, to stay vigilant, remain inside and lock their doors as they search for Card. Tensions rose last evening when, for a time, it appeared the manhunt may have been ending, but it didn't. CNN's Brian Todd was on the scene as police surrounded. The suspects home.

Then they moved a spotlight onto the house. At that point, they began kind of a one way dialogue and we were told later on that it was unknown if the suspect was in the house or not. But they began a one-way dialogue. A law enforcement officer on a loudspeaker was saying things like come out with your hands up. We don't want anyone else to get hurt. Please come out and follow our instructions. Walk to the front of the truck. Indicating there was some kind of a truck in the driveway. And he even spoke on a personal level, saying, we know this could be intimidating to you. We really just don't want anyone to get hurt. So please come out and talk to us. That was a one-way dialogue. There was no indication that there was anyone on the other end conversing with them. But they did move around a lot. They positioned their -- again their drones, their spotlights all around the house, seemingly looking for something. So kind of a dramatic night out here and what they got out of it, we don't know.

SUSAN COLLINS (R-ME): Maine, I would point out, has one of the highest rates of gun ownership in the country and has a long heritage of responsible gun ownership. It also had a very low rate of violence. What makes this crime so heinous is in a typical year Maine might have 22 murders. And last night we almost approached the number for the entire year.

This was the fourth raid that we know of into Gaza since the beginning of this war.The Israeli military has published images, video about the raid, showing tanks and armored vehicles moving on a road near agricultural land. And those images also show strikes on buildings and open areas. In a statement, the IDF said that this particular raid was meant to target Hamas infrastructure, including anti-tank missile launch sites, military command and control centers, as well as Hamas militants. In a televised news conference Thursday, an IDF spokesman said the Israel Defense Forces will continue ground raids into Gaza in the coming days to prepare for the next stage is in Israel's war and against Hamas. The spokesman said the purpose of the Israel's ground operations is to kill Hamas militants, lay the foundations for an all-out invasion and neutralize explosive devices and reconnaissance posts. And let me tell you, Max, we were in Ashkelon yesterday and we saw how Hamas continues to fire missiles into Israel. There were also several missiles here in Tel Aviv that were intercepted by Israel's Iron Dome last night. As you know, the air defense system here -- Max.",

But is there any suggestion that the Israelis will consider a pause at this time? ROMOthe international community continues to urge restraint. And during a meeting in Brussels Thursday, European Union leaders called for a pause in the Israel Hamas conflict to allow humanitarian aid to reach Gaza. They would like to open humanitarian corridors, they say, and what they called a continued rapid, safe and unhindered humanitarian access to Gaza. It was interesting, though, that they stopped short of calling for a ceasefire, something that was previously ruled out by several European leaders. The Palestine Red Crescent Society said 12 aid trucks entered Gaza through the Rafah border crossing with Egypt on Thursday, carrying water, food, medicine and medical supplies. But no fuel, Max. That's very important. And the amount of aid has been previously described by UN officials as not a drop in the bucket, but a drop in the ocean. Considering that before the war, Max, about 100 trucks per day crossed into Gaza to deliver humanitarian aid. Back to you.",

GEN, MICK RYAN, AUSTRALIAN ARMY (RET.): No, I don't think so. And they would be keen to press on with the air attacks as well as these militant raids into Gaza.
