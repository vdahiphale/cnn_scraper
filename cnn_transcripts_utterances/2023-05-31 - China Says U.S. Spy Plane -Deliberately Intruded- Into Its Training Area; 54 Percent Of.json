This was an extremely heated meeting. And as you said, dozens of parents and students and people from the community packed into the Hernando County School Board meeting on Tuesday night. They came to speak out in support for both the teacher, Jenna Barbee, who is under investigation by the Florida Department of Education for showing that Disney movie called A Strange World to her fifth graders, which had an LGBTQ Plus character in the main role and also for Shannon Rodriguez, the mother, and the school board member who reported Barbee for doing so. During the public comments section, we heard from several students. One who said that parents are -- excuse me, teachers are afraid that they're tiptoeing around their words for fear of losing their job. There was plenty of blame and some indirect criticism at the Parental Rights and Education Act also known as the Don't Say Gay law that was put in place by Governor Ron DeSantis, which basically bans in any instruction on gender identity or sexual orientation for classrooms K through three. But as we said, there was also support from parents for Shannon Rodriguez who insisted during this meeting that schools need to be kept traditional.

I want to show it to you now where it was taken by one plane and they saw against the night sky those three little dots there.Look at them. They're moving in concert. The airplane that spotted them said we don't know what that is. They tried to chase it down. They could not chase it down. And this was rolled out today. And now spoiler alert, the NASA scientists study this. And eventually, they said when you put all the evidence together, what this was, was three commercial aircraft in a typical flight corridor. The reason it couldn't chase them down is because they're much further away than they thought. And they were simply lit up that way. The movement that you see there, that's the plane taking the pictures over that distance. That's why it looks like they're moving back and forth. So, their point is to say, there's a lot of stuff out there, which actually can be explained if you can get enough information. They did say there are some typical reported characteristics of UAPs when you look at all of these out there. And this was sort of interesting. And this is the report. It is what people say they saw. They typically say they are round and small. They tend to be white, silver, or translucent. They tend to be somewhere between 10 and 30,000 feet in the air, either stationary or up to Mach two or twice the speed of sound, and no thermal exhaust. But here's the problem with all of that, John. The problem with that is that is largely anecdotal. That's just people saying that's what they saw, or it's being measured with all sorts of crazy different instruments out there. And here's what's important. There are a lot of these reports. Listen to what was said at this conference about the sheer volume of these reports that are coming in. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
