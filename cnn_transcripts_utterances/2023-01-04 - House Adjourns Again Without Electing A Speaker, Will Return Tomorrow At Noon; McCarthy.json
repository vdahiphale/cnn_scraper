And it's been 100 years since this has actually even happened. Let alone on the first round or the second or now maybe going into a seventh or more round. It's beginning to feel like it will be 100 more before you finally get all of this done.Kevin McCarthy is really fighting for his political life and for the job that he has been very, very clear that he's wanted all along. But it just shows you how hard, really, it's going to be for anyone to do this job, let alone Kevin McCarthy, who is fighting to actually get even these votes. Not a very attractive proposition for so many people. How hard it's going to be to get anything really done with even the slim majority over the Democrats and then a slim grasp on your own caucus. And let's remember it actually matters to America. It is not just a matter of watching what it is like to see how the sausage is made and political muscle flexing. I mean, Congress does have real work to do, work that can't actually get done or even started until they elect a speaker and actually swear in the members. I want to bring in CNN's Manu Raju on Capitol Hill tonight. Manu, I mean, Kevin McCarthy still does not have the votes. It's been Groundhog Day all over again for him but hoping I guess again tomorrow is a day to fight once again. Does he have the real progress he spoke of?",

Because, Manu, originally, they had wanted -- the so-called rebels wanted one, assuming they wanted to negotiate in good faith. He had offered five.

That is the expectation at the moment because that has been a red line for a number of these members. None of the members have come out and said that they are happy at the direction this is moving. And it sounds like that's essentially what they're going to get.Remember McCarthy where he started. He said he wanted half the Republican conference to call for that vote to oust a sitting speaker. That has now -- then it came down to five members, allowing five members to call for that vote. Now, it sounds like he's probably going to give them one member to call for that vote. And why is that significant? Remember what happened to John Boehner when the rule was just one member would call for the vote, we didn't want to go through with the vote that could have toppled a sitting speaker, so he resigned. He stepped aside from the speakership. And that threat to oust a speaker has been sitting -- has been wielded over the last several years so much so that it was Nancy Pelosi who raised the threshold to half their members to call for such a vote. But this hard line group of conservatives want to lower that threshold to empower themselves over the speaker ship, but that has caused with just a lot of concern within the ranks that perhaps this will just lead to such an unwieldy situation where at any moment the sitting speaker could be ousted.",

Whether the way the Senate is apportioned, the Electoral College, the filibuster, gerrymandering, whether all of that is fair, the idea that you could lose the popular vote and still be the president.But what is happening here, what is playing out here is the opposite. It is the core minority of the Republican Party saying, we want more power. We want the ability to yield more power and to take five people and give them the equivalency of like 100 people.

I think we have assumed that because it has existed for 250 years it will just simply continue to exist. We know the threats. We know that it has failed in other countries, and I'm afraid it's going to fail here. Second, tonight before I did this interview, I was a -- this woman comes up to me with a bright light, shining it in my face, asking me damning questions as I'm trying to hold a conversation about a memorial service I'm going to host in my house in California. And I said to her, please, someone just died. And she doesn't care. She's yelling at me about politics. We've lost our sense of decency, our sense of civility, our sense of respect to human beings. And, third, and this is my message to not just the Republicans in the House but to all members of Congress. We used to celebrate team work, whether it's in sports, were amused to working together side by side to get the job done. Now, they seem to celebrate individuality where it's my right to do what I want and I don't give a damn what you want. I look at these three threats to democracy and to our way of life as Americans.

He was resuscitated on the field before being rushed to the University of Cincinnati Medical Center. Now, his family is clarifying today that Hamlin was resuscitated only that one time on the field. And President Biden is saying today that he spoke at length with Damar's parents. Joining me now is CNN contributor Bob Costas. Bob, good to see you and good to know that there is some improvement although, he does remain in critical condition. There has been some back and forth as to what that condition is, but I wonder what you make of the way this is being handled by the league and the way that the improvement has been relayed.",

So, I have no criticism at the fact that it took a while to have a final decision that they would not play the game. And it seems to me obvious now, since this coming weekend is the final weekend of the regular season, they might have had a chance to make up this game earlier in the season when teams have bye weeks, but they are not going to replay this game under any circumstances. The Bengals and Bills will play 16 games. The others will play 17 and they will seed the playoffs based on winning percentage rather than total victories.
