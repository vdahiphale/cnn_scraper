Now the good news is this typhoon appears to be weakening. That's what CNN weather has been telling me. But nonetheless, attention is certainly heightened because of all of this.Because of some of the damage we've seen in Taiwan, but also in the Philippines. And I want to start in Manila and show you some of the images that we have seen rescue after rescue. We have seen boats in the water. We've seen vehicles submerged. Not only adults being rescued, but children who have been wrapped up in blankets with their parents and family members watching. In fact, we have some new reporting that indicates north of Manila and area that was hit by the floods. There were 55,000 people evacuated. That includes nearly 16,000 family. So, the impact in the Philippines is quite tremendous. Businesses have closed, schools have been cancelled. More than 150 flights were also canceled so far today with many homes just submerged under the water, making it very difficult for anyone to get around. So, the Philippines dealing with some very treacherous conditions. I should also point out that the Philippines itself was not hit by the typhoon. It's just the bands, the bands of rain -- of the water of the wind, all sweeping the Philippines. Not necessarily landfall by the typhoon itself. But that just shows how powerful of a storm this has been. And then now let's go to Taiwan, which is certainly a very typhoon prone area. Among the images that really struck me were just the gusts of wind that we have seen people struggling to stand up over the past few hours. What's interesting about the Philippines and you alluded to this, Rosemary, is the fact that the mountainous terrain almost has served as a barrier for the movement of that typhoon. And while it did prevent it from moving further inland, it did concentrate some of this rain and wind and areas that previously thought wasn't going to be the effect wouldn't be so hard. But as we've seen, it has -- it has caused a lot of hardship in parts of Taiwan. As far as here in China, again, the hope is that the storm will weaken. But as we have seen in recent months, the financial impact and the human impact has been tremendous. A price tag of impact so far this year of more than $10 billion. And of course, Rosemary tens of millions of people have felt the impact of flooding here in China. The hope is that it will not get worse.",
