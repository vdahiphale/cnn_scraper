This is James Comer, the chairman of the House Accountability -- Oversight and Accountability Committee. The Committee requests documents and information related to the foreign influence at UPenn. Joe Biden had an office at UPenn during the Trump years in the Penn Biden center. It is imperative to understand whether any Biden family members or associates gained access to the classified documents while stored at the Penn Biden Center.Again, legitimate questions, how the documents get there? Who had access to them in the like? And the House Republicans work in the foreign influence part, the innuendo, with the fact requests. LEIGH ANN CALDWELL, EARLY 2022 CO-AUTHOR, THE WASHINGTON POST: Yes, the innuendo is also Hunter Biden. It's a theme with that within the Biden administration is foreign influence. Now, one thing of course, the Oversight Committee was just formed yesterday. But one thing I'm also going to be looking for, are they just going to keep sending letters and make noise? Are they actually going to hold hearings about this? And what are those hearings going to look like? Because Republicans privately admit to me that their goal is in large part to muddy the water to take down the temperature on the Trump document saga. And that might be a success in their eyes, if voters can no longer understand the difference, even though there are major differences between the two cases.",

A mysterious laptop, now in the hands of the FBI, and long- held conspiracy theories about President Joe Biden and what he does or doesn't know. J. BIDEN: I have never discussed with my son or my brother or anyone else anything having to do with their businesses, period. BROWN (voice-over): Despite his denials, a CNN review of the laptop data, as well as other public material, shows that Joe Biden did, in Iraq, with some of his son's associates while serving as vice president, though it's unclear exactly what was discussed. One example the Republicans cite, Miguel Aleman Magnani, a Mexican businessman and son of the former president who Hunter was trying to woo. In 2014, Aleman Magnani and his dad were photographed at the White House with then-Vice President Biden. In a later e-mail, Hunter Biden reminds Aleman Magnani of the favors he's done for him. \"We have been talking about business deals and partnerships for seven years. I have brought every single person you have ever asked me to bring to the f-ing White House, and the vice president's house, and the inauguration.\" Hunter Biden bluntly acknowledged the power of the Biden name in a memoir, writing that the Ukrainian energy company Burisma, which put him on its board, \"considered my last name gold.\"",

What influence can he bring to bear on House Republicans and also keep in mind 2011, when we downgraded our credit didn't default, but there was a downgrade in the credit, much larger margin of House Republicans.

And as we reported last week, the Meta, the parent group, was already having meetings deliberating whether or not they were going to let former President Trump back on its site.In fact, they were taking it so seriously, they had a small working group within the company that was working on that. But now it appears that the campaign is trying to accelerate that process. They sent a letter to Meta asking for Trump to be reinstated and to have a meeting with that parent company. Now, I want to read you one expert -- excerpt of why they say they think that they should be reinstated. Says, Donald J. Trump is a declared candidate for President of the United States. We believe the ban on President Trump's account on Facebook has dramatically distorted and inhibited the public discourse. Moreover, every day that President Trump's political voice remains silenced furthers an inappropriate interference in the American political and election process. Now, it is not surprising that he would put in the letter this is about free speech. We know that one of his major platforms for his 2024 campaign will be about free speech, but there is something that he didn't put in this letter. And that is about fundraising and raising money. Something that we know that if you are running for president, you need quite a bit of and as we have reported, Trump and his campaign have struggled because of not being on Facebook, they haven't been able to find other donors and it has hurt their fundraising. So that in itself is also another reason why this might be incredibly important to a presidential campaign and to a presidential candidate. John?",
