And, of course, it's not either of their first trips to the border. Here in recent weeks, Trump has ramped up his often-ugly immigration rhetoric. And, last night, he promised to round up and deport unprecedented numbers of immigrants if elected. As for Biden, he's seeking to go on offense and weighing some new executive actions after Republicans in Congress blocked a bipartisan bill to address the crisis. Kristen Holmes is an Eagle Pass awaiting Trump's arrival. Priscilla Alvarez is in Brownsville ahead of the president. Priscilla, to you first. This marks a shift in the White House approach.

It's an extraordinary move for a White House that has distanced itself from border security, and one that sources tell me when it came up within the walls of the White House would ultimately be some intense conversations about the issues at the U.S.-Mexico border.But the White House and campaign officials see this as an opportunity now, especially after the failed Senate border bill. That was a bill that included some of the toughest border security measures in recent memories. And while Republicans worked on it, they ended up backing away from it at the encouragement of former President Donald Trump. So, President Biden is coming here today to hammer Republicans on that point and make the argument that it is the Republicans who carry the responsibility for not securing the border because they walked away from a deal that would have offered solutions. And that is what campaign officials and White House officials are banking on, that voters will make the connection between this potential solution and Republicans walking away from it. And it comes, of course, at a critical time. We're in a presidential election, and we're seeing in polls that Americans are starting to rank immigration as one of the most important issues. So President Biden, while he's been dogged by this over the course of his administration, is now trying to turn the tables on Republicans and seize on the issue, trying to take advantage of it in this moment where border crossings are low and when Republicans have indicated that they don't want to move forward on a measure that was agreed to in a bipartisan manner between the Senate and the White House.",

It's part of what helped him get elected, and it's something that he's continued to say in 2024. He has asked -- called for mass deportations. He said he was going to round up migrants. And this is part of his campaign strategy. He wants a general election against President Joe Biden to be about immigration. There's a reason that he's in Eagle Pass today. This is not the area where the most migrants are crossing, but this is the most politically charged area. This is really the epicenter of the standoff between Texas Governor Greg Abbott and the Biden administration over who is in charge of border security. Abbott, who is likely going to be here with Trump today, who has endorsed Donald Trump, has used state resources to put razor wire on buoys in the middle of the Rio Grande River, put them on train cars all lined along the border here. And Donald Trump is going to tour those areas. He's going to talk to the National Guard. He's going to be briefed on the situation, and he's going to deliver remarks. And, as you noted, we heard a preview of those remarks yesterday. Here's what he said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES (R) AND CURRENT U.S. PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  As president, I will carry out the largest domestic deportation operation in American history to remove Joe Biden's illegals and murderers, because that's what many of them are.

Now, I want you to look beyond this fence, because this is going to give you an idea of what President Trump is actually going to see near the stage where we're expecting him to actually speak. You can see that there's a lot of equipment, more fencing, more razor wire, more militarized equipment. This is where he's going to be touring. He's going to be able to see the Rio Grande, some of the razor wire on the Rio Grande, and shipping containers that form a border wall along the river. Now, this is where the border buoys also are. That's another big fight between the federal government and the state of Texas. They're just downriver. Some of the razor wire on here, that's where the legal battle is happening also between the federal government and the state. Now, a lot of the people here from Eagle Pass have opinions about the president stopping by. Some of them are for his visit. Others are against.

We have seen a change in how the White House has put forward policy, from enacting executive actions on broad humanitarian parole, to now, apparently, according to sources, considering actions that would severely limit asylum, actions that are very reminiscent of former President Donald Trump.I'm curious how you feel about the potential for those executive actions to move forward. CUELLAR:  Well, I think the president is -- President Biden will do an executive order that will follow the law, and not just do it for political reasons. Now, there will be some people that don't believe that he should do that, that we should have open borders. We don't want to have open borders, but the president can take certain actions. Some of it, of course -- a lot of it, should I say, will need a lot of congressional funding and maybe change some of the authorities. But there are some things he can do right now that can stop the flow of people. For example, in December, they talked to the Mexican government, where we were getting 10,000, 12,000 people a day. Now it's been cut in half. What happened? We didn't build new border wall. We didn't add new Border Patrol. We didn't add any new technology. What happened was, we worked with Mexico to do its part in the southern border with Guatemala. So there are a lot of things that the president can do. Sure, there will be legal challenges, of course, but I think he needs to take some legal action. But Congress needs to fund more judges, more asylum officers, new Border Patrol technology that will help the president do his job.",

They described drivers of the trucks potentially having run people over in the melee. But that's a very different scene than what we heard described from eyewitnesses on the ground, who say that, essentially, Israeli forces opened fire after the truck was sort of set upon by these people who were looting. I think, at the end of the day, what this underscores and what you hear from aid agencies again and again is that this is a kind of tragedy that has been predicted and warned about for weeks and months because of the nature of the humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza, because of the fact that you have hundreds of thousands of people on the brink of famine. And so now there is real urgency as to how to better implement the distribution of aid in Gaza to avoid events like this taking place again and to avoid what the U.N. has called a full-blown famine just one step away if this issue doesn't get resolved.",
