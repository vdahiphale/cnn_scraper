But they also wanted a delay of this lower court's decision that canceled the business certificates of the company. The full scope of that is really still unknown. And so, this one judge panel, Associate Justice Peter Moulton.He held arguments for about 15 minutes. He said he wasn't going to stop the trial, which is now in its fifth day. But he said he would halt the cancellation of these certificates because he even noted himself that it was unclear if this would even include forcing people to sell their own private homes based on the ruling. So that is now on pause, at least temporarily. There will be additional legal arguments on this matter to see how far long it goes. But Trump's team is ultimately appealing. That lower court's ruling that found that Trump was engaged in persistent fraud for a decade by filing false financial statements to get better terms on insurance and loans. Jake.",

Remember, he is facing 91 criminal charges across four separate criminal investigations about the state and federal levels. And now Trump's lawyers are testing new tactics to try to get him out of some of his most egregious charges. Now the first one I'm going to tell you about as a Hail Mary, Trump would have to win the 2024 presidential election, he would assume our office and then pardon himself assuming that that would be constitutional. And assuming it is, poof, absolved of federal charges. Though last month, Trump said it's, quote, \"very unlikely\" he would do that. That's if you take him at his word. OK, moving on. Second scenario, Trump would not have to win the presidency. Yesterday, Trump's lawyers asked the judge in Special Counsel Jack Smith's federal election interference case to just dismiss all of the criminal charges in that case, citing immunity since he was president of the United States at the time of the alleged crimes. Now, this is untested, and unprecedented. But various legal experts say the argument is well laid out and could actually possibly work. Take a listen to CNN Elie Honig. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And so that is going to give the Trump defense team leverage to argue that the January 6 case needs to be put on hold, while the courts of appeals sort out these thorny questions of absolute immunity. So Trump, I think, is playing a smart game in this respect. He probably knows he's not going to win this in the District Court, he's not going to win in the court of appeals, but it's going to eat up a lot of the clock, maybe push this all past the election, and who knows there might be a pot of gold in the Supreme Court at the end of this long road.",
