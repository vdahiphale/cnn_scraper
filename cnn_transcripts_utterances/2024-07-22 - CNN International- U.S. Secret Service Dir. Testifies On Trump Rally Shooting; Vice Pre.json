RAJA KRISHNAMOORTHI (D-IL): Thank you, Mr. Chair, and thank you, Mr. Ranking Member, for bringing us together this morning. One question I get asked a lot from my constituents is, what can Congress actually do to stop this from happening again? Now, I'd like to share a graphic from a very recent study conducted by Professor Robert Pape, a world renowned expert in combating political violence. The graphic shows that 74 percent of Americans want this Congress to come together to denounce political violence of all stripes. And you can tell it's across party lines. I commend the Chair and Ranking Member for putting out the statement the other day condemning political violence. And to further this effort. I'd like to ask all my colleagues to join Dr. Brad Wenstrup and me in introducing a resolution that we think can secure unanimous House passage in deploring and condemning political violence, and we will be circulating that resolution shortly. Director Cheatle, as you know, the shooter began shooting at 6:11 p.m. Eastern on July 13. NBC reported that at 5:51 p.m., 20 minutes before the shooting began, the state police informed the Secret Service of their concern. Now, the rally was not paused at that point. Correct?",

Some of us -- BIANNA GOLODRYGA, HOST, \"CNN NEWSROOM\": All right. You've been listening to the Director of the U.S. Secret Service testifying on Capitol Hill right now. She was being grilled by lawmakers from both sides of the aisle following the assassination attempt of former President Donald Trump. Meantime, Vice President Kamala Harris is taking part in a ceremony honoring the NCAA championship teams. You're looking at a live look at the White House now. The Vice President is scheduled to be on the South Lawn for the ceremony. This, of course, will be the first time we her here since President Joe Biden agreed to end his pursuit yesterday of reelection. The President's letter went on to endorse the Vice President as the future presidential candidate. We will bring you back to that hearing with the Director of the Secret Service later on. But, obviously, this is a big focus for us now to hear from Kamala Harris. Now, there is speculation over who she will pick as her potential Vice President. We know a number of the candidates includes swing state governors, popular senators and administration officials. Harris has previously praised two of the rumored contenders, Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro and North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Arguably even the past few weeks, she has addressed that in a much more coherent and stronger format, really drawing a comparison between the alternative, the Republican nominee and that's Donald Trump and his views on reproductive rights and abortion, and obviously, what the Democratic ticket would hold in their views as well.So, even though you note and maybe you're right that she will not address this latest development here, I think every word she says going forward will be scrutinized a lot more.",
