      "sentences": "Hello everyone. Thank you so much for being here At This Hour. I'm Kate Bolduan. We are going to focus in first on the war in Ukraine. Any moment now, we are standing by to hear from the Defense Secretary, Lloyd Austin and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, General Mark Milley. They're going to be holding a press conference, a news conference in Germany. This is an important moment, a critical moment in the fight in Ukraine. Western allies are meeting and have been there for a couple of days to hammer out the latest plan to support Ukraine now and support Ukraine going forward. A key point of contention right now is Germany's refusal so far to supply Ukraine with tanks that it says are necessary to win against Russia. Tanks are not part of the latest aid package that was just announced by the Pentagon. A very big package, though $2.5 billion for Ukraine, that does however, include Stryker armored vehicles for the very first time.We're going to stand by we're going to be going to this press conference any moment. Oren Liebermann is standing by with us at the Pentagon. Oren, what are we expecting to hear?",

The U.S. on the front foot here with just announced yesterday $2.5 billion package, the second largest the U.S. has ever provided Ukraine and that includes a lot of the mechanized capabilities you just mentioned, Bradleys, Strykers, MRAPs, which are mine resistant vehicles, so a few brigades worth of equipment.As we all know, the U.S. has already started training Ukrainians on what's called the combined arms training. So the ability to use all of this and then we've already heard from nearly a dozen other European countries on everything they've provided, so there is --",

So we have a window of opportunity here, you know, between now and the spring when I -- you know, whenever they commence their operation, their counteroffensive, and that's not a long time, and we have to pull together the right capabilities. And you heard the chairman walk through some of the substantial combat power that we and some of our allies have offered to provide.There are tanks in that -- those offerings. Poland, for example, is -- continues to offer tanks and will provide tanks, and other countries will offer some tank capability, as well. I don't have any announcements to make on M1s, and you heard the German minister of defense say that they've not made a decision on Leopards, so.",

Let's talk about this critical moment in the fight there.CNN military analyst, retired Army Major General James \"Spider\" Marks is here. CNN's Senior Political Commentator, former Republican Congressman Adam Kinzinger is also here. CNN's chief international correspondent Clarissa Ward is in Ukraine. Congressman, let me start with you.

I think you can tell we certainly want Germany to commit to these -- to sending the main battle tanks in there. We'd like to see him step forward now. He's trying to be a little diplomatic in that. It's confusing with me, with Germany. I mean they're trying to compare apples and apples when Germany says, well, the U.S. has to send M1s first.The reality is, our M1s take a lot different of a logistical footprint. They burn a lot more fuel, for instance, in a fuel starved region. So it's not really apples to apples. I personally think we do need to start are sending M1s, but the Germans should do it. So that's what kind of stood out. There is a real stepping up, of course, of the infantry fighting vehicles, armored personnel carriers that are going to make a big difference, but this is still going to go on. It's a slogged.",

But in terms of the hesitancy on our end, some of it is letting Europe kind of lead the way. I think diplomatically that makes sense, but I think we've been slow to react to some things. It's not critical on the Biden administration. They have certainly stepped up, but we keep sitting here saying we're not going to send, you know, HIMARS, we're going to send -- and then we end up doing it later. Give everything Ukraine needs now to win, because the sooner this war can end, the cheaper it's going to be in human lives and American tax dollars. BOLDUAN",

I mean, if I say it in a crude way, you speak Pentagon very well. What did you hear?MAJ. GEN. JAMES \"SPIDER\" MARKS (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST: Well, this is the first time I've heard that the overarching concern has been a gap between the ends that President Zelenskyy has indicated, which is the removal, the departure of all Russian forces from Ukraine and the support from the NATO forces. There's been a gap. It really went from what I heard today was it went from I don't want to be cynical about this, but it went from, let's just not lose this thing, to I think we need to win this thing. And you saw Secretary Austin lay out all the kit that's going to be provided, and then you had the reinforcement of what that kit means from General Milley. He described the brigades, the number of maneuver battalions, et cetera. So what I heard, however, there's one more, however, and that is Secretary Austin started his comments by saying, we're here as the Contact Group to ensure the self-defense of Ukraine. And then you heard General Milley say, we're here to help liberate, Ukraine. We're still at least at a narrative where those two don't link up.",

This stemming from mixed messaging we've heard from Republicans since Republicans have taken the majority. Do you think Ukraine has a reason for concern here?",

There's going to be a lot of fighting between now and then. Secondarily, there's still stocks of equipment, there's still ways to get Ukraine stuff. But, yes, I mean the strangest thing to me is watching some on the far left and far right link up in their opposition to Ukraine and support for what Russia is doing and using their kind of minority position and able to block things to say we're not going to fund Ukraine anymore.I don't understand it. I think Ukraine needs to stay on the offensive diplomatically and politically here in the United States. We need to keep talking about the people that are dying, the innocents that are dying, and how frankly Ukraine is fighting for the rest of us. But I don't think we're at the point of needing to panic quite yet.",

Clarissa, tanks or no tanks, if you will, what is the sense that you're getting there of what the spring is going to look like with this new threat of a new Russian offensive? We heard Secretary Austin took note, he says we have a window here, but that's a window here between now and spring. That's not a long time in his view.",

You look at the fighting that's been taking place in Bakhmut, in Soledar, it is a grind, it is ugly. There is a heavy rate of attrition, a huge rate of casualties. You see the attacks that we saw in Dnipro, more than 40 people killed in the residential apartment building. And you see the rolling blackouts, the attacks on the infrastructure.Ukraine is feeling the pain, they are fighting valiantly. They have had a lot of success. But in this moment, I don't think there's an obvious key strategic target for them to go for. That's an easy win. There will be some very tough battles ahead and they know that they need a lot of support in order to begin to even attempt those.",
