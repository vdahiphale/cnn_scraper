You're going to walk out with a - with a better economy, cleaner air, better national security. I mean the benefits of this - from the clean energy transition are enormous for almost everybody. Not if you're a fossil fuel billionaire. They will not be better off in a clean energy. The fossil fuel billionaires will be worse off. And because of that, and because of the enormous political power they have, they have been able to essentially capture the political process to have politicians force us to continue using dirty, expensive fossil fuels.WEIR (voice over): Bill Weir. CNN, New York. (END VIDEOTAPE) FREEMAN: All right, let's bring in my panel now to discuss and kind of react to what we saw. I'll get everyone's reaction, but I think I'll start with you, and I'll give you the top line thought, just, can President-elect Trump really lower energy prices? EDWARD-ISAAC DOVERE, CENN SENIOR REPORTER: Well, remember, he didn't say he would lower energy prices. He said he would lower them by half. That is, as he said, an ambitious promise. It is one that he said multiple times over the course of the campaign. He said it was his pledge as you played there in that clip. That is beyond what anyone serious who's looked at the energy situation believes is possible. And as, in Bill Weir's piece there, what it was getting into, it's not like raising energy production in Aerica would be the answer to that. First of all, because there's not that much more to do. And, second of all, because we are already producing so much fossil fuels at this point. So, the question that is in front of President Trump and is in front of the country, as they evaluate what he does on this promise, is not what benefits energy companies, but what is actually going to be in the lives of people, consumers, everyday Americans who voted, thinking that they were voting about pricing and what it would do to their own personal economy. What happens for them and whether they believe that getting to any kind of energy savings matters ultimately. It's a big cost. Everybody who owns a home or a business knows energy is a big part of what those costs are. And we will see now how - how much President Trump can get to cutting things by half. If he gets to half. I think he will, as I said, surprise a lot of people. And then what sort of accountability there is for that very central promise of his campaign being there if it's not fulfilled.",

Look, you can campaign in contradiction, but you certainly can't govern in contradiction. The difficult situation that Trump is in right now is, let's say he actually did fulfill his promise of lowering energy costs by 50 percent. He would actually catalyze a depression amongst the U.S. energy business at the same time, which relies on high energy costs causing massive unemployment amongst his very base political states. So, this is illustrative of the fact that very quickly the Trump administration is going to come head on into the difficulty of obtaining their campaign promises. And in fact, in many instances, such as this energy promise, it's utterly impossible.",

And I think, you know, the secretary of the Interior, I think the secretary of Energy both understand that - or the - the newly appointed - the nominated secretaries understand that.What is more interesting, I think, right now is the fact that, under Biden, these kind of energy policies, particularly under the Inflation Reduction Act, have actually been deeply beneficial to red states and blue states, but in particular red states, in some cases rescuing manufacturing, rescuing energy production, rescuing all kinds of industry. And so there is a push amongst Republicans, particularly Republican congressmen, to keep those acts and to keep those things in place. So, I actually wouldn't be surprised if the Trump administration tries to take advantage of the benefits that are coming as a direct result of Joe Biden's energy production and energy laws and infrastructure that he has been put in place, but that Democrats actually have not taken advantage of over the past several years, at least in terms of messaging. So, I wouldn't actually be surprised to see that because there's very little that Donald Trump can actually do to increase that won't actually offset or create a depression or create a recession, will cause the loss of jobs and will hurt actually those red states that he claims that he wants to protect. I actually think that this is far more of a PR campaign on the part - in messaging on the part of Donald Trump and taking - really taking advantage of the work that the Biden administration has been putting in place. The last thing that I'll say here, too, is that it also matters that Elon Musk is a huge proponent of clean energy and of these infrastructure because he takes advantage of it with Tesla and his other clean energy projects. So, I would - I would pay attention to that too, what does Elon Musk think on these issues, because that's probably the direction that the Trump administration will be going in during these first couple of months.",
