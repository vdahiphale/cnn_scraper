A cargo ship has left the Black Sea port of Odessa despite Moscow's threats to target shipping after it withdrew from the Black Sea grain deal last month. Ukraine says the ship is moving through a temporary corridor created for civilian vessels. The Hong Kong flagship had been trapped since Russia's invasion in February of last year. This as Ukraine accuses Russia of targeting food supplies following an overnight drone attack in the Odessa region. Moscow has been striking Ukrainian ports and grain silos since mid-July. Meanwhile, Kyiv claims its forces have recaptured a village in the Donetsk region after days of punishing battles. Well, CNN's Nic Robertson has been following all the developments for us from London and joins us now live. Nic, I want to begin with that cargo vessel leaving the Black Sea currently. How viable is this temporary corridor that's been set up as an alternative transport route for Ukrainian grain, given that we know Moscow have threatened to treat any ships leaving Ukraine as a target?",

Of course, this was a ship that's been stuck -- a Hong Kong- registered ship that's been stuck in Ukraine since Russia invaded back in early 2022. And Ukraine says it's giving the priority to getting all of those stuck ships out. It wasn't able to do that when the Black Sea grain deal was working, but Russia was a participant in, as well. So, Russia's threats, as far as Ukraine is concerned, are very real, and this will be a test. And we saw just today, as well, that the Russian drones targeted grain storage areas in a port along the Danube River, again, implicit threat to Ukraine. You're not going to be able to move your grain out even along the Danube River, which is a sort of alternate backup plan of not being able to use the Black Sea. So, this is a test. Thirty thousand tons of goods on board, some of them food products on board this Hong Kong registered ship. It's on its way to Turkey. It's expected to go through the Bosphorus in the coming days, but if there's interference along the way, then that would very likely cause a -- Ukrainians perhaps to have to put a pause on this current plan.",

Ukrainians took the first village, the Russians were trying to get it back, they set their sights on the second village, the one they've now got, and we can expect to see the Russians try to push back. And along that big, long front line across sort of from Donetsk all the way across towards Zaporizhzhia, that southern frontline, Ukraine continues to make small gains, but they are potentially reversible. And we heard from the commander of Ukraine's ground forces earlier today saying that he'd spend most of his day up in the frontline in the northeast of the country around Kupyansk where he said the Russians were putting a huge effort to try to get into that town, a town Ukrainians retook from the Russians back in the end of last year. So, it is significant that Ukrainians ever so slowly are making gains. It's good for their morale. But we can expect, A, the Russians to push back and any further moves from there will take time.

Only about 60 percent of this upcountry fire has been contained, and we can actually see at least two hotspots around here, which explains the yellow helicopter. That is a Maui Fire Department. He's taken bucket loads of water from a nearby swimming pool of a home that was completely burned down. They're refilling it with a fire hydrant but the fire department has stretched so thin here that it's really sort of do-it- yourself DIY fire protection, which explains this setup. This homeowner was gone, his wife was here, but she fired up their improvised sort of fire prevention system and they're spraying it as far as they can down into the ravine here. With the fear that some of these hot spots might whip up. There's a couple of storms brewing in the Pacific, nothing near to Hurricane or the storm Dora that created all of the firestorm winds, but still, anything that would kick this up is one more horrible thing to worry about here. Meanwhile, in Lahaina, officials say about only a third of that area has been searched with cadaver dogs. About a dozen souls have been identified through DNA, four identified and notified families, and then they've got dozens of other families who are now giving DNA samples because they have loved ones who are missing. So, it's agony, knowing maybe the worst has happened, but hoping you'll get a better result. Here again comes another drop. And in addition to fire department, sprinklers, we actually met a couple of guys, volunteers who were putting out hot spots with bottled water, sort of bushwhacking through this dry brush. One of them actually burned a foot when he slid into still smoldering ash. So, that's the scene here in upcountry.

There was a moment in this game where I really wanted Australia to win it. And we'll show you why, because these highlights were absolutely incredible. It was a great occasion, as you say, a huge crowd, very, very passionate crowd but England's ever tuned there, silencing that crowd just a little with an amazing goal, but it was bettered in the second half by this effort from Sam Kerr. Just take a look. What an absolutely brilliant goal. Sam Kerr is the Australian star. She is the heartbeat of this team. This was her first start in this World Cup. And I personally wanted that moment to mean something, but in the end it was for nought as England won the game. Lauren Hemp here capitalizing on a mistake in the Australian defense and then, you know, at this point, Australia could have got back into it. Sam Kerr just, just wide. And just moments after that, England put this one to bed with another good finish from Alessia Russo. So, England winning 3-1 on the night. So, so disappointing for the Australian team, the Matildas, as they're so passionately known. But this team has done so much to transform the perception of women's soccer and women's sport in Australia over the last few weeks.

Now, at the time, he was facing an involuntary manslaughter charge for being the person who was holding that weapon when it killed Cinematographer Halyna Hutchins. But that case was ultimately dismissed. At least temporarily, a law enforcement source told me at the time, that's because investigators discovered that the gun that was used was 44, modified. Now, I'll read you what prosecutors said at that time, which is so important. They said that the charges against Alec Baldwin were dismissed without prejudice because of possible malfunction of the gun. If it is determined that the gun did not malfunction, charges against Mr. Baldwin will proceed. Now, as part of this investigation, the U.S. FBI was brought in. This gun was sent to their laboratory. They determined that gun could not have gone off if someone did not pull the trigger. Officials there in New Mexico commissioned their own independent review that essentially came to the same conclusion of the FBI. I'll read you part of that new report we just got our hands on. Those examiners wrote that although Alec Baldwin repeatedly denies pulling the trigger, given the test findings and observations reported here, the trigger had to be pulled or depressed efficiently to release the fully cocked or retracted hammer of the evidence revolver. So, again in June, prosecutors said that if determined that the gun did not malfunction, they will move forward with charging Alec Baldwin. This new report appears to confirm just that. We'll see what prosecutors do going forward. Finally, it's important to point out that Alec Baldwin has repeatedly claimed his innocence, saying that he did not pull the trigger on that weapon.

What that means is that the burden of proof to put in front of a court -- International Court, is very high. And you have got to attribute individual crimes to individual perpetrators. So, we can say that the killings in Darfur now are genocidal in nature, but that is not sufficient to bring a case against any individuals. And, in the end, in the court, you have to go against individuals. You can go against a general pattern and you can go against command and control, but you have to prove a link between what's going on individually on the ground, for example, the mass graves you mentioned, and those who ordered these mass killings and then disposal of the bodies. And by the way, the graves that have been discovered really convince me that these are genocidal killings because whenever you find mass graves, and you saw this, we saw this, and I saw it with my own eyes in Srebrenica, for example, and in Rwanda and in Cambodia, you don't have mass graves unless there's an orchestrated mass attempt to kill. And that means there is a degree of organization which turns the random violence of war into a purposeful violence. And in this case, we know it's ethically targeted because the victims all belong to the Mesuliyet or other African tribes or groups and the perpetrators tend to be self-identified themselves as Arabs. So, all this just adds to the case that what we're witnessing now is a repeat of the genocide of 20 years ago.",

Either one side wins and then hascome -- and the other side has come to the negotiating table, or it is enforced from outside. This is what happened during the Second World War and in other situations, as we've seen, where the Vietnamese intervention in Cambodia or the Tanzanian intervention in Uganda and so on. Now, we have a situation now where, actually, there's a lot of fights still left in this conflict. Both sides have got a lot of resources and people, and the battle is an existentialist one, and it is supported in different ways from external parties. So, they're receiving the encouragement. Now, in that context, I think calling for peace is a little bit redundant, because peace only happens when one side or the other wants to actually make it happen and the circumstances are not there at the present time. And of course, you know, these are not the days where you can put in a U.N. peacekeeping force. I mean, 20 years ago, I asked for a U.N. peacekeeping force and I got it. It was late because the genocide already happened. However, it was something to do in terms of protecting the remaining victims and ensuring healing, to some extent at least, an incomplete job done, but I think attempt was made. Today, I think there are no prospects for intervention, whether under the U.N. or the African Union, because countries are divided geopolitically and also regionally within the Arab world and within, of course, the African continent. And, you know, today we see this with Niger. Interventions are a double-edged weapon. We might actually make the situation worse if you go down a cack-handed route. But with what Malik Agar said --",
