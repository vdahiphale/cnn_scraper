He gave two primary reasons for that. He said that, partly, it's because of the weather. It's damp; it's muddy. That makes it more difficult. And also, he pointed out the terrain. There are lots of water supply canals, which the Russians are able to use as trenches and basically use as their defenses. So it is becoming a much tougher battle than many had hoped.

CNN medical correspondent Dr. Tara Narula is with us now. So where do we stand with these trends that are picking up? DR. TARA NARULA, CNN MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, Brianna, we know we're going to continue to see infectious diseases arise and spread, new pathogens emerge. And really, one of our best defenses is bio-surveillance. And you would think coming out of COVID, we would have a robust system in place. And unfortunately, as we can see, with COVID and RSV and influenza, we're really not there. We have a real need for real-time information that can be disseminated quickly to help us make new and relative public health strategy approaches that work quickly. So we know that the way that it works now is basically the CDC releases a weekly report based on voluntary reporting from a couple labs in a couple states that represents, really, a tenth of the population. In a typical year of RSV and flu, this sampling strategy may be enough, in the sense that it shows you where you're starting to see increases, rises, falls. The challenge comes in years like this, when we're seeing all of these infectious diseases at once. And at that point, the information, the lag time is just -- it's too slow. So by the time hospitals, for example, are getting this information from the CDC, it's already a week or two old and they're backlogged. And we can see that now, where we see about three-quarters of pediatric hospital beds filled, in some states over 90 percent. So again, really, this need for actual real-time information that can be disseminated quickly.",

      "sentences": "Well, there's a couple different strategies that can be taken.First of all, we know that many times, hospitals and doctors and public health officials have been sharing information in these informal networks; for example, on social media. We saw this happen a lot with COVID. In fact, some of the first reports of lack of PPE, for example, were doctors on Facebook and Twitter talking about this. We saw research being disseminated on social media. So if we can harness that to an actionable way, that could be one strategy. Another one that's really interesting is wastewater sampling. So this may sound unusual, but essentially, we can take waste water and look for RNA and DNA samples or particles from these viruses. That can give us a sense of where we're seeing virus in the country one, two, three weeks before we clinically begin to see it. And we've seen the patterns of where we're picking this up correlate with where we're seeing the spread. And this has been used for the last couple years with COVID. Another strategy, hospitals can employ bio surveillance systems within their own networks. For example, my hospital system, Northwell, implemented this a couple years with the flu, where they have a command center where they're tracking, where they're seeing spikes in testing in the different hospitals in their systems. And they can then deploy masks, Tamiflu, appropriate staff to the hospitals very quickly. And finally, really, more funding for local and state public health officials. And even, you know, incorporating electric health medical records into public health information. So there's so much we can do, but we need funding for it, and we need, really, manpower behind putting these systems in place.",

We know here Meadows wants to claim executive privilege, or he wants to say, Trump has executive privilege; I'm not answering some questions. And he's arguing, too, in Georgia that the law there doesn't apply to him. And so prosecutors have to go to court to pick away, try and pick away at that firewall.
