I'll be speaking to Medecins Sans Frontieres as they support emergency services there in the aftermath. In the final stretch for Turkey as the country prepares for the runoff presidential election on Sunday. Will President Erdogan hold on to power? Plus, a terrifying experience for passengers in South Korea as a man allegedly opened the door of a flight of a plane, mid-flight. We'll have the latest on that investigation. Now, a Russian attack on a Ukrainian medical site is being called a war crime. But the mayor there says it could have been even worse. Ukrainian authorities report a wave of Russian attacks in several regions overnight. Rescue teams raced to save lives and put out the flames in Dnipro. Officials say the attacks there hit a hospital and veterinary clinic. At least, two people were killed and children are among 31 people injured. The mayor says it's a miracle doctors were changing shifts when the attack happened. It means fewer people were working in the hospital during the strike. Well, meanwhile, Russians are reporting attacks inside the Belgorod region, close to where the cross-border raid happened earlier this week. While further away, an explosion has been reported in the Russian city of Krasnodar, a social media video appears to show a drone flying above the city moments later, there's some kind of blast. Well, for more on Russia's attack on a Ukrainian hospital. CNN's Sam Kiley filed this report from Dnipro. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SAM KILEY, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (on camera): Dnipro like so many other Ukrainian cities, is no stranger now to scenes like this after more than a year of Russian bombardment. Now, this, though, is a medical clinic. A neurological medical clinic. It's one of dozens of hospitals and other medical structures that the Russians have attacked. According to the World Health Organization, close to a 1,000 medical personnel and other medical facilities as well as buildings have been bombed by the Russians over the last year. And according to the French government, that amounts to a war crime. But even if this wasn't deliberately targeted, we are in a residential area. There's an apartment building there. There's more medical facilities just down the road, there are more apartments here, and indeed a sports stadium and a construction. Now, we've seen the systematic destruction in Syria, of medical facilities by the Russians, and that continues. And for the last year and a bit, we've seen it here, again, by the Russians. Sam Kiley, CNN, in Dnipro. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

That is still a significant feat for an opposition alliance that has long been divided and fragmented. But of course, they are looking to beat President Erdogan who has remained in power for over two decades now. And of course, over these next few days or hours, rather, they are looking to score as many votes as they can from the other parties who haven't made it through to this runoff. So, we have seen Kilicdaroglu and other members of this alliance turning to these policies, trying to publicize policies which have been held and discussed before, but perhaps not as publicized as we are seeing now in recent days. As you mentioned, they're particularly focusing on the refugee issue. Kemal Kilicdaroglu looking towards this nationalist policies, but of course, we also saw earlier in the week, well, the third-party in that initial vote, led by Sinan Ogan, pledging his support for President Erdogan. Now, it is crucial, because of course, they were successful in achieving 5 percent of the vote. President Erdogan's AK Party successful in achieving 49.5 percent of the vote, just short of that majority they needed to successfully declare a victory. So, there has been talk around the potential for Erdogan to be a sort of kingmaker in this battle for the presidency. Of course, we've also seen other political members of his party backing Kilicdaroglu. So it's not set. Of course, it remains to be seen where those votes transfer between President Erdogan and Kemal Kilicdaroglu. But look, there's only a short amount of time left before people in Turkey go to the polls. And we are still seeing these campaign rallies taking place today. We saw the opposition party taking part in a large-scale rally in Iskodar(ph) neighborhood of Istanbul, just across the street. We were there at an AK Party rally in support of President Erdogan. In fact, the country's own Interior Minister took part in this rally, addressing supporters there. So, this is certainly still not over, there are certainly still a backup(ph) to be had, but of course, there's a lot of pressure now mounting, because if President Erdogan is successful in being re-elected as the president, again, this is another term after being in power for more than 20 years. He has made a lot of promises. He's facing a significant amount of criticism when it comes to the economy, to the government's handling of the earthquake in February, which killed more than 50,000 people, left millions more displaced. And of course, real questions, real fears and concerns over the state of democracy here in Turkey. So certainly, a huge challenge ahead, even if President Erdogan is successful. Christina?",

So, to open the door, you have to pull it in and push it out, and you can't do that at altitude or when the plane is fully pressurized.

First off, the performance, as you mentioned, is meant to, sortof, depict the 1979 album The Wall, where the protagonist hallucinates that he's a fascist dictator. Obviously, the uniform resembles a Nazi uniform. It's got the red armband and all, but instead of a swastika, it's got two crossed hammers, which is imagery that you'll find in the album. It's meant to be satire. As you said, he's been doing it for decades. But this is the first time that it's, well, that there's been a criminal probe into. \"The Berlin police have said this about it. The context of the clothing worn is deemed capable of approving, glorifying, or justifying the violent and arbitrary rule of the Nazi regime in a manner that violates the dignity of the victims and thereby disrupts public peace.\" So the performance has actually been controversial for a while, so much so that the city officials in Frankfurt, where the tour is going this Sunday, actually tried to get the venue to cancel it and it ended up in German court. The court actually ruled with Waters saying that while his performance uses \"symbolism, manifestly based on that of the national socialist regime, aka Nazis, it did not glorify or relativize the crimes of the Nazis or identify with Nazi racist ideology.\"",

Sources say U.S. President Joe Biden andHouse Speaker Kevin McCarthy are nearing a deal that would raise the debt ceiling for two years. McCarthy said his team in the White House made progress last night but acknowledges that it's crunch time. Negotiators have just six days left to reach a compromise. Otherwise, the U.S. could default on its debts and send the global economy into a tailspin. Our Chief Congressional Correspondent Manu Raju is on Capitol Hill with more on what might be taking shape. And Manu, the holiday weekend in the U.S., of course, is just ahead of us. So, the timeline is a bit concerning here because there are still a lot of procedural hoops to jump through, even with a deal on the table. So, do we have any idea when we can expect this to happen?",

      "sentences": "Yes, there are two steps here. First, there actually needs to be a deal, then second, move throughthe United States Congress in both the U.S. House and the U.S. Senate, get the votes, get that all through, and just do that in a matter of days. A process that usually takes months, they're trying to condense over a matter of a handful of days, all with the U.S. economy hanging in the balance. And the question right now is, can they get a deal? Yes, there have been some progress made in the negotiation between the U.S. House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, and the President Joe Biden, and his team, have had a number of discussions for several days now on how to cut spending and tie that for increasing the borrowing limit that's set now at $31.4 trillion. But there are significant issues that are still dividing them. One of them the issue of so-called work requirements for people who benefit from certain social safety net programs here in the United States, that includes food stamps, as well as temporary assistance programs for needy families. Republicans are demanding people who benefit from those programs have to abide by certain work requirements. Democrats have pushed back and said that would hurt the poor and hurt other people who have benefited from that program, and have tried to reject any effort to impose that as part of this negotiation. But I just caught up with one of the key negotiators in the room, Congressman Garret Graves, who told me, \"Hell no, Republicans will not drop that demand for work requirements as part of this deal to avert a debt default.\" So that all raises the question what can actually be done. If they were to get a deal as soon as tonight, then they would have to actually draft it into legislative text. That's going to take at least two days to put together, and then move to the house, that would be three days before there'll be a vote in the U.S. House, and then it could take up to a week to move it through the U.S. Senate. So there are a lot of questions here, especially given the warning from the Treasury Department that a default could occur as soon as June 1st, if not the early June. So that raises a lot of questions about whether a deal can be reached, whether they can get the votes and sell it to both chambers, and if they can actually avert this potential economic disaster. But right now, all the focus is on the speaker's office and the White House, if they can actually get there, uncertain at the moment, Christina.",

So, there are a lot of fears that it could have not just spooked the markets and send it into a tailspin, theU.S. credit rating could be downgraded. It would cost more money for the United States government to continue to borrow money. So, we'd actually rack up more money in the U.S. debt. And there are real practical effects, the U.S. would not be able to pay off some of its bills and they would have to start to prioritize which payments to make, including Social Security checks that go out to individuals here in the U.S. That among a whole wide range of other programs that they are required to continue to fund, can they continue to do that? So, the ramifications could be long-lasting, it could be drastic, or perhaps just a blip if they're able to get this done quickly and get through both chambers of Congress, which is why everyone is watching these negotiations so closely. Can they avoid what has been avoided for this long, debt default? It is still unclear as the haggle behind the scenes to try to get some sort of agreement, Christina.",
