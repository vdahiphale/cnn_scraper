I'm Paula Newton in New York.Ahead right here on CNN Newsroom, racing to the finish line, neck-and- neck. Donald Trump and Kamala Harris hit battleground states with their closing arguments. More star power on the Harris side. Former First Lady Michelle Obama gives a fiery speech for Harris on the trail. And Iran promises a response to Israel's retaliatory strikes. But the question remains, just what will that look like? So, with nine days to go until the U.S. presidential election, Donald Trump and Kamala Harris are making their final pitches to American voters. Early voting already in full swing. More than 36 million voters in the United States have cast their ballots in the race so far. Meantime, Michelle Obama brought star power to the campaign trail in Michigan Saturday when the former first lady rallied for Harris. And before heading to Pennsylvania, Trump too was in Michigan. He tried to woo Arab and Muslim voters and invited several Muslim leaders on stage during his rally. Our reporters are covering the battleground states with CNN's Danny Freeman, following Donald Trump. But first world leader, we go to Eva McKend, who is in Michigan, with the latest on Kamala Harris.",

These are young men under the age of 30. In fact, The New York Times had reported that the group of people that had voted for Biden were the most likely to defect and vote for Trump were young men under 30, who also happened to be people that listened to Joe Rogan.And so he has a 21-point lead with young men under 30. On the other side, Harris has room for optimism because there's a huge divide, a huge gender divide, and that she has a 39-point lead with young women under 30. Young women are probably the most progressive group, and women are more likely to vote than men, generally speaking, by about three to four points if we look at the last 30 years or so. But Trump's team is sensing that this is an opportunity here, that young men are disgruntled. They've been struggling more. They're less likely to be employed than young women are. They have higher rates of suicide and they're trying to target this particular demographic with, you know, the recent campaign stop focusing on things that, you know, these young men might find attractive and appealing. NEWTON: Yes. And given the fact it was in Pennsylvania, as we keep talking about, it doesn't take many votes there to swing it in one candidate's favor or the other. I do want to talk about this gender gap in a moment, but before I get there, I'm just curious, we haven't spoken about this much, but the election is close now.

I know that Congress has, of course, tried to Trump-proof NATO to ensure that the U.S. can't just leave NATO, but the U.S. provides a lot of funding for NATO. It is a guarantor of European security. And there are concerns what will happen if Trump is in power. Will he basically just give Vladimir Putin free rein to do whatever he wants to, to NATO countries that don't pay up?There are also concerns about his policies on -- his economic policies that he's going to employ all these tariffs that are going to deteriorate some of these economic relationships. And, of course, there's concerns about what he could do to other international organizations, like the World Health Organization. He's threatened to leave last time. He notably left the Paris Climate Accords, over 100 environmental regulations were rolled back under Trump.

So, I think it is an important issue for both genders that the question is, how important is it? Is it more important than the economy? Many people that want to vote for Trump are saying, well, I'm voting for Trump because my groceries were cheaper when he was in power, I was doing a little bit better when he was in power. And they are putting this top of their agenda over other issues that actually are more key to our just fundamental human rights.

This is what it looked like over the skies of Tehran Saturday. Israel is keeping a tight lid on detailed assessment from the strikes, possibly to give Iran more flexibility in its own response.Meanwhile, Israel-Hamas ceasefire talks are scheduled to take place today. CIA Director Bill Burns and Mossad Chief David Barnea will be among the negotiators. This will be the first meeting, in fact, in more than two months. Aaron David Miller is a former State Department Middle East negotiator and a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, and he joins us from Washington. Good to see you again. Look, Iran and Israel finally agree on something, right, both countries downplaying Israel's retaliation, for lack of a better term, wanting, it seems, for now, both countries to take a step back from the brink. So, in your opinion, what now? AARON DAVID MILLER, FORMER U.S. STATE DEPARTMENT MIDDLE EAST NEGOTIATOR: I mean, I think this will resolve in a sort of, I would say, temporary, but probably more permanent balance of deterrence in which neither Israel nor Iran has a stake in escalating. I think that was that's clear, as you pointed out, Paula, from the messaging. It's also clear from the reality that their closest point, they're 750 miles apart. So, we're not talking about two nations that share contiguous borders that can fight a land war. The Israelis clearly can do a great deal of damage, should they choose, and perhaps Iran can cause the Israelis some pain. But I don't think right now, based on what we've seen and particularly the messaging that that's the direction we're going. But it's important to point out, I think, that what we witness is something quite extraordinary, twice now in several months, Iran has attacked Israel directly with ballistic missiles and the Israelis have retaliated once with a standoff missile strike, the other with a more comprehensive intense set of airstrikes over the last 24 hours. This is extraordinary. And while this didn't escalate into a major regional war, it's very disconcerting that the Iranians and the Israelis may well draw the conclusion that attacking one another is, in fact, possible without going to a major war. And that expands the risk -- the tolerance risk on both their sides. And since there's no peace treaty coming and there's no way to diffuse the core issues that divide Israel and the Islamic Republic, we're going to be in a state of control tension and I suspect controlled escalation.

A lot of analysts believe that since Iran's two deterrent legs have proven to be so unstable, number one, Hezbollah, and, number two, their ballistic missile attacks. And the Israelis apparently did serious damage to ballistic missile production as a consequence of these latest strikes. The argument goes, well, if the two legs of the, of a three-leg table are now not available to Iran, well then how about the third leg, which is, of course, weaponization?But, again, that's a critically important decision. I think we would probably know if and when the Iranians were actually pushing to weaponization. And then there would presumably be consequences. I think for now, the Iranians are not going to push the envelope. They want to restore Hezbollah, do anything they can to support Hamas. It's going to be difficult. And they'll talk tough with respect to the Israelis backing their proxies. I don't think they're going to push to weaponization.
