I'm Abby Phillip in Washington.Two very serious charges for that 21-year-old Air National Guardsman accused of leaking a trove of sensitive classified documents online. You can see there Jack Teixeira's parents outside of the courthouse this morning in Boston. Their son was in shackles facing a judge less than 24 hours after he peacefully surrendered to a swarm of heavily armed FBI agents. Prosecutors revealed today that Teixeira had a top secret clearance since 2021 and that he allegedly leak -- the alleged leaking began long afterward in an online Discord group. The Pentagon says that this was a deliberate criminal act. And the new court documents show that members of that chat group gave the FBI information that could be key to making that case. CNN's Natasha Bertrand is at the Pentagon. Natasha, so lay out what the charges that he is facing are.",

      "sentences": "Yes, Abby, so he did appear in court in Massachusetts this morning. And he was officially charged with two separate counts here.The first is unauthorized retention and transmission of national defense information. And the second is unauthorized removal and retention of classified documents or material. Now, these, of course, relate to the allegation that he removed sensitive and highly classified information from his place of work, which was the Air National Guard in Massachusetts, the intelligence wing of the Air National Guard there. And then he allegedly posted them on this private social media platform called in Discord, where dozens of people who were not authorized to view these documents were, of course, able to view them. And we are told just in the last few hours a couple more details about what actually he was doing in the Air National Guard and why he had access, actually, to these top secret documents. We are learning from the FBI affidavit that he had a top secret clearance and that he has had that since 2021. And, in addition to that, he had sensitive, compartmented information access. So that basically gave him access to some of the most sensitive intelligence programs in the entire U.S. government. And the reason why he had this is not necessarily because he was dealing with this highly classified information a daily, day-to-day basis and needed to know the content of that information in order to do his job. He was actually more of an I.T. specialist. And he was tasked with keeping these classified networks kind of operating. So the risk that he could be exposed to this highly classified information is why he was given such a high clearance. Now, the question is, is whether he actively sought out these specific documents on these systems in order to leak to his friends in this group chat, or whether someone else gave them to him or who even printed them out. Did he print them out himself? So many questions still being raised about his motives and, of course, about his background? What -- how did the military vet him? And was that vetting appropriate, Abby?",

In part, it reads -- quote -- \"I have directed our military and intelligence community to take steps to further secure and limit distribution of sensitive information. And our national security team is closely coordinating with our partners and our allies.\" Now, let's bring in our former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper. Director Clapper, many of our viewers will remember you were the nation's spy chief during the Edward Snowden leak. That was one of the biggest in U.S. history. I wonder, what do you think this case is in comparison to that?",

And, from what I have read, the Ukrainians have already taken some measures to mitigate or -- the effects of the revelations. So, yes, I'm concerned about it, but the big thing is, were sources and methods revealed or which could be back-engineered, let's say, by an adversary such as, in this case, Russia? And I don't really know the answer to that. But I think, again, if there is an upside, it's that such tactical data will age off over time.",

I don't hear that from this case. I think his motivation appeared to be simply ego. And I will also comment, Abby, that taking measures to restrict access, restrict dissemination, and do those kinds of administrative things is important. But I would point out that our clearance system is based on personal trust. And, unfortunately, we have had violations of personal trust in the past. We have one now. And no matter how many mousetraps we install to preclude such breaches, we're going to have violations of personal trust in the future.",

This group that he was in, they were sharing racist memes. There's a video of him shooting weapons, making antisemitic and racist comments. It does seem to raise the question, is the clearance process, which is very intense for top secret and TS/SCI, it's really intense, but is it catching individuals who might be more susceptible to doing something for ego reasons that would jeopardize national security?",

      "sentences": "Yes.Abby, you ask the $64 question. The clearance mechanism is built -- puts a lot of emphasis on initially granting or not clearances. Where it's weaker is in the follow-up monitoring and surveillance of people's behavior. So, when he was granted a clearance, a top secret clearance in 2021, there was a judgment made, after looking at his background, which wasn't all that long, given his youth, his education, had any encounters with the police. And a judge -- in the end, a subjective judgment is made that, hey, this person is judged to be sufficiently trustworthy to be granted top secret access. When changes occur in attitude or behavior, that's where the system is a little weaker. Now, a clearance system is going to a system of continuous evaluation where, hopefully, you would catch this. And the other issue this raises is access to social media. Classically, it's been OK for clearance authorities to look at publicly available social media, but restricted chat rooms and the like, restricted groups on social media, particularly on obscure platforms, that's a tougher problem. And you do get into then some significant civil and privacy issues on just how intrusive the clearance system will be authorized to be. So, these are not easy issues.",

And I.P. addresses and login times and messages that people send often can lead a defendant to being convicted. And that's certainly going to -- not certainly going to happen here, but I think would seem to point in that direction. Now, it's not a defense, but, certainly, at sentencing, he can make an argument that:  Look, I wasn't attempting to harm the United States. What I thought I was doing was something righteous. And I don't have a criminal history before. And maybe a sympathetic judge might give him a slightly lower sentence under the federal sentencing guidelines. But that's not a defense to the crime. An individual who faces a tremendous amount of evidence that's electronic evidence stands a pretty decent chance of getting convicted or avoiding a conviction altogether and simply pleading guilty, in the hope that he might get a lower sentence.",

So, they -- it's -- they may not have known exactly what they were doing with the -- there's been a lot of talk about the fact it was just a bunch of kids on an Internet forum.

Now, we are still seeing some delays, given that there were delays and cancellations over the last day or so. But the good news is that we have seen passengers coming in with bag in hand, and they're heading out. So that is a big development as of today. I want to show you from the sky, though, what it looks like right now, an aerial view of what some of these neighborhoods out there are still seeing. We were talking to neighbors today, one who said it is a disaster in his home. A little bit more good news, well, the water receding. We started to see that early on this morning. But we are expecting to see rain this afternoon. So, neighbors were a little hesitant to clean up, given what could be coming this afternoon. Now, we don't expect it to be anything like what we saw earlier, the historic flooding. But there is some hesitation, and neighbors looking to see what will happen, given that the ground is still very saturated from all the water that came down. When we talk about damage, the schools, Broward County Public Schools, were closed here today. And the schools say that, in their initial assessment, which, by the way, did include about 30 schools, $2 million in that preliminary assessment when it comes to the damage that this took -- the toll that this took on Broward County here in South Florida. So, a lot of good news, in the sense that the rain has stopped, the water is receding, but there could be more rain.
