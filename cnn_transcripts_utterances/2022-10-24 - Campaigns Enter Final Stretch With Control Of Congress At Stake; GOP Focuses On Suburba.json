The President predicts that's something that could happen. He's trying to frame things as a choice, between Democrats and Republicans, not a referendum on the Biden administration and Democratic control of Congress. That would be fighting against history. A tide of history that traditionally sees the president and the incumbent party in their first midterm take pretty steep losses.

It will be critical to the push ahead, a push that will include the President getting out a little bit more and the country making some campaign stops as well as some official stops to tout what the administration has done on the policy side of things, some of the major legislative wins.

He grew up in Chattanooga, Tennessee and he was always talking about how he loved his mother, his family. He had a lot of brothers and sisters. I remember first discovering Leslie, of course, on Will &amp; Grace, where he played Beverley Leslie. He won an Emmy Award for that role on the show. He's also talked about how he - came out as LGBTQ, how he came out as gay and that for a while it caused some tension with him and himself because he was grappling with his very religious upbringing. And he's talked also in the past and previous interviews about his struggle with addiction and alcoholism, but always looking to teach and to tell others about how he overcame personal obstacles in his own life and, yes, the fun, sweet, endearing videos that we all came to know and love during the COVID 19 pandemic. And in those videos, he would talk so often about his mother and his family, and God and religion. He also loved music. He brought - released a gospel album, not too long ago. He was a judge on The Masked Singer. I mean, also let me point out because he was a busy guy, currently, he was on a TV show called Call Me Kat.

But Victor, Bianna, in the short term, you have kids dealing with mental health and behavioral issues and a lot of teachers burned out in schools that are understaffed. And so some experts think the problems that these test results illustrate may not be resolved for years.",

It struck me to hear Secretary Cardona call this a wakeup call, because I did cover education during COVID and every single expert I spoke with said that COVID only exacerbated a problem that already existed, whether it's teacher shortages, whether it's low scoring tests for students, so is it fair to call this a wakeup call?",

We know how devastating the pandemic was for all kids. We know the kids that were the furthest behind got hit the hardest and we can't afford to wait years, we need a year-long sprint between this fall and next fall coming back to school on an individual basis, child by child, to do everything we can to help them catch up.This is about whether they're going to graduate from high school eventually, this is about whether they're going to be able to get a good job eventually and I worry about our democracy framing at the edges if we don't give every child a chance to fulfill their true academic and social potential. So the stakes here couldn't be higher, the sense of urgency couldn't be higher.",
