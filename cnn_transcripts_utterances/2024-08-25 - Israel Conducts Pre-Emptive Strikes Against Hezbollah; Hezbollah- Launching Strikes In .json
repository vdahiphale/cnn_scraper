      "sentences": "Hello and welcome to our viewers in the United States and all around the world. I'm Michael Holmes. We continue our breaking news coverage from the Middle East and word of what Israel describes as pre-emptive strikes against Hezbollah targets in Lebanon. A short time ago, the Israeli military said it hit Hezbollah militants just as they were preparing to fire rockets and missiles into Israel.It also added that about 200 rockets were launched from Lebanon towards Israel after Israel had struck. While Hezbollah later said it's carrying out its attacks in response to the recent killing of its top military commander by Israel in July, the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is attending a security Cabinet meeting. OK. I'm joined now by Ben Wedeman in Beirut and Jim Sciutto in Tel Aviv. Jim, to you first. What are you hearing about, the intelligence about why Israel struck first?",

      "sentences": "Israel is saying that they detected movements, preparations for a more extensive Hezbollah attack on Israel, more extensive than the cross border fire we have witnessed over the last days, weeks and months, going back to October 7. It's a daily event, but that they had intelligence indicating Hezbollah was planning something bigger, and therefore took pre-emptive action to strike some of those firing positions, missile firing positions, drone firing positions, et cetera.I'm told by the IDF that its operations are still underway, that dozens of Israeli Air Force aircraft have been taking part in these operations, striking multiple targets inside southern Lebanon. And interestingly, the IDF putting out a statement to residents in southern Lebanon that Hezbollah, the IDF says is firing from positions close to civilian homes, and that people there should be on alert, that Israel is going to be firing back at those positions. I should note that just in the last several minutes, it's our understanding that the Tel Aviv International Airport, Ben Gurion Airport, is now open again for a time. Over the course of the last couple of hours, all incoming and outgoing civilian flights were suspended due to the threat and due to those Israeli military operations, but those flights are now going again. The number, as you said, Michael Holmes, some 200 rockets, drones, et cetera, fired into northern Israel from Lebanon. That is a much higher pace than we've seen over the course of the last several days and weeks. 200 in a couple of hours as compared to perhaps 100 in a 24- hour period. So the rate of fire from southern Lebanon into northern Israel certainly has -- has ticked up, and that perhaps informs the -- the assessment that Israel made. But also the statement that Hezbollah has now put out. And Ben, I know, has more details on this, saying that it is now beginning its revenge or retaliation for Israel's assassination earlier -- earlier this summer. But I think you could take that the fact that the airport is now open here in Tel Aviv as a sign that the threat somewhat mitigated. But in the northern part of Israel, as we understand it, they are closing roads. There are still alerts, and we heard a short time ago the first injury from these strikes that a civilian injured in the town of Akker just north of Haifa.",

This is the second statement within the last hour coming out from Hezbollah, saying that in the first stage of their response to the killing in late July of a senior Hezbollah military commander, they've fired at least 320 missiles in -- in addition to an unknown number of attack drones as well.It appears that -- and they also mention a major military target that they said they successfully struck. What we're seeing is that it appears that, I mean they say they've conducted 11 separate strikes on targets in Israel, and that the focus of the strikes, in the initial phase of their response, is on barracks and other Israeli military positions. It appears mostly in the north of the country, as well as targets within the Israeli occupied Syrian Golan Heights. So the actual targets they appear to be firing at are not out of the ordinary in terms of the focus of their attacks, what we've seen going back to the eighth of October of last year, is that they're very concentrated on those Israeli military positions near the border with Lebanon. And now we -- I'm also seeing reports in Lebanese media that at least 10 separate places have been struck this morning so far in these Israeli air strikes. No word at this point of casualties. Of course, it's important to remember that as many as -- rather more than 100,000 Lebanese who used to live in the South have left those areas. I've been down there. Many of those towns and villages are largely abandoned, although there are some areas where people remain. So certainly, the fear is that this is, as Hezbollah said, this is the first stage of their response, and now we'll just have to wait to see what the second stage brings.",

It's good to see you. What do you expect to come in the hours and perhaps days ahead? I mean, in the past, we've seen strike, restrike, restrike, and then stop. Or the risks, of course are escalation? AVI MAYER, FORMER EDITOR-IN-CHIEF, THE JERUSALEM POST: Well, Michael, that's exactly right. We, of course, hope that this is the end of this round of fighting. As we know, there have been hundreds of Hezbollah rockets and drones that have been sent into Israel over the past couple of hours, but they've said this is only the first bout of what they call their response to the killing of their military commander in Beirut. So of course, the potential here is for a significant escalation, perhaps even an unintended one, as my predecessor mentioned earlier on. All it takes is an errant missile hitting some civilian infrastructure, killing a large number of civilians in Israel and that would, of course, necessitate a very, very harsh Israeli response. So of course, we're very hopeful we don't get to that point, but there's certainly a danger that we might.",

But of course, that's not something that necessarily Israel will be able to control. As I said, all it takes is for Hezbollah to significantly ramp up its attacks, to escalate in a meaningful way, and then you'll be in an all-out conflict, and that would be very hard to control at that point.",

It appears as though that was not the case, that in fact, Hezbollah had been planning a wide scale attack this morning, which was thwarted, of course, by Israel's attack.Now we don't know whether that will, in itself, cause today's round of negotiations to be postponed, canceled.

Thanks so much there in Jerusalem for us.OK, CNN Military Analyst, Colonel Cedric Leighton joins me now to talk more. Cedric, what's your bird's eye view of this Israel acting pre- emptively hitting Hezbollah targets first? COL. CEDRIC LEIGHTON, CNN MILITARY ANALYST: Yeah, I think Michael, one of the key factors of this was the intelligence part of this. When the Israelis decided to conduct this operation, they were clearly looking at what amounted to imminent threat warning data, and they felt that they needed to act pre-emptively, and so this is what you see now. Of course, Hezbollah was ready to respond. They were ready to, first of all, attack Israel. When that was thwarted by the Israeli air attacks, they were still able to launch some 300 missiles, as was mentioned earlier. So what we see here is basically the Israelis moving forward with a very robust intelligence capability, coupled with their willingness to use their military in a pre-emptive fashion. And this is something that they've done historically, but it, of course, is one of those situations that is very -- at a very acute moment when it comes to the hostage negotiations as well as the overall tensions in the Middle East. So the next thing that we have to watch out for, in my view, is what the Iranians are going to do, and whether or not that's going to tip the balance one way or the other when it comes to what's next for the Middle East, whether it's a further conflict that continues in the way. It's been going -- or it goes it gets worse and there's a major conflagration, or there's a relaxation of some tensions in this case. Hezbollah, of course, has tens of thousands of rockets and missiles and drones. And as we were discussing with Ben Wedeman, not all of them are in southern Lebanon, far from it.

If they do that, then, of course, tensions would dramatically increase and the next stage of this is something that we really can't ascertain now.But if Hezbollah wanted to do this, they could move some of their 150,000 or so rockets and missiles into a position where they could fire them in a fairly sequential order, and then try to overwhelm these Israeli air defense systems like the Iron Dome and David's Sling and the Arrow system.",

If the Israelis miscalculate and draw in another party like the Iranians or Hamas, Hezbollah and some of the militias in Iraq that are currently in Iraq and Syria as well as the Iranians, get together and do something, that could potentially cause some significant issues for the Israelis.But the biggest risk is really what we're talking about as a two front or even a three front war that the Israelis would be forced to fight. That would mean fighting Hamas in Gaza, Hezbollah in Lebanon and Iran over a fairly long distance, and that is the kind of threat that, of course, would tax the Israeli defense system, not just the air defense system, but their entire military in a way that would be very hard for them to deal with.

Israel says the barrage of some 200 rockets came from Lebanon Sunday morning, with air defenses working to intercept them. Hezbollah puts the number much higher, over 300 they say they fired. All of this happening after Israel conducted what it called a pre-emptive strike in Lebanon earlier, saying it hit Hezbollah militants just as they were preparing to fire missiles and rockets into Israel.The Tel Aviv airport was temporary closed, but flights have since resumed, while the residents of the Golan Heights, the occupied Golan Heights, have been told to stay in shelters for now. I'm joined now by retired U.S. Army Major General Mark MacCarley, it's good to see you, sir. What do you think Israel's strategy was in striking first, and without Hezbollah having launched that major attack, there has been the tit for tat, of course, for weeks and months, but they hadn't launched that major attack. Is there a risk in striking first? MARK MACCARLEY, U.S. ARMY MAJOR GENERAL (RET): I'll answer the first part of your question. A pre-emption in a pre-emptive strike is truly characteristic of Israeli IDF, war fighting, it was demonstrated as far back as 1967 in that particular conflict in which the (inaudible) and in the context of today, in which the Hezbollah has such a significant number of missiles and other weapons systems, it would behoove if in fact one of us were the tactical commander, it would behoove us to strike and eliminate as many of those particular projectiles, those missiles, as possible if in fact you were sitting in the Command Headquarters of the IDF. The real risk, as we discussed last week, is that the Iron Dome this sort of euphemism for multiple number of layered air defense systems in Israel that Israel possesses, the biggest risk is that that system would be overwhelmed. So with that taken into consideration, it makes all sorts of tactical sense for Israel the IDF to strike, knock out as many as possible, and then wait for this somewhat degraded avalanche of weapons attack, which you've just seen in the last couple of hours.",

Maybe there's communication, but not such that would suggest that Iran would immediately respond in another three or four hours with its own launching of multiple rocket systems on Israel. But that threat exists, and that's why you got a statement out of the IDF headquarters a couple of hours ago.

Hezbollah could come back with further attacks that would -- Israel would then respond to. And the other big issue is Iran, and how Iran responds to this. If Iran stands back and does nothing as Hezbollah is being attacked by Israel, then they will lose credibility in the eyes of Hezbollah, and that could weaken Iran's influence in the region. So I suspect that what we're in for is the possibility that Iran could decide at some point to enter this conflict, and then you have that escalatory cycle going up to a wider Middle East regional war.",

The Israelis will be watching what the Iranians are doing veryclosely, and if they see any evidence whatsoever of an Iranian preparation to launch attacks on Israel, then it wouldn't surprise me if Israel pre-empted against Iran as well, because they will not want to see a combination of Iran and Hezbollah and these militias, as you mentioned in Iraq and Syria, launching simultaneous attacks that overwhelm Israeli integrated air and missile defenses, and these the U.S. dimension is the other important one. Obviously, the U.S. has deployed significant forces into the region to help defend Israel against a large attack.

They can't afford to allow Iran to inflict massive damage on Israel. But at the same time, the U.S. can't afford to be dragged in on a large scale conflict. They will defend themselves very obviously, you know, but at the same time, they won't want to get into the point whereby they're firing Netanyahu's shots for him.

What we saw over the last hour, hour and a half, was the firing ofabout 350 rockets towards the north. Those are areas that have pretty much come under most of the Hezbollah rocket and drone attacks over the last 10 months. Many of those, about 200 or so, were said to have been intercepted by the IDF.

Hezbollah has said it would stop it's attacks. Iran we know has been waiting and has not yet attacked for the killing of Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran, also last month which it blames on Israel, the Hamas leader who was killed in that IRGC guest house. So this deal if reached has really the potential to deescalate the entire region.

It just fought against Hamas in Gaza or just against Hezbollah in the north or just against Palestinian insurgents and terrorist groups in the West Bank. Today all of these proxies that Iran has including other Houthis in Yemen and Shia militias in Iraq and Syria, they are all connected as one and if you fight a war with one, you are potentially fighting a war with all and we would all remember Michael, in April, it was April 13 when Iran launched 350 ballistic missiles, cruise missiles and drones at Israel.So this is one big enemy that Israel is fighting against and therefore the assumption always needs to be now for the IDF that when it fights with one, it is fighting with all. And therefore a wider war with Hezbollah will almost definitely mean that we will likely see rockets and missiles and potentially drones that are going to launched from Iran also at Israel. So Israel has to always keep that into consideration that when it fights with one of these enemies it actually has to be prepared for war and with all the different fronts, with all of the different enemies at the same time.",

It's huge, and it is, you know, it's very difficult to quantify, because all you need is one miscalculation before hell breaks loose.Going back to your original and first question. Look, we're now inside an escalatory process. It's like a vicious circle. Now Israel is awaiting to see what Hamas -- what, I'm sorry, what Hezbollah is going to do. That depends on the scope and the type of targets. Are they civilian centers? Are they just military targets? Are they deep inside Israel, or are they limited to military bases or military installations in the north? If that is the case, then Israel will retaliate in a restrained way. If civilian targets are hit and there are civilian casualties, then you have to assume and imagine that Israel will retaliate more massively, and that's how the vicious cycle works. Look, this has been -- we've had this discussion on your show, Michael. This has been in the making for a full month now. I mean, ever since the two assassinations, one in Beirut and one in Tehran.

There was apparently no reason, no, no substantive reason for Hezbollah to join in.And Israel, according to most Israelis, that's how they feel. Israel has been pretty much restrained and mellow in how it responded to constant harassment and over 6000 rockets and missiles and drones fired at it. So people are frustrated with that. At the same time, they have a sense that Mr. Netanyahu has been seeking actively, proactively seeking escalation from the outset, that he never accepted the American equation, according to which a ceasefire in Gaza would lead to de-escalation.
