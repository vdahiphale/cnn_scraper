The Arizona Supreme Court reinstating a Civil War era abortion law the bans nearly all abortions in the state. It includes just one exception for the life of the mother. Arizona's Democratic Governor Katie Hobbs vowing to fight the ruling. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV. KATIE HOBBS (D) ARIZONA:  Well, Arizonans across the state are reeling from this decision that reinstates the most draconian ban in the country. This is a ban that as you said, was passed in 1864, before we are a state, before women had the right to vote, and it is a near-total ban with no exceptions for rape or incest. It requires prison time for doctors. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Fifty-fifty could easily go either way, Republicans very much hoping to take it back, and it could hinge on this race in Arizona between Ruben Gallego and Kari Lake.So, Kari Lake, the Republican, very Trumpian figure, if we remember back to how she conducted her politics last time how much he was running for governor. She writes this: I wholeheartedly agree with President Trump. Okay. A personal issue that should be determined by a state and her people. But then she says, I opposed today's ruling. I'm calling on Katie Hobbs, a Democrat, and the state legislature to come up with an immediate common sense solution that Arizonans can support. I think it's worth noting here that there is a 15-week ban in place that has exceptions in Arizona. So there is what many politicians will refer to as a middle ground solution on this. What does it tell you that Kari Lake is taking this position on this?",

And she had previously endorsed this near-total abortion ban back in I believe it was 2022.Now, she's turning around and moderating her voice. And this is something that we've seen. Its a common theme that we've seen throughout this Arizona Senate race in general, both Ruben Gallego and Kari Lake trying to be more of a moderate voice. But particularly on abortion, it shows that Republicans are nervous about how this is going to affect turnout at the ballot box, how it's going to affect ultimate results. I mean, we saw it in 2022. Everyone spoke about that red wave that was going to calm Republicans, were going to pick up a number of seats in the House and the Senate that didn't happen because better-than-expected results from Democrats blunted that red wave largely in part because of the Dobbs decision which overturned Roe v. Wade. Now this abortion politics is a winning message for Democrats. They know how to run on it. They know what brings them results. Republicans, I think the fact that is back in the news, Arizonans going to have one of those ballot initiatives to try to enshrine abortion rights come November, Republicans are nervous that once again, this could upend their momentum.",

It's happened in California, Michigan, Ohio, Kentucky, and Kansas. And if we can get that, we can show you. Now, this is the one that has kind of shows across the country, the state of play for each of these states. But there is another one, there it is, that will show you -- so, the light blue is where people rejected a measure to restrict rights and the darker blue is where it was explicitly protected. And you'll notice that states on this map include Kansas, Kentucky, Ohio, which has historically swing has not been a swing state lately. So what does this tell you about the possibility for the ballot initiative in Arizona, which has become a very purple state?",

And, of course, turnout doesn't just matter for that ballot initiative, but it'll matter if you get more Democrats voting, that could help President Biden, that could help Ruben Gallego, that can help with all these down-ballot races.So when you put this balance sheet of on the ballot, and up for grabs come November that could galvanize a lot of Democratic voters. Again, it's the dynamic that we saw back in November. So I think that a lot of Democrats, while they're not happy with the substance of the ruling yesterday, of course, they don't want to see abortion -- abortion rights being curtailed politically speaking, this is going to give them the momentum and its going to be able to supercharge their messaging as we get closer to November.",

There is a state with a ban that is literally from the Wild West, and the Civil War era. For Trump himself, what does this mean? Because on the one hand saying -- he didn't say one way or the other in that video, whether he would or wouldn't sign a national abortion ban. But that saying you'll sign a national abortion ban hands a gift to Democrats. And in this case, you can hold up an example of, hey, this is what a state would do.

He said that whatever states decide, that'll be the land of the states, essentially endorsing those rulings. And Democrats, the Biden campaign beforehand were already pointing out those states and those specific rulings and decisions in those states. Now they're going to do it even more with this Civil War era law now on the books. Of course, there's the 14-day waiting period to see if there'll be some appeals.",

If Israel is not going to partner with the Palestinian Authority and moderate Arab states to create different governance in Gaza and create conditions for normalizing relations with Saudi Arabia, Israel needs to get its hostages back, and the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, get out of Gaza, have a new election and do a deep rethink. Please, Israel, do not get sucked into Rafah and permanently occupy Gaza. It will be a disaster. This is an interesting reminder to me of the state of play before October 7, which was that Saudi Arabia was on the brink of signing this normalization agreement with Israel. Israel was potentially occupying a very different place in the region, and on the world stage. What's your view of the implications of all of this?",

And then broadly what happens after all of this and whether or not cheap stay within Israel, for example Saudi Arabia will obviously have a say as a major Arab country in what of structure should be rebuilt their, and it'll be really important one for Saudi Arabia to be working with Israel.So that was a really important piece of progression and the Middle East, the wider Middle East peace process but there are two different elements here. The long-term, the short-term, and the short-term challenges we spoke about yesterday for Netanyahu, is that the extreme right insist that he does go into Rafah, or they will topple its government.",
