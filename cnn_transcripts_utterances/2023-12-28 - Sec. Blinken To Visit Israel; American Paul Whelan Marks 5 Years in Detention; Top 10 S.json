She's kind of walking that line a little bit.And I think it's kind of hard when you're Nikki Haley because one of your pitches is that you're more electable, that you can curry more favor in a general election. But to get there, you have to get through a Republican primary base that's very much in the thrall of Trump and has a pretty narrow consensus on a lot of these issues. I think this is kind of another example of her trying to find her way to a path to victory that's going to be really tricky for her.",

Hezbollah - Iran-backed Hezbollah now confirming that it carried out a shelling across the border, targeting what it says to be Israeli positions on the border, a village nearby the border region. This, they say, in response to airstrikes carried out by the Israeli military on the southern border of Lebanon. The Israeli military did confirm on Wednesday it had carried out an airstrike, they say, targeting Hezbollah positions near the border. The Lebanese national news agency on Wednesday confirming that three people had been killed and, according to Hezbollah, at least one of those killed was a Hezbollah fighter. But, of course, we have been hearing those fresh warnings from Israeli officials, including a war cabinet member, Benny Gantz, who has said that time is running out for a solution to this unfolding crisis. And, in fact, the Israeli foreign ministry has warned that while time is running out, they are looking at two possible solutions here, a political solution or a military solution.
