Sources are also saying that today's release is happening with the help of officials from Qatar who were involved in the other release as well, as well as Egypt this time.CNN Chief National Security Correspondent, Alex Marquardt, joins us with some of the details along with CNN Anchor, Kaitlan Collins. Kaitlan, let's start with you. What exactly do we know? Obviously, we have some information that we are not giving out until all of this is confirmed because this is still a very fluid situation. They are not in Israel, is my understanding.",

      "sentences": "Right. It's an incredibly fluid situation and so we are holding off on some of the details while we run those down because this is a very sensitive situation. We want to make sure we get everything completely right.But what we do know is that two more hostages have been released by Hamas. We are told - I'm told that they're not actually in the custody of the Israeli government yet, but that they are on the way there right now. And so that is part of the sensitivity around this reporting about these hostages, obviously, given their situation. But this is significant. I am told that they are both two female hostages that have been released. They, of course, would be only the third and the fourth hostages in total to be released of the hundreds that we do believe, according to the IDF, that Hamas has in their custody at this moment. And so what we are still trying to figure out, Anderson, is whether or not they are dual citizens. We do know they are Israeli citizens, but maybe they have dual nationalities, as we've seen with a lot of these hostages and the people who were abducted by Hamas. So those are details that we are still trying to figure out. But it does appear that this came about from some quiet mediation that was happening behind the scenes with the Egyptian and Qatari governments that have been obviously playing a really significant role in trying to get these hostages released, because Israel has made very clear from all officials that they are not personally negotiating with Hamas for the release of these hostages. And I do think this is a big part of what we are seeing here when it comes to the timing of what everyone is waiting to happen next in Gaza, which is that Israeli ground invasion that we know officials have said and telegraphed quite clearly is expected to come. There have been discussions with U.S. officials, with other government officials about holding off on that until more of these negotiations for these hostages can happen. And so right now, what we are working to confirm is the identities of these two hostages, where exactly they are now. And once they get into the custody of the IDF, which, Anderson, as you know, is what happened with those two hostages last week, they came to the Gaza border. They were then given over to the IDF, who brought them to a military base first in central Israel. That's where they greeted their parents before and having those medical checkups and obviously kind of debriefings of what they've been going through.",

Let's talk about the timing of this. Clearly, Hamas has many captives in their custody. They could release all of them if they wanted to. They are releasing them two by two.

What are your thoughts on hearing this news? KURT VOLKER, FORMER U.S. AMBASSADOR TO NATO: Well, I think that this is a very difficult situation for Israel. The longer this goes on and this is clearly Hamas' strategy, is to drag this out, just a trickle of hostages here and there, harder for Israel to go ahead with a full- scale invasion. And that means that time goes by and increasingly public opinion is trending against Israel in many countries around the world. So this is a Hamas tactic from the beginning, taking the hostages as a way to try to hold off an Israeli full-scale assault.",

Whether that's true or not is unclear. But certainly Israeli officials have said that in past experiences, there have been individuals or families or other groups which have taken hostages, and then they're sort of moved up the chain ultimately to a group like Hamas. Hamas, though, could release all the hostages that they have. There's nothing stopping them.",

Then they can say, oh, well, we don't even control all of them. We're working on it. We need time.It's all part of a positioning of Hamas to try to keep the Israelis from launching that full-scale assault anytime soon. And I think that it could be both ways. It could be that, yes, there were individuals or other groups that also took advantage of the mayhem to go kidnap a few people to see if they can get some ransom or some payment from a higher-level Palestinian terrorist organization. But it also could be that Hamas did this and then distributed these hostages in order to create the very conditions where they can then claim. Well, we can't even get them all right now.

We see through that and we demand all of the hostages back. We are ready to maneuver. We are ready and every minute that goes by, we are more ready, more preparations, more practice and better honing of all of the capabilities.

Hamas bears full accountability and responsibility for the actions, for the atrocities of October 7th, for crossing into Israel, for butchering, and raping, and maiming, and murdering and burning people alive.All of that is on Hamas. They will pay the full price for it. They will be dismantled.

So that's a risk we take. We will get our hands on those Hamas terrorists as well. We're hunting them and we have had quite a lot of successes lately of the last days with tactical commanders. We have a special task force that is interrogating many of those so-called elite Hamas forces, Nukhba. Many of them were apprehended in Israel. They are being interrogated by the ISA and the live intelligence that is extracted is helping us in targeting the whereabouts of those that were able to get back to Gaza. And that has led to quite a lot of successful strikes on their whereabouts. We continue with that. None of them will end this war alive.",

I've been here since 2011 with Speaker Boehner. We had a number of people who defected from Speaker Boehner when they said they were going to support him. So I don't think it's that important. It'd be nice. But I do think we have to have a strong majority supporting our candidate, because if we just have a - barely supported candidate and another candidate who's close, then it makes it more difficult to get 217 votes.
