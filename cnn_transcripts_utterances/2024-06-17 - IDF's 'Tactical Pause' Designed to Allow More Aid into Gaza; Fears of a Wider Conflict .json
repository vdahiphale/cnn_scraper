(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MAHMOUD ABDEL JAWAD, PALESTINIAN IN GAZA (through translator): As you know, the Eid is for all Muslims. And for us, it is sacrificing animals to shed blood. But this Eid, there isn't any sign of that. Rather than sacrifice animals, now, we sacrifice ourselves. We sacrifice our own bodies, but there's no Eid celebrations in Gaza. (END VIDEO CLIP) HOLMES: The death toll in Gaza is now more than 37,300, according to Gaza's Ministry of Health. The tactical pause ordered over the weekend created confusion at the highest levels of Israel's government, one source telling CNN the prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, was unhappy when he first heard about it, until he was assured that the fighting in Rafah will continue.

Mired in what appears to be an unwinnable war in Gaza, Israel has vowed to turn its military might on Hezbollah. Earlier this month, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited the border, saying, \"We are prepared for very strong action in the North.\" But the Iranian-backed group is by far the most formidable, battle- hardened foe Israel has faced on its borders since the 1973 October War. After its guerillas forced Israel to pull out of South Lebanon 24 years ago in 2006, Hezbollah fought Israel to a standstill, although the war left parts of Beirut and much of Southern Lebanon in ruins. Retired Lebanese Army Brigadier General Elias Hanna knows the militant group well. BRIG. GEN. ELIAS HANNA (RET.), LEBANESE ARMY: Hezbollah is an exclusive club: well-disciplined, monitored, and they have, which is the most important issue, the charismatic leader. WEDEMAN (voice-over): Since October, Israeli strikes have killed more than 300 Hezbollah fighters, including last week, high-ranking Commander Taleb Abdullah, given a hero's farewell in Beirut. At the funeral, senior Hezbollah leader Hashem Safieddine warned, \"We will increase our operations in intensity and force, in quantity and quality.\" Analysts believe Iran has provided Hezbollah with an arsenal of sophisticated, long-range missiles capable of reaching Tel Aviv and beyond. Until now, Hezbollah has mostly limited its strikes to military targets along the rugged, mountainous frontier, hitting Israel's extensive network of surveillance posts. It also says it has taken out an Iron Dome battery, the backbone of Israel's missile defenses, and has used ground-to-air missiles to shoot down three top-of-the-line Hermes 900 drones, in the process, forcing tens of thousands of Israelis to flee their homes in the North. Hezbollah is learning faster than Israel can adapt, says Hanna.",

And I'm wondering, where do you rank that bunker shot at the very last moment? BRYSON DECHAMBEAU, U.S. OPEN CHAMPION: That bunker shot at the very last was possibly my best golf shot in my entire life. I didn't know that practicing those 50-yard bunker shots when I was a kid would have brought me to this point at Pinehurst No. 2 to one, my second U.S. Open, but sure enough, it did, and couldn't be more proud.",

You told me earlier in the week, though, that you know, three years ago, the landscape was very different for you and that you could have handled things differently.Compare that to that euphoria and the warmth you felt all weekend at Pinehurst.",

And I can't thank them enough, because without them, I wouldn't be here.And it's been a long road, but I'm certainly very blessed and thankful to have those individuals sticking with me and continuing to push me forward.",
