An uneasy calm in Russia right now after an extraordinary 36 hours that saw an armed insurrection led by the head of the mercenary, Wagner Group, Yevgeny Prigozhin. His whereabouts are unknown right now after the Kremlin said he struck a deal to stand down. The agreement allows Prigozhin to be exiled to nearby Belarus and have all criminal charges in Russia against him dropped. Prigozhin's news service tells CNN that he will answer questions when he has proper communication. And in a dramatic announcement late yesterday, the combative head of the Wagner Group said, his troops would turn around after coming within just 125 miles from Moscow. (BEGIN AUDIO CLIP) YEVGENY PRIGOZHIN, WAGNER GROUP (through translator): Therefore, realizing all the responsibility for the fact that Russian blood will be shed from one of the sides, we turn our columns around and leave in the opposite direction to the field camps according to the plan.

Now, I think that really what is emerging on the streets in Russia is a very carefully controlled media reaction with people doing vox pops on the streets; very, very careful about what they say. This is an authoritarian regime that does not brook any criticism, and yet it is dealing with something very fundamental, which is the leader of a mercenary organization launching an insurrection, a rebellion on the premise or among the premises was that in the campaign in Ukraine, the invasion of Ukraine by Russia or the special military operation as the Kremlin calls it was conducted under false premises. He is now kind of taking the position of the international community, that is undermining the whole military effort in that country, and that is going to be very critical for Vladimir Putin over the next few days and indeed, much, much longer. His standing with his own military has been undermined. We don't know where Shoigu, the Defense minister is. We don't haven't really heard from Gerasimov, the head of the armed forces, two figures who Prigozhin when he was in Rostov-on-Don demanded to meet in a very aggressive way and has been very, very brutally critical of them from the frontlines in Bakhmut in so many of those video statements that he made. So at the moment, I think the Kremlin is rattled. It is trying to figure out what to do next and breathing in enormous sigh of relief that this has not metastasized, at least not yet -- Wolf.",

      "sentences": "Well, it was a surprise to many across the administration, Wolf, whether that's the White House or in the military or over in Congress. This was surprising on a number of different levels -- the speed with which it happened, when it happened, and the sheer audacity of Prigozhin trying to challenge the Russian military and perhaps, political leadership.But we're also told, Wolf, that it was less of a surprise to the intelligence community; that this was something that they knew was in the works, they knew was a significant possibility. They were tracking this and in fact, we are expecting something like this to unfold. Intelligence analysts, we are told from multiple sources, saw a buildup of troops, of equipment, of weaponry. They saw that moving. Now remember, Wolf, Wagner had just pulled out of the battle for Bakhmut, which they've been waging for months. And so, intelligence analysts here in the US were seeing that movement towards Russia, and it got to the point where intelligence officials just a couple of days ago, I'm told, in the middle of the week, they briefed the Gang of Eight in Congress, those are the most senior leaders of both chambers of Congress. They also, among them, are also the heads of the intelligence committees. So this was something that the intelligence community did believe was imminent. And then when it was launched, Wolf, there was an expectation that there would be a lot more resistance that those Wagner forces faced on their march towards Moscow, that they would run into the professional Russian military, that there would be forces from the FSB, the internal security services, that there would be border guards who would come out and meet them and try to fight with them. I'm told from a US official earlier today that there was an assessment that there would be a lot more violence and a lot more bloodshed, that this was going to be a bloody battle. Of course, Wolf, that did not happen. So there was real surprise that there was not more resistance. There was real surprise that this deal was brokered, allegedly by the president of Belarus, Alexander Lukashenko. And so this really has come to quite a stunning end, Wolf. So now the intelligence community, the national security officials here in Washington, really trying to figure out why is it that Prigozhin stopped this march, when it really appeared that he had the upper hand? Why was this deal struck? And what if anything, did Prigozhin get out of it -- Wolf.",

This is a domestic dispute, we don't want any part of this.Every US official I spoke with, every diplomat I spoke with made the point that we are not at all involved. Everyone saw this immediately for what it was, which is the biggest challenge to Putin's leadership since he came into office and none of these countries wanted to give Putin any kind of way to say, oh, this is an effort that is backed by the United States are backed by NATO. The administration really wants to make clear that this was something that Wagner and Prigozhin were doing absolutely themselves. Now, of course, this is something that the United States and NATO would like to see, this challenge to Putin, this fracturing among the Russian military, but they didn't want to give any kind of indication that they had any kind of role here. And then over in Ukraine, there is certainly a sense that there is an opening here for the Ukrainian military, if the Russian military has indeed been weakened, to try to really push forward during this counteroffensive to take advantage of a weaker Russian military, to take advantage of certainly, weaker morale. But you can also imagine, Wolf, that there was almost certainly a message to Kyiv as well from Washington and from other -- from European capitals to not make it look like Ukraine was involved in this either, to not try any of those sabotage acts or cross border attacks at this moment, really let this play out. So this was certainly something that everybody in the pro-Ukraine camp, NATO and the US really wanted to make it look like this was internal Russian squabbling, and just let it play out. Let's sit on the sidelines and watch closely -- Wolf.",

So that's gone up at huge cost to the Russian state. So there was damage, and I think, certainly for the Russians, they would have been very afraid, particularly in Rostov-on-Don, and particularly those in Moscow as well were afraid at these potential clash points could have become very bloody. In the early hours of today, we heard that the Chechen leader, Ramzan Kadyrov, his special forces, were pulling out of Rostov-on-Don, and of course, Kadyrov is a huge pillar, a strong and powerful pillar behind Putin, and he was one of the first to come out yesterday and back Putin. He had sent his special forces into Rostov-on-Don. Look at that heavy fighting equipment that Prigozhin pulled out. Imagine if the elite Chechen forces had gone up against Prigozhin's battle-hardened fighters. The overspill and the potential for civilian casualties would have been huge. And I think people are very aware of how big this could get, yet, you do here in Moscow today, comments from people who felt that perhaps this was all a bit of theater and all a bit stage managed. To me, that makes me realize that they're very much out of touch with the reality because it is often again, that cynicism of Russian leadership and cynicism of what they see on TV because people know that they're being lied to by their leadership. So they don't necessarily trust what they see on the TV, and therefore feel when these events are happening, they may not be quite so real, but then suddenly they are, and of course, people, you know, that's a concern for some people, that they play it down that way.",

Putin's reversal regarding Prigozhin is very interesting, because it, I think, as Ivan has just reported, I think it reflects a weakness in Putin's conduct of the war and generally of the state, because Putin knows that what you don't do is show weakness. And the fact that he did not follow through on his threat to punish Wagner and Prigozhin I think, is a reflection of his inability to do so. It is not the product of some newfound humanity, because look at what he is doing in Ukraine every single day, and how he is forcing Russian conscripts to fight in a World War One trench battle, and of course, he is lobbing missiles into Ukrainian cities.

Staying silent, at least in the part of the president was absolutely the right thing to do. What the US government did publicly was Biden was silent, watchful waiting, while Blinken was out making clear that we were talking and consulting with our allies, which is absolutely the thing to do.

And here is what they've been able to recover up until this point -- the nose of the vessel, the pressurized hull, the front and the back of it. And also these two other debris fields that the remote operating vehicle has been scanning. Another interesting thing that we have learned, Fred is that the company that is operating Odysseus 6000 has been using its heavy lifting capabilities. So we want to know whether or not they have been able to recover any additional debris and hopefully the Coast Guard will be able to provide more information on that. This debris that's being recovered is going to be critical to the investigation, which the Canadian Transportation Board has said that they are conducting.

Officers come to the scene and they decide that they're going to charge her with defacing property because she is potentially putting the lives of others at risk. But she runs into her apartment, she locks the doors. Officers tried to confront her and get her to come out. She grabs a hammer though, she is very frightened, but what you're going to see in the next couple of seconds, Fredricka are portions of the body camera video. She has the hammer, you'll hear an unsettling exchange of words between the woman and an officer and then two volleys of gunfire when the woman who has the hammer is near her window. Just watch what happens over the next 20 seconds. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Your affiant does not believe a reasonable officer in light of the same facts and circumstances would have felt compelled to use deadly force.\" These officers are now all out on bond and they have a preliminary hearing a month from now -- Fred.",

Thanks so much for joining us for this special CNN coverage.We're following developments out of Russia after an extraordinary 36 hours that saw an armed insurrection led by the head of the mercenary Wagner Group, Yevgeny Prigozhin. We will have more on that in just a bit. But first, moments from now, in Boston, the US Coast Guard is holding a press briefing on the investigation on the Titan submersible implosion. We'll take that live as it happens. Meantime, CNN's Gloria Pazmino is live for us in St. John's, Newfoundland. So Gloria what is expected from this presser?",
