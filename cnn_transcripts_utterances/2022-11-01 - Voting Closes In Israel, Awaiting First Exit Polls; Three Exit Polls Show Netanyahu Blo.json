Now what we're hearing from our sources is that this does seem to be where the trend is heading. And really notably, Richard, from these initial results that we are hearing from our sources is the rise of the far-right, that this far-right party, one of whose leaders was once convicted for inciting racism and supporting terrorism, really known as a far right settler extremist, that his party, that he may have as many more than 12 to 15 votes.",

And as the pollsters, start counting more numbers, because keep in mind, there is a threshold that the parties have to pass before they can even be counted. And if a party, a small party suddenly passes that threshold, that can completely change the balance, especially when we're talking about one or two seats, which is essentially where we're seeing Netanyahu standing at 61 or 62 from these exit polls. If one small party makes it through that could bring him down, possibly, but we are seeing a trend. So far, it seems as though from the three networks is that Netanyahu and his allies will potentially have those numbers to form a government. We will not get the official numbers, the official vote count for several days. But if this trend continues, if all of the official results, follow the exit poll results, it does seem as though Netanyahu will get the mandate to form a government and if these numbers hold, he will come back to the Prime Minister once again becoming the longest serving Prime Minister in Israeli history.",

And now I understand all three exit polls, and they have a fairly good history and precedent of getting it right, are all saying 61 for Netanyahu and the significance here, I think, Hadas, and correct me if I'm wrong, is that they're not saying 60 Even Stevens, they're saying 61, which is a majority.",

But I think what's really notable what we're really looking out of these results, as much as it is about Benjamin Netanyahu and his party and/or what Yair Lapid's party got is the rise of that far-right party. How many votes are they going to get? Because that could potentially put them as the third largest party in the Israeli government. What does that mean? What kind of ministerial positions will these people have? These are people potentially that will have ministerial positions that like I said, were once convicted for inciting racism.

The feeling I have, to tell you, Richard is so much different tonight. It does feel like it's going to be much more celebratory and likely part of what he has to thank for all of this, if it does turn out to be true that he does have the votes in order to become Prime Minister is that higher turnout, we were talking about. The fact that this is the highest turnout for Israeli voters since 1999, this despite the fact it's the fifth election in three-and-a-half years.

But look, they do give us a broader look at the trends that may have happened today, during Election Day, it does seem like there may have likely been a surge of right-wing voters to the ballot box, and on the other side of the equation, Arab-Israeli turnout was likely not where it needed to be, especially since there were three independent Arab-Israeli parties running this time around.",

And apparently, we had the highest participation rate. So rather than demonstrating election fatigue or lack of faith in the democratic system, Israelis came in huge numbers to the polls. It is estimated at around 72 percent, and there is only about 90 percent of Israelis in the country. So it's actually de facto close to 80 percent, which is extremely high. It seems, based on the initial figures, that the Ultra-Orthodox community came in record numbers, and they outperformed the figures in the initial surveys, since they belong to the Netanyahu camp, and this probably is the single largest difference and that currently brings the Netanyahu bloc to the 61 or 62 threshold, that should be just about sufficient in order to form a government. But again, those are initial results. And there's one probably major factor that we need to wait for, which is whether a third Arab Party by the name of Balad, whether they're able to cross the threshold. If they will indeed cross the threshold, then Mr. Netanyahu loses majority. So, it's too early to make -- to reach conclusions, but clearly, there is a trend that Mr. Netanyahu just about, with some radical right-wing forces, and a very Ultra-Orthodox Party, he might be able to form a narrow government.",

And with a simple majority of 61, this is quite unique, and if we want to stabilize the system, this needs to change. It's not the reason for the current crisis, but it enabled the crisis. The crisis is very much around Mr. Netanyahu, the fact that he was indicted and nevertheless remained in politics. He has a very strong camp of supporters and he has a very strong camp of Israelis who oppose him. But the fact that we have weaknesses in the electoral system, and a relatively fragile constitutional arrangement, those two systemic features contributed to the crisis and helped extend it.",

And in return, they will demand senior coalition or ministerial positions, they will demand to have grave influence on Israeli policy, but with respect to the Palestinians in the West Bank, but not only also in terms of domestic internal Israeli politics and society.

So, when we actually poll Israelis on the specific initiatives that have to do with undermining the independence of the judiciary, undermining the Attorney General, the independence of the State prosecutor, changing legislation that will make offenses like breach of trust, this is a cluster of pieces of legislation, and that the pro-Netanyahu camp will probably, if he wins, try to initiate in order to relieve Mr. Netanyahu of his trial, and to serve the interests of his coalition partners.

And the way they're looking at the moment, if the exit polls are right, they will be taking place, they will be going into government with Mr. Netanyahu, and they will be of course, the fight over which Cabinet posts, which Departments of government, they take over. One of the biggest challenges for whichever party finally does it and the Israeli Prime Minister, its inflation. Inflation in Israel is 5.2 percent in July, it's a 14-year high. Now, it is down somewhat because of the moves by the Bank of Israel, the Independent Bank of Israel. We had the Governor on QUEST MEANS BUSINESS only recently talking about that. The benchmark interest rate is at two and three quarter percent. That's the highest in a decade. In a recent survey, once again, cost of living was the top issue of nearly half of Israeli voters because the one thing about Israel, although there's certainly a lot of entrepreneurs, internet entrepreneurs, and there are a lot of extremely wealthy people with second homes in Israel, there's also a great deal of lower middle class poverty and housing prices are through the roof and housing crises has become a staple of everyday life. Jonathan Medved is the entrepreneur and CEO of the crowd funding platform, OurCrowd, he is with me from Jerusalem.

He has been an extraordinary economical leader in Israel, responsible for much of the privatization that happened for the reform of the Tax Code and for a very supportive environment in government for the technology juggernaut, which has pushed Israel's economy forward. So my sense is that while Israel is part of the world economy, and we suffer from inflation, our inflation rates are one half those of the US and Europe, our growth rate is still up at five percent. It is more than twice the average of the developed countries. And in fact, the shekel is so strong -- that is the only traded currency that has actually strengthened against the dollar in the last 10 years. So, I think we're starting from a pretty good position and I'm hoping that the new government, if it's led by Netanyahu, or if it's led by someone else, will help to strengthen that even further.",

Ukraine's air force is warning it currently has no active defenses against such missiles, which could reach across the whole country. Both sides say the battle for Kherson is intensifying as Ukrainian forces are trying to break through Russian lines. Its civilians, of course, caught in the cross fire. Ukraine says, some are being evicted by Russian-backed forces. Nic Robertson is with me. Nic is in Kramatorsk in Ukraine. This is, I mean, we now have more firepower coming from Iran to Russia. This is going to get even more horrific.",

      "sentences": "But the concern is that these new missiles that Russia would get from Iran, some short-range ground to ground missiles, that wereperhaps even more accurate than what they have in their arsenal at the moment. But the bigger concern is if they switch up to a more sophisticated Iranian drone, the Arash 2, it has a longer range. It has better intelligence on board, if you will. This is a drone that can switch targets when it's in the air. The current drone that sort of set it off, it goes to the target and down it comes with a bang if it's not intercepted. But the new, one the Arash 2, could come down with an even bigger bang and it can carry up to five times the amount of explosives. So a more accurate, more sophisticated, a longer range and potentially more deadly munition is what the Ukrainians are concerned that Russia may get with the new tranche of weapons from Iran. And on the front line here, that could make a difference. It would be expected that Russia would use it to target the power supply system across the country as it has been recently, perhaps with more devastating effect though it is has had a lot of effect in the past three weeks. But used along the front line, it would equally, you know, dent Ukraine's ability to push forward. In this area here, where we are in Kramatorsk there, were 14 Russian missiles came down into here in the early hours of this morning in the local town of Bakhmut. Missiles came down there. One civilian was killed. Other towns around here, heavily contested. The Ukrainians feel like they're making a bit of ground on around a key highway here. But again, all of these become harder to achieve and harder to keep if Russia has a more effective arsenal of weapons, such as they could potentially get from Iran.",

At many levels that there is so much corruption in his military and aninability to pass up accurate information up the chain of command, politicians as well, that Putin did not understand the flaws and weaknesses in his military, that he thought had been raised up to a better level over the past decade. So when he went into Ukraine on a false premise that they would be welcomed in, that was wrong; the military wasn't up to the job, got chased out. They expended far more weaponry than he ever anticipated that's in this deep. It's his decision, his political neck on the, line if you will, if he fails. So now he finds himself turning to Iran, when perhaps he never expected. It seems like a war that he's fighting one week at a time, you know, buy weapons from Iran, get conscription going, fill the holes, try to find other ways to replace the weapons that you've lost through the war so far. It really is somewhat ad hoc in some ways.",

I will tell you why, Richard. Protesters that are behind me, those who are blocking the roads throughout the country in the last 24 hours, they listened to the same speech you and I did, Richard. They are saying, that's not what they have heard. They did not hear anyone asking them to stand down and, more to the point, they did not hear anyone conceding this election. Now, yes, it is true; the apparatus of government there will continue. Bolsonaro at least pledged to stay with what he called the parameters, the four corners of the constitution. That's all good news. At issue now, though, is how much more, quite frankly, many Brazilians and the economy can take. Richard, I don't have to remind you what a fragile situation the economy isn't already. We've had supply routes definitely interrupted from this. We've had a little bit of chaos at the Sao Paulo airport. All things that Brazil can get over relatively quickly if these protests come to an end. And that's a question right now. From protesters I've spoken to, they have no really -- there's nothing stopping them, they tell us, from staying out here and continuing to block traffic. They heard Bolsonaro's speech, they say that what they hear in that speech is to continue until he definitively says he accepts the results.",

It will hopefully, in the next few hours, days, weeks, things will come down. And those allies, who have power, who are sitting in positions of power throughout Brazil, will continually say, it is time to move on from what has been an incredibly divisive election. And that this country needs to be able to rehabilitate itself on an economic point of view and clearly from a political point of view, which I have to tell you, Richard, is divided. Not just people in this country, people within families in this country.

The results at the moment do show -- the exit polls, I should say, show Benjamin Netanyahu on the cusp of a return to power in Israel; 62 for his bloc, 54 for the anti-Netanyahu. So with 62, Netanyahu has a majority. Election exit favor polls, the former prime minister winning enough seats, forming a government.
