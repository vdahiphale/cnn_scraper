So the future of getting Israel aid, uncertain here at this key moment as Dem -- Republicans on the opposite sides of their strategy, moving ahead and divisions about whether adding Ukraine to this is -- should be part of the equation, all of which leaves its fate highly uncertain at the -- this moment -- Boris.",

They called for a ceasefire in Gaza. They protested any additional aid for Israel as well.In the Senate, we are seeing a rare display of bipartisan unity as leaders of both parties agree that Israel aid should be part of a larger package that includes Ukraine aid and also border funding. But divisions remain in the House, where new Speaker Mike Johnson wants a stand-alone bill for Israel that does not include any new funding for Ukraine. We have Beth Sanner with us. She is a CNN national security analyst. She's also a former deputy director of National Intelligence. All right, Beth, tell us how you see this if it makes sense, as the speaker is demanding that these funding sources be separated.

I mean, I think we all agree that there's a crisis there then -- that needs to be dealt with as well. And so I think that that practical aspect is very important.But there's also just, you know, U.S. leadership and credibility is at stake here. And this is something that I think actually Americans would understand if it was put to them. Whether the United States is seen as a declining power, which is what China and Russia and all of their friends are putting out there to the whole world and they're getting a lot of traction on that because of our dysfunction at home. And so I think that, you know, showing strength, the Republicans say Biden isn't showing strength. Well, they're actually making it a lot harder for this President to show strength in U.S. leadership, by handling the funding in the way that they are with all these shenanigans.",

But that said, there is a psychological effect here, both for the Ukrainians, but also this very joyous psychological effect that's happening with Putin and Russia and China, that is going to gain a momentum of its own.And we can't also forget that the Europeans and our allies that really depend on U.S. leadership. If we can't come through with this, this is a problem. And as we move closer and closer to the election, it gets harder and harder to pass. The last time this bill came forward in September in the House, 117 Republicans, including Mike Johnson, voted against a -- the bill for Ukraine. And Johnson has voted three times for amendments to limit aid to Ukraine. And so that majority of Republicans in the House it's getting harder and harder to pass these things.",

This camp is -- has been known for many, many years, for decades as a Hamas stronghold.It is where -- it is the birth place of the First Intifada that first Palestinian uprising. And so, you know, Hamas is in that camp. They live in that camp. They are part of the culture of that camp. But not everyone, of course, right. And I'm sure that the civilians there who don't like Hamas were prevented by Hamas from leaving. And so this is just so hard, but I think that the administration, you know, in grappling this, we just have to be so much more forward leaning and protecting civilians because we are losing the global narrative on this war by not being able to say at the same time. Hamas is a terrorist group, did horrible things and we must protect civilians.",

      "sentences": "This weekend, the Commandant of the Marine Corps, General Eric Smith, suffered an apparent heart attack, according to reporting from the \"New York Times.\" The Senate only confirmed Smith for that job late last month -- or last month, I should say, but he's actually been doing two jobs for months. His new one and the old one because his would be deputy hasn't been confirmed.And that is because Republican Senator Tommy Tuberville of Alabama is blocking the Senate from what are usually perfunctory votes of grouped nominations of hundreds of general and flag officers across the military. He says he's doing it because he opposes the Pentagon's abortion travel policy. A policy, by the way, that these Generals and Admirals had nothing to do with adopting, because that's the purview of civilian leaders of the military. Now to be clear, we have no way of knowing that the stress of these demands contributed to General Smith's health emergency, but safe to say it did not help. Smith himself, telling the \"Marine Corps Times\" last month, quote: It is not a sustainable thing when the last thing you do is flip your computer off at 11:30 at night and you're getting up at 5:00 in the morning. General Smith is now receiving care, according to the Marine Corps, as they scramble to fill the void. Because, as I mentioned, Smith does not have a confirmed deputy. The Senate hasn't confirmed an assistant commandant of the Marine Corps -- hat tip, Tommy Tuberville. The senior most general at Marine Corps HQ Lieutenant General Karsten Heckle is now filling in for Smith. And Heckel was already doing two jobs because yet again, Tommy Tuberville holds, according to military.com. So now general Heckle is responsible for what, four jobs. The whole affair actually so confusing that the Marine Corps announced that Heckle would be acting commandant and then had to correct itself and say that Heckel would just be performing the duties of the Commandant. That is not a flex of military strength, at a time when the U.S. is trying to stop the war between Israel and Hamas from ballooning into a broader conflict in the Middle East. When the Pentagon just announced today that the U.S. is sending 300 more service members to the Middle East, as the Marines, the Navy and the Air Force are mobilizing thousands more troops, as well as ships and planes in the region. When you have the proxies of Iran, the country that funds Hamas and Hezbollah and rebels in Yemen attacking American interests, including bases where American troops are stationed in Iraq and Syria 27 times in the last two weeks. In fact, in that time period, the U.S. Carney alone spent nine hours intercepting four missiles. And 15 drones in the Red Sea near Yemen. And there is no commander of the Fifth Fleet responsible for the Middle East. No deputy commander of U.S. Central Command, which overseas the entire region. No deputy commanding general of joint Special Operations Command as U.S. Special Operations Forces are on alert in the region. Some of them involved in advising hostage rescues. And there is no head, we should say, of the Navy or the Air Force as fighter jets deployed to the region. But don't worry, Tuberville says his holds are no big deal. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. TOMMY TUBERVILLE (R-AL): There's no threat to readiness. The people that we need to be really worried about are her colonels and majors and sergeants and privates, they're the people who get ready to fight wars. The people up here in the Pentagon, I don't know what they do every day, but they're more of giving advice. (END VIDEO CLIP)",
