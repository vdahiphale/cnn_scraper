Here is what we know about the suspect: Twenty-two-year-old Anderson Lee Aldrich, police say they found at least two guns inside of the nightclub. They say he used a long rifle. That was as much as they will share about the guns that they found and what they believe he used. The District Attorney there says that they believe that he acted alone. A motive, Jim, though is still unclear. Now of course, people are looking into this as being a potential hate crime because this was an LGBTQIA nightclub. This is a gay nightclub, and we all remember what happened at the Pulse nightclub and the gay club there in Orlando back in June 2016 when 49 people were killed there. So now, we still have questions about the motive, but the District Attorney says they will be pursuing all avenues and likely first- degree murder charges against the suspect who is still alive and in police custody -- Jim.",

They are the refuges we carve out, especially in a world that treats us with hatred and discrimination every time we walk out the door. So, when I heard the news this morning, first, of course, I was heartbroken. Heartbroken for those who will have an empty seat at their Thanksgiving dinner table this week, heartbroken for those that will have a missing stocking from their fireplace, heartbroken for those that had to call parents and tell them that their children were not coming home. And then I was filled with rage and fury, because we've spent the last two plus years being told by right-wing extremists in this country and the politicians who serve at their pleasure that LGBTQ people are a threat that must be contained. And when you pump that kind of dehumanizing, demoralizing rhetoric into the atmosphere, when you supercharge the political environment to make it as hostile as possible toward LGBTQ people, eventually, someone has to pay the price. For these politicians, it may be short- term political gain, but for our community, it comes with real lived consequences. So I'm feeling heartbroken today. My heart goes out to that community and I'm also feeling very angry that we live in a society, in a world, in a country that continues to put LGBTQ people in danger.",

And they discovered that, you know, there may be a path there to build it on the backs, especially of transgender and non-binary people. But for the politicians who have sold out to this agenda of hate, I think it is a couple fold. First of all, they don't have any real policies to run on. They are not solving people's actual problems. They complain about a lot of things, but they don't put real solutions forward, and they are looking for the cheapest, fastest way to help shore up their base, to stir up fervor so they can win future election cycles.

SCOTT GALLOWAY, PROFESSOR OF MARKETING, NYU STERN SCHOOL OF BUSINESS AND COHOST OF \"THE PIVOT PODCAST\": Yes, I was tempted to buy a head of lettuce and do the same thing they did with Prime Minister Truss, and I want to be clear, you know, Twitter will survive in some form, but when you lay off this many people this quickly, it seems to me that there is real collateral damage or there is a nonzero probability you have a fairly significant technical glitch. You're already seeing it kind of on the edges. The site feels a little bit more buggy right now, but yes, I don't -- I just wouldn't be surprised if the site went down. [15:40:10]",

I think you're going to see a bunch of competitors pop up in the next few months, because so many advertisers are looking for an option as are consumers.But yes, it's the agent of chaos. I think you'd rather kill a live puppy on Twitter space and not be the headline every 48 hours and he manages to do it and we take the bait.",

And last night, case in point, Musk restored former President Donald Trump's Twitter account after hosting a poll asking users whether to reinstate it.He used a Latin quote that means the voice of the people is the voice of God. I guess he didn't, maybe the voice of the bots doesn't translate from Latin or into Latin. But I mean, you've spoken about some of these issues before with Musk. He has got a cult following and so on, and then he puts Trump back on. What do you think? What were your thoughts? When you saw that? I guess it was not a shocker.",

We don't know who voted in this poll, and also his polls are kind of like a drunk using a lamppost more for support than illumination.He took a poll around whether he should sell Tesla stock, and then it came out in subsequent filings that he had been selling all along. This was just purely a stunt. And also, Jim, we don't know what this means. We don't know if the account is going to be restored. It is just he said so many things that he goes back on or reverses on. Now, there is some question as to whether Trump can even be on the platform because of his agreement with Truth Social. But again, the key here is that he manages to be in the headlines every 48 hours. The other thing we have to remember is among a small group of influential people, kind of the chattering class in media and in academia, you know, we're addicted to Twitter. I don't know how you feel about it, but I will get off this segment, Jim and the first thing I will do is check Twitter, right? People under the age of 25, Twitter is pretty much irrelevant. I mean, everything from Snap to Instagram to much less TikTok, absolutely dwarf it. So, it gets a lot more attention and heat than the actual size of the landmass here. It's mostly irrelevant to an emerging generation of consumers.",

I remember covering this when his account was suspended. But if you go back and look at the tweets now leading up to I think it was January 8th, it's almost like following the breadcrumbs to the scene of the crime of what happened on January 6, you know, just inciting people, telling them to come to the Capitol and all this stuff about overturning the election results. How dangerous, do you think it is to allow Trump back on Twitter?",

So, I think he's actually less of a threat. But let's be clear, this free speech blather he has been talking about has absolutely no resonance, it is totally illogical. This is the private square, not the public square. If anything, he has reduced free speech and when Trump's account was removed, we saw 30 to 60 percent of election misinformation and disinformation go away overnight. And if you were to look, if you were to take the least moderated platform, 4chan, to the most moderated, TikTok, and then fill out in between with Gettr, Rumble, Parler, Twitter, Instagram, there is a direct correlation between more moderation and growth and profitability. So the notion -- so he is putting him back on the platform, fine. I don't think it's a good business move. I personally am going to enjoy it because I like watching -- I want a front row seat to the continued undoing of the former President, but it's not a responsible thing to do. You're not serving stakeholders of the country by putting -- by massively increasing election misinformation across a platform. That will start the moment this account that Trump is back tweeting misinformation.",

But what's profound is the risk that you might not be able to get a ticket for the Taylor Swift concert. It has been unbelievable how much attention this received.The interesting thing is you referenced what will come out of this, this antitrust scrutiny and that is when Live Nation merged with Ticketmaster in 2010, they consolidated 70 percent of the market. And if you want to understand the power of a monopoly on consumer harm, or how it increases consumer prices, just look at the fees that are added to your ticket, when you check out almost anything, when you're going to a sports game or a concert, they have 70 percent of the market. So while we're focused on Big Tech, there's Big Ag, there's Big Pharma and there's Big Event and that is Live Nation. Seventy percent of a sector this big is just -- you've got to believe that this is going to get the scrutiny it deserves. It should likely be broken up. These fees need to come down and also kind of exhibit number one will be that this company doesn't have a lot of incentive to make the requisite investments in technology, because at the end of the day, we're all going to pile back in on Monday when the site is back up. This is overdue scrutiny across a variety of sectors because the DOJ and the FTC have been asleep at the switch and have forgotten our proud legacy of antitrust.",

It was pretty flat if you had kind of an overview of the Stadium especially with the home team playing so badly. They actually had the ball in the back of their own net after three minutes VAR saved them The goal was ruled out. But Ecuador were up thanks to a penalty after 15 minutes. A terrific opening ceremony here by the way, which was more like an Olympic opening ceremony than a World Cup opening ceremony, which don't tend to be that good, but this one was very well produced. Not such a great night for the home team though, losing two nil to Ecuador and, Enner Valencia scoring ties for the Ecuadorians. This was a game that Ecuador really needed to win. It was their easy game in this group. Their next games are going to be much harder against Senegal and the Netherlands. And so Ecuador, I'm sorry Qatar are becoming the first host nation ever to lose the opening game. Really not a good night for them at all. It looks like we've got the highlights now that we can take a look at. Yes, that was a terrific goal there from Enner Valencia putting the Ecuador side two nil up and that is how this one finished --Jim.",
