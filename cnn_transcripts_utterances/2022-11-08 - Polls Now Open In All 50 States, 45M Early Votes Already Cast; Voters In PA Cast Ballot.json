You will see this line, we've seen people come out and literally go like this cheering that they put their vote in place, we have to be very careful to make sure that we're far enough back because there are very, very good rules just for security to make sure that everyone feels safe and secure voting. But we've heard also from a couple of different students that they were worried about inflation, that that's really affecting their pocketbooks as students.

But history outlines the huge challenge facing Democrats and the president of the United States tonight because if president's first midterm tends to be the more punishing one. Look, this is 435 elections for the House, all of these new lines because of redistricting. But let's just look at where we are now. And again, the map is a little different but the math is about the same right?Republicans need a net gain of five seats. A net gain of five seats would mean speaker Kevin McCarthy replaces speaker Nancy Pelosi. So, let's come forward to look at this map. And then let's look at the history here. If you bring up a president's first midterm, this goes back 40 years to Ronald Reagan. Forgive me if you're turning me back just a second, I want to stretch this out. This goes back to Ronald Reagan. The average in the first midterm for a president to lose 31 House seats, Democrats can only afford to lose four. The average is 31. We'll come back to the Senate in a minute. But remember that the average is two. So, you don't have to keep five, right? You cannot lose five and then look at all these competitive districts, right? That's the challenge for the Democrats. Two competitive seats or coast to coast, Republicans need a net gain of five or half dozen to become the majority. And if you look at these 82 competitive races across the country, you see Democrats on defense in 57 of them, nearly three to one more Democrats on defense in the competitive races which is why when you look at the House history is just not on the Democrat side. And then, Erin, you come over to the Senate. And you know -- so Joe Biden could defy history say and let's say they only lose 10 House seats. Republicans are still in the majority, a good night by historical standards, a bad night for your day-to-day reality, same for the Senate. I said the average in the first midterm is two. Democrats can't afford to lose any. If they lose one, the Republicans are in the majority in the Senate. So, you can beat history defy history and your day-to-day reality come January if you're Joe Biden and the Democrats, will be quite the opposite of what it is today.",
