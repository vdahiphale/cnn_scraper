It was the first time that she has made such a pledge and also notable because this is a policy Former President Donald Trump also supports and has been campaigning on for weeks.

      "sentences": "The White House is voicing serious consternation at this Israeli airstrike in Gaza, saying it makes more urgent the necessity for the ceasefire and hostage deal to bring peace to Gaza. A White House National Security Council spokesman saying in a statement, we are deeply concerned about reports of civilian casualties in Gaza following a strike by the Israel Defense Forces on a compound that included a school. The spokesman goes on to say, we are in touch with our Israeli counterparts who have said they targeted senior Hamas officials, and we are asking for further details.A U.S. official familiar with the matter tells me that Israel has informed the White House that it used smaller munitions in the strike in an attempt to limit civilian casualties. And the spokesman from the White House does acknowledge in this statement that Hamas has a history of using these types of facilities to operate and gather within. But it does say that Israel must take measures to minimize civilian harm. Of course, that has been the message coming from the White House and from President Biden going back several months. It's far from clear that is having any influence on Israel's conduct in this war. That has caused deep tensions between President Biden and the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu. So, far, President Biden has not limited arms sales to Israel. What his intention has been and what his strategy has been is to press both of these sides to come to the table and renew these negotiations to try and come up with a ceasefire that would be paired with the release of hostages in Gaza. He did release a statement last week with the leaders of Qatar and Egypt calling on all sides to come back to the negotiating table next week on August 15th and renew these discussions. Now that President Biden is no longer running for president, this has been an overarching objective of the remainder of his term.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has been steadfast over the last, what, 10 months of fighting that Israel won't be deterred from its war objectives, which are to destroy Hamas' military and governance capabilities, to get the hostages, the living ones and the dead ones, back in Israel, around 115 of them still, about a third of whom are believed to be dead, and also to prevent the Gaza Strip from posing a threat to Israel in the future.So, in that respect I don't think that this strike is going to change anything. That said, perhaps with a nod to some of the international condemnation that has come about as a result of this strike, Israel has pursued a kind of three-pronged strategy here of explaining, naming, and blaming. It has put out three statements. You don't normally get three statements from the IDF on one particular strike. Three statements explaining how it used precision munitions, small munitions and that there was aerial surveillance and intelligence to try to minimize the number of civilian casualties. It took the unusual, though not unprecedented step of very swiftly naming 19 of the two dozen militants it says it killed in that strike. And then among them, it clarified later, they believe was likely to be a senior commander from Islamic jihad. And then finally, is the blaming. Blaming Hamas for using schools and other buildings where civilians are sheltering as a base to store weapons, to launch terrorist attacks, and to use them as command-and- control centers. So, with those three prongs, as I say, perhaps with the not to some of the international condemnation, Israel trying to get its version of events out there. Of course, the other thing, and Kevin was alluding to this, is what impact this may have on ceasefire talks, which is set to resume on Thursday. So, first of all, important to note that Hamas is has yet to issue a statement saying if it will or if it will not attend those talks. The other thing, of course, is, look, this strike isn't going to help those negotiations, but I think we also need to bear in mind that they've been talking on and off for the best part of nine months since the last one and only ceasefire came to an end, and they haven't managed to achieve any breakthroughs. There is an added sense of urgency this time around because there's a slim hope, slim chance that perhaps a ceasefire deal could forestall an Iranian and/or attack by Iran or one of its proxies such as Hezbollah on Israel in retaliation for the killing of a senior Hezbollah commander and also the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran last week. But that is a very slim hope. And certainly, Iran and Hezbollah have been adamant that there will be a retaliation and Israel still very much expecting that to do so. The war of words thus far is the only thing that has been escalating, but a retaliation of some sort from Iran and/or Hezbollah, its other proxies, is still very much expected any day now. Kim.",

We haven't been able to verify that, and Ukraine hasn't talked about that. But certainly, that is the image they are trying to project. But the evacuations that you talked about, some 76,000 of them, according to state media, the acting governor of the Kursk region also urging authorities to speed up those evacuations in one specific district on Saturday. That speaks to those ongoing hostilities. He has said this morning that they have managed to stabilize the situation in that district. But it certainly does give the sense that this is continuing. It could also portend of a bigger Russian operation to come to try to push Ukraine out. Of course, the question now that they've managed to pull off this sort of blindside, this operational surprise in advancing across the border is how long can they stay there?

There was though a real buzz on the streets here in Paris last night around the men's basketball final, the one the script writers had been wanting. The stars were out in force on and off the court and the game more than lived up to the hype as host France took on what might be one of the most talented U.S. teams ever assembled in the quest for gold. 20-year-old Victor Wembanyama more than holding his own against some of the all-time greats. The reigning NBA Rookie of the Year scoring 26 points, keeping his team in it all the way to the very last. But in the end, the new dream team of LeBron James, Kevin Durant, Steph Curry and co. proved just too strong. And it was Curry whose late game heroics have made him a full-time NBA champion. He added to his legend scoring 25 points and hitting a couple of three pointers in the closing minutes that all but sealed the gold for the USA. A first for Steph, third for LeBron, and a record fourth gold medal for KD. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
