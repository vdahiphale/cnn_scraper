A Ukrainian soldier tells CNN that the death toll is now so high that they've stopped counting the dead. Soledar is located in the Donetsk region not far from the city of Bakhmut.  It's home to the biggest salt mine in Europe and a vast network of underground tunnels which Russian forces are likely to try to exploit.

Well, Cardinal George Pell, the most senior catholic official to be convicted of child sex abuse before his 2020 acquittal has died. He was 81.Church officials say that Pell died of cardiac arrest following hip replacement surgery in Rome.  He Australian-born Pell was a former archbishop of Melbourne and Sydney and served as Vatican treasurer for five years.  And in a case that shocked the church, Pell was convicted in 2018 for allegedly abusing two choirboys in the 1990s.  He denied the charges but served 13 months in prison before Australia's high court acquitted him. And CNN Contributor Barbie Nadeau joins me now live from Rome.  Good morning to you Barbie.

So, his legacy is conflicted and survivors of clerical sex abuse have taken to social media not to mourn his death necessarily but to talk about how he will be taking these secrets of the church to the grave and I think that there is going to be in the coming days a lot of discussion about what he did know that he did not share and how he could have helped to save a lot of young children from the horrific abuse we know existed, Rosemary.",

But clearly, you know, the second question that you put quote which is what is the church doing about that these days.  I think that is really the neuralgic point.

If in two 21-day periods or 42 days there has been no new reported cases then the country can under international law declare that an outbreak is over and that's what Uganda has done.How is it possible to do that so quickly?  Because Uganda was really vigilant on tracking down every suspected case of Ebola.  Anyone who came into contact with somebody who tested positive for Ebola in Uganda had to go to 21-day quarantine.  It was really high handed for some people, some people tried to disappear in the community but they have had health workers going village to village, every community, to try to make sure that everybody was netted to make sure that this does not spread within the community. They did have a few cases in Kampala, in the capital, but they quickly had that under control.  So, they've been able to, essentially, get rid of Ebola in a much shorter period than they anticipated.

Although the rain chances are starting to taper back a bit at the moment and each wave will start to lessen regardless, our grounds are completely saturated. So, even the little rain that we get is going to cause a nuisance. Looking at radar now, scattered showers pushing inland maybe a few rumbles of thunder left with it but that moisture is starting to pop back off into the Pacific, will slide right up over top of us here in the upcoming hours, north of Santa Rosa, north of Sacramento, where the heaviest rain currently is falling.  But some of the heaviest rain over the past 48 hours actually fell down in a SoCal where just east of Santa Barbara, we picked up over ten inches of rain. Some of these locations like Ventura over the past few days picked up over 18 inches of rain since January 5th.  There is that area of low pressure we're talking about the atmospheric river.  Look at that dark blue color, that's the deep moisture that we are talking about that's getting picked up by the jet stream and pushed in.  That is exactly what an AR is or an atmospheric river. Areas of low pressure that come up out of Southeast Asia, get picked up the jet stream gesture and all that to subtropical moisture gets pushed on to North America's west coast.  So, you're seeing the darker greens and the blues, that's the next wave coming in today rolling in Thursday, Friday Saturday, doing the same thing.  One area of low pressure after the next. It's not just rain, it's heavy snowfall, 2 feet of snow expected through the sierras and this all pushes a back into parts of the four corners too which has all been official because some of these reservoirs really need the rain.  Redding to Fresno, extending just north of Los Angeles, flood watches that are still in effect.  The rapid rises and rivers and creeks, that is the next thing, that water is going to flow downstream and the rivers and creeks rise.  We're talking about the Salinas River near Spreckels.

Those levels of details are not supposed to be released. It could jeopardize Prince Harry and his family's security, the security of British troops, make them more of a target.

It was just being critical of revealing that level of detail about military operation. This seems to gone down very well with Stephen Colbert among American audiences, as you would expect. He speaks about how great it is to live in America. The audience is definitely highly sympathetic to Prince Harry. And it is interesting to see, again, we've spoken about it for this week, that juxtaposition between how the reports are being received in the United Kingdom versus America. It seems that Prince Harry was definitely playing to that audience.",
