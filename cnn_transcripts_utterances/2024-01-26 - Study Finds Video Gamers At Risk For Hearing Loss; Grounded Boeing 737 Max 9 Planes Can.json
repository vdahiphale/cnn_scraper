      "sentences": "The latest is the FAA has done its part. It`s ended the 19 day long emergency grounding of the Max 9. Itreviewed the data from Boeing Airlines at about a quarter of the fleet that`s out there in the U.S. So the Max 9 can fly again. But now before airlines do a final check of each plane, here is what the FAA is calling for, a detailed visual inspection of the door plug. That is the part that violently shot off Alaska 1282, 3 weeks ago. The FAA also once checks of the bolts and guides that hold the door plug on the plane and any abnormal conditions to be corrected. Remember both airlines that operate these planes found loose door plug bolts. Alaska Airlines has 65 Max 9s. They say inspections will take about 12 hours of labor, meaning the first few Max 9s at Alaska Airlines will be flying as soon as Friday. United Airlines is 79 Max 9s. United says its planes will be flying by Sunday. Airlines cannot wait to end this chapter after being forced to cancel flights by the thousands, even still the question a lot of people have is, are these planes truly safe? Important to note the NTSB has not finished its investigation. And this week I asked that question to FAA Administrator, Mike Whitaker.",

      "sentences": "Hot quiz, hot shot. What was the first supersonic passenger carrying commercial airplane called?Hurricane, Concorde, Nighthawk or Sky Crane? If you pilot said the Concorde congrats, you`ve passed with flying colors. From its first light in 1969 until its last in 2003, the Concorde supersonic plane shovel passengers at speeds far faster than traditional airlines. Next, we`re looking at how NASA is aiming to take commercial travel to supersonic speeds. NASA has been testing the limits of flying both in space and here on earth for decades. In 1947, X-1 became the first manned aircraft to break the sound barrier. In 1967, X-15 broke the record for fastest manned flight ever, and that record 6.7 times the speed of sound still stands to this day. Now NASA has created a new aircraft called X-59 intended to become the future of supersonic commercial air travel. But they`ve had to spend decades researching ways to fix issues with supersonic travel like a little thing called Sonic boom. No, not the special attack by Guile from Street Fighter. This Sonic boom, an enormous amount of sound energy created when an aircraft breaks the sound barrier, which is about 750 miles per hour. The boom registers at about 110 decibels, about as loud as a thunderclap and loud enough to crack windows on a house. But, even though NASA says the X-59 will cruise at about 925 miles per hour, it is designed to produce more of a thump than a boom spreading out the sound rather than bringing it together. Besides the loud sound like all air travel, another concern is the impact on the climate. NASA has a program looking at sustainable fuels for supersonic flight, because that`s going to be another requirement to truly make it a viable option in the future. For today`s story getting a 10 out of 10, a conspiracy theory swirling around online ahead of the NFL conference championships this weekend. Just four teams remain and the winners go to the Super Bowl. But are the two teams that will eventually face off in Las Vegas predetermined? And is there a clue in the Super Bowl logo? Follow me down the rabbit hole as we investigate this theory that there`s more than needs the eye to the colors of the Super Bowl logo. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

      "sentences": "At the start of the season, the NFL launched an ad, joking that the games were scripted, but many online, they think it`s true.For the last two seasons, the Super Bowl logos match the color schemes of the two teams playing. And, but the league tells us they design these logos up to two years in advance. In 2022, the Superbowl 56 logo had the orange of the Cincinnati Bengals and gold of the LA Rams. The following season, the colors were replaced by Philadelphia Eagles green and Kansas City Chiefs red. Is this some master plan and we`re all just drinking the Kool-Aid, was like predetermined to play for the Falcons and the Buffalo Bills before that? No. Some online are calling foul, suggesting some nefarious conspiracy theory that the league already knows what teams it wants to make the big game. And they fall a predetermined outcome rate in our faces. This year`s Super Bowl logo colors purple and red, leaving only one possible outcome for this weekend`s conference championships. Time will tell if the Ravens or 49ers proved the Super Bowl logo right. Yet again, the NFL has denied any conspiracy theory. They would say that one thing. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
