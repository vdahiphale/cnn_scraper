We spoke for over 20 minutes at their Washington, D.C. home. It was their first ever sit down interview together since they first debuted as a couple in 2019. And we spoke about these tough economic times. And also, what is he going to do with $124 billion and what he said to me was pretty interesting. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

What I can tell you is the economy does not look great right now. Things are slowing down. You're seeing layoffs in many, many sectors of the economy. People are slowing down. The probability, say, if we're not in a recession right now, we're likely to be in one very soon.So, my advice to people, whether they're small business owners or, you know, is take some risk off the table. If you were going to make a purchase, maybe slowdown that purchase a little bit. Keep some dry powder on hand and wait a bit and see. Try to reduce some risk in your business or your life.",

It's very hard, and there are a bunch of ways that I think you can do ineffective things too. So, we're building the capacity to be able to give away this money.(END VIDEOTAPE) MELAS (on camera): So, you heard him there say that he gave -- that they have this Courage and Civility Award, and my interview came on the heels of giving Dolly Parton $100 million with no strings attached, but to use it for her philanthropic endeavors. And we know that Dolly she especially loves to help children and she's done a lot in her home state of Tennessee. But we had a wider reaching interview. We talked about the NFL. Is he going to buy the Washington Commanders? He played coy about that. He said more on that later. And then we also talked about space travel. He believes that we will all be able to go to space -- get a ticket to space and it will be affordable in this lifetime, and he referenced the Wright brothers.

And we're in a really -- Jews are in a really scary place and, you know, you think about Kanye and you think about -- or Ye, and you think about Kyrie, and you think about their reach.

A-list investors, $32 billion valuation, prominent backers including Tom Brady and others. And then in just the span of days it all blew up. It's just this incredible train wreck. And everyone is searching for answers including law enforcement.Just last hour our colleague Kara Scannell reported that federal prosecutors in New York are investigating the FTX collapse. This investigation is being led by the U.S. Attorney's Office in the Southern District of New York. Now FTX is actually based in Bahamas. And authorities there have a team of financial investigators probing potential criminal misconduct. We don't know precisely which part of this debacle they're looking at. But there's no shortage of threats for them to follow. \"The Wall Street Journal\" and other media outlets are reporting that FTX used customer funds to prop up its sister hedge fund's high risk trading operation without their permission. Also, over the weekend FTX said it's investigating whether some crypto assets were stolen. Experts say the missing assets could be worth almost half a billion dollars. Just to take a step back for a minute, FTX is a crypto exchange. So, it's a place for people to buy and sell bitcoin, Ethereum, and other cryptocurrencies. And it's also a place where individual and professional crypto investors, they actually keep their crypto assets there. It was believed to be a safe place for them. At a minimum, this bankruptcy filing is going to tie up billions of dollars in customer funds for a while. Legal experts say though ultimately customers may end up losing most, if not all of their funds in this bankruptcy filing. It's just a stunning situation. And another reminder of how crypto really is not regulated. It's still the wild, wild west of the financial system, and this is going to just increase those calls for a regulatory crackdown.",
