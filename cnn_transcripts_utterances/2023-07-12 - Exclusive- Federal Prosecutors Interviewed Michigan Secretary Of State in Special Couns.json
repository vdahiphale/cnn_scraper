We will have details on that and what it may suggest about the case Jack Smith could be making.Also, Republican lawmakers grilled the Republican appointed, registered Republican FBI director. Is there evidence for their allegations? I'll ask the Republican former US attorney who recommended him for the job, presidential candidate, Chris Christie joins us. Later, Ray Epps, the January 6 protester now in hiding after right- wing media painted him as an FBI plant. His attorney joins me to talk about the lawsuit they've just filed against Fox News. Good evening. The Breaking News starts us off tonight. New word that another top state election official has spoken with federal prosecutors in connection with the former president's efforts to overturn the election. She is Jocelyn Benson, Michigan secretary of State. She now joins her Georgia counterpart, Brad Raffensperger; former Arizona Republican lawmaker Rusty Bowers, and two Nevada Republican Party officials in talking to Jack Smith's team. CNN's Evan Perez joins us now with more. So what have you learned about Secretary of State Benson's interview with Jack Smith?",

      "sentences": "Well, Anderson, what's important about this interview is that we now see a pattern of the Smith team, the special counsel's team going through all of the states, the key states that there was this effort by the former president and his allies to try to overturn those elections and try to perhaps seat these fake electors.And so what we know, sources telling Zach Cohen is that she sat with the Smith team for several hours in recent weeks and we know that, as you pointed out, they've already talked to state officials in Georgia, in Nevada, in Arizona. So you can see that this is an effort by the special counsel to try to figure out exactly whether there's a crime here that was committed in that effort, not only to overturn those state elections, but also to perhaps get access to voting machines. That is one of the things that Jocelyn Benson's office turned over. They turned over documents and evidence that indicated that there were people connected to Rudy Giuliani, who were trying to get access to voting machines in a specific county in Michigan. Again, we don't know whether this is something that is going to end up being charged as a crime, but it is something that it is clear the special counsel is diving deep into.",

And what's key here is that the legal team for those two Georgia election workers produced some evidence that they have obtained from Rudy Giuliani and some of his allies. And one of the key things here, Anderson is that it shows that Giuliani and again, people connected to former President Trump, were not really interested in checking out these claims of vote fraud. What they simply wanted to do is make those claims and try to make them stick.And so here's an example which is a text message from Boris Epshteyn, who continues to be very close to the former president as an adviser. Here is what he says in the text message: \"Urgent POTUS request. Need best examples of election fraud that we've alleged that is super easy to explain.\" He continues, \"Doesn't necessarily have to be proven, just need to be easy to understand. Is there any sort of greatest hits clearinghouse that anyone has, for best examples.\"   Again, an indication that they weren't really trying to make sure that these were proven examples of what they claimed was fraud. They just wanted to be able to make those claims, again, as part of this broader effort not only to overturn the state election results, but again, to give reason to Congress and perhaps the state legislators to have their fake electors be seated and again, overturn the victory of Joe Biden.",

They had people who were sending mail to them, death threats. So they -- people knew where they lived, people were driving by with guns out of their trucks pointing them at the house just to intimidate and scare Ray and Robin.And so, they had to flee because their safety was in jeopardy. The FBI in fact one time checked in on Ray. There were credible (ph) threats on the dark web focused on Ray. And in fact, Ricky Shiffer, if you remember that name, he is the man who attacked the FBI Office in Cincinnati, Ohio in 2022, referred to Ray in his Truth Social biography. So, Ray was a focus of the right-wing media and their viewers based on lies that Tucker Carlson and Fox were telling about him.",
