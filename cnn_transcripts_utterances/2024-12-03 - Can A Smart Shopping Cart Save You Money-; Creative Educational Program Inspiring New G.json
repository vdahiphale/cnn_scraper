(Voice-over):  I had to take a little more care with a couple of items. Well, that wasn`t good enough. But for the most part, product scanning was seamless. The cart even caught my tissue box toss. (On camera):  Oh, got that. (Voice-over):  Caper claims their carts don`t just save you time but money as well. The carts are free to use and the display shows a running total of your items to help keep you on budget. (On camera):  Four items and we`re already at $14.35.
