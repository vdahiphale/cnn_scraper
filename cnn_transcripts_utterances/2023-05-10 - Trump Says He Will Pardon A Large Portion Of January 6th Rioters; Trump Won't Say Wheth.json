So, I think there's a huge opportunity for the new generation, the new voice of the Republican Party, new ideas to come to fruition. There's still a lot to play here before we even get to the first in the nation primary in New Hampshire, which is next January, right? So, I understand the polls. When someone polls and says, do you support Donald Trump? They think about what's going on in New York with the D.A. They think about some -- he's playing that victim card very well. I mean, let's just think about the irony of that, the fact that Donald Trump is playing a victim here. But they do think there is a political vendetta, if you will, against him. Now, does that translate into a vote nine months from now? Totally a different story, absolutely totally different story, which is why I still very firmly believe he will not be the nominee.

It's the media going back and asking these questions of Donald Trump. Journalists wouldn't have to ask the most fundamental questions of Donald Trump, had he not continued to during the end of 2020 up till January 6th, 2021 and up till today, said things that were not true, that were not proven with evidence.We are evidence-based and there was no evidence to show that. And so when we and when Katelyn starts a Town Hall, which is a very fundamental democratic ideal, he's facing voters. The first thing you need to do before you can have a discussion within the confines of democracy is to ask the person who wants to have the job again of president if they feel comfortable with the basics of democracy like free and fair election and believing it. That's why that question was asked. And he hasn't been asked a question in that way in this kind of forum for a very long time because he has only talked to people who are for the most part, not entirely, but for the most part, people who feed the lies back to him.",

Governor Hutchinson, what was your reaction to what we heard from Donald Trump? ASA HUTCHINSON (R-AK), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Well, Donald Trump was certainly grilled tonight. And what was clear, he had a weak performance, and he's locked in the past. He had a goal, I'm sure, to expand his base, to be able to prove that he can attract independence and suburban voters. He failed that test. He narrowed his base of support. He locked in the past. He didn't address the issues of the future. Whenever he was asked about the economy, he gave one brief response on energy policy, but really didn't address the broad range of needs that we have in our economy to get it going again. And so I think it was a poor performance, it was a weak performance, and again, he was locked in the past. TAPPER: He repeated his lies over and over and over that the 2020 election was rigged. Obviously, this has all been adjudicated in election boards and courtrooms. He didn't indicate any regret from January 6, including his Vice-President's life being threatened. He said he was inclined to pardon most of the rioters from that day. I guess the question I have is, do you think that this is going to hurt him at all with the Republican base? You're out there, you're talking to Republican voters. I'm sure when you say that they want to hear about the economy, you're right. And yet, he still is so far ahead in the polls.",

And so he got locked into the debate about 2020 election and that it was all rigged and his false dialogue on that. And then he spent time on January 6th, and those were very appropriate questions, but the debate should have moved way beyond that much quicker because, as I talk to people, they might believe the last election was rigged.But they're ready to talk about the future as well. And so it's not foreclosing winning those votes, even though we might have a fundamental disagreement on what happened in 2020 in the election. That's an important fact to remember. These voters still care about who could lead our country, who's got the right position on supporting Ukraine, who can actually solve the problems along our southern border. And so, that was clearly a mistake, but not moving more quickly to that. Whenever you look at Ukraine, and that's something that bothered me a great deal, because he basically talks about himself being a great negotiator. Well, he set the stage by saying, we can end this in one day if I'm President. Well, that gives away every negotiating leverage that he has, because he tells Putin that you're going to win, you've got the leverage as we go into negotiation. It's a terrible mistake. It's a terrible position not supporting Ukraine, not trying to win for Ukraine in that fight against Russia.",
