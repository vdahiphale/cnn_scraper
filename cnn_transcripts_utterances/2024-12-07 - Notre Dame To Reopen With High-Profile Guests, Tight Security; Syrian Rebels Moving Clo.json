      "sentences": "Hello everyone, thanks for joining me. I'm Alisyn Camerota in today for Fredricka Whitfield.We begin this hour with the grand reopening of the Notre Dame Cathedral. This long-awaited ceremony is underway right now in Paris. World leaders and dignitaries are arriving, including President-elect Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Zelenskyy. Both arrived there just moments ago. Last hour, the two leaders met with French President Emmanuel Macron at the Elysee Palace. Today's grand opening comes more than five years after the iconic cathedral was ravaged by fire. That blaze brought Notre Dame within minutes of collapsing. We have a team of correspondents covering today's developments. Alayna Treene is in Washington, D.C. Nic Robertson is in London for us. But let's begin with CNN's Melissa Bell outside of Notre Dame Cathedral. So, Melissa, it's miraculous. I mean, it truly is Notre Dame rising from the ashes from five years ago. And it's a ceremony that many people, French people, thought would never happen. So what's it like there?",

      "sentences": "Well, the weather is sadly atrocious, Alisyn. In fact, we've just watched President-elect Donald Trump being accompanied by someone holding an umbrella over him as he made his way into the cathedral.Clearly, this is not what the organizers had counted on. It's been windy, blustery, and now it's raining really hard. But that ceremony just about to get underway with those 50 heads of state. A really moving moment, of course, not just for France and with everything this cathedral means for Parisians, but it was when it burned down five years ago that I really got a sense of what it means to the whole world. Over the course of that night in April 2019, when the flames were coming out of the top of the cathedral, now, of course, entirely restored. President Macron carried out his final construction site visit last Friday. I had the opportunity to go inside. The interior is extraordinary. What you're about to see as these leaders take their seats, President- elect Donald Trump, but also President Zelenskyy of Ukraine, with whom he and President Macron held a trilateral meeting for about half an hour at the Elysee Palace, all of those dignitaries are now sitting down. What we expect to have happen next is the Archbishop of Paris to knock on the doors of Notre Dame. The choir will answer him. He will eventually make his way in, awaken, as they call it, the organ of Notre Dame, which has been carefully restored along with the rest, damaged also by that fire five years ago as the ceremony gets underway. This is not a religious mass, by the way. That first mass will take place tomorrow, Alisyn. This is just a ceremony of reopening. And an important reminder, I think, by the presence of all these foreign dignitaries, of what this cathedral means to the world.",

      "sentences": "That's right. And I will say that First Lady Jill Biden is there, and we saw her moments ago taking photos with the French president. But a lot of the attention is on his meeting with the President-elect Donald Trump, and Donald Trump's, you know, first return, really, to the world stage ever since getting elected.I was told that Donald Trump received the invitation a little over a week ago and very eagerly accepted and told his team immediately upon receiving it that he wanted to go. Part of it, of course, is because Donald Trump does love these historic sites. I was told he's had this long-held fascination with the Notre Dame Cathedral, and particularly ever since that fire had really caused severe damage to it. But the other part of this is his team recognized that this was going to be a very good opportunity for Donald Trump to, one, rub shoulders with a lot of these foreign leaders, some of whom he has known from his previous time in the White House, others who he'll likely be meeting for the first time. But also, they knew that he would get the type of pageantry and warm welcome that we saw unfold earlier today when Donald Trump arrived at the Elysee Palace and was greeted very warmly by Macron. And so I think what's really interesting, as well, though, is what we're seeing now kind of unfold and what we're starting to learn about that meeting between Donald Trump and Macron, but also when Zelenskyy then joined them. We did see Zelenskyy say that it was a good and productive meeting. But the key question that I know is on a lot of these leaders' minds is, how is Donald Trump going to approach the war between Russia and Ukraine? Is he going to withdraw funding? Is he going to try and push for a very quick end to the war, which he has promised to do throughout his time on the campaign trail? But what does that mean and what that could look like? Those are all the big questions I know that are on a lot of people's minds, and they were kind of preparing for in the lead-up to this. And so, you know, look, I'm eager to hear more of what was said during that meeting and how these relationships look moving forward.",

And the latest information that we have coming from sources familiar with the situation in Damascus is that Assad is currently not in his usual places in Damascus.Now, the rebels do not know where precisely he is. They continue to search for him. But this would be the first indication we've had so far that Assad has perhaps decided to get out of the way of this rapidly advancing mass of different rebel forces that are coalescing around the capital. We heard from that exclusive interview that our colleague Jomana did with the rebel leader Juhani earlier in the week that their focus now was going to be on the Assad regime and on Damascus. And this is what is now going into effect. And indeed, it does appear as if the timeline that U.S. officials understand at the moment, the reality on the ground this evening in Damascus, almost begins to look as the game is pretty much up right now for Bashar al-Assad. Again, not in his normal places in Damascus. We don't know where he is. We do know, however, that rebels are trying to ascertain where he is, and we know that they're getting incredibly close to the absolute seat of his power right at the center of Damascus.",

And the story, the way European officials I've spoken to see it, is that Russia is a bully, and it's been bullying Europe in multiple different ways.So allowing Russia any quarter in Ukraine, for instance, to keep Ukrainian territory it's seized in negotiations that Trump wants to launch, that could be dangerous for all of Europe. And it also gives Macron a chance to cast Trump as the hero, the guy who could stand up to the bully for all of Europe. And one last point, he will be stressing how much Europe has been stepping up to pay for its own defense since Trump was last in the White House.",

And President Trump didn't, in other shots, didn't seem terribly enthusiastic about being there with Zelenskyy.

So I don't know how much we should read into that, especially since Zelenskyy made a point back in September before the election to visit Trump at Trump Tower, and they had a grip-and-grin, very cheerful talk with reporters where Zelenskyy said Russia can't be allowed to win, and Trump agreed with that, though not saying how.",

That's what's got Europe really worried.Trump has said he's going to impose 10 percent to 20 percent tariffs on all imports into the United States. That could be pretty devastating for members of the European Union. And so surely they will be having quiet asides, and Macron will possibly be having some direct conversation asking him what his intentions are and what they could do to keep it from happening. What is he trying to negotiate for? Also, as you know, President Macron is dealing with a crisis in his own country. The French government is, you know, in collapse. There's an economic crisis.

And people start thinking of, I got to save my own family and try to get to safety before an advancing insurgent mob runs over Damascus. I've got to get the heck out of here. And they stopped taking orders. That's a lot of what we saw happening when the resistance of the official troops dissolved in Kabul. And I think that's what we're beginning to see right now in Syria.

But this is the official opening now. The Archbishop of Paris being received inside the cathedral after knocking three times. The next step is that he will awaken, as they say, the organ. So it is the largest musical instrument in Paris. So far, you're hearing the choir who've welcomed the Archbishop of Paris inside the cathedral. Next, we expect to hear the organ brought back to life after its careful restoration after that fire five years ago. It caused some damage to it, too. It will be brought back to life. The idea of this ceremony, very much, Alisyn, is one of the main architects of the ceremony was telling me earlier today, is to bring the cathedral back to life. And that is done, of course, with the voice of the choir. It is going to be done with the words of the Archbishop, but also with the sound of the organ once it starts. None of this, by the way, because it's not officially consecrated, is part of any religious ceremony. That first mass will only take place on Sunday.
