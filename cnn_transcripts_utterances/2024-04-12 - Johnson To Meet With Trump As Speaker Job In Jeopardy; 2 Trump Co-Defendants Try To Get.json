      "sentences": "Soon, former President Trump will hold a joint news conference at his Mar-a-Lago club with House Speaker Mike Johnson. And while Trump will make a public appearance with Johnson, a big question is, will he give the Speaker a public show of support?Johnson is facing a serious challenge to his leadership. GOP Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene is still standing firm on her threat to force a vote to remove Johnson as Speaker. Trump and Johnson are expected to deliver remarks on, wait for it, election integrity. Remember, Johnson played a key role in Trump's efforts to overturn the legitimate results of the 2020 Election. We are told the two are planning to draw attention to alleged efforts to allow non-citizens to vote. We should note, currently, federal law bans non-citizens from voting in federal elections. If they do, which they often do not, they risk major fines up to a year in prison and deportation. I want to bring in CNN's Melanie Zanona now from Capitol Hill. What more do we know about why Speaker Johnson feels that he needs to go to Mar-a-Lago to kiss the ring, Mel?",

      "sentences": "Yes, Brianna. This is a big moment for Speaker Johnson, given that his speakership is on the line right now. Now, this press conference on its surface is about elections, which is something Donald Trump obviously cares very deeply about. But Johnson is going down to Florida today with a much bigger mission in mind and that is to secure a critical lifeline from one of the most powerful figures in the party right now. And I think it's telling that this press conference was Johnson's idea, according to sources that we spoke to.Now, Johnson would not say whether he explicitly has asked Donald Trump for his support amid this speakership battle. But as Kristen Holmes and I reported, there have been allies to both Trump and Johnson who have encouraged Trump to either stay on the sidelines or to put out a public show of support, some sort of statement backing Johnson amid this potential battle. So we will be watching very closely to see how Trump interacts with Johnson on the stage and to see what he does say about the Speaker. But at the same time here, the person agitating against Johnson is Marjorie Taylor Greene who is one of Donald Trump's closest allies on Capitol Hill and hanging over it all right now is the topic of Ukraine aid. That is something that Greene has warned Johnson against doing. He is still committed to trying to find a path forward and I am told that allies to Johnson have counseled him to keep Trump in the loop, try to get his buy-in for whatever they do, because there's a clear recognition here that Donald Trump has the power to not only make or break that legislation, but also make or break Johnson's speakership, Bri.",

And right now, you have the lawyers for these two co- defendants, Walt Nauta and Carlos De Oliveira, both still currently employed by Donald Trump at Mar-a-Lago.And what the argument from these two - from the lawyers is, is that they did not know that there was an ongoing investigation or at least the government is not proving that they knew there was a - there was an ongoing investigation, and that they didn't know what was inside these boxes. These boxes, of course, it contained classified documents, according to the government, some of the highest, most sensitive classifications of documents that were contained in those documents. And that, according to the government, according to prosecutors, they have on video evidence of them moving boxes multiple times, trying to, according to the government, trying to evade the FBI, which came to retrieve them. So, right now, John Irving, who is a lawyer for Mr. Oliveira, is getting some sharp questions from the judge. She's getting - she's pushing back a little bit on his argument that the government hasn't done enough to prove that there was obstruction. And she's pointing out that some of his arguments are better left for a jury, that he could make these arguments to a jury when you come to a trial. So at least for - from the initial part of this hearing, it doesn't look like she's leaning in that direction. She also, though, was pressing the government to say, well, can you explain what in this indictment actually shows that they knew what was going on. And the government, I have to say, was having a little bit of a hard time. They said, essentially, that the fact that we charged it is the proof that we believe Mr. De Oliveira knew what was going on. So, again, this hearing expected to go for another couple of hours. Donald Trump, as we talked about, is not here today. Jessica, Brianna?",

      "sentences": "Well, it's quite an extraordinary document. In the FBI, this is what we called a 302. It is basically the record of an interview conducted by agents, two agents of Walt Nauta, about the boxes, when the boxes were moved, did he know what they contained.And Walt says he can - he thought they contained old newspaper clippings, personal records, hair spray, shampoo, personal items for Donald Trump. And he said that in the context of when they were leaving the White House in January after losing the election, that the moving process was pure chaos and that things were thrown together in a topsy-turvy way into different boxes and shipped to Mar-a-Lago and so on. Part of the problem and Evan touched on this briefly, is, well, how did they know what Walt knew about what was in the boxes? But there's a telling piece. He's interviewed in May about the boxes, but it's also May where he's getting texts and enlisting others to start moving these boxes around. Some of the boxes are given to one of Trump's lawyers. Some of the boxes are shifted from one storage area to another. Walt is titularly in charge of this. And when the FBI asks him in this 302, where the boxes were stored before they were in Trump's residence, whether they've been in a secure location. He says, \"I wish I could tell you. I don't know. I honestly just don't know.\" [15:10:02] And that is part of the bulwark of where they charge him with a 1001 violation or lying to federal officials in a - in an official investigation. Because when the boxes were in some of these storage areas and spilled out in pictures that were taken on Walt Nauta's phone, you could see markings of secret and top secret. So this is something they'd rather litigate in court than in a motion to dismiss.",

And what they're trying to do now is get out of the case, essentially saying, look, we didn't know what was going on. We were just cogs in a big wheel and let Donald Trump go this alone.

There are multiple agencies on site. I can see members of the Texas Department of Public Safety, the Washington County Sheriff's Office and Brenham as well.

We don't know exactly why this person decided to do this. But we do know that this is a Texas Department of Public Safety building, a driver's license office. And of course, this is a Friday.

We didn't have this - and I'll go again, women did not even have the right to vote. I've got a long history and record of defending women and their rights and taking care of their health care, whether it's education, health care and I'm not going to stop here.There is going to be solid ground and what we're going to start with is this territorial law needs to be repealed, and we need to move something forward, and I hope a bipartisan matter that we can all agree upon. And that may be even to the point of allowing the voters to determine not only if abortion is going to be legal in the state, because remember, that's what Roe versus Wade overturning was. It's going to be the state's decision when before it wasn't. So we find ourselves in new waters here, in new territory here, but I want to assure the people of Arizona that we are going to find a solution for this as we move forward.
