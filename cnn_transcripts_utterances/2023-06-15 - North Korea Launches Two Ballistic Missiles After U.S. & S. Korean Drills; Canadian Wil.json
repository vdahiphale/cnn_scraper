Japan saying that these missiles landed less than 100 miles from the Japanese shore.The launches are coming just hours after Pyongyang condemned the U.S. and South Korea for conducting live-fire joint military drills near the North Korean border. CNN's Paula Hancocks is following this story. What do we know about these launches, Paula? What can you tell us?",

      "sentences": "Well, at this point, we do know there were two short-range ballistic missile launches off the east coast of North Korea.And it appears it happened just hours after a defense spokesperson in Pyongyang through statement media slammed the U.S. and South Korea for joint military drills they had been holding earlier in the day. Now we know that there have been five separate occasions where these Live-fire drills have taken place. Today, this Thursday, was actually a time when the South Korean president, Yoon Suk Yeol, was in attendance. The commander-in-chief saying that he was confident and satisfied by what he saw. Now these have been billed as the largest ever Live-fire drills. In fact, we went to one of these five days, and I can confirm that it was the largest drill that I have seen in many years here. It was also a much more blatant and a much clearer message to North Korea. Quite often, these military drills talk about reacting against an enemy. In this particular scenario, they talked about an illegal armed invasion by North Korea. And the fire power that we were witnessing was the reaction by the U.S. and South Korea. So it was a very clear message to Pyongyang. And certainly, that is something that Pyongyang did not appreciate, as we can see by the reaction today. Now they've said that the reason that they're carrying out these increased numbers of missile launches and weapons tests over really the last year and a half is because of these joint military drills by the U.S. and South Korea -- Brianna?",

The Vatican says he's expected to be discharged from the hospital tomorrow morning, nine days after undergoing abdominal surgery for a hernia. Earlier today, the pontiff visited with child cancer patients at the hospital's nearby cancer ward. Also, the manager of the Harvard Medical School morgue has been indicted on charges of stealing and selling human body parts. Yes. According to the indictment, the body parts came from cadavers that were donated for educational purposes. It accuses Cedric Lodge of taking the body parts to his home and then shipping them to buyers. Prosecutors also say that Lodge brought people to the morgue to shop in-person for body parts. Anyway, here's a quick look at the Dow. It's up big today, nearly 400 points. Investors seem to be taking kindly to the Federal Reserve's big announcement yesterday. For the first time in 15 months, the Fed hitting pause on a new interest rate hike amid signs of cooling inflation. But there are still two more rate hikes potentially planned for the end of the year. Brianna?",

So they have had this before.And you're right. It is back. Here's a live look at St. Paul, Minnesota, from our earth cam. You can barely make out the buildings across the skyline. And we're looking at poor air quality anywhere across Wisconsin, portions of Minnesota, and down into Iowa. We have air quality alerts up. And you can see these yellow and red dots. Those indicate some poor air quality. We have unhealthy air quality across portions of Iowa, on into near Chicago even, seeing poor air quality as you saw from that picture. And the smoke is just pouring in from Canada, these wildfires. And we talked about how this could be the summer of smoke. We are seeing it. So it really all depends on the fire activity in Canada, and the wind direction. Here's going to be the near-surface smoke forecast going forward. And you can see that poor air quality is going to be pretty far south. But what really caught my attention is this plume right here. You can see around the Canada/U.S. border, by Saturday morning. That's going to be one to watch as well, those bright colors of red and orange, that could sneak back into the U.S., especially the northeast by the time we get to say, Sunday into Monday. So it's going to be interesting to see what happens there. But, Brianna, I think this is going to be a story that's going to stick around for most of the summer as the fire season in Canada is just getting going.",

And even more concerning, recent research showing that children struggling with suicidal thoughts don't get the follow-up care that they need. CNN's Meg Tirrell joins us with details.

If you look at the rates both of homicide and suicide over this age group over the last two decades, they are now converging at about 11 per 100,000.And the number for homicides, that rate is the highest we've seen since 1997. For suicides, the rate is the highest going all the way back to 1968. And that rate has really been increasing since 2007, up by 62 percent. For homicides, there was a jump up more than 30 percent just in the first year of the pandemic alone. And that's something we've seen in the broader data but it's pretty scary to see it laid out like this. Also scary, if you dig through the data more deeply and look into the specific age groups, if look at the youngest kids in this, between ages 10 to 14, the suicide rate in that age group has tripled since 2007. That's really something that's really making people very worried as well. The American Medical Association this week saying, quote, \"We are in a crisis situation with children's mental health.\" This week, voting to adopt a new policy to advocate for children's mental health, Boris. Something that a lot of people are very focused on.",

You know, some of the issues are that, you know, kids don't get the help that they need, about half of them. And there's not a big enough work force to take care of these kids who need these mental health services.

VICTORIA DUNCKLEY, CHILD PSYCHIATRIST &amp; SCREEN TIME EXPERT &amp; AUTHOR: I'm not surprised at all.

So I think all screen time has a physiological response that can cause depression, anxiety, and mood dis-regulation.Social media adds extra layers on top of that because it's psychologically trying to hijack these developmental needs to be seen, to role play, to get, you know, a response from people. So parents really need to replace that role. And it's very compelling and it really draws kids in. We can't just rely on them. It's not realistic to have them regulate their own use. It really needs to be cut out. So I think, you know, the recent surgeon general's warning that social media can be harmful, especially to minors, is a big step in the right direction. I think it needs to be socially acceptable that we keep kids off of social media altogether.",

World Tour and Saudi Investment Fund may end up not even happening. According to the \"Wall Street Journal\" and people familiar with the matter, the U.S. Justice Department will be investigating the planned partnership over antitrust concerns. This comes as Senate Finance Committee Chairman Ron Wyden sent a letter to PGA tour leadership asking a variety of questions to seek clarification and evidence associated with the deal. The U.S. Open is the first major since the partnership was announced. The guys that stayed loyal to the PGA tour and were always very critical of the LIV series, obviously not happy about how this all went down, especially since it came out of nowhere. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JON RAHM, 2-TIME MAJOR GOLD CHAMPION: The general feeling is that a lot of people feel a bit of betrayal from management. I understand why they had to keep it so secret. It's no easy as a player that's been involved like many others wake up one day and see this bombshell. Right? That's where, we're all in a state of limbo, because we don't know what's going on and we don't know how much is finalized or how much they can talk about it either. BROOKS KOEPKA, 5-TIME MAJOR GOLF CHAMPION: So we didn't hear anything about it. I think that's kind of the one thing that shocked everybody the most.
