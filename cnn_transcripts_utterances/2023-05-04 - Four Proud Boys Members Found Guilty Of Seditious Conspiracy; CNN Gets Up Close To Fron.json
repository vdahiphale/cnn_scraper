Today, four Proud Boys convicted of seditious conspiracy for their roles in the January 6 insurrection, making this the third time federal prosecutors have successfully gotten a guilty verdict on these very serious charges. What might this mean for Donald Trump and the special counsel investigation? Plus, a homeless man held in a deadly chokehold by a stranger on a New York City subway car. Why this incident sparked a homicide investigation and is sparking important conversations about mental illness and vigilantism. Then, the fight gets under way to overturn an abortion ban in one state, a ban dating back to 1849. 1849 -- you heard that right -- years before the civil war, decades before women could even vote. We're talking to the attorney general who filed the lawsuit. (MUSIC)",

In a verdict affirming the prosecutor's central allegation, that they conspired to stop the peaceful transfer of power on January 6 by attacking the Capitol.

But this is one of those cases where it wasn't a clean result. There are four men convicted and who were found guilty of seditious conspiracy, that centerpiece of this case. One of those men was found not guilty, cleared of that, and what that shows us in this case is how the jury was able to distinguish between the leaders of the Proud Boys and actors on the scene on January 6.

Now, for the third time, we've seen that the DOJ is fully capable of charging seditious conspiracy and obtaining convictions.Also, if you look at the way the prosecutors put this case together, they didn't have one smoking gun. They didn't have a particular communication where somebody said we're going to overtake the Capitol by force and block the electoral count. Instead what they did, they put together all the evidence, testimony and documents showing that there was talk of revolution insurrection and that they had a plan to go to the Capitol and just stay in coordination. So you can see how that model could be used against Donald Trump and others. But I think on the other hand, it's fair to ask it has been almost 2 1/2 years now. If no charge against Donald Trump thus far, why not? We just heard Katelyn read the U.S. attorney's statement that this charge goes to the heart of democracy. Well, if DOJ genuinely believes that conduct goes to the heart of democracy and they have the goods to prove it, they would not have taken 2 1/2 years to charge it.

The Proud Boys who were convicted today all five were found guilty depending on the type of count, Pezzola and the others, Tarrio, Nordean, Biggs, Rehl, they all will need to be sentenced. And how that plays out is going to be very closely watched in this courthouse because until this case, much of what the Justice Department was doing was about people who were setting foot on the Capitol grounds and going past the police line on January 6 into the Capitol complex. Enrique Tarrio, he was not. He was not even in Washington, D.C. on January 6. So the fact that the Justice Department was able to get a conviction of him today and to see what the judge, Tim Kelly, in this case does at the sentencing later this summer, that is going to be a really significant thing. The other thing happening still, Jake, is they are still making arrests. There are still 250 or so more people that the Justice Department is seeking to identify who were at the Capitol that day, and that are wanted on various possible charges, including ones like assaulting police officers -- Jake.",

But if you look at the bigger scheme here, DOJ has now charged over 1,000 people in connection with January 6, that's good. Those are important prosecutions. But they have charged fewer than 2 percent of those people with seditious conspiracy. And don't just take it from me, various federal judges have criticized DOJ on the record for being too lenient in the way they've chosen to charge these cases. We've seen judges call these charges, quote, baffling and puzzling and I quote, schizophrenic. So judges have said, why have you been so lenient charging things like trespass but not the more serious seditious conspiracy? I think we'll see Merrick Garland in a few moments take a victory lap.

JONATHAN GREENBLATT, CEO AND NATIONAL DIRECTOR, ANTI-DEFAMATION LEAGUE:  Well, Jake, this deals a very serious blow to the myth that the Proud Boys are some kind of drinking group, some kind of fraternal brotherhood. The fact of the matter is, as prosecutors demonstrated, they are a right wing extremist group with a violent agenda. They are misogynistic, anti-immigration, many of them espouse white supremacist, anti-Semitic ideologies. And, Jake, they are committed to a kind of behavior that was on full display on January 6th. So we've watched this trial began and before, since they've come under scrutiny, this group has mutated like a virus. They are now doing more things locally.

President Trump and his whole coterie of crazies really exploited the sort of paranoia and you saw that on full display on January the 6th.So, yes, when the president called on the Proud Boys to stand back and stand by, they thought that they were his armed militia. And so this way riled up and when he called them into action saying that it would be wild on January the 6th, they came en masse, they were -- there is a lot of them who are climbing all over the Capitol building and in the mob on the Mall that day.

When you look at seditious conspiracy charges, we've now seen ten people in this entire country convicted of seditious conspiracy in relation to January 6. Ten people, does anyone realistically think only 10 people -- we've seen the video of how many people are storming the Capitol, trying to obstruct the counting of ballots. So I think that they've been insufficient in the way they've charged seditious conspiracy against the people who physically entered the Capitol. Now, who is the most powerful political person who Merrick Garland has charged with anything in connection to January 6? There is none. Nobody above ground level has been charged with anything. Enrique Tarrio, the leader of the Proud Boys, is the first person who wasn't physically present who has been charged in relation to January 6. And Garland quoted himself just now, he went back to his confirmation hearing and he quoted how he said we will see those responsible for this attack. But he said that bunch of times since. And he said previously three words that he left out today, at any level. That is usually the way he says it. We will pursue anybody at any level.

With respect to Donald Trump, I do think the evidence is there based on what we know to charge him, based on all the things that he said, based on the reasonable inferences that we've heard, they believed had he was instructing them and they reasonably took it to me, I want you to go in there and block the counting of the electoral ballots.",

COVID made that even worse as they took the few remaining mental health beds and turned them into critical care beds. The medical business has figured out that that is not where the money is and the government on the federal level and the state level isn't putting the money into it, it used to. So you have a growing problem with a shrinking solution. The mayor has tried to counter that by pouring money into it from the city's own coffers and urging the governor to contribute state money. But at the same time, New York City is faced with the homeless problem which has a mental illness factor in it that's fairly significant. And now, a migrant problem that uses many of the same resources in terms of housing and social work. So we're on the edge of a crisis. TAPPER:  Andrea, as a mental health expert, how do you see it?

Turning now to our health lead, will an 1849 law, you heard that right, 1849 law banning abortion in Wisconsin stand the test of time? Arguments began today in a lawsuit that is seeking to overturn that 1849 ban. It was filed by Democratic Wisconsin Attorney General Josh Kaul, shortly after the U.S. Supreme Court struck down Roe v. Wade last summer. The Supreme Court decision reverted Wisconsin back to its pre-civil war era law, which penalizes providers who performed abortions even in the case of rape and incest. The only exception is to save the mother's life. A reminder this law passed decades before women got the right to vote. With me now, Wisconsin Attorney General Josh Kaul. So, Attorney General Kaul, you argue that Wisconsin should adhere to newer state laws. One would criminalize abortion only after the point of fetal viability. This law, of course, that I'm talking about was passed 12 years after Roe v. Wade legalized abortions. Now that Roe has been overturned, why should the state revert to a 1985 law and not the pre-Roe statute? JOSH KAUL (D), WISCONSIN ATTORNEY GENERAL:  We filed suit four days after Roe was overturned. When Roe was overturned in Wisconsin, abortion became generally unavailable for women in the state with very narrow exceptions and we are working to restore access to save and legal abortion. In our suit, we've argued among other things that there were a series of laws passed after Roe and some laws that directly conflict with the 1849 ban, and that it can't be both legal and illegal at the same time for providers to provide abortion care. Because of that conflict, we've argued that the courts should find that the 1849 law is unenforceable and that the ban is not in effect in Wisconsin.",

      "sentences": "That's true, though. Even before Roe v. Wade, abortion bans were very rarely enforced in Wisconsin and around the country. And part of the argument we've made is that to provide fair notice to people that laws are going to be enforced they need to continue being enforced. And part of this is about notice and part of it's about the way that the legislature and other policymakers act.Because Roe was in place nobody acted to remove the 1849 ban. And because of that this law really doesn't have the consent of the governed. In fact, if you look, Wisconsinites overwhelmingly support restoring access to safe and legal abortion. So for that reason as well as the laws that were passed subsequent to Roe that imply they repealed the ban we've argued that that ban shouldn't be enforceable.",

They've talked about patients who come in. Even when they have healthy pregnancies, concerned about what might happen if they can't get the care that they need.I've heard from an OB-GYN student who talked about how she wasn't sure if she was going to practice in Wisconsin because she couldn't get the training that she needed and provide comprehensive care.
