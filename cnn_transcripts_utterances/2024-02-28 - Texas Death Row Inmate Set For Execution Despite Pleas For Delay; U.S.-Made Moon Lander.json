Ivan Cantu says he should get a new trial based on new evidence. He was convicted 20 years ago of killing two family members.But now even the foreman for the jury that convicted him penned an op- ed, saying he's having second thoughts about the case. CNN senior national correspondent Ed Lavandera spoke with Cantu and his family. He joins us now live from the prison where tonight's execution is set to take place. Ed, walk us through this new evidence that Cantu says proves he is innocent.",

The Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles, Texas Court of Criminal Appeals, a federal appeals court has also rejected very intensely, in fact, calling Ivan Cantu's last- minute legal filings a, quote, abuse. So he has now arrived here at the prison where the execution chamber is in Texas. We were told by prison officials that when he arrived here, he looked anxious and nervous, and this execution is scheduled to take place around any time after 6 p.m. Central Time in about three and a half hours or so -- Boris.",

      "sentences": "I mean, first and foremost, we got the images that we've been waiting for since last Thursday when Odysseus first touched down on the surface of the moon, and I want to pop the money shot up right now. Because, Brianna, that's the image that everybody has wanted to see.It is of Odysseus on the surface of the moon, and you can see it's just kind of tilted over about 30 degrees. That is where it just didn't quite stick the landing, Brianna. But you can clearly see the moon in the background for all the doubters out there, like perhaps even your co-anchor, Boris, yesterday. It is now, you know, the company and NASA saying, look, it is proof that we are there, and then there's another image that's also pretty cool that just came out, and it is of Odysseus landing just seconds before landing, and you can see that 3D-printed engine spewing what's called lunar regolith. That's the dust and rocks out from underneath it right before it lands, and you can even see a little broken leg there over on the left, which is part of the reason it tipped over. But, you know, Brianna, we've got a lot of people who've got about five hours left of Odie being alive on the surface of the moon. But the company, Intuitive Machines, says they are just putting it to sleep for a little bit. They're going to try to wake it back up in two to three weeks once the sun comes back around. But overall, they believe this was an overwhelming success. All the payloads, sending back data, communicating. We now have these images. And, Brianna, one more thing. They said if there was anything that they could do different on future missions, one of the things would be more cameras. The chief technology officer said, we got the message loud and clear, so, Boris, I think they were listening to him yesterday, and they know how critical those data are, and they've got more missions planned now.",

Paul, thank you so much for chatting with us about this. You say that this was a night that you want to forget. I'm wondering when you first suspected that something was off about this gig. PAUL CONNELL, ACTED AS WILLY WONKA FOR \"WILLY'S CHOCOLATE EXPERIENCE\": And so, I basically offered the gig on Thursday. I think it was when I received the script. And upon reading it, it was AI-generated and just nonsense. It was 15 minutes long and I had one day to learn it. And to say it made no sense is an understatement. So I think that was probably my first red flag that there's something not quite right at my chocolate factory.",
