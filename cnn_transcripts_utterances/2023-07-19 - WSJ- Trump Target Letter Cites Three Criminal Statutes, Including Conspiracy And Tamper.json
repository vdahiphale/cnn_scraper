      "sentences": "Tonight, straight from THE SOURCE, I have brand-new reporting, on how Trump is beefing up his legal team, as he's bracing for another potential indictment, from the Special Counsel. I'll share that scoop in a moment.And stunning new details on the U.S. soldier, believed to be detained in North Korea, tonight, after crossing the heavily-fortified Demilitarized Zone. A witness says she saw him bolt across the border, and you're going to hear her account. Plus, the music video that is rocking the world of country music and beyond. Why Jason Aldean's chart-topper was pulled by Country Music Television. I'm Kaitlan Collins. And this is THE SOURCE. Good evening. We start, tonight, with that breaking news, on how Trump is adding more firepower, to his legal team, as he is bracing, for a potential another indictment, from the Special Counsel. Of course, as we know, Trump shocked the world, when he announced yesterday, he had gotten that target letter, from Jack Smith's team. And now, I have learned that he has quietly added a new criminal defense attorney, in recent weeks, to his team. I'm told that John Lauro, a former federal prosecutor, turned white- collar attorney, is going to be joining that team, that team that is focused on what could be an indictment, in the coming days. He will be focused, on the January 6th investigation. And of course, that comes, after last month, when Trump was indicted in the documents case, two of his key attorneys departed his team, one of them who was very familiar, with the January 6th investigation. Now, Trump is adding a new person, to that team, of course, as they are trying to figure out more about that potential indictment, what evidence does Jack Smith have, what witnesses has he spoken to that Trump and his team were unaware of? Of course, I should note, John Lauro is someone, who was part of that group that was reaching out to others, in Trump's orbit, attempting to find out who else may have gotten a target letter. I should note that as we came to air, tonight, here at 9 o'clock Eastern, so far, they have not uncovered anyone else, who has also gotten a target letter, in the January 6th probe. Meanwhile, that grand jury that is hearing evidence is expected to hear more, from other witnesses, tomorrow, one going back for his third visit, before the grand jury. We have learned that Trump's team has been asking around, to see about those other potential witnesses, that other potential evidence, as they're trying to learn more, and bracing for another indictment, potentially. As we know, Donald Trump has until tomorrow night, given that target letter, to answer that. But sources say it is highly doubtful that he would accept an offer, to testify, himself. After that, his legal team is going to be on indictment watch. Tonight, they are already bracing for it. All of this is coming, as we are now learning what kind of charges, Trump might be facing. This is included in that target letter that he got. According to multiple news outlets, there are three federal statutes that are included, in the letter that Trump's team got, on Sunday night. Deprivation of rights, conspiracy to commit an offense or defraud the United States, and witness tampering. Serious crimes and historic times. Let's bring in someone, who was once in that inner circle of Trump's. And joining me now is the former National Security Adviser, to Donald Trump, John Bolton. Ambassador, thank you, for being here, tonight. What do you make of the fact that the former President, and your former boss, is on the verge, of potentially being indicted, in this case? JOHN BOLTON, FORMER TRUMP NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER, FORMER U.S. AMBASSADOR TO UNITED NATIONS: Well, we haven't seen the indictment yet. Although, I agree, it certainly looks like one is coming almost any day. We don't know the exact scope of it, which could have a big influence. But I have to say, this being the third indictment, not having seen a real political impact, negative to Trump, on the first two? In fact, if anything, it helped bolster his stature with supporters. A third indictment, or even a fourth indictment, I don't think is going to change that much politically. I think the single most important question, now, on the legal side is whether any of these cases actually get to trial, before the 2024 election. That's what's going to be important. Not this indictment or that indictment or the next indictment. Which case, if any, gets to trial, and does he get convicted?",

If Trump really wanted justice, he'd be saying, \"I want to go to trial as soon as possible, and remove this cloud, from over my candidacy.\" That's obviously not what he wants to do. I happen to think his attorneys, in the documents case, made a substantial mistake, by putting it fairly directly to the judge, they don't want the case before the election. That shows the real strategy. And when you think about it, it is shocking. Now, it may be difficult to have a kind of traffic jam here, with all these cases. But I think it's part of the court's duty, to make sure that the public interest is served as well. The defendant has a legitimate interest in time, to prepare his or her defense. But I do think, in this case, giving special privileges, to somebody, just because they're a candidate for president, is not consistent with the notion of one law for all.",

So, I think the intent issue here is difficult. And I think that's where the focus of Trump's defense will be.",

Do you expect that Sidney Powell, the Rudy Giuliani, the John Eastmans, that those attorneys should be indicted, in this case?",

Therefore, it must have been stolen.\" And I think the worst outcome, in any of these cases, from the public interest point of view, of keeping Trump, from becoming president, again, is that he's acquitted, or gets a hung jury, because that fits directly, into his argument that these cases were all political, he's being persecuted. So, a lot rides on this. I'm sure Jack Smith understands that. But a win here could shake up this election. An acquittal or a hung jury could give Trump, the Republican nomination, for sure, in my view, and might win in the election.",

He also testified, I should note, as an expert, before the House January 6th congressional committee. Thank you so much, for being here. When you look at this, and you hear this reporting, about these three statutes that are allegedly cited in this letter? That is what Trump is ultimately charged with. Which one do you think is the most important? BEN GINSBERG, ELECTION LAWYER, TESTIFIED BEFORE JANUARY 6 COMMITTEE: Well, it really depends on what the facts that Jack Smith presents are. In other words, if this is a case, where there is a broad conspiracy, with lots of information that we don't know yet? Then any of the three could be serious. I think the deprivation of rights count is probably the most interesting, because that could, in effect, open up a discussion, the proof that Trump would have to make that his charges of rigged elections were actually true.

And essentially, as \"The New York Times\" sums this up, tonight, it was to provide a tool, for federal agents, to go after KKK members, who engaged in terrorism.

He lost all of them. 14 of them never got to -- were dismissed on procedural grounds. 14, he voluntarily dismissed. Over 30 actually were hearings on the merits.

What's interesting is that Jack Smith has been able to talk to all those people. And there are a series of court decisions we know about, in which attempts to invoke either Executive privilege, or attorney- client privilege, have been rejected by the courts.

There is a grainy Telegram video that appears to show him alive and well, greeting soldiers, in Belarus. I should note, tonight, that CNN has not independently confirmed that this is indeed Prigozhin. But if so, it would be the first time that he has been seen, in public, since he led that attempted mutiny, against the Russian military, nearly a month ago. The whole saga still has Western intelligence officials, scratching their heads, over how it happened, and how he's still alive. Even Britain's spy chief, Richard Moore, the Head of MI6, who I should note, rarely speaks out in public, and certainly not as candidly as he did today, said, he was stumped. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) RICHARD MOORE, BRITAIN'S MI6 CHIEF: Prigozhin started off, I think, as a traitor at breakfast. He had been pardoned by supper. And then, a few days later, he was invited for tea. So, there are some things and even the Chief of MI6 finds that a little bit difficult to try and interpret, in terms of who's in and who's out. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And yet, Prigozhin doesn't seem to be on that spectrum. The question is where exactly is he? He presented possibly the greatest challenge, to Putin's rule, in his entire time, in the Kremlin. And he was essentially moved out, right? He's no longer in charge of Wagner, at least not as he was. He's not leading his forces in Bakhmut. The relationship between Wagner forces, in Africa, and Prigozhin, right now, is also unclear. And yet, if this video is to be believed, and CNN teams have geo- located to a base, outside of Minsk, the question is if Prigozhin remains open? But if this video is to be believed, he clearly has at least some of his forces, and safe haven, in Belarus. It's also worth noting that the Head of MI6 said Putin had to make this deal, with Prigozhin, to save his own skin. And that Kaitlan, in and of itself, is very telling.",

Where was he when hospitals in these small towns were closing? Where was he when people in these communities were suffering, from starvation wages? Nowhere to be found. But instead he comes to sing a song that harkens back to the vision that harkens back to fear of outsiders, this racist violence, that led my grandparents to leave these small towns, fleeing Jim Crow terrorism. This is something that we must condemn, because if we normalize, this racist, violent rhetoric, then we normalized, racist, violent actions. And we cannot allow that. Because we see what's happening in this nation. I was expelled challenging gun violence.
