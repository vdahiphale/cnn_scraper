The fact that he is being held in Moscow's notoriously formative of prison for a period of two months. He has served about 2.5 weeks of that, so that is what we're going to hear discussed today.It seems pretty unlikely given the severity of the charges against him, those espionage charges that he could be bailed or move to house arrest or something like that. Obviously, if politics is at play here, as well as the U.S. government, clearly strongly suspect that makes the situation even more bleak for him. As to whether we will see him, we don't know if he will appear in person. He could appear also via video link. This will be really the first chance to see him. Publicly since that arrest. He was, though, granted his first consular access on Monday, 19 days after he was arrested. The U.S. ambassador herself, Lynne Tracy, visited him and said he was in good spirits, staying strong. We've actually just seen Lynne Tracy walk into the Moscow City court where this hearing is going to be held, as well as one of Evan Gershkovich's lawyers.

We have heard before, as saying this is part of an anti-China smear campaign, denying the existence of these police stations, insisting they were service enters, staffed by volunteers helping Chinese citizens living overseas renew their government documents such as driver's license.But I think because these indictments cover Chinese national police officers, the rhetoric this time appears to be hardened with this official even try to turn the tables on the U.S., accusing the U.S. of being the biggest offender in transnational surveillance and repression. Now, we haven't covering this issue for quite some time, human rights groups have shared with us Chinese government documents showing the maintain more than 100 such facilities across the globe, often in the guise of restaurants and community centers, not only monitoring, pressuring dissidents but also propagating Beijing's ideology. But I think what's different here is the timing. These indictments came at a time when hostilities already so high in Washington towards China. This is certainly going to cement this notion about increasingly provocative Chinese behavior, even encroaching on U.S. sovereignty, especially on the heels and the following that balloon incident. So this is undoubtedly going to trigger more anti-U.S. rhetoric and policy here. So this kind of downward spiral, Christine, making so much more difficult for the White House, for President Biden to defuse tensions and to manage this very critically important relationship. And just to add one word here, Christine, as you started introducing the story, the Chinese censors blocked CNN signal in China, just showing how sensitive they are towards the issue and so CNN viewers in China right now seeing color bars on their TV screens, Christine.",

Plus, the pizza delivery guy who literally helped trip up a man running from police. And it's tax day, everyone. We'll break down what to expect in refund checks. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) [05:15:16] ROMANS:  The Fox News defamation trial starts just hours from now, the $1.6 billion lawsuit by Dominion voting system was supposed to start yesterday. You know, the judge announced a delay moving into today without any kind of explanation. Opening statements are expected this morning, and if there is time, the court could hear testimony from potential witnesses. I want to bring in CNN legal analyst Joey Jackson. Joey, this is really -- you know, what a show, what a show. I heard somebody say it's the biggest show that Fox has not produced. You know, CNN learned that Dominion brought more than 40 boxes of evidence into the courtroom ahead of today's trial, all lined up on the -- on the benches, below the benches, along the wall. What could those boxes contained to make a strong case for Dominion?",

You'd have to imagine that those boxes contain voluminous information that speaks to a narrative of this being false, right? You cannot go on air and spin a web of lies that you and this will be in contention that you knowingly or at least recklessly believed not to be true. So understand the standard that will operating under, Christine, right?The standard is whether you had knowledge of its falsity or reckless disregard as to its true. So you have to think that any evidence, whether they're in boxes or on technology would have to really grip into that, to demonstrate that you had no belief that our software was flawed, to the extent that at least you were proclaiming you knew and had information, in fact to the contrary, but you chose politics over truth. And I think that when the evidence ultimately is revealed, it will demonstrate at least from what we know the narrative that anchor after anchor after anchor was going on and just spinning this information that just had no bearing with reality.",

So what happens is it it's not illegal from a criminal perspective, it's illegal from a civil perspective when we talk about the legalities and illegalities. The whole essence of defamation, when you talk about defamatory, we always talk about, hey, you can say anything you want, right? At any time, but we know they're restrictions. You can't yell fire in a movie theater can injure other people. You can't spin false statements that are injurious to someone's reputation.And so, here, that's the argument. The fact is, is that in the event that you say something, and what you say happens to be false, as in untrue, at it impairs or affects a company, that's a problem. And so I think in this particular trial, you're going to see it bifurcated -- like every civil trial as to whether that was the case, right, whether you were saying false things and then in the event, the jury concludes you were, you pivot to the issue of, well, how much have you damaged me, as in Dominion?",

The verdict as to the issue of falsity, and then you pivot to your very question as to how are you damaged? You have to prove those damages. You have to indicate the loss of reputation. Have you lost contract? Have you lost potential business? Have you lost valuation into the future? And so, I think what they're doing, Christine is their pairing that so they can make their case, proved their case and assert their measure of damages, whether that be one billion or 1.6 billion.

However, a short while later he was contradicted by his own spokesperson on the official Facebook page of the armed forces, and they said, we're not aware of any coordination with the mediators and the international community about the truth and the rebellion's declaration of a 24-hour truce aims to cover up the crushing defeat it will receive in a few hours.
