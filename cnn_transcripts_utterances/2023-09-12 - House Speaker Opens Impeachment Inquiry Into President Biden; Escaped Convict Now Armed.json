GEORGE BIVENS, PENNSYLVANIA STATE POLICE:  And at 10:10 p.m., a call was received from a resident on Coventryville Road indicating a short Hispanic male, no shirt and wearing dark pants had entered his garage while the homeowner was in it, and that he grabbed a .22 rifle that was leaning in the corner of the garage.

Now, the big question is, what happens next? Obviously, this man is very dangerous. Police are really preparing for any eventuality.

He knows how to get from A -- to point A to point B without the assistance of technology. And so he is definitely aware of the area. And what is most concerning is, with the rifle and the scope, that he could set up an ambush, or, if he sees the officers coming through the woods, he's able to preposition and get ready. So the tactical officers from all those law enforcement agencies really need to be cautious when proceeding, so it's not traveling through with those heavy horses, the canines.

But the bigger, obviously, looming question is, is there going to be time for that, given the fact that Matt Gaetz is expected to go to the floor at noon, obviously, Kevin McCarthy now trying to get out ahead of whatever Gaetz is going to say at noon at this 11:00 a.m. statement. Like I said, we expect the McCarthy could come out at any moment. He was supposed to begin at 11:00 a.m. We're now a few minutes past that hour. But, obviously, this is all moving very quickly.

Now, what we're seeing here, and you listen to Lauren's reporting that you guys were just talking about, there's also a faction of Republicans, 18 of whom sit in districts that Joe Biden won, we're entering into the election season, who are concerned that if, indeed, Kevin McCarthy takes the full conference, and demands that the desires of the far right wing be met, that they are going to be left to walk the plank, specifically on something like moving towards an impeachment inquiry. And they too are a large enough group to be larger than this narrow five-seat majority or whatever that Kevin McCarthy hasn't. And so he has it coming it from all sides here. And because of the way, as you know, he won the speakership, to your point before, this third undercurrent, besides the budget battle to avoid a shutdown and whether or not to proceed with impeachment, is McCarthy's own survival, because this was one of the things he agreed to, that one person can call to vacate the chair and then put that up for a majority vote in the House.",

He did not say that just now. In fact, he said that they would -- he was directing that key House committee, the House Oversight Committee, to open up an impeachment inquiry. Now, one big reason why perhaps the speaker is not moving in the direction of having a vote, he does not have enough support, the majority of the House, to open up an impeachment inquiry at the moment. That's because there are a number of Republicans, including ones in swing districts, and some conservatives like Ken Buck of Colorado, who are skeptical about moving forward with an impeachment inquiry. That means, if there were actually a vote to formally open up this probe going forward, at the moment, he would not have turned 218 votes, as Democrats would vote against it, and more than four Republicans would vote against it as well. So he is now telling the House Oversight Committee to move forward. And one big reason why there is not the support at the moment is because of the fact that they have yet to figure out -- come up with definitive proof or evidence to suggest that Joe Biden took official action as vice president to aid his son Hunter Biden or that -- so Biden profited in any way by Hunter Biden's business dealings. And these allegations of pay-to-play scheme, they have simply not proven yet, which is why there is a number of members who are skeptical, not just in the House, but also Senate Republicans as well. So McCarthy here, though, is still taking a very significant step by opening up an impeachment probe. Remember, if Joe Biden is in fact, impeached, he would just be the fourth president in American history to be charged with high crimes or misdemeanors, Donald Trump, of course, was impeached twice over two separate issues. But that is still a ways away. Now we are going into the part of the impeachment investigation where they have to actually continue to gather evidence, try to build the case against Joe Biden, and try to charge him with high crimes or misdemeanors, and then try to get the votes in the House to do that. That is still a very, very heavy lift for Kevin McCarthy. But this action today in some ways being pushed by the far right of his conference, which has been very vocal at this moment for the speaker to move ahead on this issue, the speaker aligning himself with that faction in his conference to move ahead with this impeachment inquiry. Now the question is, what evidence will they gather? Will they actually have a vote either to formalize this inquiry at some point or to actually impeach the president?
