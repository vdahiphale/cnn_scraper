And we begin with major developments in the Fulton County investigation into former President Donald Trump. The district attorney there just notified two witnesses to testify before the grand jury next week as she prepares to seek a potential fourth indictment against Trump and some of his allies. She will attempt to show that they conspired to overturn his 2020 election loss. And today, we got the strongest indication of that from former Georgia lieutenant governor and CNN contributor, Geoff Duncan. Take a look. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

That's who we know so far who were notified and said, please show up, please testify before the grand jury on Tuesday.So this is a good indication that she is going to start presenting her case early next week. We've heard from other sources that this is likely to take two days so she could begin this presentation on Monday, go through Tuesday, and then ask the grand jury essentially, to hand up their indictments Tuesday afternoon or evening. You know, we've heard that she is likely to seek charges against more than a dozen individuals in this case. So it's not just Donald Trump that she has been looking at.",

This grand jury that he is going before now, they haven't heard any of that.They have been hearing cases about armed robberies, they've been hearing cases about murderers, you know, sort of run of the mill cases in Fulton County. And so what I think is that the Fulton County district attorney's team is going to come in before that grand jury and say either Monday or Tuesday, okay, today, you're going to hear a different kind of case. And then they're going to put on witnesses that can sort of craft this narrative about the efforts to try to overturn the 2020 election, whether it was the phone call between Donald Trump and Brad Raffensperger, where Trump asked him to find the votes, whether it's the fake electoral scheme, whether it's the voting breach in Coffee County, Georgia and then she will ask for these indictments she's seeking.",

He's someone who showed up and gave, you know, a totally bogus presentation before state lawmakers, have plenty of these conspiracy theories.

So this is a big case, and I think where the defense is going to go is first trying to find a jury that they'll find some sympathy with that will hang -- that at least, somebody will not agree to find beyond a reasonable doubt.

We've seen barricades go up around the courthouse. We've seen a huge police presence out there. We know her personal security has been beefed up, and I suspect that we're going to see even more of that this week, just because, you know, it's hard for them to discern what is going to be the difference between an internet troll, someone who is firing off, you know, threats via e-mail or leaving anonymous voicemails versus someone who would actually be willing to try to show up, and I think that's something that they take very seriously and are trying to guard against.",

Today, former Georgia lieutenant governor, Geoff Duncan revealed to CNN, he will testify before grand jury Tuesday. Duncan is also a CNN political commentator. All of this as the son of the current president faces mounting legal troubles of his own. Just yesterday, the Justice Department appointed a special counsel to oversee the prosecution of Hunter Biden. Joining us now to discuss all of this Seung Min Kim, White House reporter for the Associated Press and Laura Barron-Lopez, a White House correspondent for PBS NewsHour. It is great to see both of you. Laura, I want to start first with you. We see the former president in Iowa today. He is campaigning. What are we expecting to see from him in the next few days as this goes on in Georgia? Because now, this would be a fourth indictment. He kind of has a playbook here. LAURA BARRON-LOPEZ, CNN POLITICAL ANALYST: He does. He right away, sometimes gets ahead of the indictment, especially if his team is notified of the details, then he will often post on Truth Social ahead of it, attacking the prosecutor -- in this case, he would be attacking the Fulton County district attorney, Fani Willis and her entire team and essentially just saying that it isn't true that this isn't something that he's done and rallying his base around him. And we've seen that each time that an indictment has dropped, the Republican base really supports him and so does a significant amount of establishment Republicans in the Republican Party, particularly House Republicans saying that they want to investigate the investigators, and that is what I think we can expect to see come next week.",

BARRON-LOPEZ: That's right -- a lot of -- I mean, the one that's right behind Trump now by double digits, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, has defended the former president repeatedly even going so far as to float a potential pardon and saying that attacking the DOJ, we've seen Senator Tim Scott also attack the Justice Department and the country's justice system. I was just -- when we talk about the general election, though, I don't think these indictments are ultimately going to help the president. They are clearly a big boon in the primary because the base rallies around him, but I was talking to a Republican voter in Arizona, just this past week, someone who voted Biden in 2020, who had previously voted Republican his entire life, and I wondered if he had soured on Biden and he said no. That he planned to vote for Biden again, and that he couldn't find a Republican candidate in the field that he could support because they weren't challenging the former president. And he thought Tim Scott could have been someone he could have supported, but because he's actually supporting the former president or defending him when these indictments come down, this Republican -- you know, registered Republican voter said there's no one really for me, he might protest vote for Chris Christie in the GOP primary.",

You know, obviously this is a family matter, a personal matter. President Biden has talked a lot about how he really is proud of Hunter for overcoming a lot of his personal struggles, but it also has turned into a political issue with the number of investigations that we're seeing on Capitol Hill, with Republicans in the presidential race -- or his potential Republican opponents are weaponizing this matter. I do think it's fascinating how congressional Republicans after calling for a special counsel in this case for months, now that Merrick Garland has done so and actually appointed the attorney that Republicans had called for are not pleased with this decision, and they believe that they -- that the Justice Department has done this to particularly stonewall Congressional investigations that they are doing, that multiple committees are doing into alleged, and we should say, unproven, you know, financial dealings involving the family.

Right before the fires, we were in what we call SOS foster, which means we are over capacity in our kennels. And what we asked the community to do is take animals from the kennels and place them into their own homes to make space for what we know is going to be inundated with animals that are lost missing or need medical care and that is exactly what the community has done.
