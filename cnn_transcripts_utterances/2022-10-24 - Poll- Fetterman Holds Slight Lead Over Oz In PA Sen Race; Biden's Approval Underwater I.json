Right now, some brand-new CNN polling out of Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan. An important read of your midterm mood, just 15 days before we count your votes.Plus, a disturbing reality check about what democracy looks like in 2022. Armed vigilantes donning tactical gear patrolling a ballot drop box in Arizona. And a new warning from Congresswoman Liz Cheney, the promise that if Donald Trump testifies the January 6 committee won't let him turn it into a circus. The warning in her view, nominating Trump would equal the death of the GOP as we know it. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. LIZ CHENEY, (R) WYOMING: I think that the party has either got to come back from where we are right now, which is a very dangerous and toxic place. Or the party will splinter and there will be a new conservative party that rises. And if Donald Trump is the nominee of the Republican Party, the party will shatter and there will be a conservative party that rises in his place. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

New numbers from three key states just 15 days of course, from election day. The big races are closed, and voters tell us they are highly motivated to vote, but it also tell us they're in a gloomy mood about the state of the economy.Let's begin, we'll look at two races absolutely critical for the Senate balance of power. We begin with the Pennsylvania Senate race. No incumbent on the ballot here, Republican held seat right now, Democrats hope to pick this seat up. They hope to pick it up to build on their Senate majority or to offset, maybe a loss somewhere else on the battlefield. Democrat John Fetterman has a lead 51 percent, Republican Dr. Mehmet Oz 45 percent. This leads small though, just outside the polls' margin of error. Democrats hoping, they can pick up Pennsylvania as Joe Biden did. Donald Trump won it in 2016. Joe Biden did in 2020. Democrats are hoping they can pick up the Senate seat, but you see how close it is. We'll go inside these numbers in just a moment. Let's move over to Wisconsin. A Republican incumbent there, Republicans hoped would put this seat away right now. You see these numbers, they have not. 50 percent for the Republican incumbent. 49 percent for the Democrat. The Lieutenant Governor Mandela Barnes, no clear leader in this race. Again, Democrats would love to have a pickup in a Republican state. Republicans confident in the end, they can close here, but you see how close this race is, as it goes in. So, what is motivating voters as we go through it? But we also pulled in Michigan, we'll get to the results in the governor's race there in a few moments. But in these three states, these three industrial battleground states, the states that were so important remember, in the 2020 election. Donald Trump won them in 2016. Joe Biden flipped them in 2020. What's first in 2022, the economy and inflation overwhelmingly, 46 percent In Michigan, 47 percent in Wisconsin, 44 percent in Pennsylvania. That would lead you to believe the climate is favorable to Republicans because voters are mad at the current state, and they take that out on the party and power. Abortion ranks second in both states, notice a little bit higher in Michigan where there is a constitutional amendment on the ballot about abortion rights, a little bit higher there. Voting rights and election integrity run third, as you look at this. When you see these big numbers at the top, 44, 47, 46. The bones of the poll, if you will, would suggest the climate is somewhat favorable to Republicans. But there's a lot to dissect. With me to share their reporting and their insights, Seung Min Kim of the Associated Press, the Republican pollster Kristen Soltis Anderson, and our CNN political director, David Chalian. David, let me start with you. Most of these seats, the Senate seats. If you go back to Pennsylvania, and then Wisconsin, absolutely critical. When we get into the day after the election or the days after the election, we're trying to figure out, do the Democrats keep that majority or not? What jumps out most?",

      "sentences": "And so, as the polling professional at the table. We obviously look first at the horse race numbers. Is there anybody ahead? Is it a big lead? Is it a, you know, lead that you can catch during. When you look deep into these polls and what jumps out to you? In both these cases, it's very close, slight democratic advantage in Pennsylvania. As a Republican at the table, are those seats in play for the Democrats? Or do you see something in the bones that maybe helps Republicans in the final two weeks?KRISTEN SOLTIS ANDERSON, REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST &amp; POLLSTER: Well, everything's in play. And if anybody tells you, they're confident that they know exactly which way the United States Senate will go. I wish I had that kind of confidence. But I do think that inside the numbers in this poll, it's fascinating in the race between Fetterman and Oz, for instance. Independent voters breaking pretty heavily for us. So even though the top line number shows pretty good result for Fetterman, underneath the surface, whether it's an advantage among independents, whether it's that advantage among voters who think the economy is most important. There are things going on there that suggest to Republicans, as you get to the finish line, if they're able to, one, hang on to those voters who might be on the fence about whether they turn out at all. Those folks that might be late deciders, it seems like if those pieces are in play, they will break toward the Republican, it wouldn't surprise me if this closes even further as we get toward.",

But if you look at the partisans, I think it helps explain why Fetterman is a little bit ahead. He has more consolidation among Democrats.Dr. Oz has some work to do, Mehmet Oz does. I mean, if I were writing a to-do-list off of this poll, I would say, Oz needs to still - he's made progress, but he still has to consolidate the Republican vote in a pretty significant way. That discrepancy as well as their unfavorables, he is not as well liked, Oz is to Fetterman. I think that's why you're seeing Fetterman on top.",

And some more suburban Republicans who turned on Trump say, is he really a Trumpy? Or would he be a traditional Republican? I think that the piece of that.One of the north stars in any midterm election was the president's approval rating. We are two weeks out now. If you look through these states right here in Pennsylvania, the president's approval rating 45, disapprove 55, in Wisconsin 43, disapprove 57, in Michigan 42, 58. That's our national poll of polls. If you look at the far right of your screen, they're pretty consistent, pretty consistent, give or take a point or two, the present United States is underwater, including, again, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Michigan. If you're taking the 2016 map versus the 2020 map for president, adding Georgia and Arizona, those were the states that made the difference, that made Joe Biden president struggling. SEUNG MIN KIM, WHITE HOUSE REPORTER, ASSOCIATED PRESS &amp; CNN POLITICAL ANALYST: Struggling very much so, and that is why as we have said time and time again, for the last several weeks that Joe Biden is not a popular asset on the campaign trail. But you do see that approval numbers a little bit higher in Pennsylvania than in other states, which is why the White House, which is why the president along with Kamala Harris, the president is making his 15th visit to Pennsylvania during his presidency this Friday for an explicit campaign event for Pennsylvania Democrats. So, the White House believes that again, if you can at least flip Pennsylvania, that gives them a lot of breathing room for the other states that could potentially flip in the other directions such as Nevada or Georgia.",

But Kristen, when you look again, you look at the horse race numbers and you see very close races, then you try to look at the bones to see, you know, where's the mood of the people? How's the economy doing in your state right now? This is gloomy, and you would assume this is advantage Republicans.In Pennsylvania 8 percent of likely voters think the economy is getting better. 63 percent say it's getting worse. In Wisconsin 10 percent of likely voters say it's getting better, 61 percent say getting worse. Michigan saying 13 percent, say it's getting better. 61 percent say it's getting worse.

The 20 percent Wisconsin who say their strategic voters that are concerned about control the Senate. They're actually favoring Mandela Barnes against the incumbent Ron Johnson there. So, you have two different stories being told about how those strategic voters are playing it. I would also just note, the character, the integrity, that issue, it's down on the list here. It does not, you know, about half as many say that that matters to their voters the major factor as the candidate policy positions.",

He keeps saying, he's going to be the 51st vote in the Senate for abortion to bust the filibuster on union rights.And it seems that, at least if you're - what really matters to you is that is who controls the - who controls the Senate. It's actually Republicans who are favored in that part. And I think that's the calculation that particularly a lot of voters in Georgia are making, especially with the personal shortcomings of the Republican candidate there, but many voters are overlooking that says, I want a Republican representing me in the Senate.",

That's outside the margin of error.And in Pennsylvania, the Democrat Josh Shapiro, he's currently the attorney general close a 15-point advantage over the Republican nominee Doug Mastriano. In Wisconsin, though, take a peek there, the polling there are no clear leader of pretty much a dead heat in the matchup between the incumbent Democrat Tony Evers, Republican challenger Tim Michels. Evers maybe at 50 to 48 percent. Right here are great reporters and our Republican pollster Kristen Soltis Anderson is back with us. This was, I just want to put up. Number one, these are critical elections in the states, the governor of your state is critical to you, especially in the age when the Supreme Court says, abortion rights is a state issue, where it may be other state issues do as well. But these are also, these are states that Donald Trump won in 2016. And then were flipped by Joe Biden in 2020.

He said about 9They responded, \"without hesitation\" they actually made entry into the school he said, and didn't know exactly where the shooter was, but got reports from students who were fleeing that school that there was a shooter inside, then they actually heard gunshots and ran toward that location.

As you said, John, two people, we know of that were killed in this incident. One adult from a belief to be gunshot wound died at the hospital, and another was a teenage girl who died there at the scene. There are eight people in total that were transported to the hospital.

Now, at this point, what he understands is the injuries of those that were injured are about gunshot injuries, shrapnel injuries, as you can imagine with an active shooter situation. And at this point, authorities have cleared that screws school, they don't believe there are any other threats. However, they did say that this shooter believed to be about 20 years old. So not a student at the high school. They're still trying to ID him, figure out what his relationship is to this high school. But he did have a car there on the scene. So, authorities, as part of the investigation are going to go through that car, determine if there are other threats with that car as well. So yes, just a devastating incident.
