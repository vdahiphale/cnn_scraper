Of course, defense counsel will try to attack the credibility of the investigation and beyond, certainly with the gun itself. How do you -- how do these investigations work?THOMAS CHITTUM, RETIRED ASSOCIATE DEPUTY DIRECTOR AT ATF, SVP OF FORENSIC SERVICES AT SOUNDTHINKING, INC.: When a gun is fired, there's a lot of impact and pressure, and that causes the harder metal of a firearm to leave impressions on the softer metal of the cartridge casing. During the manufacturing process for firearms, each firearm picks up unique, microscopic, individual characteristics, and it's those markings that are left behind on those softer cartridge casings in the bullet as it travels down the barrel. So, a forensic firearms examiner will use the evidence recovered at the crime scene, the fired cartridge casings, maybe even the projectiles if they are intact (ph), and will compare them to a test- fired sample from the recovered firearm. And looking for those unique characteristics, they can compare and match the two.",

It also in and of itself is a firearm under the law. The other parts to that firearm like the slide, like the barrel, those are not regulated by law. And the gun that was recovered in this case had a 3D-printed frame, but the other components were metal, so it will not be an impediment to a firearms examiner matching them.The thing that it might thwart is being able to identify where the firearm came from, and I think that raises an interesting question here. There's some belief that perhaps he used a 3D-printed firearm because he didn't want to leave a trail connecting himself to it.

Now, I want to know the man behind the eyes that we're seeing and get into the mindset. The detail that we're getting tonight of Mangione, having no contact with his mother since July despite her attempting to contact him over and over again. What does this revelation add to the profile of this suspected killer? MARY ELLEN O'TOOLE, FORMER SENIOR PROFILER AND SPECIAL AGENT, FBI: Well, it certainly suggests that there was possibly some social isolation that was taking place, which could be a real problem. And what I mean by that is he separated himself from his family and even friends said that they hadn't heard from him for months. And just that social isolation where he pulls away from people that were very important to him at one time or another can actually cause a certain amount and, in some cases, a great deal of depression. So that would tell me that something else was going on with him mentally at that point where he decided to pull away from people, and investigators are going to want to find out what that was. Was it related to a health issue or was it in addition to a health issue? And perhaps, the reason that mother called and filed a police report is because she already knew that he was missing.

Mangione's notebooks have multiple references to Ted Kaczynski. He does have one note in there where he says he opted not to use a bomb in the attack because it could kill \"innocents,\" his quote. Shooting to him was more targeted. That distinction he draws, what does that say to you? O'TOOLE: It tells me he's a little bit naive or maybe a whole lot naive because the devices that Ted Kaczynski built were really pretty complicated and they were extremely effective. You have to know what you're doing if you're going to build a bomb. You have to have some background, some knowledge, some experience. You have to have the components, you have to have a place to do it, you have to know what you're doing. And that, just considering that, was probably pretty overwhelming. And yes, granted, a bomb can end up killing other people, but I just think the complexities of building a device were probably a very compelling reason for him not to do it.",

But here's what's interesting. The majority of our mass and school shooters are young males under the age of 30. And when you go back and you look at their writings or their diaries, you see where they look to and they aspire to other prior shooters. And that's not something that you see in other criminal behavior. You don't see bank robbers or people that go out and do jewel heists. They don't look to other people to say, I want to emulate or be like them.
