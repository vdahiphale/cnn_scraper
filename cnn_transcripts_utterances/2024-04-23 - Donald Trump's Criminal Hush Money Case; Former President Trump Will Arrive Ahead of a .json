So, this is Biden versus Trump margin nationally.Look, in January and February, you had a pretty clear Trump lead, right? Plus five, plus four, plus five. And you had the Marist poll that had Biden up by one, but within the margin of error. A Trump lead. Look at what's happened in April, though. All of these polls, all of them have shifted to be more friendly to Biden, plus four, plus three, plus one, but it was plus four Trump back in January and February, and plus five to now plus two. So, something is cooking, Kate. Something is cooking in the polls, and whatever is cooking seems to be helping Joe Biden. And one of the things that might be cooking is the fact that the attention has turned from the Republican primary now to Trump's legal problems because that's really been the math -- main thing that's been in the news.",

If you're paying little to no attention, Trump leads among these voters by 18 points.So, the more people are focusing in on the Trump cases, they're actually more likely to vote for Joe Biden than for Donald Trump. The less attention that you're paying, the more likely you are to vote for Donald Trump. So, the fact is, if you're paying more attention, you're more likely to vote for Joe Biden.

David Pecker and Donald Trump were for decades a match made in media heaven. So, how did it all come to this? DONALD TRUMP, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT AND U.S. REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  I don't think they even paid any money to that tabloid, OK? I don't think we made a payment to that tabloid. Nobody, except for me, would be looked at like this. Nobody. FOREMAN (voice-over):  For a long time, the relationship was good for both men. Trump gave Pecker's \"National Enquirer\" access to his fame. The tabloid gave him headlines. Trump catches Russia's White House spy. Trump must build the wall. Trump takes charge.

JAMES SCHULTZ CNN LEGAL COMMENTATOR AND FORMER TRUMP WHITE HOUSE LAWYER:  So first off, you know, the prosecutors have a bunch of witnesses with baggage, David Pecker being one of them, right? So, David Pecker made a deal. David Pecker is now turned on Donald Trump. I think the Trump team is going to look to discredit him for the deal that he cut.

Jurors are going to wonder about their motives for testifying, but being such an early witness, it really sets the stage for jurors to create this overarching case story in their minds.And then once they do that, the other witnesses will either reinforce for them what that case story is, or if the witnesses get up there and there's some contradictions, then that will go against it.

They look at whether witnesses are consistent, they look at whether or not they're knowledgeable. Are they evasive? Are they -- do they come off as arrogant? And a lot of times too, which is interesting, is that jurors look at nonverbal communication as well. So, they don't just look at what the witness is actually saying, that is important, but they also look at how the witness is saying it and how they come off when they're testifying under oath. And that -- what's really important too is consistency between direct and cross- examination. So, David Pecker's getting his story out for the prosecution.

Politicians try to hide their baggage all the time from the general public when they're running for office. So, now they have to look at the true crimes that make this a felony, right? Remember, this would have been a misdemeanor, but for the fact that they made allegations that crimes were covered up. Campaign finance, tax, those kinds of things. They're going to have to make a showing on that at some point in time.

This is not like any of his campaign rallies or campaign events, or even the debates that he participated in. So, this is a very different process. I think it's really important for Trump and his team to keep in mind that he has to just, respect the process and come off as someone who's treating this very seriously because these are serious charges, and he deserves a presumption of innocence.",

You, when you access care, when you go see a doctor, when you enter a hospital, when you see a medical professional, and you provide, because you're required or you're requested, very personal health information, that information is entitled to protections under federal law.

And Voyager 1 is now, as you said, about 15 billion miles away -- million -- billion miles away in interstellar space, way beyond our solar system.And so, these spacecrafts are just really old and they're really far away, right, to begin with? But in November of 2023, Sara, Voyager 1 -- the engineers started noticing that Voyager 1 was sending back data that was indecipherable. Basically, the data that was being sent back to Earth in a code of, you know, zeros and ones was stuck in a loop. And so, NASA engineers were stuck with this problem of, you know, how do we troubleshoot an issue with Voyager 1 when this spacecraft is billions of miles away and, get this, it takes 22 hours for a signal on Earth to reach Voyager 1 and then another 22 hours for that signal to get back from Voyager 1 down to Earth. So, two days from the time you send a code, you poke the spacecraft to the time it gets back to Earth. So, those are just some of the issues that they were dealing with. They were able to track the problem to one single chip. We don't know what went wrong, Sara. It might have just worn out after 46 years. It might have been hit by too much radiation in space. Whatever they did, the NASA engineers were able to get it out of that stuck loop. They were able to stop that chip from what it was doing and move the memory that it was storing elsewhere. And just a few days ago, Sara, they were able to get their first readable, understandable signal from Voyager 1. So, it is back and it is sending us, you know, we're not getting those images there of Jupiter and Saturn that you're seeing. I mean, those are the images that Voyager is so well known for.
