Joaquin Guzman Lopez, the son of notorious drug lord El Chapo, was arrested by U.S. authorities in Texas Thursday.He was taken into custody alongside Ismael Zambada Garcia, who is known as El Mayo and thought to be the current leader and co-founder of the Sinaloa drug cartel. Federal officials say both men were arrested without incident after arriving in El Paso on board a private plane. The Justice Department describes the Sinaloa cartel as one of the most violent and powerful drug trafficking organizations in the world. Both men are facing several charges for allegedly smuggling tens of thousands of pounds of drugs, including fentanyl, into the United States every year. Sinaloa's other co-founder, El Chapo, was convicted in the U.S. in 2019 on ten counts linked to federal drug offenses. Even before the curtain goes up on the Paris Olympics, the games have been rocked by the first allegations of cheating. Bev Priestman, the head coach of Canada's women's football team, has been suspended for the remainder of the game for the allegations that drones were used to spy on rival teams. Women's football took center stage Thursday with the U.S. easily defeating Zambia. Trinity Rodman opened the scoring for the Americans with a turn and shot. Then two more goals came within eight minutes for a final score, three-nil. Thursday saw a new record in women's archery, with South Korea's Lim Si-Hyeon scoring 694 points in the individual ranking round. And will see or won't she?

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) NICK PATON WALSH, CNN CHIEF INTERNATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Once battered, but now flourishing in the shadows. ISIS seemed crushed in Syria, but ahead of the French Olympics, extremism experts are seeing a troubling resurgence, one disturbingly targeting teenagers using social media platforms like TikTok to recruit. According to a landmark study by researcher Peter Neumann, nearly two- thirds of ISIS-related arrests in Europe in the past nine months have been of teenagers. PETER NEUMANN, PROFESSOR OF SECURITY STUDIES, KING'S COLLEGE LONDON: We're also seeing groups like ISK, Islamic State Khorasan, specifically targeting young teenagers. And a lot of these young teenagers, they may not be very useful. They may mess up. They may change their mind. But at the end of the day, some of them may actually be quite useful, not least because they are less suspicious. Who would think of a 13-year-old as a terrorist? WALSH (voice-over): This study collates public data on the arrests, some startling. Two teens, age 16 and 18, arrested in April and May for plots on the Olympics, one with a bomb belt. A 14-year-old on a mall, a 15-year-old on a synagogue, and a 15- and 18-year-old plotting together. Germany, too, made arrests of an 18-year-old for a knife attack plot, and also three teens aged 15, 15, and 16, for an ISIS-inspired plot.",
