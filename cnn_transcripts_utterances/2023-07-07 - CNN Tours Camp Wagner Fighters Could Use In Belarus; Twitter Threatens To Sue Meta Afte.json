They've been erected in the past few weeks. There were satellite photographs of this place before and after. And we all believed this is the location where Wagner forces, the mercenaries from Russia would be located if they came to Belarus.That was part of a deal, remember, with the Belarusian leader Alexander Lukashenko inviting Wagner and its leader to come into exile in Belarus as a way of diffusing their military uprising in Russia last month? Well -- I mean, at the moment, though, these tents are completely empty. I mean have a look inside at one of these here. Completely empty. There's nobody in there. It's too dark for us to show you inside but I can tell you, it's just wooden platforms, nobody is in there at the moment. But ultimately, it can house as many as 5000 people. The problem is, of course, the events of yesterday here with the revelations from Alexander Lukashenko, the Belarusian leader, that actually is that that plan is no longer sort of in operation. It's on hold at the moment. And at the moment, Yevgeny Prigozhin, the Wagner leader is not here in Belarus. He said to be in Russia. And not a single Wagner soldier has so far come here. And so, we don't know whether there is going to be a transfer of Wagner to Belarus or not. At the moment, all we can tell you is that it hasn't happened yet. Back to you. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

And I think when you look at it collectively, you're seeing from Pence, from Chris Christie, from Nikki Haley, this sort of general theme about turning a page and then from DeSantis, or folks supporting DeSantis, much more willingness to attack Trump on social issues to try to fall to the right of him.Collectively, if what this does is take all of those GOP rivals and make them more willing to go after Donald Trump, that would mark a real turning point. Remember, for the last several months, it's been you know going after each other or criticizing DeSantis or kind of criticizing Trump and then walking away. But you know, a real carefulness about going directly after Trump because these rivals didn't want to alienate the base. Remember, this is also coming, as all of these legal issues are heating up. So, Trump might want to go to Iowa and talk about ethanol. Nobody else in that -- in that field really wants to concentrate on ethanol. They want to concentrate on Donald Trump. And anything Donald Trump says on the stump can be used against him by prosecutors also. So he needs to be more careful.",

The other question is, is Iowa really going to be, you know, pivotal? And I think that was your earlier point.So, we don't -- we really don't know the answers to any of these questions. Really interesting new poll. This is a Politico-Ipsos survey of Americans showing two really interesting things. One is that more than six in 10 Americans now say they actually want this trial over the classified records on withholding records to be started and done before election day. And the other is that if you combine the share of Republicans who either already think Trump is guilty in that case or who say they don't know, you're at around 45 percent. So, you've got close to half of Republicans now either saying they think the former president did what he's accused of in the holding onto records case or that they're not sure.

It says \"Twitter intends to strictly enforce its intellectual property rights in demands that Meta take immediate steps to stop using any Twitter trade secrets or other highly confidential information.\" Now, it's -- Musk followed up this threat with a tweet saying that competition is fine.
