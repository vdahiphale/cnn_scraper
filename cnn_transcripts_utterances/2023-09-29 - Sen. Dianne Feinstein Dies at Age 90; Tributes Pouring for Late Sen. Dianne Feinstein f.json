      "sentences": "And when he turned and looked at her empty desk, which we see there -- I mean that is -- we've seen this before. And recently when a senator dies, they put the black drape and the white roses on top, and that's a very powerful thing for -- not only her constituents and Americans to see, but for her colleagues who saw her sitting in that seat for so many decades. And when Senator Schumer was talking, you saw Senator Patty Murray behind. And she also came into the United States Senate in the year of the woman in 1992. She was the mom in tennis shoes, that's how she ran.And so, if you take that and what you just said, Sara, that you don't always have to be wearing a pinstripe suit to be strong, Senator Feinstein, along with those other women who came in 1992 really did help to usher in change. Change didn't go far enough for a long time, and you could argue it still is not far enough, and it won't be until the number of seats in the United States Senate equals the number -- the percentage of women who are in this country, not quite there yet, but it is very, very different from when Senator Feinstein first came in. And she had to bear the brunt as so many women who are trailblazers, which is the word that you see in every one of these statements coming out today have to do. She took the harpoon, she had to deal with incredible misogyny and doubting her because she was a woman. So, like a lot of women of that era and women today, she had to work twice as hard to prove that she was good enough to fight for all of the issues that she fought for. KATE BOLDUAN, CNN NEWS CENTRAL CO-ANCHOR:  That's for sure. Dana, stick with us if you could. I think we have CNN Presidential Historian Tim Naftali joining us as well. Tim, kind of getting to what Dana is talking about. This one line from senator -- the senator's chief of staff really continues to stick with me which when he writes, there are few women who can be called senator, chairman, mayor, wife, mom and grandmother.",

And now, minutes from now, President Biden will speak at a farewell ceremony honoring outgoing Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Mark Milley. A man who leaves behind a complicated and controversial legacy.General Milley was appointed by Donald Trump, but the two fell out after Donald Trump began pushing the baseless 2020 election fraud allegations and then in the wake of the January 6th insurrection. Milley determined Trump was such a threat to national security that he called a Chinese general to reassure the nation about U.S. stability.",

You can see President Biden sitting there, the vice president is sitting there, the secretary of defense sitting there, Mark Milley sitting there. This is a huge moment in a transition as Mark Milley will be heading into retirement, and handing it off to the next Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. A big moment for -- a big moment for President Biden, especially, as he will now have a new top military advisor.But Donald Trump, as Sara was talking about, Donald Trump has made really a practice of attacking Mark Milley. He's -- who also was his Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. In a \"Truth Social\" post last week, you will remember, Donald Trump called Mark Milley treasonous, and also says, what he had done was so egregious that at a time -- in times gone by the punishment would have been death, that from the former president about his then top military advisory. President Biden spoke out against what Donald Trump has said. Many people have spoken out against those comments. Here's President Biden just yesterday. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN, U.S. PRESIDENT:  This is the United States of America. And although I don't believe even a majority of the Republicans think that, the silence is deafening. The silence is deafening. Hardly any Republican called out such heinous statements. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

I'm -- just give us some sense of the ceremony and what it means, because there is a transition here, a peaceful transfer of power, we should note. MAJ. MIKE LYONS, U.S. ARMY (RET.):  Yes. I mean, for sure, this is the Chairman of the Joint Staffs, the senior advisor, as the correspondent said. He just advises the president. He has no real command authority. But he oversaw some incredible combustible moments in the past four years. And unfortunately, worked for a boss that confused moral courage with royalty. I think you'd take 43 years of General Milley's service as a green beret, endured tremendous hardship through battles. He was a warrior. And, you know, he takes the job initially because Trump thought he was that guy who was going to be that officer that was going to do what he said all of the time. But he was not going to obey unlawful orders, and I think that's where he drew a hard line.",

We do not take an oath to a king or a queen, a tyrant or a dictator. We do not take an oath to an individual. We take an oath to the constitution.That was so significant. Let's -- just -- and that gets to the core of what I have learned over -- in covering him and those around him of what of the -- of Mark Milley.

And it actually reminded the military of what we're all about.So, again, he's -- makes a mistake but it was used as a way to be a positive. So, again, the military exists for civilian control, that's the bottom line. And I think General Milley brought up the concept of it. We have civilians that are going to potentially give us orders that are against the constitution and the military has to stand up and say, we're not doing that. BOLDUAN:  Major, remind folks General Mark Milley, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, this is a term that spans administrations, he's -- you know, the top military advisor to a president of the United States.
