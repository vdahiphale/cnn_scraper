And what you have to do is really dig in deeply, talk to the family members, try and find out what that medical history was that we heard about. How did that impact him? Is there anything out there would give you some kind of a hook on the defense? I mean, in some ways this case was very much like the Hinckley case with Ronald Reagan.Hinkley tried to assassinate Ronald Reagan. Ultimately, it went to trial on a insanity defense and won on that defense, in the sense that he was put away for the rest of his life essentially. But that's kind of what we're looking at here. Certainly, an insanity defense would protect him from any kind of death penalty in the federal action. But that is really a huge job. And I've had this happen before. What looks like something that is an open and shut case isn't always what it looks like. I had an individual who was a prominent lawyer, who hadn't filed his tax returns for 10 years. It looked like he was absolutely a goner. But once I dug into it and found out that he had issues going back to his college days when he had a concussion on his brain that caused his left lobe to shrink, which led to him not being able to accomplish certain things later in life, going from spot A to B, which also then led to the IRS and the U.S. Attorney's Office dropping the case. So, you never know. It really gets down to looking at what's out there, consulting with doctors and trying to determine whether there really is any kind of defense here.",

We know he's been in custody since the incident happened. He was apprehended late on Sunday. The incident took place early Sunday morning.

I'm waiting to learn exactly why, what happened to him and why he's been getting medical attention. But that's what's holding up the arraignment. Now, he's expected to face this murder one charge, murder two, as well as the arson charge. We're also waiting to learn more about this victim. As you said, police believe that she too was homeless. People usually take shelter in the subway when it's very cold at night like it was that day. And the suspect here also believed to be homeless. He was in and out of several shelters in the city.
