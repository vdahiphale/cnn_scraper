This is a move that U.S. officials hope will deter the Iranian-backed rebels from launching more attacks in the Red Sea, and it comes after the U.S. led several nations in striking Houthi targets in Yemen.CNN's Natasha Bertrand is at the Pentagon. Natasha, tell us what this designation means.",

      "sentences": "Well, Brianna, this is a designation that basically triggers new economic sanctions as well as asset freezes. And according to the Secretary of State, he said in a statement that, quote, this designation seeks to promote accountability for the group's terroristic activities, and he said that if the Houthis cease their attacks in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden, then the United States will reevaluate this designation.So this is basically just another tool in the U.S.'s toolbox that they have decided to reinstate following the Houthis' delisting as this entity in 2021 as a direct result of the Houthis attacking commercial shipping in the Red Sea with missiles and drones over the last two months. But importantly, this is not as strong as a terrorist designation as the administration could have imposed on the Houthis. That would be the Foreign Terrorist Organization designation. And the administration stopped short of that because under that designation, that would also penalize anyone providing material support to the Houthis, and the administration was concerned that that could potentially negatively impact humanitarian aid that flows to parts of Yemen. Because the Houthis do control a significant portion of territory in northern Yemen. And so the administration says that this designation, being global terrorist, is going to take effect in the next 30 days, and throughout this month, they're going to reach out to different stakeholders and international companies to make sure that they understand the limitations on what they can and can't provide in this context. But basically, all of this comes, of course, as the Houthis have not let up their attacks on the Red Sea, striking vessels as recently as today, even though the U.S. military has launched several strikes as recently as yesterday on the weaponry that the Houthis have been using to launch these attacks. So another attempt to pressure the Houthis here to kind of squeeze them into stopping. However, the Houthis, of course, show no signs of letting up at this point, Brianna.",

That's the part that violently blew off Alaska 1282 back on January 5th. Investigators are also reviewing extensive records regarding the door plug. Homendy now says the door was made by contractor Spirit AeroSystems in Malaysia. It then went to a Spirit factory in Kansas before going to the Boeing production line in Washington state. Investigators want to know where in that process the problems first occurred. Senator Ted Cruz sits on the Senate Commerce Committee, which got today's briefing. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. TED CRUZ (R-TX): We don't know, but it's obvious somebody screwed up. And so this investigation needs to find out where the mistake was, what caused this accident, and critically, what needs to be done to make sure it doesn't happen again, and it doesn't happen again with tragic consequences.

You know, just think of how many areas of the law the federal government touches.And let me just read two things from Neil Gorsuch, who you guys opened with his being at the center of the case. He had been pushing this Supreme Court to take up a case that would test the Chevron deference, as it's known. And two years ago, when the justices decided not to, he wrote a dissent. And he said: Rather than say what the law is, we tell those who come before us to go ask a bureaucrat. We place a finger on the scales of justice in favor of the most powerful of litigants, the federal government, and against everyone else. And then during the back and forth, I just came from the oral arguments, and they took more than three hours, very tense three hours. At one point, Justice Neil Gorsuch said, the government always wins. Chevron is exploited against the individual and in favor of the government. So it was, you know, I can really feel the momentum on the part of conservatives, including Neil Gorsuch, to try to really roll back this policy, which, as I say, has given wide latitude to federal regulators in a host of areas, including environmental protection, workplace safety, consumer rights.",
