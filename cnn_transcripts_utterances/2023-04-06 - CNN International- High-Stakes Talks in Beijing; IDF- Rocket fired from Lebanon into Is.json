French President Emmanuel Macron meets China's President Xi in Beijing top of the agenda, ending Russia's aggression against Ukraine. Under fire Ukrainian soldiers tell CNN about their life inside the gruesome frontline trenches, and Israeli forces stormed the Al-Aqsa Mosque for the second time. In 24 hours we're live in Jerusalem.We begin in Beijing where the French President Emmanuel Macron is on a three-day visit. He met earlier with Chinese President Xi Jinping and urged him to \"reason\" with Russia and helped negotiate peace in Ukraine. The two leaders were then being joined by the President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen, who is also visiting China. CNN Correspondent Selina Wang joins us live from Beijing. This is a very strong message, isn't it? Coming from Europe effectively with these two leaders in place there and reaching out to a real authority when it comes to Russia.",

      "sentences": "And Max Macron is just the latest EU leader to be coming to Beijing and urging China to do more when it comes to peace over Ukraine just days before the Spanish Prime Minister had been in Beijing as well. And these are the words that Macron had to say to Xi Jinping, he said, \"I know I can count on you to bring Russia to its senses, and everyone to the negotiating table.\"Xi Jinping said to Macron that China is willing to work with France to call on the international community to \"maintain reason and restraint, and avoid taking actions that will further aggravate the crisis\". Now there is skepticism over how much progress Macron can make here with Xi Jinping. Although China has claimed neutrality over the conflict in Ukraine we have seen China refuse to condemn the invasion to refuse to even call it an invasion. Instead, Xi Jinping has threat has strengthened ties with Vladimir Putin and recently traveled to Moscow to reaffirm their partnership. Now, during these opening remarks, Xi Jinping also touted growing and strengthening France, China ties also talked about rapid growth in bilateral trade. And that really speaks to sort of the dual purposes of Macron's visit in Beijing. Yes, he wants to drive forward peace talks and the role that China could play but also the economic issues here loom large. China is a critical trading partner for the EU, for France, and Macron is in Beijing with roughly 50 top business leaders from France. They need to maintain this business economic relationship after Europe's economy has been hit so hard. Meanwhile, Beijing also would like to shore up this relationship with France with the EU. They don't want to see European and China ties go the way that China and U.S. ties have. They would like to have a different relationship with the European Union. They don't want Europe to follow what they see as a U.S. led effort to contain China, Max.",

McCarthy said it was not intended to escalate tensions, but he was also defiant. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY (R-CA): Well, my first message to China, there's no need for retaliation. But the one thing I would say to China too at no time, I am the Speaker of the House. There is no place that China is going to tell me where I can go or who I can speak to whether you be foe or whether you be friend. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "Yes, Max. I mean, this was a rare moment of bipartisan force. Here in California, there was a lot of discussion yesterday about the importance of that. At the summit you saw Kevin McCarthy standing with Peter Aguilar, who is a member of the Democratic leadership, and someone who also hails from the state of California.But one of the things that was underscored by McCarthy yesterday was the fact that the U.S. has to be united in its relationship with Taiwan, in part to strike back against some of the rhetoric you're hearing coming out of China. This has been a very important piece of Kevin McCarthy speakership. He created a select committee to deal with China specifically to deal with issues on a bipartisan basis. And he wanted that meeting yesterday to come off with this idea and perception that this was the United States speaking as one and not just Republicans, talking with the President from Taiwan. So that was a very important issue for Kevin McCarthy. You also saw yesterday that he reasserted the importance of transferring weapons to Taiwan and to do that in a quick manner. He also argued that the trade relationship with Taiwan needed to remain strong and whatever those on Capitol Hill could do to make sure that that was the situation moving forward. He wanted to make sure that that happened. So a couple of things, you know, in terms of the symbolic importance of this, but also there were logistics that were discussed in that meeting yesterday another important element to make clear.",

Shortly this March will get underway and they will head to the plus - since that we've seen repeated you're right in other European countries. Here the particularity is of course that purchased over a pension reform. But you mentioned Germany and the strikes that we saw United Kingdom as well, Max, in a sense, they're all linked. This has become about much more than pension reform. It is also about inflation, the high cost of living exactly what we've seen behind those other protests in other European countries. One of the big questions is whether they can keep the momentum going. [08:15:00] So we're looking to see how many of you people get out on the street today and just how violent they become that's another factor we see in the last couple of weeks as these strikes that had been largely peaceful, Max, really getting a lot more violent between far left protesters and the police trying to keep order but themselves accused of times of excess. But the unions are right vowing that they will continue. We'll find out later tonight, what the next big day of strike action and protests will be, Max.",

I think it's important to remember that this happens in a particular context. It wasn't so long ago, the yellow vest protest, things for a lot of people have only gotten worse.
