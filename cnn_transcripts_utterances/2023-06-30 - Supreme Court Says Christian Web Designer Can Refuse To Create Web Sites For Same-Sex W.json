The findings were kept secret by the Coast Guard's top leadership. And get this, after all this time, the Coast Guard finally came clean and reported it to Congress this month, only after CNN's investigative team asked about it. The report found dozens of cases of alleged sexual assault at the Coast Guard Academy, even though they only looked from 1988 to 2006. Here are some more highlights that's in the report, Operation Fouled Anchor. It said that \"there was a disturbing pattern of not treating reported sexual assaults as criminal matters, even in cases where there was overwhelming evidence.\" Leadership was more concerned at the time about Coast Guard Academy reputation than about the victims of crimes who were members of service. The suspects and sometimes the victims were simply disenrolled from the academy with no investigation at all. And, Brianna, if there were punishments, I mean, they were laughable. Extra homework, lower class standings, even those pushed out of the academy were sometimes able to serve in the military.",

Remember, last year, they also enhanced Second Amendment gun rights, another favorite of conservative interests. So in case after case, we are seeing an empowered court rolling back precedent.
