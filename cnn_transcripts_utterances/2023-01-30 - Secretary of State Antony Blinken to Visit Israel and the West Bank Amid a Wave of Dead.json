Plus, Memphis police shutting down the special police unit tied to the beating death of Tyre Nichols. And just hours from now, classes resume at a Virginia Elementary School for the first time since a first grader shot his teacher.Welcome to our viewers in the United States and around the world, I'm Christine Romans this Monday morning, Secretary of State, Antony Blinken in Egypt this morning, the first leg of his three-day tour of the Middle East. His visit coming at a time when violence is flaring between Israelis and Palestinians. Iran and Ukraine also high on the agenda as Blinken prepares to leave Cairo this hour for Israel where Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's new right-wing government is causing turbulence at home and abroad. Nic Robertson has the latest for us from Jerusalem. Nic, what is Blinken hoping to accomplish on this visit?",

      "sentences": "I think the best hope here of people on both sides, Palestinians and Israelis, is that he can lower the tensions at the moment. How does he do that? Well, he's very likely to appeal to Prime Minister Netanyahu to reconsider some of his cabinet's decisions over the weekend on how to respond and react to that deadly shooting outside a synagogue on Friday where seven Israelis were killed.One of their proposals that's being considered by the government is to throttle back, even remove the rights of Palestinians' family members of attackers. That is something that could potentially further inflame the situation. The prime minister has also said that he's considering what he describes as strengthening the settlements. And we know that within his far-right coalition, there's heavy pressure on him to expand settlements and at a time of increased, intense security, both of these measures become sort of more open to the prime minister. So, if the Secretary of State can influence him to dial back on that, that may help lower tensions. But also on the Palestinian side, when he meets the Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas, he's likely to have a similar message of improve the background situation by re-establishing security coordination with Israel. This affects both Palestinians and Israelis. But the reality is, the Palestinian Authority doesn't have the control of the streets at the moment, so expectations are low, and partly because of the pressure within the governing coalition of Israel on the prime minister to keep good on his commitments to his right-wing partners and partly because the situation in the West Bank is incredibly tense. So, the dialing back at the moment of tensions and a de-escalation and a pause for breath, perhaps, the best he could hope for, but not forgetting this has been a very deadly month for Palestinians and Israelis, and indeed, the past year, one of the deadliest for both really going back more than a decade or so.",

I think that any unit of police activity has to be about policing the community in a way that instills trust and certainly secures order. I think units not only here, right, in this particular jurisdiction, but throughout the country, have to examine, Christine, number one, who are they recruiting and how are they recruiting them?Number two, how are they training them to meet whatever? Number three, mission that they ultimately have. And so, I think while it's a significant first step, it's certainly not enough. And so, I think if anything, this should spark a re-examination. Listen, to be clear certainly, we need police, communities need police, police need communities, it's a cooperative and collective effort. But it has to be under control. Police serve an important role in deterring crime and detecting crime. But to act as units, once you're going out there and demoralizing communities and savagely beating people, I don't  think that's the answer. We have to get our hands around the issue, and I think hopefully, this, if Mr. Nichols' death means anything, it will really spark a discussion, and not only a discussion, but activity towards reform of what these units are doing --",

The force you're using is grossly disproportionate to what he's doing, your behavior is patently unreasonable, if that's what these units are doing here or any place else in the country, there's no need for them and it certainly has to be ended here and everywhere else if that's their mission and mandate just to intimidate and really savage neighborhoods.
