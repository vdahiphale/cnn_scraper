You can actually see by these pictures here the extent of the destruction, looking at all the emergency service workers around the rubble there. The mayor says that a kindergarten and a nursery were among the damaged buildings. The nearby port city of Mykolaiv was also pummeled with drones and missile strikes, killing at least two people. The barrage comes after Russia pulled out of a U.N.-brokered deal this week that had allowed Ukraine to export its grain. But Moscow claims the strikes are in response to Kyiv's Crimea bridge attack on Monday. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Last night'sattacks alone would have been the worst on this city, but it was the third night in a row. There was a lot of damage done by Russian drones and missiles. You can see here this building has completely collapsed. We're told that this was an administration building. It is near the port, which we can't show you because of security reasons. You can see here that a door is still standing, but that's about it. This is a pile of smoldering rubble. Firefighters have been trying to put out those fires and you can still see the smoke rising from them. It is not just this building that was destroyed, we believe, by a Russian missile, but there is damage all around here. Windows have been blown out, trees knocked over, there's dust everywhere. From the shockwave of these missiles you can hear the car sirens that were going off during this attack that lasted around an hour and a half. It started just before 2 AM, we heard the air raid sirens. We saw the red tracer rounds flying into the sky to take down Russian drones and then the missile started. I want you to listen to a little bit of what we experienced overnight. At least one person was killed here in Odessa. A number of people injured. But Odessa was not the only city that was hit. The southern port city of Mykolaiv was also attacked by Russia there. At least 19 people were injured. Now, Ukrainians believe that this is directly tied to the grain deal. We know that Odessa's port has been a target for the last three nights. Some 60,000 tons of grain were destroyed in the second night of these attacks. Ukraine says that this is in response to Russia pulling out of that critical grain deal earlier this week. Alex Marquardt, CNN, Odessa. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

The first match between thehosts and Norway opened with a moment of silence for two people killed Thursday morning and several others injured by a lone gunman who took a shotgun to his place of work, a construction site in downtown Auckland early Thursday and began shooting, killing two people and injuring several others including a police officer. Police were commended for getting to the scene shortly after he began firing and ultimately neutralizing the suspect. He was found with a gunshot wound in an elevator shaft. Now, every time that there is a case of public violence in New Zealand, thoughts immediately go to 2019 when a white supremacist terrorist attacked two mosques in the city of Christchurch, killing 50. This attack, however, was not deemed to be a terrorist incident. The killer was not deemed to be ideologically motivated by police, that it was an isolated incident and not a national security threat. So, the authorities there in New Zealand believe that the game was okay, was safe enough to go ahead and it did so. There are several World Cup teams at the moment stationed in Auckland including Team USA who was quick to state their condolences after the tragic incident, posting a statement to social media, reading, \"U.S. Soccer extends its deepest condolences to the families of the victims who were killed in the shooting in downtown Auckland today. We are saddened by the inexcusable loss of life to gun violence and our thoughts with the people of Auckland, Tamaki Marakau and Aotearoa, New Zealand. Now, the games of the World Cup are historic this time around. More tickets have been sold than any Women's World Cup previously and 32 teams will this time take part with Team USA: The Favourites. We'll all hope that the shadow of this terrible incident, Thursday morning, will not loom too large over the competition. Angus Watson in Sydney Australia for CNN.",

We need to raise domestic revenue that's why these tax hikes are crucial, essentially. But just walk us through whether or not there is a certain segment of the Kenyan population that feels let down by President Ruto.

It tells the story of physicistRobert Oppenheimer, the man known as the father of the atomic bomb, because he led the U.S. effort to build the world's first nuclear weapon during World War II. It was a terrifying project because no one really knew how exactly the power of nuclear weapons would change mankind.

And though he built bombs, the atomic bombs, \"Oppenheimer\" eventually became a critic of nuclear weapons as their power grew stronger and stronger. More than 200,000 people were killed in Hiroshima and Nagasaki and in the years since then, the U.S. has actually developed nuclear weapons that are as much as 600 times more powerful than the ones you see here, the ones dropped on Japan. Of course, this film examining the moral complexity of nuclear weapons comes at an important juncture in military history. Russia, with one of the world's strongest nuclear arsenals, is currently, of course, at war with neighboring Ukraine. Time now for The Exchange, and we're going to look at what Robin Oppenheimer feared about nuclear weapons many years ago and what he might say about them today. Joining me live now is Joe Cirincione. He's a National Security and Weapons Expert, as well as the Author of the book, \"Nuclear Nightmares: Securing The World Before It Is Too Late\". Joe, thank you so much for being with us. How important do you think it is for people to know the story about Robert Oppenheimer and how and why the man who was the father of the atomic bomb eventually became a critic of nuclear weapons? How important is it, do you think, that we know and understand his history?",

      "sentences": "Yeah, I mean, the moral complexity is certainly isn't lost on anyone. Here's the thing, Joe, the first half of the 20th century was oneof the most lethal periods in human history. You had World War One, which killed about 20 million people. Obviously, these are just estimates. And I'm not even including the number of people who were maimed and went missing, right? The Second World War killed about 60 million people. And then after that, in August 1945, you had the atomic bomb dropped twice in the span of a few days on Japan. And I think that one of the sort of interesting things about nuclear weapons is that ever since the atomic bomb was invented, we haven't seen those kinds of great wars that we saw in the first half of the 20th century. I mean, do you think that, you know, one of the sort of strange, I guess, side effects of the invention of nuclear weapons is that it somehow brought about --unintentionally brought about a period of peace because there is so much fear about using them.",

But that's just one of the factors that happened. We shouldn't neglect the tremendous diplomatic and economic developments after the war that created the United Nations, for example, that created NATO, for example, that created a global economy. And these are also restraints on people going to war. The idea that France and Germany would go to war with each other. It's inconceivable now, but not because of nuclear weapons, but because of the political, diplomatic, and economic ties that have developed between those countries. And this was a theme that Oppenheimer emphasized days after Hiroshima. He and the other scientists wrote a letter to what's called the Interim Committee, the government committee overseeing the bomb, urging them that although they could make more and better bombs, that this would not provide security for the country. This could only be achieved through diplomatic efforts to make war less likely.",

For example, we now have about 13,000 nuclear weapons in the world. That is way too many nuclear weapons, but it used to be 60,000. So, we've decreased these arsenals since the height of the Cold War. We have nine countries with nuclear weapons, ranging from the United States, Russia, China, all the way down to North Korea, but it's only nine countries.

Iguess you can't really do anything about that. But there are countries that are in the middle that could have nuclear weapons that have chosen not to, or that did have nuclear programs that have reversed them. I mean, South Africa is one country like that. Obviously, Germany could have nuclear weapons if it wanted to. It's chosen not to. Japan is in that category. I would put South Korea in that category, as well. How do you focus on that category? Because that is the key to keeping the number at just nine.",
