REP. JAMIE RASKIN (D-MD):  Ours is not a system of justice where foot soldiers go to jail and the masterminds and ringleaders get a free pass. RAJU (voice-over):  The unprecedented developments come after the seven committee Democrats and two Republicans voted unanimously to adopt the report and issue criminal referrals against Trump and one of his attorneys, John Eastman. In a 154-page summary the report released today, the committee also accusing several of Donald Trump's associates like attorneys Rudy Giuliani and Kenneth Chesebro, along with former Trump chief of staff Mark Meadows and ex-top DOJ official, Jeffrey Clark as taking part in a conspiracy. In making its case in a final public meeting, the committee detailed how Trump ignored many of his top advisers who tried to persuade them to acknowledge his loss.",

I'm just telling you that after the commission has gone through its work, I don't know if there's enough evidence there. Keep in mind, at the end of the day, Jake, I don't think these changes much, anyway, for this simple reason. The Department of Justice is already investigating. The FBI is already investigating. They've already asked the commission to share their evidence. So, I don't know how these criminal referrals change much. I think the Department of Justice will say thank you very much for the referral. Thank you for the evidence. We're going to continue to go about our business.

He has worked for decades and runs a shelter called The Annunciation House. He is the most prominent person involved in helping migrants and an advocate for the shelters and the churches here in the El Paso area. And as we sat down to do the interview, we were essentially giving him the breaking news about what -- this was happening, and his reaction was simply this. He's like, they have known for a month that this judge had ordered this, all of this last minute, so you can really sense this sense of frustration and exasperation that so many leaders in Washington have had time to figure out what to do with all of this, but all of this always seemingly coming down to the very last moment in the days. And these are shelters that are trying to plan as far ahead as they can and right now, they're just trying to keep their heads above water, waking up every day, trying to figure out how much bed space and shelter space is available in the city.

There was that looking in of the grand jury and the district attorney into the Trump call to the secretary of state to find votes.

Thousands of Afghan refugees who risked it all working for the U.S. Military back in Afghanistan could be deported if lawmakers do not pass the Afghan Adjustment Act before the end of the week. The bipartisan legislation would provide a pathway to permanent residence for thousands of Afghans already in the United States, along with help with health care and finding jobs.Now, as CNN was the first to report, more than two dozen former and retired U.S. Military leaders, including three chairmen of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, one NATO Supreme Allied commander, and more, have written to Congress urging them to include the Afghan Adjustment Act in the larger government spending bill that needs to pass before the weekend. Joining me now is one of those signatories, one of the former chairmen of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Admiral Mike Mullen. Admiral Mullen, it's always an honor to have you on. Thank you. So you're one of the retired officers urging lawmakers to include this act into the spending bill, and saying it's a national security issue. Explain why you think it's a national security issue. ADM. MIKE MULLEN (RET.), FORMER CHAIRMAN, JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF: Well, I think at a very high level, Jake, it is a moral imperative for us to take care of those who gave so much and risked their lives while we were fighting in Afghanistan. And it wasn't just the ground forces because there were many Afghans throughout the entire government agency, the State Department, et cetera, who supported us as well. I think long term, if we're unable to support those who gave so much, others will look at us in the future and we might fall short in gathering that support. We work hard to take care of our friends and our allies, and nobody was closer to us on the ground in particular in Afghanistan than those who supported us, many of whom actually lost their lives in that support.",

And supporting those who are actually fortunate enough to get here in that evacuation is something that we should do to help them and help their future. And that will not be lost on the 100,000 or so who are still in Afghanistan that deserve leaving the country that we're trying to support and their families.

I do know that, in fact, one of the reasons the evacuation went so slowly was because of a very strict vetting process. So there's going to be some risk associated with this. I don't think there's any question.But my worry, Jake, is like so many things, this just gets tied up in the politics in Washington right now, and individual lives and families are at stake. And I would love to see this issue, you know, be raised above politics, which is very difficult in the times in which we live, to take care of these people. So I would hope that somebody like Senator Grassley, who, you know, could make an exception here in his position to help these people. And your point about veterans and veterans organizations widely support this, those who fought bravely for so long. There are very few -- there's almost no one that wouldn't support passing this bill and helping out these people. TAPPER: I mean, after Kabul fell in August of 2021, I know so many veterans who spent literally weeks, months of their lives trying to get their former interpreters and other aides out of the country with their family to the United States, liberal veterans, conservative veterans, moderate veterans, apolitical veterans, it didn't matter.
