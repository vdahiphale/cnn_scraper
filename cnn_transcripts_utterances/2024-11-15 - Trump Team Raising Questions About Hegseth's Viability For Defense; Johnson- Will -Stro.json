They're not commenting that those steps were made. Those would be normal. But I think the problem they're facing in this case is what prosecutors always face in, he said, she said cases that happened behind closed doors, which is they have two distinct, different versions of what occurred and what was consent.

Kennedy Jr.'s Health and Human Services secretary appears to be building for Republicans like former Vice President Mike Pence, who denounced Kennedy today in his position on abortion. For Democrats, it's about Kennedy's conspiracy theories about vaccines.There's also public debate about something he stated days before the election about what would happen if the president-elect won. Quote, \"On January 20th, the Trump White House will advise all U.S. water systems to remove fluoride from public water. Fluoride is an industrial waste associated with arthritis, bone fractures, bone cancer, IQ loss, neurodevelopmental disorders, and thyroid disease. President Trump and First Lady Melania Trump want to make America healthy again.\" Now, fluoride, which local governments began adding to water supplies in 1945, is added in small quantities to help prevent cavities. The American Academy of Pediatrics and American Dental Association and CDC continue to support it, but recent studies have raised questions about the potential health risks and the degree to which fluoride is helpful. In September, a federal judge decided there is sufficient evidence to warrant the EPA investigating. Now, it's that court decision and the research Kennedy cited in an interview after Trump's win last week. (BEGIN VIDEOCLIP) ROBERT F. KENNEDY JR., TRUMP'S PICK FOR HHS SECRETARY: I think fluoride is on the way out because of that court decision. I think the faster that it goes out, the better. I'm not going to compel anybody to take it out, but I'm going to advise the water districts about their legal liability, their legal obligation to their service zones and to their constituents. And I'm going to -- and I give them good information about the science. And I think that fluoride will disappear. (END VIDEOCLIP)",

That's what RFK Jr. is sort of alluding to there.So what is interesting is that when you think about the two sides of this issue, the CDC on one hand saying, hey, look, this is one of the greatest public health achievements of the 20th century. That's what they put on their website, and the reason they say so is because their data suggests that it has reduced cavities by about 25 percent. So a pretty significant reduction. But on the other side of the argument is this idea that at certain doses, it could be a neurotoxin, fluoride. So I want you to take a look at this full screen here, and as you look at this, keep in mind something that we say in medicine all the time that the dose makes the poison. OK, the dose makes the poison. So when you look at that, what they're saying is with moderate confidence, fluoride exposure of more than 1.5 milligrams per liter is associated with lower IQ in children with moderate confidence. There is very low confidence, there is low confidence, there is moderate, there is high. So, you know, the significant amount of confidence. In the United States, because of the United States Public Health Service, they recommend 0.7, so about half of that. World Health Organization, incidentally, says right around 1.5 is the safety limit for them. So you can sort of see the concern here. On one hand, you know, there's the evidence that it's reduced cavities. On the other side is this evidence that at certain doses, it can be, with moderate confidence, a neurotoxin. In some places around the country, Anderson, the levels are higher than this because fluoride is occurring naturally as well in the water in addition to it sometimes being added into the water. So in some places, it can exceed those values, and I think that's the issue that he's really raising.",

I mean, these medications, you know, Ozempic, for example, comes from Novo Nordisk out of Denmark, outside of Copenhagen. That company now has a larger value than the entire country of Denmark.I mean, that just gives you some sense of just how quickly these medications took off. But one of the things that was really interesting to me, Anderson, is when you think about obesity, thinking about it as a disease of the brain, the idea that for some people, when they eat, the hormones don't go to a part of the brain that tells them that they are full. And as a result, even when they're eating, they're already thinking about their next meal. They get anxious if they think that there's not enough food around. So the idea of thinking of obesity increasingly as a brain disease, much in the way that we thought about depression, you know, several decades ago, we now -- it's clear that it's a brain disease. We're sort of at that same stage now, I think, with obesity. And it's pretty fascinating how you treat it if you sort of approach it that way.",
