And many -- one of the campaigns effectively sweeps all seven states.One of the things he said also earlier today was that he would accept the outcome of an election if he lost, he said, if it was a fair election. Well, he didn't accept what happened in 2020 that he lost. What you can expect tonight is, if he is on track to losing, he will probably come out and declare he won or say something similar to what happened in 2020. How does the Republican Party respond in the immediate aftermath of that potential scenario? So there is so much that could happen here. But, you know, this race is -- could be historically close.

Let's listen.BRAD RAFFENSPERGER, (R), GEORGIA SECRETARY OF STATE: -- today. Just kind of pro rate that out to the rest of the day, the over 1.1 million, which gets us to probably right now 5,,150,000. We don't know if the trend will continue. It could actually come up a little bit. We have more work today. That's really what the big news should be. I'm not telling you what to print. That's your right. That's your job. But I think that is pretty darn awesome. Then we have a few things that happened that we can explain. And one of them, in the weeds. But in Peach County, it was a little cold down there. Someone plugged in the space heater that was also serving the county EMS for the election management system. So it fried that. So it was replaced this morning. Those are the kind of things you don't expect. But a very minor issue. And another really minor issue that, so far, two precincts had an illegal link of about 30 minutes, so we'll extend those. But what is really interesting is that fakes calls coming into our call center. So far, we've had 1,374 calls on our call centers. And answering an average of 16 seconds. And the oldest was about 42 seconds. So really responsive getting back to people, answering their questions, what do they do, where do they go, things like that. We have actually even gotten some great feedback. Already, 40 emails, sending us 40 emails telling us they had a great experience. We want everyone in Georgia to know that I have led on making sure that we lead the nation on having fast, secure and accurate elections. And we say fast, so much of that is about the voter experience, the customer, which is the voter today. And we are just really grateful we are getting feedback. We're just really grateful that we're having a check-in time right now under a minute. And we're having line time right now under a minute. And we're having line time two the three minutes. So in four minutes or less, on average, people are voting in Georgia. And we think that is good news, too. We have a lot to be proud of. And that's what you have to be proud of. You live in a great state. You know, I talked to you a little bit earlier about that Russian bomb hoax and that bomb scare. I just want to make sure everyone understands this. That Georgia is not going to be intimidated. Russia has just decided they picked on the wrong Georgia. They need to pick on the other one in the Black Sea because we will not be intimidated. But we are just excited about where we are right now. I don't know if anyone had any questions.",

Obviously, still going on. We'll see if that actually happens. Let's go to the Michigan secretary of state, Jocelyn Benson. Secretary Benson, it's good to speak to you. I don't know if you just heard your colleague there in Georgia, Secretary Raffensperger. He was talking about the threats that Georgia has dealt with. But he is saying that votes are on track. But a couple of places may be open 30 minutes longer because of earlier delays. What are you seeing in Michigan right now? Have you had any places with any massive disruptions or a massive delay at this point? JOCELYN BENSON, (D), MICHIGAN SECRETARY OF STATES: We have not. Similarly to my colleague in Georgia, we have seen both extraordinary engagement and turnout. All across the state, I have visited polling places throughout the day. And there are literally parties at the polls. People dancing, people celebrating, which is kind of what today should be. And people standing in line next to each other voting with different candidates with very different opinions but still proud to respect each other's right to vote. So that is what we are seeing above all else. And like Georgia, we had a few non-credible bomb threats that were attempted, we believe, sources back to Russia as well. But working with law enforcement to debunk these things so nothing deters anyone from participating in this historic election.",

It depends on the margin of victory for any particular race. But that said, I have been very encouraged by how efficiently and securely our largest communities are tabulating those votes that came in through the mail. Detroit has already said they will probably be done by tonight, probably around midnight. So we should have an update by 9:00 p.m. Eastern.

The bar code on the ballot was printed incorrectly and machines couldn't read them. So county employees have traveled 70 miles west. They are expected to bring back and distribute reprinted ballots across the county this afternoon. Now ballots that voters cast already that cannot be read by the machine will be hand counted. We've also learned that mail-in ballots are not impacted by this issue. Election officials said in a statement, \"At this point, our focus is getting people to vote. And their votes will count.\" Now let's go to Allegheny County. Because, here, we have learned that the mail-in ballot return rate has exceeded 2020. As of last night, more than 219,000 mail-in ballots we're returned. That's a return rate of 85.2 percent compared to 84.8 percent back in 2020. Interestingly, officials have already begun counting the mail-in ballots in Pennsylvania. Because remember, in that state, they come in multiple envelopes so officials started by extracting the ballots from their outer secrecy enveloped and then started extracting the ballots from the inner envelopes to begin scanning. Results are not expected to be posted until after 8:00 p.m. in Pennsylvania because officials cannot start tabulating those mail-in ballots until Election Day -- Erin?",

Other than simply looking at the people waiting in line right now, what can the campaigns really do to try to figure out if they are getting their people out there to vote before the polls close? NIA-MALIKA HENDERSON, CNN SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST: Yes, I mean, they're getting data back about who is showing up, are the voters they contacted, did they already cast their ballots? And they can send folks to areas where they feel like they are not getting the numbers they need. These campaigns -- and the Democrats have a better operation than the Republicans at this point -- they have specific numbers they want to see in these areas. They had a certain number going into Election Day. A certain number of voters and votes they wanted to bank going in. And now they have another one. You know, you think about what Democrats we're doing going into this, they we're sending high-profile surrogates all over the place. The Obamas, Bill Clinton, you know, Wes Moore, Jasmine Crocket. Everybody was out and they were trying to connect with voters and get voters to the polls during the early Election Days. And listen, we obviously don't know what is going to happen. But the Democrats certainly have a superior ground game. It is more data fueled. We had Bryan Lanza on at some point earlier today and he was saying, oh, they didn't have any data. Maybe he didn't have any data. Ideally, the Trump campaign has some data. And they can sort of figure out where they need to juice the numbers and maybe send some door knockers out to the different counties to kind of juice up the numbers.

Because of their criticism of the way the Republican National Committee had dealt with this in the past.

This is why Trump has spent so much time in North Carolina in the last several days.
