Officials in coastal counties have a singular message for residentsPulling No Punches: Vice President Kamala Harris slamming former President Donald Trump today after he told falsehoods about the response to Hurricane Helene. Election Day, of course, just four weeks away and pulling shows a race that could break either way. And can so called ghost guns be regulated like firearms? The Supreme Court taking up a case involving the weapons, which has become a major problem for law enforcement. We're following these major developing stories and many more all coming in right here to CNN NEWS CENTRAL. We are following breaking news. I'm Brianna Keilar in Washington and my colleague and co-host, Boris Sanchez, is live in Florida as the state is bracing for Hurricane Milton and we're seeing a very powerful category four storm with wind speeds teetering very close to a Category 5. Milton has lashed Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula. And then to give you a sense of just how strong it is, take a look at this view. It is from inside that hurricane hunter plane as it flew through the storm over the gulf just a short time ago. Right now, mandatory evacuations are in place along Florida's west coast as officials there warn of catastrophic impacts. And we're looking at live pictures here of people getting out of town. Time is running out to do that with Milton set to make landfall tomorrow night. Let's go to Boris Sanchez. You're there on Treasure Island, which is in the Tampa Bay area, Boris. Tell us what you're seeing. We see so much debris around there.",

When these storms are just so intense that eye wall goes to recycle that could teeter the intensity, which is why we saw it go down a little bit this morning, but it popped back up to 155 miles per hour. And what that does as a result is it expands the wind field, it gets fatter and wider. The eye is just so crystal clear, and circular and perfect, just classic signs of an intense mind boggling hurricane.We are just teetering that Category 5 strength right now that starts at 157-mile-per-hour winds and we're at 155, right? So just incredible with how strong this still is. The storm surge is by far the most deadly part of hurricane. It is the push of those intense winds in the eye wall, taking the ocean water with it and sloshing it inland, 10 to 15 feet of storm surge from Tampa down through Sarasota to Fort Myers. This is the unsurvivable part. This is why the officials are using such dire wording to get out. We still have 10 feet storm surge down towards Naples and you get it as the part that is unsurvivable because look at what happens to the ocean waters when it comes in, it's just at that level at eight feet or more. It just takes your house away. Boris?",

I understand former President Trump is teaming up with RFK Jr. for a virtual town hall. What can you tell us about this? KRISTEN HOLMES, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Yes, the theme of this town hall is \"Make America Healthy Again,\" something that Donald Trump never really cared about until, of course, Robert F. Kennedy dropped out of the race, and then he made it part of his platform. I think the thing to keep in mind here is that this race is going to be decided in the margins, and any kind of votes that the Trump campaign or the Harris campaign can secure are votes that they believe that they are going to need to take them across the finish line in November, and that includes those independent voters. And the one thing to keep in mind about particularly RFK Jr. voters is they don't typically go to the polls or at least that's the concern among the Trump campaign. So how do you actually get them from being RFK supporters to being Donald Trump supporters to getting them to actually cast your ballot in November? Well, the hope is that by teaming up with RFK, you're actually showing that it's not just that he's given the endorsement, but he's going to be part of the next administration. You might think that 6 percent in some of these states that RFK held is not that much, but if you can even get a fraction of that to actually show up in November, the Trump team thinks that could help them win. Now, whether or not this is a strategy that actually works, obviously, as we know, the big question is, can you actually get these people to cast their ballots. But this is how they're doing it. This is why you're hearing him make promises about RFK being part of the transition team, as well as Tulsi Gabbard, trying to get those voters to actually show up at the polls by basically giving them an incentive that is beyond just an endorsement.",

And Democrats jumped on that.And the danger of something like that is when it's - when you say something that feeds into an already problematic narrative. And as Eva noted, a problematic narrative for Kamala Harris is that she is attached to an unpopular incumbent President Biden. And so by saying, though you say every day you're going to turn the page and then all of a sudden saying you can't think of anything comes to mind that you would do differently. [15:24:59] It just gives a huge opening to Republicans, which part of their main strategic effort since Harris has taken over the top of the ticket has been to attach her firmly to unpopular President Biden.

She wants to extend that advantage.She wants to diminish Trump's advantage with men, go on \"Howard Stern.\" It obviously has a lot of female listeners, too, but that is a place where men are tuning in and listening and the opportunity to try and chip away at Trump's advantage among men.
