Great to have you with us on another day filled with recession fears, allmarket tears and Beijing shifting gears and that's where we begin the Chinese government making sweeping changes to zero COVID policies including a significant easing of quarantine rules. Today's moves, raising hopes of an eventual growth rebound. It could also help to call the anger of people across China but one of the risks now to the health system, if it means a surge in COVID cases during the winter. That policy shifts however, doing little to boost market sentiment in Asia where the HANG SENG tumbled more than 3 percent. Context though, as always is key we are up 30 percent in that market from the October lows of all Chinese reopening, of course too will take time and while we wait, the economy continues to weaken. Beijing today reporting dismal import and export numbers the worst trade data in fact, in well over two years. The IMF also warning yesterday that China's financial outlook has \"darkened noticeably\" or this enough clearly to trigger fresh volatility across all markets both Brent and U.S. crude trading near their lowest levels of the year we're actually back to pre-Ukraine war crisis levels, who better and to help make sensible of these developments. And Ian Bremmer, the President and Founder of GZERO media will talk the latest from Ukraine. The moves in China, and also get his perspective on the likelihood of a softening stance from the Iranian regime too, amid clearly deep skepticism. Now in the meantime, recession, fears continue to weigh on U.S. and European markets with more Wall Street executives warning of tough times ahead. We've got the latest on that U.S. stocks set for further losses after four straight losing sessions for the S&amp;P 500 and as you can see, pre market were off another three tenths of 1 percent. More on all of that in just a moment, but first we begin in China and Beijing's significant COVID strategy shifts. Something that government says is about \"Keeping pace with the times\". Ivan Watson joins us now with more. Ivan we've talked about this now for a number of days. It seems a clear relaxation of the guidelines now at the Beijing level at the national level, but it does come in midwinter and of course the concerns now rose about the capacity of the healthcare system to respond if COVID cases spike.",

But it also brings some new challenges to China on the health care front. First of all, this is the first time that the national government has announced a substantial relaxation of these onerous restrictions. One of them for example, is that asymptomatic COVID cases, people with mild symptoms and close contacts of COVID cases no longer have to go into government quarantine where there have been reports of kind of unsanitary conditions and poor food and hygiene. They can do home quarantine, that's just one of 10 changes take a listen to some more announced by a Senior Health Official. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

U.S. stocks on pace for another week open after a 1.5 percent drop for the S&amp;P as I mentioned already on Tuesday, a 2 percent sell off in tech stocks too. All this as the heads of Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan warn once again, about the outlook for U.S. growth. Paul R LA Monica joins us on this. Paul, it was the Walmart boss yesterday, the Goldman Sachs CEO, JP Morgan CEO, Jamie Dimon, all warning about challenges for the economic outlook. If you look at what we saw earlier this week, we also had strong data and the investors sold stocks on that as well concerned that perhaps that means higher rates rather than lower rates. So it just feels very nervy to me at the moment. PAUL R. LA MONICA, CNN REPORTER: It's incredibly jittery right now, Julia. I think that the market is still holding out. Hope somewhat perversely, that if the economy deteriorates so rapidly in 2023, that maybe the Fed will reverse course, stop the rate hikes sooner rather than later and then maybe even begin to cut rates at the end of 2023. That might be a bit premature, but clearly, we are seeing signs of nervousness from leaders of corporate America. You mentioned David Solomon of Goldman Sachs, his comments about the possibility that maybe there needs to be a lower level of bonuses for investment bankers at Goldman Sachs. I'm sure a lot of viewers are really not shedding tears over that, but still, it's not a great sign. JP Morgan Chase CEO, Jamie Dimon continuing to be gloomy, taking some breaks from bashing crypto to talk about how he sees potentially you know, more sluggishness ahead for the U.S. economy.

What they were planning to do is, as you say, staggering the violent overthrow of the Parliament, the Bundestag, this is a group - that doesn't believe in the legitimacy of the German government, but not happy with going out and protesting about it on the streets. Some of their members were former members of the German Military and the Attorney General, who's been laying out some of the details today, has described what would have been a potential violent attack on the Bundestag to try to take control of it. And then this group had their own set of people that they were going to put it into ministerial positions and to run the army as well. So this was not an idle group sitting at home twiddling their thumbs. The states, the Federal Chief Justice has ordered that eight so far of the members of this group that have been arrested, continue to be detained, including someone they call Heinrich PR.

Competence and character which was he was hammering home that really seemed to have resonated with the voters. So the Democrat Raphael Warnock prevailing to this six-year full term in the Senate. His wind really underscores several things. First off, Georgia, the state we are in now is truly a swing state. This is something that Georgia, Democrats have been looking at very closely, and they will use this win as a blueprint. As they try to win in 2024, Georgia is absolutely a crucial battleground state now. It also highlights the Democrats ground game. This was something that was set up by Stacey Abrams, who successfully ran for Governor again, this time around, but there was this controversial voting law that Georgia lawmakers passed after the presidential election in 2020. That shortens the period between the general election and the runoff from nine weeks to four weeks. It also reduced the number of early voting days pretty significantly, and what the Senator Raphael Warnock was hoping for was a big early voting turnout. He was hoping that turnout would really give them enough cushion to win on Election Day and that's exactly what happened for him. But Julia turnout was robust. We're talking about 3.5 million people turning out. Although that is slightly less than the general of 3.9 million but again, keep in mind this was a runoff up that just shows how much interest and enthusiasm there was in this Senate runoff, Julia.",

It's precisely because Zelenskyy stood up for his people, that he would got the Americans and American allies to rally behind Ukraine to send billions and billions of dollars of military equipment of humanitarian support to invite Ukraine to become a member of the European Union. All 27 states voted in favor of that, to put unprecedented levels of sanctions against Russia.

Because he knows that the Ukrainian government could never accept it, because they could politically and also because Russia still occupies large swaths of territory they've taken since February 24. And the question is might someone like Emmanuel Macron, who's been saying, oh, the Chinese need to be involved in negotiations. Oh, the Russians need to be provided guarantees and assurances from NATO a little out of step not completely, but a little out of step with the Americans, certainly with the Ukrainians. Might you see Macron and other NATO leaders start to say, oh, well, this is an opportunity. We need to talk to Putin right now that truce is something we should accept Ukrainians would not. And it was very important on the back of Macron's state visit that Biden and Macron, specifically publicly aligned on if there are to be negotiations and of course, that would include a truce. The Ukrainians have to be the ones to make that decision. It's very important in the face of what you just asked Julia, that NATO stands very, very solidly together with the Ukrainians on that decision, because of course, one of the reasons this war has gone as well as it has for Ukraine since the invasion is because NATO has been so solidly united with Kyiv and with the President Zelenskyy in their willingness to face down the Russian threat.",

And of course, the Chinese also believe more in Eastern medicine and vaccines themselves, that's Western medicine. That's, you know, you give a drug and you fix everything right? Even that's not the way vaccine actually works. There is a lot of skepticism there. So this is China now basically saying, we're going to roll that back. We're not going to put in a formal mandate, but essentially, we're going to do everything we can to make sure all of these elderly get vaccinated in very short order and roll back, relax. Some of the lockdown standards say that you can quarantine in home for much of the population that's much, much more convenient. Stop the blocking of emergency exits during quarantines, for example, which is why they couldn't fight that fire that ended up with a lot of civilian's dead up in Urumqi. But of course, if what we see his massive uncontained spread of COVID as a consequence, and Chinese hospitals starting to get overwhelmed. Yes, they've built out a lot more ICU beds that built out a lot more hospitals, and they're vaccinating a lot more people.

So we're estimating companies are going to break even between 18 and 24 months, versus buying a traditionalstep van and when you think about $10,000 a year, over the 10 year life of vehicle or 15 year life of a vehicle, the vehicle more than pays for itself in those savings. So it's really pretty incredible that we are at this moment where the technology is finally mature enough that not only can we do the right thing for the planet, but we can also do the right thing from an economic perspective. So it makes it really an easy decision for customers to make the switch. And I think when you add on top of that, in the U.S., the new incentives that are coming out that potential for clean energy tax incentives, it creates a little more momentum there for customers as they look to make this switch.",

First of all, thosetraditionally been diesel vehicles, they're emitting a lot of carbon, but in addition is creating a lot of traffic congestion in our city. So all of us have seen, you know, sometimes these trucks have to double park and block a lane of traffic or block a bike lane in order to get to the front door. And that's creating sort of snarls of traffic in our cities. We've developed a whole suite of products we have our electric delivery vans called the Zevo, but we also have our trace eCarts and we have a software suite. And all of these together are really designed to help both eliminate carbon but also reduce urban congestion and make our streets safer. So the eCarts we've tested with FedEx and to imagine these eCarts, they're essentially a giant locker on wheels with electric propulsion, they can carry up to 250 pounds of packages in a single go. So they're really replacing the dolly that you see these delivery folks struggling with, you know, to get upstairs, they can carry 250 pounds of packages, effortlessly. So it allows rather than a truck sort of stopping and a driver making three or four trips back and forth to the van to make a single delivery, they can just drop an e-card and the truck can keep moving and the delivery driver can go and do those. And it lets you separate the delivery runner from the driver and lets traffic keep flowing. We tested these with FedEx in New York; they were able to reduce their curbside dwell time. So how long a truck is sitting there by about 50 percent. So that's real savings. And that's going to help our cities really flow.",

So what you're seeing is some of the biggest names in the industry are coming to BrightDrop, because they really trust what we're doing. They know we can deliver for them. And we already are delivering for customers today we've got vehicles on the road with FedEx in Los Angeles already. With our announcement this week that we've opened our factory, what that really means is that we're going from sort of the early stages to this becoming real today and going to scale today. And I think the power that General Motors our parent company brings is that we know how to scale these kinds of businesses. So we're going to see this business scale up very, very rapidly starting this year, and you're going to start seeing these trucks on your streets delivering packages. And you'll know that those packages that have arrived at your front door have arrived without any tailpipe emissions, which is really a revolution when you think about it.
