Biden's response was, quote, \"Look at me, decide.\"Evan, that's exactly what voters in Wisconsin and across the country are going to do today. Does the president see this as a make-or-break moment? EVAN OSNOS, PRES. BIDEN BIOGRAPHER: I think there's no question that he does. I mean, he has had a theory of the case for a long time that people would watch him as he often says, watch me and judge for yourself. And when he started saying that at the beginning of his campaign, it had a very different valence to it than it does now. Right now, the question is, is there really anything he can do? Is there anything that he's able to do in public that would shift the frame of reference? Because the frame right now is that support is sliding for him. And it would take more than just an ordinary performance, both today and then also later in this interview with ABC, in order to get people to say, OK I'm willing to give him another chance to dig his way out of this. As you heard a moment ago from Gerry Connelly, the congressman, he's saying openly it's not clear to him that Joe Biden is in the strongest position to win.",

In fact, he floated the idea of only serving one term.And when you look at him and just consider his age, and some people wonder why -- why continue on, you know? Why is he running again? What drives him, especially in this moment of immense pressure right now? Does he feel an obligation to serve?",

      "sentences": "Yes. Two things. One that's interesting is, even though he said at the time I want to be a transition candidate, he actually explicitly said no to the idea of only serving one term. I just think it's something that is worth pointing out.What he was doing at the time was, let's be honest, he was sort of playing with the ambiguity of that idea. He wanted people to say, well, he will put in place people who would eventually inherit this kind of power. But the reality is people expected him to serve one term and only one term. And I think, when I talked to him back in January about this, it was very clear in his -- his self-description that he felt like he had earned it. That's the word that kept -- that kept coming up to me as I thought about it. He would say over and over again, any other president who's had this list of achievements, have this list of accomplishments would have a second term. But what, of course, doesn't accommodate, what it doesn't allow is for the reality of how he is perceived now. Go back to the way he always asked people to judge him, watch me. And he was, in his own way, I think kind of immune to the reality of how people did see him. He didn't see himself that way. And so if he was not open to the understanding that people were not seeing him as he did.",

      "sentences": "But let me just pull this up, very quickly. But I mean, I guess what I'm what I'm wondering is, you know, he's already had one term as president, right, almost? He's, obviously, a few months left.But why does he want to run again and be in the White House for another four years with the weight of the world on him and not just retire. Go look at his career as a public servant. Feel great about that. And just spend time with his family and ride off into the sunset. What's driving him right now?",

      "sentences": "I think -- I think what's driving him right now is a combination of deep-rooted reasons and then immediate reasons.The deep-rooted reasons are he wanted to do this his entire life and he believes that he got in there and has done a good job as president. That's not an immaterial fact in the sense that he believes that politics should reward people who do the things that everybody wants them to be able to pass big bills, achieve things that would improve our way of life. The reality is -- two is, he doesn't want to be driven out of politics. Like his way, he was -- in his memory, he was driven out in the 1987 presidential campaign. He carried that cigar with them a long time. It bothered him. And so I think, in some ways, the challenge for him now, the key is can he turn this moment into the thing he always talks about, which is finding purpose in moments of setback and of embarrassment. Can you find a purpose in it? And the purpose may ultimately be setting up a successor to succeed. But that's a message that he has to absorb himself. And he ultimately is -- it is now the moment, I think, where people are expecting it to reach that choice.",

Specifically among members of his own party on Capitol Hill. You reported, days after the debate, that there was a large number of Democrats that were discussing the possibility of Biden stepping aside as the nominee. As the days have gone on, and you've heard this sort of ambivalence among certain members, key members of his constituency, what do you think the perception is on Capitol Hill about his efforts now, this more aggressive campaign strategy, more off-the-cuff moments. Especially in light of what he said in that meeting with governors about not scheduling events after 8:00 p.m.",

I am deeply grateful for his leadership. And I know he agrees this is the most important election of our lifetimes.\" You know, it's under seeing the light of this statement. Evan, I was speaking to a Democratic strategist earlier today, who said -- this person didn't feel like President Biden, maybe initially after the debate, grasp the gravity of like what just happened and whether he can continue on. And I'm wondering now, with statements like this and a few other Democratic House lawmakers coming out telling him to step aside, do you think that President Biden is really grasping this moment and the gravity of it? And, you know, sort of where we are?",

Meaning, can he see a lane that allows him to get through obstacles that might be piling up in his path.And there have been moments when the answer is, no. In 1987, after a plagiarism scandal in the presidential race, it was his friend, Ted Hausman, who said to him, the only way that you get the sharks, he said, to go away, is to get out of this race. And Biden did get out of that race. But it is -- it is -- as you know, Pam, a campaign is a matter of conviction. It is a kind of faith. Faith in yourself in this audacious idea that you could and should be president. And so you have to maintain that, both to yourself and the people around you, up to the point at which you realize you're going to do damage ultimately to the American values, to the party to which you've devoted your life. And it is not an overstatement to say that, today, and really just in the hours and the days ahead, we are seeing that decision on the block. It is this moment. And, you know, it's been a very long time since we've had a moment of this kind of stakes in our politics.",
