      "sentences": "Well, we're getting new details about this.This is Marina Ovsyannikova. She is a journalist who really made splashes across the world when in early March she held up that sign -- I know you were playing that clip earlier -- that said \"No war. Stop the war. Stop believing their lies. This is propaganda.\" It, of course, sent shockwaves around the world -- that video going viral of her. She was then charged, given a fine, and put under house arrest. But earlier this month her lawyer said she escaped that house arrest with her daughter. It was unclear how she did that given that she was wearing an ankle bracelet in one of her social media videos released online -- but able to escape. And now we understand from her lawyer that she is living under the protection of a European country, not specifying which European country that is. Russia, in turn -- the Kremlin has not put her own a wanted list. There is charges for her to come back. That she would face prison time once she's extradited to Russia. But it's hard to imagine that any European country, wherever she may be, would willingly extradite her. But I think her case highlights the issues of freedom of speech in Russia right now, particularly when it comes to speaking out on the war in Ukraine. We've seen hundreds of protesters arrested in recent weeks. Rights groups say that journalists cannot operate freely -- that they are often silenced or punished if they do criticize the Kremlin or criticize President Putin's war. So, yes -- here, a journalist able to escape. Able to find some safety, hopefully, in a European country. But that plight for freedom of expression for journalism in Russia absolutely continues. ROMANS:  All right, thank you so much for that, Salma. All right. Ahead, the big stores offering unbeatable discounts right now. And election deniers running county election offices and sowing mistrust in the system. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Asia closed mixed. And on Wall Street, stock index futures are leaning down a little bit after markets closed lower on Thursday. The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield climbed about 4.2 percent -- the first time that's happened since 2008. Gas prices dropping overnight by more than a penny to $3.82 a gallon. Those higher interest rates visibly cooling the housing market. U.S. home sales falling for the eighth month in a row in September, the longest slump in 15 years. Sales of existing homes down 23.8 percent in September from a year ago, and down 1 1/2 percent from the prior month. The main culprit here, mortgage rates. They rose again this week.

They've had to stave off elimination twice against Cleveland, which meant a really short turnaround to prepare for Houston. And now, the Bombers have their backs against the wall again. They're in a 2-0 hole against Houston. Alex Bregman had the Astros taking flight early, launching a 3-run shot to left. It was his 14th postseason jack, the most ever by a third baseman. The Yankees did cut it to 3-2 in the eighth. Aaron Judge had a chance to tie it but Kyle Tucker making a nice little play here just over the short wall in right. So the Astros hold on. Game three at Yankee Stadium tomorrow night, so a chance for the Bombers to get back in it. \"THURSDAY NIGHT FOOTBALL\" now. Cardinals quarterback Kyler Murray getting into it with head coach Kliff Kingsbury after being forced to use a timeout near the goal line. That moment right there got a lot of attention. Both sides downplaying it after the game. But it also came right before the team went off offensively. Keaontay Ingram tying the game on the very next play there with a short touchdown run. The Cardinals' defense stepping up in this game. Marco Wilson picking off the deflection there and taking it all the way to the house -- 38 yards -- for the score, giving Arizona its first lead. And a minute later, Andy Dalton throwing it right to Isaiah Simmons in the middle of the field. So he would go 56 yards for the score. The Cardinals win 42-34, snapping an 8-game home winning streak, their longest since the '50s -- 1958. Some very big news here for football fans. The 49ers making a huge trade last night acquiring star running back Christian McCaffrey from multiple draft picks. The 2019 Pro Bowler has battled injuries the last couple of years but he is healthy now and he is ready to flourish in Kyle Shanahan's offense out west. McCaffrey returning to the Bay Area where he played his college ball at Stanford. The Panthers thanking McCaffrey on Twitter for this 5-plus years with the team -- a class move there. In the NBA, the Lakers hosting the Clippers in the battle of L.A., and LeBron trying to keep his team in it. In the third quarter here, a big jam on the break. Twenty points, 10 boards for LeBron. It was not enough though. Kawhi Leonard, who played in his first game in 16 months, scoring 14 off the bench and putting a nice little clutch jumper over LeBron in the final minute as well. So the Clippers with their eighth-straight win over their city rivals. And it was an action-packed night in the NHL, highlighted by the Maple Leafs handing the Stars their first loss on this overtime goal by Nick Robertson. That capping off an incredible night in sports. So, this is what we refer to, Christine, as a sports equinox. It is only the 27th time in history that all four major pro sports -- NFL, NBA, MLB, NHL -- all playing on the same day. The last called -- last so-called sports equinox was last Halloween. So right around this time of year is when things get really good. But that's not all. We also have college football. We have the MLS playoffs -- a great ending to the battle of L.A. there. So a lot for sports fans. You didn't -- you didn't need to really go anywhere. You could just sit on your couch and watch it all night long.
