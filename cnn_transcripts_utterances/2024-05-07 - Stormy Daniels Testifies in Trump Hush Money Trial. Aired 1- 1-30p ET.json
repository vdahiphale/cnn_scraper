Anderson Cooper is just outside the courthouse in New York for us today. A truly blockbuster witness right at the heart of this case, Stormy Daniels, has been testifying. The adult film star has delivered at times very salacious testimony detailing her first meeting with Trump back in 2006 and their ensuing sexual encounter, which Trump denies. Ten years later, Daniels was paid to keep quiet about that alleged affair. And that's the payment that launched this case -- Anderson, over to you.",

Prosecutors said the crime was in the bookkeeping, which allegedly involved falsifying records to conceal the nature of the transaction.

Of course, the question is, did Trump know about the way this payment was actually logged in his personal business records?",

Did he know about those 34 individual documents that are allegedly falsified?I think what we got out of Stormy Daniels this morning is the, what did Trump want to hide ahead of the 2016 election? Post-\"Access Hollywood,\" pre-election Day, what was it that he and everyone else was concerned about getting out? That is what Stormy Daniels has given the jury so far, no evidence of falsifying business records. That's not something she will have knowledge of. And we're just starting to get into the hush money that she received in the days ahead of the election. COOPER:  Also, it's going to be interesting, Phil. I mean, does the jury believe Stormy Daniels in her testimony? And if they believe her, then they don't believe Donald Trump when he says that he did not have sex with her. And if they don't believe him on that, perhaps that colors the way they believe his testimony in general.",

You saw the objections, probably more objections and more objections sustained from the defense team than we have seen in the entire trial combined up to this point. I think those details and the reason why she was being asked about them by the prosecution were to kind of lay out the point that you're making here, that she wouldn't know all of this if it didn't actually happen. The former president denies that this happened in the first place. And, therefore, you should be able to view her as credible. And I think what's interesting as we head in to the afternoon is where she ended up. She ended up saying that the delays to the money, she attributed them first to Cohen, and then said it was Trump to Cohen to Keith Davidson. And while that line or chain of events may take you back a week or two into the trial, whether or not she has proof to that, to Paula's point, it's been the missing element throughout this. Who can point directly to the former president and what he knew. She kind of closed things out, saying, I -- my understanding or my belief is that Trump was the reason that this was being delayed. We have not seen proof of that. We have heard from Davidson. And how she's able to kind of develop that or paint that picture in the afternoon is going to be really important.",

For example, it's a small detail, but she said: \"I went through Donald Trump's toiletry bag. I'm not proud of it.\" Why would you admit that if you were not telling the truth? It's hard for me to believe this jury hears that testimony and thinks this is fabricated. But now we're getting into the more relevant parts of her testimony and perhaps the dicier elements of her testimony. For example, right before the lunch break, she said she really wasn't interested in getting money for her story. Well, she got $130,000 for it, ultimately. And we are coming up to the point where she's going to talk about how she publicly -- here's the quote -- My motivation wasn't money. It was to get the story out.\" That's a little hard to square with what ends up happening. So it's going to get bumpier in the afternoon for Stormy Daniels and for the prosecution.

She's talking and testifying about events that happened in 2006. And it's easy to say, well, what -- what exactly do you remember? Where was the hotel room and so on? And even little things that might be honest memory lapses for you or me or a regular person, to a jury might appear to be questions about the witness' credibility. And then, finally, the big one is just motive and intent. Why -- picking up on Elie's point. To get the story out is not a good fact for her at all, because it suggests that she is going after this defendant.

He was watching it very closely. I mean, his eyes were on this monitor almost the entire time. He was not closing his eyes, like he's been doing in other days of testimony. And there was this one moment where she'd been on the stand briefly just describing who she was, where she grew up, her backstory. And the prosecution asked her to identify Donald Trump. And she had to kind of stand up in her seat a little bit, and she pointed at him and identified him as the person in the navy jacket. And he looked over towards the witness stand as this happened.

That's why Trump's often looking straight ahead at this screen. But, I mean, this is the biggest witness to testify, easily, so far in the 13 days of this trial. I don't think -- I think there was a lot of questions about whether or not she was actually going to take the stand, but the prosecution called her this morning.

This is something that also stood out to me is, Donald Trump hasalways denied this affair and said that Stormy Daniels was not his type. He's talked about her a lot in his rallies when I was covering him inside the White House. She laid out so many instances of where -- not only when they met in 2006 at the Lake Tahoe golf tournament and the subsequent conversations she had, other meetings that they had, phone calls where he would call and she put him on speaker. And there were dozens of witnesses, essentially, to their interactions, her assistant, her publicist. Her boyfriend at one time drove her to an interaction with Donald Trump, where she went and met with him in Beverly Hills, and he waited in the car. And so it also just speaks to Trump's denials of this. I mean, she had a level of detail about the tile in his hotel room in Lake Tahoe, the double doors, what they were talking about. There were parts where he was muttering to his attorney and looked increasingly irritated as she was continuing to testify about these details of their interactions. There were moments where, when the jury was out of the room and they took a break, the judge kind of scolded the prosecution and talked about the level of detail that she was going into, saying it wasn't really relevant and that she just needed to directly answer the question. And twice while she was answering her questions, that was another interaction that happened where he said: \"Just directly answer that. You don't have to tell kind of a whole story about it.\"",

And so it was this fascinating moment. And then she was going into all of these details and talking about how Trump never had asked her to keep their affair quiet or to hide it.
