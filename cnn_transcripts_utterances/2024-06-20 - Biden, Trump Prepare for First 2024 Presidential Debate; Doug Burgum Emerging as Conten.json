The other meeting with V.P. hopefuls, working on sharpening his attacks.So let's bring in CNN political analyst and historian Leah Wright Rigueur; former federal prosecutor -- prosecutor Elliot Williams; former White House communications director Kate Bedingfield; and Lance Trover, spokesperson for North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum's 2024 presidential campaign. All right. So before we get into the debate, I do want to just talk about the state of the race right now. There was a FOX News poll out last -- last night, and probably better news that Biden has had in, really, months. He's been trailing. This one had him actually ahead, of course, within the margin of error. So there's really no clear leader: 50-48, it says here. There was a bit of a bump with independent voters for Biden in the last month or so. Lance is the Republican strategist here at the table. Is Biden getting a bump post-Trump conviction? LANCE TROVER, SPOKESPERSON, DOUG BURGUM'S 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN: I think national polls are a snapshot in time. You're getting a mood of the country in the moment right here on June 20, right? And that's what they are. I think what's more interesting right now is taking a look at what is happening in some of the states, some of the polling. We've seen Virginia become a little more competitive. We see Trump leading and sometimes winning in Nevada. We saw a poll from \"The Des Moines Register\" this week, and granted, it's Iowa. There was a 20-point delta. That is a huge number. But I also think it's interesting, looking at some of the congressional races out there, the Biden's swing districts. I'm talking to a lot of people on the Hill, pollsters and the like. Donald Trump is leading in these districts that Biden won in 2020 that have Republican members. So I think we also need to look at what's going on both in the states and the congressional races.",

But I also think that this underscores that the Biden campaign's theory of the case here, which is that, as people started to dial in, started to see Donald Trump, remember Donald Trump. Obviously, his conviction, as we've seen in the data, has played a significant part in making him unpalatable to some of these swing voters.But, you know, that as people started to dial into the race, they would find Trump less and less appealing and see Biden as the viable alternative. So, you know, I think for rural voters, for male voters, I think, you know, Biden has to continue to draw this contrast on -- on democracy, on the existential nature of this election. I think in some ways, talking about the fact that this election is -- you know, is historic and different, because Trump represents a threat to the very fabric of who we are as a country. That's a powerful message that lands with voters across the spectrum.",

And this is probably earlier than we are used to seeing candidates debating now.

And what we're seeing, I think, in some of these snapshot polls, again, it's way too early to call the race. But what we're seeing in some of these snapshot polls, is that their attempt to, one, win over independents on the nature of wisdom and age is -- is actually playing out quite well. But the other thing is that the Biden administration has launched this kind of long-term plan with older voters. And it is paying off in dividends. You know, I want to point out, again, that you know, American public has made a lot of really -- a lot of stink about the age of the two candidates. But in particularly Joe Biden. One of the things that we're going to have to see in the debate is that that age debate actually doesn't necessarily matter in the way that we think it does. And I still think that, at the end of the day, Americans are looking at the fact that they have two old white guys that are running. RAJU: Yes.",

      "sentences": "For Texas, some of that rain is dying down a little bit today. But for Mexico, we're going to continue to find some of that heavy rain, the storm surge. You've got that tropical storm. And landfall really imminent within the next few hoursWe do have a tornado watch still in effect from Corpus Christi down towards Brownsville, where when you get these kind of outer bands to come in, they're spinning. You can get some weak and brief tornadoes. So that's something that we've been watching for on the overnight. This as -- look at all the rain that has fallen. Widespread two to four inches. A lot of totals, 46 inches there in the orange around Corpus Christi, from some of that heavy rain. Rockport, Texas, you've got more than five inches of rain, which is more than your June average. An entire month's worth of average as to just incredible. The heavy rain continues to move inland in Mexico. That can cause some flash flooding, maybe even some landslides in some of those mountainous regions. And look at where the showers stretch as we go into Thursday and Friday. We're looking at some of these showers, even making it up to New Mexico, which they need the rain with some of the wildfires that we've had. But we don't need too much all at once. What happened yesterday was we had flash flood emergencies, because we have burn scars. The water is not really going to go anywhere, has nowhere to go when the ground is torched. So that's something that we have to watch out for as we go through the next couple of days. We still have extreme and exceptional drought conditions in New Mexico fueling these fires -- Manu.",
