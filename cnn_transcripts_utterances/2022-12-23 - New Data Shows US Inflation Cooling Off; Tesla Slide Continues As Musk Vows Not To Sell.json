Those are the markets and these are the main events. US consumers increased their spending last month as inflation cooled. Four thousand flights are canceled in the US amid a winter bomb cyclone. And parkour activists in Paris are helping turn out lights to save energy. Coming to you live from New York. It is Friday, December 23rd, two days before Christmas. I'm Zain Asher, in for Richard Quest, and I too, mean business. All right, good evening. After a year of rising prices and soaring energy bills, there are finally signs that peak inflation, maybe -- maybe -- behind us, at least in the United States. Prices in the US rose five and a half percent in November, that's according to the PCE Index. That's one of the Fed's favorite ways to gauge inflation, and it's the smallest rise since October of last year, it was more than six percent this past October. This isn't a picture seen everywhere, though. We also had inflation numbers from Japan today and prices there are now rising at their fastest rate in more than 40 years. CNN's global economic analyst, Rana Foroohar is joining us live now. So this sort of key inflation measurement, Rana, showing signs of slowing, showing signs of moderating, what should we be reading into this? Because it just sort of seems like a very mixed bag when it comes to the broad economic picture here in the US?",

      "sentences": "Well, it does. And you could say the same thing globally.You need to take the inflation number in the context of what else is happening in each country's economy, so just starting with the US. I think it's probably fair to say that the Fed has done a lot of work and that we are going to see slowing inflation for the next few months, and it is possible that we could have hit the peak. I mean, you began to see that in November-December, and you also see signs of consumers being pretty resilient in the face of all this, which is great news. That's exactly where the Fed wanted to end up in that kind of sweet spot where you get inflation under control, but you don't kill the economy. Looking abroad, the picture is not quite as rosy. As you mentioned, Japan is seeing the highest levels of inflation in 41 years, and even though they're not as high and the jump is not as big as some of the things we've seen elsewhere around the world, you know, this is coming in the face of a huge bout of energy inflation, a weekend, so people that are really going to feel the pain, and in parts of Europe, too. I would not want to be in the UK right now, and you know, not only because of the strikes, but because the inflationary picture there and Europe again, you know, not looking quite as bad as it would have maybe a few months ago, but it depends on how the winter goes and what happens with the war in Ukraine.",

Folks that we consider to be the essential workers of the last few years -- caregivers, teachers, their salaries simply cannot keep up with inflation. I mean, most people can't, but you're really seeing middle class jobs now under pressure. And, you know, people are looking around and hearing policymakers talk about wage inflation. And they're saying \"What wage inflation?\" Because if you look at the prices rising -- food, fuel housing -- it dwarfs any kind of increases that we've seen in wages.",

      "sentences": "Yes, so let's look at this through two lenses. First, the business lens, you're starting to see orders of durable goods slowing, thatis generally a sign when companies are pulling back, that's a sign that they think that there probably is a slowdown coming. At the same time, the US consumer has been way more resilient than people would have thought, and that is part because you had that over $2 trillion -- $2.2 trillion in additional savings, fiscal stimulus savings that was given to the US consumers, kind of gifted in the middle of the pandemic. About $700 billion of that has been spent down, but still leaves a heck of a lot of money lying around on balance sheets. So I suspect that you're going to see people not, you know, going out and spending wildly, but I think that the consumer is going to be resilient, certainly for the first half of 2023. I think one of the big things that is going to, as you point out, the labor market is going to really matter is how much are companies laying off, right? We've already seen a big slowdown in the tech sector. We've seen big banks in the US announcing layoffs. Does that labor market picture spread? And do you also start to see some of the investments that companies have made in things like automation, accent stripping software, you know, offshoring of white collar jobs? Do you see that really start to impact the labor picture in the US?",

Today, it is down more than 65 percent so far this year, including a fall of more than 30 percent just this month alone. It has led to some of its major investors to complain that Musk's attentions are being spread too thinly. Let's break all of this down with Paul La Monica. So Tesla hasn't had the best week to say the least, past six days they've been in the red. A lot of people, a lot of investors are complaining that listen, he is being stretched too thin that his focus right now seems to be squarely on Twitter, when it should be more on Tesla.",

There are always distractions for Elon Musk. I think part of the problem now is that it's not just that he is obsessed with Twitter, he might be alienating people that would be potential buyers of these pricey electric cars that Tesla sells, because again, as we have pointed out on this show, and I've mentioned to Richard and others before, Elon Musk isn't necessarily making friends with everyone right now on Twitter. He is alienating a lot of people with his behavior, and these very strange tweets and polls, and a lot of it is just really perplexing.

Let's talk about what we're seeing interms of discounts for some of the cars, discounts -- $7,000.00 discounts on the Model 3, Model Y, a lot of people are concerned that perhaps these discounts signal that the demand is slowing amid a slowing economy for electric cars, in particular.",

I think that the fact that the Model 3 and the Model Y are already the \"cheaper versions\" of the Model Sand the Model X, that could be a sign of weakening demand that you need to entice buyers with these discounts. And again, this might be an industry-wide problem as a lot of people worry about a recession to newer electric vehicle companies that are now public as well, Rivian and Lucid, both of their stocks hit all-time lows today. Granted, it's a brief trading history, but it just shows that this isn't only Tesla that is having a problem. Companies not run by Elon Musk are hurting as well.",

Now Facebook's parent company is making a huge payout to end legal action over the Cambridge Analytica data leak. It's a $725 million settlement as part of a class action lawsuit. The plaintiffs say that it is the most money ever paid in this kind of legal action. The case dates back to four years ago, after millions of users had their data leaked to Cambridge Analytica. Claire Duffy joins us live now from California. So, this is a huge payout, even for Meta, but the key here is that they're not technically admitting to any wrongdoing. Just walk us through that.",

And this was really sort of a turning point for Facebook, in terms of its reputation. It had been sort of a darling on Wall Street, on Capitol Hill with users, and this was sort of a change in how people were thinking about the power of this company and this platform. And so I think this settlement really sort of gets to the fact that Meta really wants to move on from this. The company has made changes to its privacy practices and policies, and this is something that the company does not want hanging over its head anymore. So as you say, Meta did not admit wrongdoing as part of this settlement, but the company sort of suggested in its statement today, it said, this settlement is in the best interest of our community and our shareholders, and just sort of suggested that this is something that they're looking forward to moving on from.",

And we'll look at the Parisian parkour athletes that are helping the city save energy. Before that though, this is CNN and, on this network, the news always comes first. Russian President Vladimir Putin describe the fighting in Ukraine as a war. While speaking to reporters Thursday. It is the first time he's publicly used that word. He's actually been calling it a special military operation for the last 10 months. Iran's most prominent Sunni cleric is urging sheikh leaders to stop executing protesters. A CNN investigation has found that 43 detained protesters in Iran could be facing imminent execution. Iranian authorities have been brutally cracking down on dissent since protests erupted in September, after a young woman died in police custody. The United States is condemning North Korea's missile launches. It comes after Pyongyang launched two short-range ballistic missiles on Friday. They landed in the water between the Korean Peninsula and Japan. That's according to South Korea. This marks the 36th day this year that North Korea has launched at least one missile. In Paris, three people were killed and one critically hurt by a gunman who attacked a Kurdish community center. Angry protesters surrounded the scene afterwards. They ended up clashing with police who fired tear gas to hold the crowd back. Police have arrested the suspect. So, they say has a history of violence with a racist nature. CNN's Jim Bitterman is in Paris at the very latest. So, Jim, you and I were speaking earlier. It looks as though the protesters -- the process rather have quelled, things have calmed down. But I understand you spoke to some people who are out in the streets. Why did they feel it was so important to come out?",

It's a very racially mixed neighborhood kind of a tough neighborhood. And there's been trouble with police in the past. So, I think when they saw the police set up the court and around the crime scene, they became agitated. I don't know who fell through the first stone but in fact, there were exchanges of stones and other objects as well as tear gas. And after that it kind of degenerated from there. It's kind of calmed down now. But here basically is how the day unfolded. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BANDERAS (voice over): Within minutes of the shooting at a Kurdish center, police had a suspect in custody. A witness described the scene. ALI DILEK, WITNESS (through translator): They had arrested a guy an old man. Elderly tall, and that there were three wounded people in the room.

BIITERMANN (on camera): What we know now about the government is that 69- yeart-old Frenchman who was only out of jail, got -- only got out of jail 11 days ago because he was being preventively held because of a similar crime a year ago. Police are still investigating, but at the moment they think this is a crime of racist nature and not necessarily a terrorist crime. BIITERMANN (voice over): They are investigating a crime as murder and attempted murder. Officials at the center where the attacks occurred, said those killed were activists and said that there would be a vigil to remind everyone of the plight of the Kurdish community.

Its method of countingdeaths goes against the World Health Organization's guidelines and experts say it will severely under counted the COVID death toll. By China's count, less than 10 people have died of COVID this month. It is a shockingly low number, especially considering how fast COVID is spreading in China and the relatively low vaccination rate of the elderly. But what we've witnessed on the ground in China at crematoriums and hospitals, it points to a very different situation. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) WANG (voice over): The burning can't go fast enough. WANG (on camera): The smoke behind me it's been billowing constantly from all the bodies that are burning and these crates over here they're all full of yellow body bags. WANG (voice over): Workers later open those metal containers here at a major Beijing crematorium, revealing groups of body bags as they load more coffins in the freezing cold temperatures. Crematoriums and major cities are swamped as COVID sweeps through the country. But China has only reported a small handful of COVID deaths since reopening late last month. WANG (on camera): I spoke to a man earlier who said that his close friend passed away from a fever, normally the hospital would hold the body but the hospital told him that there were too many dead bodies. He said he's been waiting here for hours, and he still has no idea if his friend's body can even get cremated today. There is a long line of cars that snakes around this whole area waiting to get into that cremation area. I'm in the parking lot right now and it's completely full of cars. I'm speaking here because there are many, many security guards patrolling this entire area. WANG (voice over): Grieving family members clutch photos of the deceased, some tell us off camera they know that their loved ones died from COVID and have waited for more than a day for cremation. Busy shops nearby sell funerary items with paper money, clothes, houses, and animals used in burial traditions stream on the side of the road. A woman who sells flowers says she's running out of stock. A man selling urns says business has jumped. Even the convenience store and the crematorium grounds is getting busier. Normally you are so busy, right? I asked. The man nods and tells me that normally there's nobody here. And it's not just in Beijing. Social media video shows crowded crematoriums and funeral homes around the country. At this funeral home in Jinan, the man is saying it's going insane. Here it is packed with cars. Vans carrying bodies stretch all the way into the distance in front of this crematorium in Szechuan (ph). WANG (on camera): This is a COVID-designated hospital in Beijing. There's been a steady stream of elderly patients in wheelchairs being led into this hospital. I spoke to a man who has been waiting outside for his elderly family member who he said is very sick with a high fever from COVID. But he said this hospital, it's running out of bed space. WANG (voice over): I asked the worker outside of this hospital. Did a lot of people die here? Yes. Every day, he response. I asked. Is it all because of COVID? Yes, people with underlying conditions he says. China is now going through the painful reopening the rest of the world has already gone through. But it's not sharing the same data. The government now says it's narrowing the definition of COVID-19 deaths only to patients who died of respiratory failure directly caused by the virus. People who spoke to at the crematorium may have said their loved ones died of COVID but their deaths and so many others won't be counted in the official tally. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
