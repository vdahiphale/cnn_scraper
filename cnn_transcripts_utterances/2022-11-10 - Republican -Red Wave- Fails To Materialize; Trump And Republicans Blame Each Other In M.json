What I am here in Atlanta, Georgia, where election officials are now preparing for a runoff election next month between incumbent senator Raphael Warnock and Republican hopeful Herschel Walker.Counting is still underway in a number of close races for both the Senate and the Lower House, which means we still don't know which party will control the U.S. Congress. Republicans were expecting a huge red wave of support, easily taking control of the Senate and in the Lower House picking up 30 maybe more seats. While the GOP is on track to win the House, the majority will be razor thin. Results from Senate races in three states are yet to be called leaving Democrats holding 48 seats in the upper chamber. Republicans 49. In Arizona, incumbent Democrat Mark Kelly is leading Republican Blake Masters with hundreds of thousands of votes to be counted. In Nevada, Republican Adam Laxalt is leading the incumbent Democrat Catherine Cortez Masto. State officials there say final results not expected before next Thursday. Now the poor showing by Republicans means President Biden can breathe a little easier, even though GOP control of either house of Congress will be getting anything done over the next two years could be next to impossible. So, Biden now reaching out to moderate Republicans to work with his administration. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN, U.S. PRESIDENT: I don't think we're going to break the fever for the super mega MAGA Republicans. I mean, but I think they're a minority of the Republican Party. I think the vast majority of the members of the Republican Party we disagree strongly on issues but they're decent, honorable people. (END VIDEO CLIP) VAUSE: More now from CNN senior White House correspondent Phil Mattingly. (BEGIN VIDOE TAPE) PHIL MATTINGLY, CNN SENIOR WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT (on camera): Less than 24 hours after election results rolled in that made the White House feel far better than they thought they were going to going into President Biden's first midterm election. The President spoke laying out in detail a kind of calibrated approach to recognition. And Washington is about to be reshaped. Republicans are very likely to take the majority in the House and that voters are still largely not happy. There's still real problems, obviously with inflation that remains sky high and just a general discontent in the wake of the worst pandemic in more than a century. But the President also making clear that there was a little bit of vindication in those results. Take a listen.",

      "sentences": "President Biden spoke in a wide ranging news conference really his first formal news conference, and almost 10 months walking into foreign policy issues detailing how his White House is going to view the next several months with Republican leaders that he's going to have to work with more than he did in the past.One in particular, House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy, the likely next speaker, he and Biden don't have much of a relationship, they know each other somewhat, but not a lot, that is probably going to have to change. In fact, the President and McCarthy spoke by phone on Wednesday night and underscored the dynamics of what's to come and dynamics that are going to be far different than most Republicans thought heading into election day. In fact, that Republicans are going to have a majority that was never really a question that they're only going to have at this point what looks like a few seat majority that could be potentially very problematic for McCarthy and for Republicans and an advantageous issue for the White House. One, Biden alluded to saying he believed with a very small majority, that perhaps there were efforts or at least options and peeling off Republicans for some types of bipartisan legislation. Overall, though, as the President gets set to head to Asia for a two-week long foreign trip, things are simply better than White House officials thought they were going to be in this moment. There's no denying that. The vindication they feel is very real validation. The President said he feels based on his agenda and how it channeled into the results. Also very real, what this means going forward. Well, Washington will most certainly be different, and not nearly as different as White House officials and just about everybody else thought heading in to Election Day.

Former President Trump, you know, endorse a number of candidates who were either problematic for a variety of reasons or election deniers.Just in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania alone, he endorsed Doug Mastriano, who was just wiped out and caused problems down ballot for Republicans and this happened in other places around the country as well. So Donald Trump is going to take a lot of the blame for what happened because of his unhelpful interventions in the primary. Talking about the past constantly the insurrection in 2020 and his election denialism that hurt him. And of course, you know, Ron DeSantis had a terrific night, you know, winning Florida by 20 points. He's ascendant, you know, he's setting himself up as the future. And, you know, the better part of the Republican Party as opposed to Donald Trump in the past. So I think that Trump's got a problem on his hands. In fact, I would even argue that Donald Trump is probably regretting the day that he endorsed Ron DeSantis in the 2018 gubernatorial primary in Florida, over Adam Putnam, who was on his way to victory in the primary until Trump interceded, so Trump only has himself to blame.",

Because it's strange to me, because why wasn't the violent insurrection of January 6 enough to marginalize Trump and the party? Why wasn't the big lie enough to marginalize him? Why wasn't his endorsement of rising fascism right and one in three Republicans thinking that violence might be necessary in order to save the country? That wasn't enough. His mishandling of classified documents, not to mention all the scandals, that's not enough to distance the party from Trump.But I do think that him costing elections will be enough.

And I suspect, with a very small majority, this may actually temper some of the most overzealous oversight initiatives of Republicans, I mean, if they want to focus their time on and obsess over Hunter Biden's laptop, and impeaching Joe Biden, that means they're not going to be doing the necessary oversight. They should be doing maybe the withdrawal from Afghanistan, how monies are being spent from all this money that the Biden administration has push forward, that's where they should be spending their time. That would be useful. But they will not help themselves politically, you know, embarking on impeachments, just for pure political reasons. The American people will see through that, but it's really up to the leadership to, you know, be the adults in the room to try to force the members to stay on a more solid, sustainable political path.

I think Kevin McCarthy has proven himself to be hyper partisan, and a Trump loyalists even given, you know, I guess his flip position on January 6, where he was critical of Trump and then again in the Trump camp.So, I actually do think that what we will see is a massive waste of time, with a lot of partisan investigations. I think unfortunately, we will immediately see the cessation of the January 6 committee so that investigatory work will cease. I think what we will have is an incredibly hyper partisan moment of gridlock for the next two years. And Biden knew this.

      "sentences": "Well, the election has come and gone and with neither candidate getting 50 percent of the vote, this Senate race is headed for a runoff. The runoff here in Georgia will look different than it has in years past, because of the 2021 law that cut the length of the runoffs from nine weeks to 4 weeks. That's significant, because anyone that wants to register that didn't vote in the midterm election that wants to vote in this runoff, has already missed a deadline. There's no telling how that will impact the final outcome of this race, but it will no doubt have an impact.Meanwhile on Wednesday, the secretary of state's office held a press, conference during which they said by Wednesday afternoon there was about 10,000 ballots remaining but that number not significant enough to get either candidate over the threshold to avoid the runoff. Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger did say that there office is already making preparations for that run-off election on December 6th, prepping ballots to be sent out to counties, for them to get signed off on by November 14th. Additionally, the absentee portal for anyone that wants to go that way has been opened. Early voting could begin as early as November 26. If there's one thing that is clear here, is that for the 2nd consecutive election cycle, Georgia will continue to be at the center of the political universe, at least for the next four weeks.
