I mean, she was there at Mar- a-Lago with him, and she's figured out how to survive. Her survival skill is to not be an intense gatekeeper. Essentially, she knows to let people in. Trump loves his kitchen cabinet. Look, you might not get a role in his actual cabinet, but you have, you know, an ability to call him, to go to Mar-a-Lago and speak to him. And she has learned that to try to put a stopgap between him and people say, like Laura Loomer, that might cause her some problems.So, she's been able to figure out Trump. She tends to sort of bend to his will rather than push up against it. She knows when to pick her battles. There'll be times where she'll say, hey, this maybe isn't the greatest choice, but she's really been able to like pick and choose when it's time to come up against him and play the role of the adult in the room, sort of try to challenge maybe his worst instincts. And that's how she survived. I mean, she's a survivor. She is a mild mannered, 66-year-old grandmother.",

Both of his campaigns that he won were won by strong, smart women and now he's appointed the first female White House chief of staff.This is a groundbreaking pick, it is a smart pick, and Donald Trump -- and it's a quick pick, by the way, decisive, he didn't meander on this, he didn't linger, a decisive move.

Andrew Yang points out that if the president, if he had stepped down in January instead of in July, we may have been in a very different place. Bernie Sanders, he says that the whole party decided to just outright ignore the needs of the working class.And if you go to Philadelphia, that city's Democratic Party chair blames the campaign for not showing everyone some, R, E, S, P, E, C, T, quote, they were just elitist.

RAMPELL:  I think we will be litigating this and re-litigating this for many years to come.

She had many, many chances to do so, and which the public wanted, right? I mean, voters were eager for change, whatever that means. And instead, she refused to distance herself from him. Not only that, she sort of enhanced the Bidenomics agenda. You know, she hired a lot of the same people. She had a lot of the same messaging. And, in fact, a more left wing version in, in some cases of, of that messaging, some of which I agreed with and some of which I didn't. And, you know, the thing that Americans disliked most about Joe Biden was Bidenomics.
