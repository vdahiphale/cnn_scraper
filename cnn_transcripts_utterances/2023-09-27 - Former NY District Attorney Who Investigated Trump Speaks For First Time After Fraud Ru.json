      "sentences": "Tonight, straight from THE SOURCE.Donald Trump, on the brink, of losing his real estate empire, after a judge effectively branded him a fraud, and exposed a decade's worth of financial lies. The prosecutor, who kicked off that investigation, is here with me, tonight. Plus, the U.S. soldier, who mysteriously bolted, over the border, into North Korea, is on his way, back to the U.S., right now. Even more puzzling, why Kim Jong Un let him go? And after more than six years, in NFL exile, quarterback Colin Kaepernick, now trying to get back in. But will the New York Jets pass on his Hail Mary? I'm Kaitlan Collins. And this is THE SOURCE. Donald Trump has just lost another legal battle, tonight, as he is also on the cusp of losing what's at the heart, of his entire identity, his business empire and his brand. First, on the legal front. The judge, who is overseeing his federal election interference case, has denied his demand that she recuse herself, from overseeing that case. Judge Tanya Chutkan deciding that, quote, it is \"Not warranted,\" after the former President claimed that she wanted to see him behind bars. Meanwhile, tonight, Trump is calling for a different judge, the one here in New York, to quote, \"Be stopped.\" The judge found that he and his two adult sons were liable for fraud, saying that they massively overvalued his assets, deceived banks, and exaggerated Trump's net worth, in making deals and securing loans. Essentially, he's not as rich as he claims to be, and his property is not valued at what he said it was. In his first hearing, today, that happened, since this ruling, came down, last night. Trump's attorneys seemed to struggle, to even understand the implications, of what the judge's call means exactly here. One of Trump's attorneys actually asked the judge, to clarify, what does this ruling mean for his businesses? The attorney asked another question, one that's pretty fundamental, it seemed to be, what's the point of a trial, at this point, given this ruling? Well, that trial is set to begin on Monday. But what is still at the heart of the question here, and what this ruling, from the judge, could mean, is whether or not this is the beginning of the end of the Trump real estate empire. And let's go straight to THE SOURCE, with former Manhattan District Attorney, Cy Vance, who was the first to get Trump's tax returns, and then turn them over to the New York Attorney General, essentially kicking off the process that ultimately led to this ruling. And he joins me now. Thank you so much, for being here. We haven't heard from you yet, on this ruling, at large. What was your reaction to it? CYRUS VANCE JR., FORMER MANHATTAN DISTRICT ATTORNEY, PARTNER: Well, I wasn't surprised by the ruling. Having litigated, against the Trump team, and its lawyers, and its tactics, I wasn't surprised by the some strong statements, by the court, about the tactics and the like. But my reaction is that by granting partial summary judgment, on some of the liability issues, it's going to be a very uphill road, for the Trump legal team, as we get into next week's trial. And obviously, the consequences of perhaps decertifying, the Trump Organization, affecting its ability, to operate in New York, is a major consequence, at least I believe, both practically and, I think, optically, for the Trump Organization, as it heads into this litigation-heavy year, coming up. So, I think the A.G.'s trial will be fascinating. I think the case that she has built, it, was very similar to the case that we were building, at the end of my tenure, as D.A. I think it's strong. And I think they've done an excellent job.",

Should this have been charged, though, as a criminal case?VANCE JR.: Well, it's very similar to the criminal case that our office was investigating, at the end of my tenure. We had, as I say, we got the Supreme Court -- from the Supreme Court, favorable rulings, on the fact that no person, even a president, is immune from investigation, which led us to get the tax records. And within four months, the organization, Trump Organization had been indicted, along with the CFO. We then moved into an economic investigation phase, which I brought Mark Pomerantz in, to lead. And I felt the case Mark was building, quite similar to the one that the A.G. has built, is a strong case. It's not that it doesn't have challenges. It's a complex case. It's a historical case. It requires jurors, understanding real estate valuations, which isn't rocket science, but nonetheless, it's not an easy case to present. But I think it's a strong case. And ultimately, my successor, and I'm not second-guessing him, but my successor decided not to proceed with the case, that we were building, and to proceed instead, on a case, involving hush money payments.",

So, I was -- I felt strongly that the case was going in the right direction, and was potentially a strong case.

Could we see his name, taken off Trump Tower, ultimately, as a result of this? VANCE JR.: Well, I, you know, if your company essentially loses its license, to operate, in the State, it absolutely could lead to the Trump Organization not being able to operate, as the Trump Organization, in New York. And of course, the Trump Organization is Donald Trump's alter ego. It's how he defines himself, to the world, as a successful corporation, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. And I think that the air on that balloon has been -- is happening quickly, with the series of first, the conviction of the corporation, for financial crimes, in the Manhattan -- from the Manhattan D.A.'s office, then the four separate criminal charges, and indictments, which are all serious. And the A.G. is beginning a trial, where the judge has, after exhausted discovery, pre-determined that many of the issues, the Trump Organization was fighting, were both frivolous and wrong.

He says it could be 100 times that.But I'm not going to ask you to evaluate the property value, of his beach club, in Florida. But you brought up the judge here. The judge, in a separate case? And I know this is something that you've weighed in before. Judge Chutkan, in Washington, who is overseeing that election obstruction case, has just ruled, tonight, she is not going to recuse herself, after Trump wanted her to do so, from that case. She said, quote, that the court has never essentially been able to prove that they -- that she took this position that they said she did, that Trump should be prosecuted and imprisoned. Those were his claims. What did you make of her ruling, tonight? VANCE JR.: Well, Kaitlan, I think, what the judge is doing is respectfully saying, \"Donald Trump, you're not controlling this courtroom. I am.\" And I'm sure that her ruling, if he is convicted, I'm sure that ruling will be an issue on appeal. But I think the judge is obviously a very smart, and very strong, very experienced judge. And I think she's saying \"You don't get to knock me out of this case, just because you don't like me.\" And she's weighing out the list of reasons why Trump is wrong. It is legal and factual analysis. And she wants the case to move. And this is the biggest challenge, I think, all these judges have is controlling the Trump legal team, and Trump himself, from trying to -- from disrupting the proceedings, both outside the courtroom, and inside the courtroom.

Van Jones, a former Obama administration official; and Scott Jennings, a former Senior Adviser to Mitch McConnell.

And so, I think, he's trying to continue to see if he can expand on that.Now, some people think he's maxed it out that he's done all he can do, among that segment. But I think the Trump campaign is hoping that because Joe Biden has such low marks, on the economy, because a lot of people blame him, for inflation, because a lot of people are upset, with the Biden administration, on the electric vehicle subsidies, and threatening their own livelihoods, that he could maybe inch it up, just a few points.

You rewind the tape, when Biden was running for Vice President, in 2012. Mitt Romney went out there, saying good stuff about unions.
