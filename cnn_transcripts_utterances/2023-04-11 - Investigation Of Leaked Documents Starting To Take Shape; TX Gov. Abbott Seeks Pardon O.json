And coming up next for us, a political firestorm in Texas. The Republican governor there is putting a convicted murderer on the fast track for a pardon before he was even sentenced. We'll tell you why. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) [13:40:43] PHILLIP: Texas Governor Greg Abbott, he's now calling on the state's Board of Pardons and Paroles to quickly review and recommend a pardon for Army Sergeant Daniel Perry. It comes after Perry was just convicted of murdering Garrett Foster at a Black Lives Matter protest in Austin three years ago, Now Perry's team argued that he was acting in self-defense when he shot Foster. Foster was carrying a legally -- a legally-obtained A.K.- 47 rifle. Now Governor Abbott has faced growing calls from national conservative figures, including FOX News's Tucker Carlson to issue a pardon for Perry. Watch this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TUCKER CARLSON, FOX HOST, \"TUCKER CARLSON TONIGHT\": This is illegal atrocity and so obviously unjust that tonight we extended an invitation to the sitting governor of Texas, Greg Abbott, to come on this show on Monday. And we wanted to ask if he was considering a pardon for Daniel Perry. But for some reason, Governor Greg Abbott's office told us he just can't make it. There is no right of self-defense in Texas.

Why -- why do you think this is happening here with Governor Abbott? It is a little reminiscent of how conservatives rallied around Kyle Rittenhouse after the Kenosha shooting. He was acquitted of killing a Black Lives Matter protester. Why do you see this happening?",

      "sentences": "Well, I think, in this specific instance, Abbott is afraid of the power of FOX News, Tucker Carlson and the extremist MAGA base of the Republican party.Look, and I think, if this pardon goes through without even the sentencing, and without even the legal process, having given a chance to go through what it should go through, it is dangerous. It sets -- it sets a really scary precedent. Because as I understand it -- as I understand it, the facts of the case are that it was not self-defense. If you look at the posts, the social media posts of Perry, he went there to try to kill people. And that's exactly what he did. He turned his car into the public. And one of those people that he almost hurt was Foster's wife. Foster went to signal to him to just move on, so that he couldn't hurt people anymore, and Perry took that as an affront to him. And he even said, I didn't even give him a chance to aim at me. He did it. He killed him right then and there in cold blood. And so I think it sets a very dangerous president for this governor to now go into huge gubernatorial power overreach on this issue. And I think it's going to hurt him.",

That was expected to happen tomorrow.But I do have to disagree with my friend, Maria, there in terms of what the facts appear to be in this case. Is that Perry was dropping someone off as an Uber driver in the area and his car was surrounded by the protesters. He was in fear for his life. And the victim here pulled out an A.K.- 47, pointed in his direction, and he feared for his life and fired at him with a gun that he kept in his vehicle for his own protection. And look, I have full faith and confidence in the judge and jury process. But clearly, Governor Abbott sees this in a different way. And he is clearly standing up for the Texas Stand Your Ground law, which allows people to protect themselves. And he is not, I don't believe, being swayed by Tucker Carlson and FOX News. He's looking at this from the standpoint of the people of the state of Texas and the Stand Your Ground law. And he is making it clear to his constituents that he's going to take steps to protect that. (CROSSTALK)",

The battle over Mifepristone is really heating up. And I want you to look at this recent poll from Ipsos. It shows an overwhelming 70 percent of Americans oppose federal courts banning access to that abortion drug. More than 50 percent of Republicans oppose it. And just yesterday, GOP Congresswoman Nancy Mace, she's calls herself pro-life. She told CNN that we're getting we're getting it wrong on this issue. And she said, we have to listen to women. Is it possible that Republicans, and even the courts being pushed by Republican activists, activists maybe going too far here?",

Because they look at this and the numbers that the pro-life advocates are looking at have to do with the dangers of these medical abortion pills.And I know that you shared earlier some of the facts and data that has been shared by the FDA. But pro-life advocates are looking at this, the way the FDA did these tests, they didn't feel as though it was full and complete and done. In the typical way the FDA does this. They're concerned with the safety of women. Oftentimes, the injuries to the mother are not reported because they are not required to go to seek a doctor's care or go to the emergency room. So a lot of the injuries to the mothers are unreported for that very reason. (CROSSTALK)",

And based on the numbers of people and where they stand on this issue, I do see a way or a pathway for these types of medical abortions to proceed. But it's in the legal process now and that -- the judges and the courts are making this decision. But ultimately, again, this is one of the many issues I think are best left up to elected officials at the state level. And it should not be adjudicated in the court.
