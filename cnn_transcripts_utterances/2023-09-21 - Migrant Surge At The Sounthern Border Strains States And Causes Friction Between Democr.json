CNN has just learned there were 8,600 arrests in the last 24 hours throughout the southwest portion. Now President Biden is sending another 800 troops to that region, as he also addresses concerns miles to the north.New York state officials have been pleading for his help, saying their facilities are overwhelmed with asylum seekers. In response, the president is opening up work permits to hundreds of thousands more migrants. We begin the hour in Eagle Pass, Texas. The border town declared a state of emergency because of the surge. CNN's Ed Lavendera is there, not far from the river. Ed, take us there. What's going on behind you?",

They will be facing the state trespassing charges, so they will be essentially put through a traditional U.S. and Texas court system.That has, as I've mentioned, been very controversial over the last few months. And then, of course, there's the other family units -- the family units you see over there sitting behind that car beyond where the troopers are, those folks will be turned over to Border Patrol and processed as well. So it will take days and days for many of these people either to be deported or released from custody. It is not exactly clear where eventually these people will end up, but for the time being, they will be processed through the various state and federal systems here and where they end up, if they end up getting the paperwork they need to be able to present their asylum case in the U.S. It will take some days to really kind of get a clear answer as to where exactly all of these people will end up.",

      "sentences": "Boris, picking up there on your conversation with Ed, a lot of Venezuelans go into the United States as they go through their immigration court proceedings, many of them seeking asylum from a country that has been undergoing political and economic turmoil. And many of them went to the state of New York. And over the last few weeks, we've been covering those tensions between New York City Mayor Eric Adams and the White House over work permits and making sure that these people can work as, again, they go through their immigration court proceedings.And that was the big announcement yesterday evening, which is that the White House is expanding what's called a temporary protective status to make 472,000 Venezuelans already in the United States eligible for these work permits, as well as giving them deportation protections. This is significant. This is the largest expansion of this status that we have seen to date. And it is indicative of the challenges this administration faces with this particular population. Given the frosty relations between the United States and Venezuela, it is very hard for the U.S. to deport people back to Venezuela. And that's exactly the population we're seeing the most of along the U.S. southern border. And so by now allowing some of those who are already here the potential to work, it can at least start to relieve some of the pressures in some of these northeastern cities and interior cities elsewhere in the United States. But to be clear, Boris, this only applies to those who were residing in the U.S. on or before July 31st. Those people that you saw crossing there behind Ed would not be eligible for this status.",

Here in about an hour, he will be meeting with President Biden at the White House. But this morning, he was meeting with lawmakers on Capitol Hill. It's a much different place for him than it was the last time that he visited in March of last year.This time, Republicans are in control of the House of Representatives. The speaker is skeptical of sending more aid to Kiev, and some GOP hardliners are willing to shut down Washington over it. Let's get to CNN White House correspondent Jeremy Diamond. Jeremy Zelenskyy has a much more receptive audience than President Biden than he just had with Speaker McCarthy, for sure. What are we expecting to come out of their meeting, though?",

Uncertainty about that $24 billion aid package, despite the plea from President Zelenskyy behind closed doors meeting with senators today. I'm told from attendees in the room that what Zelenskyy said, he said, quote, you give money, we give lives. That was one of the messages that he said. He also said that if the money dries up from the United States, it could have a cascading effect.European countries could follow suit. And he warned that Ukraine could fall to Russia if the U.S. backs away. All coming as a major debate is playing on on the Hill about whether to provide that money this month as part of a bill to keep the government open by October 1st. No final decision had been made about how they will deal with that. But that is a debate particularly happening on the Republican side of the aisle. There is a large number of support among Senate Republicans. There's a large number of opposition among House Republicans. But there are a faction of Senate Republicans like Senator Josh Hawley, one who is sharply critical about providing more aid to Ukraine, arguing that it is not in the U.S. interest. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOSH HAWLEY, SENATOR FOR MISSOURI (R):  Oh, they're totally wrong. (LAUGHTER) About this and so many other things. But listen, I mean, they're wrong. Number one, we've spent 115 billion on Ukraine. What I heard last night from the administration is that may be just a very -- and not only maybe, it is just the very beginning. They want 25 billion more now. They're going to ask for more later. There's no end in sight. We were told this could literally go on for years. It's another forever war. THOM TILLS, SENATOR FOR NORTH CAROLINA (R):  Quite honestly, I don't believe you can convince Josh Hawley to change his opinion. So why waste the time? Go focus on the vast majority of the members who are prepared to support it. And let's see what we can get on the House side. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

He also denied a joint meeting of Congress for Zelenskyy to speak to, unlike what he did in the Democratic controlled Congress.All raising major questions here, Brianna, about exactly how the speaker will deal with this. He has made no guarantees that he will move forward on this aid package, certainly not as part of a bill to keep the government open. But will he do it later in the fall?

As of right now, Kevin McCarthy is huddled in his office with all the chairmen of his spending committees as they try to figure out a path forward on funding bills. And one of the things being discussed is making some changes to that defense bill that went down on the floor a little bit ago. One of the ideas being discussed is cutting Ukraine assistance from that bill.It includes $300 million for the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative. But that is money that has been allocated to Ukraine since 2014. It is different than the $24 billion aid package that hardliners are also opposed to. But even though that might win over some of the hardline critics, it's unclear if the rest of the party would go along with that. A number of defense hawks and moderates and appropriators are very still supportive of Ukraine money, and especially on the day that Zelenskyy came and visited the Hill pleading for more resources. But I think more broadly here, there is serious concerns and doubts about whether House Republicans are going to be able to pass a broader bill to avoid a government shutdown in nine days from now. Even though the House GOP came up with a plan and they loaded it up with conservative goodies to try to get the right flank on board, there are still a number of hardliners who are opposed and they don't have the votes at this moment to proceed ahead with that bill to avoid a government shutdown. And it's created a lot of frustration and tension inside the ranks. Just take a listen to Mike Lawler, who represents a Biden won swing district in New York. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
