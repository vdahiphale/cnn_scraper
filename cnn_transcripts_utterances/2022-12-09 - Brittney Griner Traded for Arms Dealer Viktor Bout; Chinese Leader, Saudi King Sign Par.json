And from there, Griner will be taken to an army medical center on the base, which specializes in treating survivors of torture and other trauma. Russia agreed to her release, in exchange for Viktor Bout, one of the world's most notorious arms dealers, who was found guilty of and convicted for conspiring to kill Americans. The two briefly crossed paths while on the tarmac of a runway in Abu Dhabi, where the swap took place. Griner was sentenced to nine years in prison, what was seen as a harsh punishment for possession of a small amount of cannabis oil, which was found in her luggage at a Moscow airport. Her attorneys argued it was medicinal use, prescribed by a doctor to relieve chronic pain. News of the prisoner swap came hours earlier, with the U.S. president making the announcement from the White House. And, alongside Joe Biden was Griner's wife, Cherelle. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

It's bothering them that we're -- that journalists are asking those questions. Wow. I mean, talk about being completely out of touch. And I'm sure people watching this and seeing the one clip after another, after another. I mean, it seems like something surreal out of the most crazy movie you'd never think that this could be said. One of those soundbites, much less the next, much less the next. And here we are. And as I said before, you know, it is -- it is just unconscionable that this is happening. As I said before, I can't believe it. You, know, if all the things that I've covered in sports, I don't think I've ever heard that much of a completely out-of-touch heartless cruel, frankly, reaction to the death of a worker who is involved in the event. But, even then, even if it was just a human being that had nothing to do with the event, I don't know that I've ever heard soundbites and comments quite that bed, that many of them all put together by the very people running the event.
