In Washington today, new details are emerging about President Biden's decision to order the dramatic shoot-down of a Chinese spy balloon. Today U.S. Navy divers and other military personnel are collecting that debris off the coast of Myrtle Beach, South Carolina.A U.S. fighter jet fired a missile through the balloon yesterday to bring it down. Top republicans say the Biden administration acted indecisively and waited too long, letting the balloon to float across the continental U.S. for days. President Biden says the military advised him there would be less danger to the public in shooting down the balloon once it got over the ocean. Lawmakers are reacting sharply and along party lines. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. TED CRUZ (R-TX): I want to start by doing something that I don't do very often, which is commending Joe Biden for actually having the guts to shoot this down. That was the right thing to do. That is absolutely what the president should have done. Unfortunately, he didn't do that until a week after it entered U.S. airspace. SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY): They're saying we should have shot down the balloon the minute we saw it. I would use two words in answering these GOP criticisms. They are premature and they are political. SEN. MARCO RUBIO (R-FL): Presidents have the ability to go before a camera, go before the nation and basically explain these things early on, and his failure to do so, I don't understand that. I don't understand why he wouldn't do that. And that is the beginning of dereliction of duty. And the second is, we have to act swiftly on these things. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "Yeah, Jim. This timeline is absolutely critical and it is also what Republicans are using to fuel much of their criticism as we just heard there. We are learning from U.S. officials that this balloon first entered into U.S. airspace on January 28th. That was in Alaska. The president got his first briefing on Tuesday, the 31st. So that, Jim, is four days before this balloon was eventually shot down.And during that briefing, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Mark Milley, as well as other military commanders, informed the president that this balloon had made its way down from Alaska through Canada and would be entering U.S. airspace. And it did so on that day, on Tuesday entering into Idaho. We now know that it then floated across into Montana and across eastwards across the United States. On Tuesday in that briefing, President Biden did ask for military options and was presented with them on the next day, on Wednesday when Milley and others, including the Secretary of Defense, Lloyd Austin, advised the president against shooting it down over land because it was simply too dangerous for people and for property on the ground. The president, we're told, made clear to his military commanders he did want to shoot it down as soon as possible, not just to block it from its intelligence-gathering capabilities, not just to do it in a way that would make sure that people did not get hurt, but in a way, Jim, that the surveillance payload that hung underneath that balloon could be salvaged. Now, that happened, as we know, as soon as it hit water yesterday right off the coast of Myrtle Beach, South Carolina. The administration will still have to answer a lot of questions. And one of the first instances that they will have to do that is as early as Tuesday when the so-called Gang of Eight will get a briefing from the administration. The Gang of Eight, let's remind our viewers, those are the top leaders from both parties in the House and the Senate as well as the chairman and ranking members of the intelligence committees in both the House and the Senate. They will be asked as to why the balloon wasn't shot down sooner, but also about the administration's claim that they were able to block this Chinese balloon from gathering a lot of the intelligence that it intended to, as well as the claim by the Biden administration that they were able to gather counterintelligence on this Chinese balloon as it crossed the United States. You can also imagine that these members of Congress will be asking about the recovery efforts so far, what they have been able to glean, what the recovery efforts will look like going forward. So, Jim, this week-long saga of this balloon crossing the continental United States, that may now be over as much of it sits 47 feet below water. But so many questions still to be answered. Jim? ACOSTA: Absolutely. All right. Alex Marquardt, thank you very much. Now let's go to the ground in Surfside Beach, South Carolina where locals there on the scene were watching with their own eyes as this massive balloon was shot down. CNN's Carlos Suarez is there. Carlos, I'm sure this stirred up a lot of reactions there on the beach. What are you hearing?",

In fact, some of the rain that we've had seems to have moved through and so we're told that the work to try to get some of this debris out will begin in earnest in the next couple of hours if not the next couple of days.[17:05:03 In fact, in the last hour or so, we were able to make out what appears to be a military vessel just off the coast here in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina. We're told that all of this is taking place at least 10 miles off the coastline. Now, officials believe that crews are going to be able to get to this debris site relatively quick in large part because it is in some shallow water off the coastline. Initially, we're told that officials thought this was going to land in deeper water. However, we're being told that much of the debris, it seems, is in water that is about 47 feet deep. And so, the thinking is that a team of divers as well as unmanned military equipment is going to be able to get to the bottom of the ocean where this debris is. They're going to be able to lift it up and put it onto a military vessel, where it will no doubt be analyzed. And then from here in South Carolina, it's going to be taken north to -- from South Carolina rather, it's going to be taken north to Virginia where we're told that the FBI as well as a number of other agencies are going to get a closer look at the technology that was on board as well as whatever else may have ended up coming down here. Again, we're being told this debris field is about seven miles in an area, and folks are being told if you come across any of this debris, ignore it. Don't take it home. Don't bother it because, Jim, it is part of a federal investigation.",

But, Jim, it's clear that China doesn't want to escalate things further.Beijing has been trying to repair the relationship with the U.S., and Secretary of State Antony Blinken's now postponed trip to China was supposed to be a big political win. Now, both the U.S. and China use surveillance satellites to spy on each other from the air. So, if China already has these more sophisticated satellites, we're still left with this question of why it would use a balloon for spying and why at such a critical moment right before Blinken's trip. We still don't know if it was an accident, if it was a deliberate test to see how the U.S. military and Biden would respond. We still don't know if Xi Jinping was looped in because it certainly is an embarrassment and a setback. Now, as you say, China has been sticking to this line that it's just a civilian research balloon, a weather balloon that went off course. State media even announced that the head of China's weather service has been dismissed, which some analysts say is an attempt to support Beijing's claim that this was indeed a weather balloon that went astray. Now, the U.S. says they are confident this was a surveillance balloon trying to monitor sensitive military sites. The U.S. said this balloon and the other one that was spotted over Latin America have surveillance equipment not usually used for standard civilian research and say both are part of a fleet of Chinese spy balloons that have been spotted across five continents over the last several years.",

Some are mocking the U.S. and joking the balloon is just a lantern from this month's lantern festival that flew over to the U.S.But, Jim, all of this just goes to show how tense the U.S./China relationship is right now with so much mutual distress, and it really underscores how important it is that there are these open lines of communication between both sides.

But we really rely on satellites, and all countries do.And you know, we're taking a peek at what's happening in Iran. We're taking a peek at North Korea. We're taking peeks into China as well as Russia. And the Chinese are doing the same. So, why they're using these balloons makes absolutely no sense. But it caused a huge political blunder, forcing the cancellation of Secretary of State Blinken's visit to China. The same thing happened in 1960 when the Russians shot down our U-2 airplane. It came on the heels of ostensibly warming relations, Khrushchev and Eisenhower had a good meeting just a few months before. People were thinking that this could lead to some thawing of the tense relationship between Russia, the USSR and the United States. But then after Gary Powers' U-2 airplane was shot down, the scheduled meeting in Paris that was scheduled for just a few weeks later had to be canceled the same way that this trip by Secretary Blinken had to be canceled.",

So, if you look at primaries since 1972 -- and I know this graphic is a little bit confusing so I'll try to and break it down here.But basically, if you're polling in Trump's position, folks polling in Trump's position wins the primary about 75 percent of the time. If you are polling essentially in Ron DeSantis' position, people who have polled in his position historically have won primaries about 40% of the time. But if you poll in the position of either Mike Pence or Nikki Haley or polling in, they have won the primary less than 5 percent of the time. So, yes, it's early, and, yes, this may be an ahistorical year. Maybe something atypical will happen. But these numbers suggest you would much rather be Donald Trump or Ron DeSantis than anybody else.

This is a Fox News poll that has it at 88 percent. \"The Washington Post\" poll had in the low 80s. But basically, the bottom line is at this particular point, what we're seeing here is that Biden's approval rating among Democrats is in the 80s.And if we flip forward a slide here, what we can essentially see is if you have an approval rating that is, in fact, in the 80s, right, if you are an incumbent president, what we know historically speaking is that the candidates who have been challenged in primaries, if we can pull that up, look at this. All of those candidates who have had a competitive primary, those presidents, their approval ratings were 72 percent or below, and it really needs to be in the 60s or below in order for a president to lose a state.

I mean, you know, the terminology in the sport, you know, revolves around hits. You know, commentators talk about defensive backs blowing up receivers, you know, to try and break up passes.

I watched the Pro Bowl today, which for the first time was flag football, and that's a snooze fest. No one wants to watch flag football. Football is a violent game.

So, I want to talk about how this all started, where the idea came from. So, you're talking about $2,500 that was spent. And that's how much it cost to wrap this police cruiser. Not taxpayer dollars though, but coming from the Miami Community Police Benevolent Association. That's significant because that is the second oldest black police officers' organization in the country. So, you have black police officers who helped design this and who thought this would be a great idea and were proud of this unveiling.

This video was shot at a local boat landing in north Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, earlier this afternoon.The person who shot the video said it appeared to be some kind of navy vessel. We must say CNN cannot independently verify or confirm whether or not this is debris from the balloon. But we are reaching out to the U.S. Navy for some kind of comment. The landing where this video was shot is along the intercoastal waterway and about seven miles from where that waterway opens out to the Atlantic Ocean on the border with North Carolina and South Carolina. But it just gives you an indication of some of the activity that is taking place on the coast there as some of these retrieval and recovery efforts are under way right now. The Navy and Coast Guard have secured the area where the balloon was shot down yesterday. Officials say debris from the balloon will be taken to an FBI lab for analysis. We'll stay on top of this and we'll let you know if we get any other pieces of video coming in to CNN that might indicate what the latest is that's happening there on the Carolina coast.
