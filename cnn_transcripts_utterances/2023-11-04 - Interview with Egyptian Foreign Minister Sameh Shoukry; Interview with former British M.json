They brutally killed 1,400 people, mostly civilians. Israel's vow to crush them, to never live next door to this threat again, has been unleashed ever since. Round-the-clock air strikes combined with a ground incursion has led to the capture and killings of several key Hamas leaders according to the IDF, and has also killed more than 9,000 Palestinians in Gaza, according to the Hamas authorities there. Much of the world is in an uproar about it. And the mounting dead and injured have even caused the United States, Israel's staunchest supporter, to call for a humanitarian pause. Meantime, the Rafah border from Gaza into Egypt was finally opened this week. And I've been speaking exclusively to the foreign minister, Sameh Shoukry, a former ambassador to Washington, about negotiations so let thousands of foreigners out and into Egypt, and about fears of a wider war in the region.

So there is a contradiction and a discrepancy here. I believe that the repetitiveness of the conflict and its consequences, both of the humanitarian level but also at the political level would warrant that we show a little bit more dedication and commitment. We have the resources, speaking about the collective resources of the P5, permanent members of the Security Council, the institutions that exist in the Security Council, to be more effective in implementation of the concept of a two-state solution, rather than only aspiring to it as a potential outcome if all of the various components come miraculously together.",

You can destroy a lot of Hamas infrastructure. You can take out these tunnels if you can find the full extent of them. But Hamas does have a political base inside Gaza and to some extent in the West Bank as well. You can kill individuals, you can't kill an idea. They can't leave a vacuum because if they do, then Hamas will or something perhaps even worse might take -- might take that place in Gaza. And so we've got to start thinking very soon about what comes next, and not expect it to be very straightforward because there will still be remnants of Hamas and there will be a lot resentment against the Israelis for the civilian deaths that they've caused over the last few weeks.",

I don't have any privileged information on that. But certainly Hamas, they will have known, part of the purpose of the operation, was to pull the Israelis in, so they would have been fully prepared for a long battle now on the -- in the streets, in the tunnels of Gaza. So Hamas will be well equipped. And we shouldn't be complacent about the risk of this spreading. So far, this has been managed. But we've seen problems on the West Bank, we've seen attacks on military bases, in Iraq and Syria where U.S. personnel are based. We're seeing uptick of rocket fire across the Israel-Lebanon border. I wouldn't be surprised if one of these groups in the region didn't think of targeting an American target at some point. We've seen that before -- American embassies, American battleships.

How is the Palestinian Authority, in the weakened state that it is, ride into Gaza? M2: With difficulty. When secretary Blinken talks about revitalizing the Palestinian Authority, that's easier said than done. They have their own politics. They have their own leadership corridor (ph). We know that Mahmoud Abbas, the head of the Palestinian Authority is aging and he is not really got the capability to take on a major new challenge. But America can't replace him. Israel can't replace him. A new leader needs to emerge from within the Palestinian political process.

This is a battle that Israel is fighting for its own security. I think it is perfectly legitimate for those of us in Europe and America and around the world to be a supporter of Israel's security, and at the same time, be very sympathetic to the suffering of the Palestinians especially those in Gaza at the moment. And the British government and the U.S. -- traditionally U.S. administrations have always supported the so-called two-state solution. We need to find a way back to that. And I don't think it's right that it takes a Hamas atrocity of the sort that we saw on 7 October to wake us up to the reality that there is a lot of injustice in that part of the world. There are 15 million people living in that small space. Half of them in the state -- there are two-thirds of them in the state of Israel, a third of them in the territories of the West Bank and Gaza. About half of those people are Jews and half of them are Arabs of different religions.
