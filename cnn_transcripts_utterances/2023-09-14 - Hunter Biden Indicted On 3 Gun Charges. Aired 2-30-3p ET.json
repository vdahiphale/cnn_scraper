Now you are seeing it happen on the other side. And they are going to have to navigate that. As we know, Donald Trump, we're not talking about just legal options here, legal ramifications, legal challenges that his team is making. We're talking about the court of public opinion, which is where Donald Trump likes to play in, and that's the argument that he has been making for years.",

This is about 2024 as they are trying to draw links to the president that's so far not here, that are really not here that we're not seeing. At what point do you think this sticks? And how much do you think it's already sticking? FRANCIS ROONEY, (R), FORMER U.S. CONGRESSMAN FROM FLORIDA: Well, you know, they have a habit of outrunning their skis. I mean, this impeachment thing, as Charlie alluded to, I think he's absolutely correct, is not a good move for a variety of reasons. They don't have anything. They've got three committees working on all of this. If they can't figure it out and get the evidence out to the American people, why have one more process to do it? It makes us wonder why they have House committees in the first place if they can't get their job done. That's a separate question. The other thing is, you know, swing districts, you know. As Paul Ryan used to say, hard core conservative districts knock the RINOs and things like that, but without the RINOs, you won't have a majority. And Charlie can speak to that because he was from a swing district and I was from just the other kind. They have just put a lot of Republicans in some serious jeopardy, I think.",

So at least with respect to the impeachment inquiry, this is terrible for those members because they are getting hammered every which way. They are getting called in their offices right now from the right saying, you know, you're a RINO, a squish, a bed wetter, don't have the guts to vote to impeach Biden. They're getting calls from the left saying, you're a MAGA Republican. They are in a terrible situation. They don't want to be talking about any of this. A lot of swing district Republicans, this is just bad for them. What I argued, Hunter Biden, it's a bit of a sideshow. Yes, this whole thing is malodorous and it speaks to influence peddling, which is very bad for Biden. Do you think that's an issue driving this election? I don't think so. But still, if you're trying to draw a contrast with Donald Trump, who is very corrupt and ethically and legally challenged, and you've got this the situation with Hunter Biden that certainly muddies the water. Again, Republicans always have this problem of overplaying their hand on these investigations, whether it was Benghazi, Fast and Furious, the Clinton impeachment. And now here we are again with the Hunter Biden situation. They don't know how to take a political issue and use it. I mean, it's malodorous enough with all the money from the gas company and the Chinese business dealings. That's all they have to talk about. They don't have to go down the impeachment road. But that's what they have done and it's not going to help them in the elections.",

We'll see what it does in 2024. But does this successfully at least create a reality that if, in the minds of some Republican voters --and we see this in the polling, right that, there's a two-tiered Justice Department system or legal system here, right -- that at least that skepticism is now -- is now baked in.",

And you can't get there with just the hardcore fanatics. If it were me, I'd be talking about MAGAnomics in a really good way. I would be ignoring the fact that Trump was the messenger because that's defective. But I would be talking about how our national debt, our interest rates, our inflation and our unemployment were lower before January 2021 than they are right now.

      "sentences": "We don't, Boris. At this point, we do not know.Look, a special counsel, that's one -- that's one of the things that you always worry. Certainly if you're on the receiving end of one of these investigations, if you're on the receiving end of a special counsel, you're always worried that they may spend time and additional resources trying to find things for -- you know, essentially for the reason that they exist, right, to come up with things. And so that's always one of the -- one of the concerns if you're on the receiving end of this. That's one of the reasons why Donald Trump was so mad about a special counsel being assigned to -- to look into his affairs. So we don't know whether David Weiss is going to look beyond this. We do know that this has been an investigation that, again, over five years, has gone all over. Has looked at -- at the entire waterfront. They have looked at, again, the foreign lobbying allegations. And I should note that the -- that the foreign lobbying aspect of this was looked at by the FBI. This was part of their investigation. And at end the -- the prosecution decided that there just wasn't enough there. And that's one of the reasons why that fell away. To me, it was a bit of a surprise when -- when one of the prosecutors stood up before the judge in Delaware and said that that was still a thing that was hanging in the air, right? And so certainly, because everything that we've heard from our reporting is that that is not likely to add up to much in the end. We don't know what else could be -- could be looked at. Certainly, what the wording of the appointment letter for David Weiss makes clear that he can look at crimes that are related to the ones that were already being investigated. And so that could be a lot of things. That could be -- again, just speculating here, but it could include things related to other members of the family who were involved with Hunter Biden's business dealings. We know that one of the -- one of the sitting president's brothers was involved in some of his business dealings. So look, if you're the special counsel, those are the things that you, under the law and certainly under the rules, you can start looking at. We don't have any indication that that's the case, but it is -- obviously this is something that I think Republicans believe. They want more investigation. They think that there's more to find. And certainly, the investigation that we know that has looked at -- has been looked at for five years has gone over all of these things and arrived at, in the end, that -- that the things that they could bring were the tax charges and, of course, the -- the gun case. I should note that even for the tax cases, there are things that have expired for the statute of limitations. So because this thing has gone on so long, there are certain things that were being investigated that they can no longer charge because the statute of limitations, in some cases, for tax cases are six years. Other crimes, other potential crimes, alleged crimes, could be five years, so some of those things have expired. As a matter of fact, if they are going to bring the tax cases that we know they are looking at, they need to move quickly because some of those might expire as soon as three weeks from now in October. So that's one of the reasons why we certainly don't know what else David Weiss could be doing. But it does beg the question because they have looked at every single thing that we -- at least from our knowledge, and this is where they have arrived. Now, I should note that if you look at the testimony from some of the whistleblowers, these IRS agents, they think that they were prevented from looking into other things. Including looking more closely at then-Vice President Biden, now President Biden. They believe that they should have been allowed to look at that stuff. I don't know whether there's anything there and whether that stuff is even something that they could bring charges on right now.",

We have an entire team tracking this story for us now. Let's go to Kara Scannell now, who can breakdown the latest information coming from the special counsel.

President Biden just arriving in Prince George's County, Maryland, where he had planned to give a speech on Bidenomics.And the goal, according to senior White House advisers, was to establish counterprogramming of sorts, to what they saw as a sideshow on Capitol Hill, as Republicans launched an official impeachment inquiry and were barreling towards a government shutdown in just 16 days. But now the split screen will be one that the White House had not anticipated and certainly does not want. The split screen between the president delivering a speech on his policy platform against the backdrop of this indictment, against the president's son. The White House has referred all questions, all inquiries to the Department of Justice and to Hunter's personal legal representatives, noting that this is an independent investigation and one of a personal nature. The White House has engaged on this topic, it's gone to great lengths to point out that David Weiss was first appointed to his role in Delaware by former President Donald Trump and that the five-year nature of the investigation means that they turned over every stone possible and that it was conducted in a fair and independent manner. Of course, that was largely when the investigation was going to result in a plea deal. And there was a sense of relief by the White House, according to sources that I've spoken with, that this situation was expected to be tied up neatly with a bow several weeks ago. That before the plea deal fell apart. And certainly there's been some consternation behind the scenes as there was a lot of uncertainty about exactly how this would go for the president's son who has continued to keep incredibly close and a member of his inner circle and has not shied away from appearing with Hunter publicly. We're still awaiting the president in Maryland. We're awaiting further word from the president's inner circle about exactly how he's feeling and reacting to this news. But certainly, this is not the image that the White House hoped for today.",

The Internet is littered with images of the president's son engaging in what I think most people would say are depraved acts.He went through a time in his life where he was heavily addicted to drugs. He was engaging with prostitutes, he was holding weapons, posing for photos during all of this. Those are all over the Internet. But sometimes it's easy to conflate those photos with the evidence that criminal prosecutors believe can be proved beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law. And after investigating for five years, they were only willing to sort of engage in a plea deal for tax charges and potential gun charges that a lot of experts have suggested would not necessarily be brought against just anyone. They are not commonly bought and that his team could not be proved beyond a reasonable doubt. So there's no doubt this is a deeply flawed person. And there are photos everywhere that, politically, most voters would look at that and say, of course, this guy must have done something wrong, ew. But when prosecutors did a five-years investigation with a Trump- appointed prosecutor, this is what they came up with, tax charges and a gun charge.",

And now made a deal, the sweetheart deal and the deal collapsed and now they're actually charging him. So we have to hold them to account and we'll do our best to do that. Michael Moore, I'm going to go back to you, to your sage legal analysis. Because there's another issue here, which relates to the gun charge -- and one of our reporters referenced earlier -- that he's being charged under because it's not clear that gun statute is going to pass muster with the current make-up of the Supreme Court. Last month, the New Orleans-based federal appeals court struck down this law, saying it violated the Second Amendment. This case concerned a man convicted under it in 2022. That appeals court decision says, in short, it supports some limits on an intoxicated person's right to carry a weapon but does not justify disarming a citizen based exclusively on his past use. It raises the question as to whether this law will last. I wonder, does it apply pressure for prosecutors to charge now? And will it stand up in the Supreme Court if it goes another way down the line?",
