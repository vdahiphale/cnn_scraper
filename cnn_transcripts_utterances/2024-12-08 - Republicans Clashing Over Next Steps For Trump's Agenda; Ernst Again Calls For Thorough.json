Rebels in Syria have toppled dictator Bashar al-Assad, a stunning development of 13 years civil war that's cost the lives of more than 500,000 Syrians and impacted millions who had fled their homes in the region. For just moments ago, President-elect Donald Trump is making news in a brand-new interview that just aired on NBC News. He promised to deport all undocumented immigrants, but saying he supported a deal on undocumented migrants brought to the United States as children. Trump also promised not to cut Social Security or Medicare, but stood by his threat to impose tariffs on U.S. trading partners. Though he could not guarantee it would not raise Americans' prices. And he promised that the members of the January 6th Select Committee should go to jail and vouch to pardon January 6 rioters on day one.

There are two Republicans on that committee. There's other Democrats as well, mostly Democrats. What's the reaction to him saying they should go to jail?

And Trump seems to acknowledge that there. DAVIS: He does. And, by the way, this is something we have heard from Trump before. He's going to work with Democrats on a plan for the Dreamers. We've heard that in his first term. And he has agonized over this, in part, because of what you're saying. I think he recognizes. And many people around him recognize the political toxicity of potentially sending home people who have been here for their entire lives, essentially. But he also, at very key points in the negotiation about this during his first term, pulled back and basically called that amnesty. And so there's this very stark line he wants to draw that everyone who is here undocumented has committed a serious crime and needs to leave.

You've been covering a lot of these internal battles -- this is House versus Senate. Just to set the stage, the new Republican Majority Leader John Thune, wants to move very quickly on a new Trump agenda, dealing with border security, dealing with energy production. And also -- but he's facing pushback from Republicans in the House who say we need to move forward on taxes first. They say that is if we don't do this all now, then everything could -- that could fall by the wayside and they may not be able to pass these tax cuts that they've been campaigning so heavily on. This is not just an issue of prioritizing. It's a concern about potentially this all could fall apart if they don't get on the same page. JULIE HIRSCHFELD DAVIS, \"NEW YORK TIMES\" CONGRESSIONAL EDITOR: Right. I mean, there's so much pent-up demand for the policy that they've been waiting to be in a position to move through Congress. And now that they have this trifecta, they really want to strike while the iron is hot. But it is the case if you look at history that when one party has control of the White House, the Senate and Congress -- and the House, there's a lot of celebration and a feeling of elation, and we're going to be able to get everything done. But you find out very quickly that it's difficult to do because you do have internal party divisions on what to do first, what to put the most priority on in the House. As you pointed out, there is a nothing margin of control and we have seen how hard that's been for Mike Johnson and Kevin McCarthy before him to manage. They won't have the option of teaming with Democrats like they did in the last Congress so it's a lot, as you said, easier said than done. And they do need to kind of get on the same page pretty quickly about on how they're going to do this, because procedurally, you really need to make some decisions in January to be able to sequence this in a way that will work.",
