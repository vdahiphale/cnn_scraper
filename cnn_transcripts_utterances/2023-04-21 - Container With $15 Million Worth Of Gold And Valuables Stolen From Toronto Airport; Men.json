Sudan's military and a rival paramilitary group have been fighting since last Saturday. At least 413 people have been killed so far and it hasn't even been a week yet.And this morning we're learning that the U.S. is deploying, quote, \"additional capabilities\" near Sudan to secure the embassy there and assist with a potential evacuation. Hundreds of Marines are already based in Camp Lemmonier in Djibouti. As of December, there were 14 active-duty U.S. military personnel in Sudan providing Embassy security. All this comes as a 72-hour ceasefire was announced overnight. The truce aligns with the Muslim holiday that marks the end of Ramadan. The ceasefire could provide a crucial window for aid to be distributed to the people caught in the conflict zones. The World Health program warns that if the fighting continues millions could be forced into hunger. Tens of thousands of people have already fled Sudan and are now refugees.",

The region has been the scene of several explosions and bombings since Russia invaded Ukraine over a year ago.And take a look at this because here you can see some of the damage from the explosion.

It's going to be an initial court appearance for another one of the defendants -- his name, Tyler Bradley Dykes. He's from Bluffton, South Carolina. A third defendant, Dallas Medina from Ohio, has been arrested but is not in custody -- at least he wasn't as of a couple of days ago. So a bond hearing for one; an initial appearance for the other.These men, as you mentioned, Don, charged with, quote, \"burning an object with the intent to intimidate.\" And that was related to that torch march that was held in Charlottesville the night before the Unite the Right rally -- the night of Friday, August 11, 2017. These white nationalists marched through the campus of the University of Virginia. Don mentioned those horrible slogans that they chanted -- \"Jews will not replace us.\" One of the slogans was \"blood and soil\" which is a Nazi reference. And for many years, the people who led that torch march were not charged. The former commonwealth's attorney for Albermarle County, Robert Tracci, declined to press charges against them. But the current commonwealth's attorney for the county -- his name, James Hingeley -- he was the one who kind of led the charge to bring charges against these defendants. And so we'll see where it goes from here. Are other people who took part in that torch march going to be charged? Could there be others who were involved in the Unite the Right rally on that Saturday which, of course, led to so much horrible violence that day and the death of a counter-protester Heather Heyer when she was struck by a vehicle that rammed a crowd of protesters? Is there going to be -- are there going to be charges for any of the -- of the people who were involved in that? Interestingly, Don, this is kind of a continuation of an effort to bring some justice for that event six years ago. Because I was here about a year and a half ago when there was a big civil trial. Some of the leaders of the Unite the Right rally -- some of these white nationalists were successfully sued for about $26 million. And this was -- the plaintiffs were people who were victims of the violence and civil rights groups. They won a lawsuit against them. So, interestingly, a continuation here, Don, of the effort to bring justice for those events in 2017.",
