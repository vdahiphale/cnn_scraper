(MUSIC) (END VIDEOTAPE) RAJU (on camera):  Good morning. And welcome to INSIDE POLITICS SUNDAY.  I m Manu Raju. Vice President Kamala Harris is zeroing in on a crucial, high stakes decision that could make or break her path to the presidency and redefine the Democratic Party for years to come. Who will be her running mate and what impact will her choice have on the final 93 days before the elections? Now, the news will be revealed by Tuesday, if not earlier. Harris is expected to meet with at least three top finalists. And sources tell CNN these are the six men she's considering: with Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro, Arizona Senator Mark Kelly and Minnesota Governor Tim Walz so far, getting interviewed today. Now it comes after Harris spent yesterday behind closed doors grilling aides on scores of pages of vetting documents, including potential controversies from the candidate's records. Harris and her pick will hit the trail Tuesday in Philadelphia, kicking off a multi-day blitz across seven battleground states. Meanwhile Donald Trump stumped with J.D. Vance in Atlanta last night at the same arena where Harris held a rally earlier in the week. He spent much of the time targeting the Republican governor of Georgia, but he also lashed out at Harris.

We understand from our reporting, from others reporting as well that there have been extensive briefings on each candidate so far. They've been vetting materials. They've been looking at. We do expect Josh Shapiro, Governor Walz of Minnesota, and Mark Kelly, the Arizona senator, to get these interviews today.

But ultimately, they say she is going to need someone that she feels comfortable with. So you can make an argument that, you know, Shapiro or Kelly, really, it's a simple choice. You know, take one of these swing states and try to take it off the board. But, you know, this is a candidate in Kamala Harris who has not been a Washington her entire career, has relationships with these individuals, but not deep years long relationships, and is trying to make an assessment and knows personally from her own experience of what it's like to be in this job. And so, you know, she says she wants a governing partner. Who does she feel like she can actually have trust with?

It leaves a wonderful process whereby we have this less than 100-day campaign in which the Democrats are going to try to define themselves very quickly. The Republicans are obviously going to try and stop that and define Harris and whoever she chooses as her VP running mate. And I ll just note in, in terms of who she's picking as her running mate, we obviously have no idea. We know it's amongst these, you know, 5 or 6 finalists. But at the end of the day, the decision comes down to her. And the math is pretty simple, which is do I want to choose somebody who perhaps is a social media star and appeals to the progressive left and a Tim Walsh who's come on strong lately, or do I want to choose a swing state person, either Mark Kelly or Josh Shapiro?

People vote for the top of the ticket, not the bottom.The one measurable effect that does seem to be consistent, although it is quite small, is that home state effect. And wouldn't it be nice if you're a Democrat? They had, say, half a point or a point to your margin in a state that Joe Biden won last time around by 1.2 points?

And you see Bernie Sanders coming out for him. You see Representative Jayapal, the progressive caucus leader, coming out for him and getting hints that Nancy Pelosi thinks he'd be a good pick. So there is a push for Walz, I think largely based on how effective he's been in his TV appearances over the last week or ten days or so. But is that still something of a long shot? I mean, ultimately, you don't need excitement. You don't need to excite the progressive base. Harris has done that, right? You're raising $300 million in effectively a couple of weeks.

This wasJoe Biden's path to 270. Win in Pennsylvania, win in Michigan, win in Wisconsin. You could lose in those Sun Belt battleground states -- Georgia, Arizona, Nevada -- which obviously Joe Biden carried last time around, and you get to exactly 270 electoral votes. Of course, you have to carry that second congressional district in Nebraska. It's the thinnest of margins, but the path would work. The question is, is the polling there to support it? Well, take a look at this. I mean these were just tight polls. These were polls that were taken by Fox News after Kamala Harris became the likely Democratic nominee. She's obviously now the presumptive Democratic nominee. Look how tight these races are. In Wisconsin --",

I'll be interested to see as we get more polls going forward whether or not these polls shift a little bit more in a direction as the national polling seems to have done. But the fact that this pathway wide-open. It was closing for Biden, but it is wide open for Harris.",

Let's say in this particular case, we're actually going to give all of those Great Lake or Rust Belt battlegrounds to Donald Trump. We're talking about all these. They're all pink on the top of your screen.So what can Harris do? Well she could win in Nevada. She wins in Arizona. She wins in Georgia. And then you might notice here, she also needs to win in North Carolina in order for this Sun Belt path to work. And of course, no Democrat has carried the state of North Carolina since Barack Obama back in 2008. So it's a very tight pathway. The question though is Manu, does this pathway -- interestingly enough, we don't actually have a ton of polling from the Sun Belt. In fact, none since Harris entered the race as the likely and now presumptive Democrat nominee. So the question is, why do we think this might work? Well, want to take a look here. This is our last national poll. Choice for president. I want you to know how much better Harris was doing with black voters. Joe Biden was just at 70 percent in April and June. Look at where Harris was up to in July, up to 78 percent. How about Hispanic voters? Look how much better Harris is doing than Biden -- doing them than did in April and June. Biden was just at 41 percent. Look at Harris up to 47 percent. Some of the polling suggests he's even doing better than that. Why is that so important? Well, if you know anything about the Sun Belt, you know that it's very, very diverse. So let's take a look at the --",

Compare that to the national percentage, 12 percent. So nearly double in North Carolina. Well more than double in Georgia.How about Hispanic voters? Take a look here. Arizona, Hispanic voters, 21 percent; in Nevada 19 percent. Way more than the national average of 10. The fact is with the Harris coalition being more diverse, they believe that they can potentially be very competitive in these states. And if she is, all of a sudden she has a second, third, fourth pathway instead of just relying on the Great Lakes.",

We talked about the Sun Belt battleground path. The chance that Harris -- this state put Harris or Trump over the top in the electoral college, look at the number one state. It's here, it's obvious, its Pennsylvania. 35 percent chance that that's a state that put you over the top. Wisconsin way lower than that at 14 percent. Michigan way lower than that at 12 percent. Fact is none of the Sun Belt battleground states are particularly close. So who is the VP pick who could potentially help you the most? How much they outperform Biden's 2020 margin in their last election. Look at Josh Shapiro outperformed his margin by 14 points. Kelly by five, that's not half bad. Walz was just 0.6. And of course, as we were noting, one of our earlier segments, Manu what is Josh Shapiro's favorable rating in the great commonwealth of Pennsylvania? It is 61 percent.
