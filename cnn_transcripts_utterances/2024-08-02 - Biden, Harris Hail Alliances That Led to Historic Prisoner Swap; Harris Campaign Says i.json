Former U.S. Marine Paul Whelan, Wall Street Journal Reporter Evan Gershkovich and Russian- American Journalist Alsu Kurmasheva reunited with their families after unimaginable ordeals being wrongfully detained.Whelan telling reporters, every day of the five years, seven months and five days that he was held, he was singing the national anthem. Gershkovich telling his Wall Street Journal colleagues who were on the tarmac, I'm home. And Kurmasheva running into the arms of her two young daughters, reporters on the ground saying that you could hear the little girls sob from many yards away. One of the girls, one of her girls, turns 13 years old today. These three Americans are returning home after a massive prisoner swap that started breaking on this show yesterday, the likes of which have not been seen since the Cold War, 24 people involving 7 countries, a deal that President Biden says he was convinced his administration could get done.

He said that it didn't feel real, that none of this felt real to him until he was flying over England. And, of course, he's also a British citizen, and he says that he looked down, and at that point, that's when it hit him, that this was real, that he was heading home. Now, if you look closely at the video of him here in San Antonio, you can see that he is wearing an American flag lapel pin, and he explained that this is the lapel pin that President Biden gave to him on the tarmac there in D.C. He says that they were just chatting and that the president gave him the pin as a keepsake. And he said that this was a good homecoming to American soil. He said he was nice to hug his sister and that he's looking forward to recuperating here. But he also took a few moments to criticize the Russian government for his experience. Take a listen.

They were in isolation, they were in conditions that were unspeakable. And so what's going on behind me is a medical evaluation, first of all, Omar, but also they get to decompress, and they get to reintegrate to physical exercise, to a regular diet.

Her campaign says it raised $310 million in just the month of July. That's more than double what Donald Trump raised last month, but also just a wild amount of money, period. It's also a clear sign of the energy felt by both high dollar donors and grassroots supporters with the change to the top of the Democratic ticket.CNN Senior Reporter Isaac Dovere joins me now. So, Isaac, can you tell us just a little bit more about the fundraising haul, how this came together, and where this money is coming from? EDWARD-ISAAC DOVERE, CNN SENIOR REPORTER:  Yes, well, a lot of that money came just in the first few days. After Harris became the expected Democratic nominee. And I think, Omar, you compare that to the Trump numbers for this month, that's an important number. It's also an important number to think about where the Biden numbers had been expected to be for this month. Sources that I've talked to were thinking even pre-debate that they were going to have a rough July. Obviously after that debate and all the trauma that the Democrats were going through and Biden was going through, it was much lower. So, this is a big amount of money for the Harris campaign. They are saying that 94 percent of the donations that came in here are under 200. That means that those people can give again, that there are new donors that are coming in, a lot of them, and also means that there is a lot of money theoretically there from some of those big donors that we always hear about, the people who can write the giant checks to the super PACs that are potentially going to be flooding even more money into this race. We don't know what that looks like yet and whether those donors who had spent a lot of time in July saying that they wanted Joe Biden out of the race will be giving the money to support Kamala Harris here.",

And we've heard names in the mix, several top contenders, Kentucky's Governor Andy Beshear, Pennsylvania's Governor Josh Shapiro, Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker, who even joked about being in the mix. Take a quick listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV. J.B. PRITZKER (D-IL):  Lollapalooza is happening this weekend here in Chicago.

But obviously we know that this process is coming to an end here, with an expected decision early next week.We do expect that Vice President Harris will be doing her own interviews with the contenders over the next few days. And one of them -- one of the factors here that is on a lot of people's minds when it comes to Shapiro, as mentioned, I've got new reporting on our site right now, there are some Jewish Democrats who are wondering is America ready for a Jewish vice president, Jewish running mate? Shapiro is Jewish, he's observant in a way that is different from a lot of Jewish politicians who are in public life and that is one of the many considerations here as people think about what the way forward is between the six options that Harris has in front of her.",

No country should have to live next to that kind of threat. As for an impact on the ceasefire deal, I think all of this activity in the last few days, it's just too soon to know whether there's going to be a direct effect on our ability to get this ceasefire deal done. What I will say is that we have a team in the region right now. We continue to have conversations with our counterparts, including our Israeli counterparts, including last night between the prime minister and the president. And we believe that this is the best way to get a six-week ceasefire and maybe even work towards a cessation of hostilities.
