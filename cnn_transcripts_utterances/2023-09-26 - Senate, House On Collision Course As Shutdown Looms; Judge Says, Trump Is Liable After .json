Alabama has been ordered to come up with two majority black districts or something quite close to that to better represent the state's 27 percent black population. The map that Republicans offered still only had one majority black district. But with this decision today, Alabama will now have, beyond its way, to having a new map in time for the 2024 election, something that could have national implications.

      "sentences": "Tonight, we are going to play for you Jake Tapper's entire interview with Cassidy Hutchinson.She's the former Trump aide whose testimony may end up leading to his conviction. She discusses there her tumultuous time in the White House, her biggest fear about a Trump second term, and her message to anyone who is still loyal to the former president. But, first, we have two breaking stories that are unfolding right now. Good evening, everyone. I'm Abby Phillips. And the very first one that impacts all Americans tonight, the United States government is just days away from a crippling government shutdown and a collision course is emerging. The Senate has cut a bipartisan deal to keep the government open until November. And that includes more than $6 billion in aid to Ukraine. But it does appear that that bill is dead on arrival in the House. As you know now, Republicans have been fighting with each other. Hardliners want drastic cuts to spending, which includes more money for border security and less for Ukraine. Now, House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, who is, by the way, fighting for his job, says that the House's counteroffer will include a border security package. But for some, including Congressman Matt Gaetz, that is not enough. Now, remember, if the government shuts down, key agencies and national parks will all be closed, service men and women will be at risk of not being paid, and everyday life will be impacted for all Americans, from food inspections to lines at the airport. And joining me now is Congressman Ralph Norman. He's a Republican from South Carolina. Congressman, thank you for joining us tonight. Speaker McCarthy just a few moments ago in a presser said that it was a mistake for the Senate to include even more funding for Ukraine and he's dismissing that stopgap measure that they've put on the table. He says that he's going to put forward a Republican bill with border provisions likely as soon as Friday and he's daring hardliners to vote against it. What do you say to McCarthy tonight? REP. RALPH NORMAN (R-SC): Well, I agree with what the Senate put forward with $6.5 billion for Ukraine, $5.2 billion, from what I understand, for disaster relief, and then the same spending through November 15th of this year, which is totally unacceptable, and along with all the other spending that has been in place. So that's a complete dead on arrival, I hope, in the House. As far as what Speaker McCarthy had, we'll see what the final numbers are. I don't know what level he wants to propose but we'll see.",

But when you're in that environment, it becomes a lot more difficult. And I did get brought back into that environment and for a short period of time when I first began doing my depositions with the committee. But I didn't feel empowered to comply completely.And also, Jake, if I'm being completely candid and frank, you know, I still felt that loyalty to him at the end of the administration. And I worried that if I had gone down to Florida, that would have only grown and I would not have come forward. And whether or not what I testified to you changes the trajectory of any investigation, I fulfilled what I was obligated to do under the oath that I swore to protect and defend the Constitution and the country. And I fulfilled the obligations of my subpoena. So, to me, this is not about what I did and the impact that it has. For me, it's more about, I was able to maintain my character and my integrity after I retained new legal counsel who empowered me and showed me the importance of telling the whole truth. So, anybody that finds themselves in a situation like that, you know, I would just encourage them to listen to your conscience. And this moment's much bigger than us.",

And Mark and I had a lot of profound conversations about this mentality that I still had to break. I didn't write this book with the intention of trying to convince people that I did the right thing. I wrote this book with the intention to show my journey, and I don't love the word journey. It sounds a little like the bachelor, but the journey that I had of being a Trump world insider, I'm not a Democrat. I still consider myself a Republican, but I don't consider myself part of what the Republican Party largely identifies with today, which is the Trump Republican Party, in my opinion. But in this period for me, you know, I've never once doubted my decision to come forward and be truthful and be honest. And I had a conversation with a member of Congress who is a Republican member of Congress that did not serve on the January 6th Committee.",

She ultimately did move outside that hothouse that she lived in, but so many people are still in it. And the fact that she's one of many Trump officials who now say that Donald Trump is the gravest threat to democracy in our lifetime, possibly in American history, that's striking. That calls for coming from within the House. And people who are still with Donald Trump and can't bring themselves to separate should look at people like Cassidy Hutchinson and realize that that's a sign of coming attractions.",

And you know, one of the things that you made the Republican Party was a sense of personal responsibility which turned out to be, you know, just a marketing slogan for the party. But I believe when I wrote a book, I said blame me because I helped elect these people. And I think that's something that all of us who helped build this Republican Party after as this isn't about Donald Trump. Donald Trump is just this weird god from Queens, it ran for president. It's the Republican Party accepted him and made him president. And all of these people that now come out and say, well, what happened on January 6 is so terrible. I mean, Trump was a terrible person before that. And how many of these people would still be working for him if he was re-elected? A lot of them. I don't think Cassidy Hutchinson would. But a lot of these political figures. And when you see where the party is, where the majority overwhelmingly of the party is where Trump is. It's not about Donald Trump.
