      "sentences": "It without a doubt storm surge, Boris. That's the main concern with this storm. But there are so many other threats to Idalia, from inland flooding to destructive winds that will bring down trees, power lines, you name it. There's a lot.But let's talk about the storm, the details first, then we'll get to the threats. Hurricane Idalia is strengthening, 80-mile-per-hour winds with this particular storm. And you know what, just looking briefly at the satellite composure, and this thing is becoming more organized as the minutes wear on. So, that's a concern. It's really tapping into the warm ocean waters. There's the forecast track from the National Hurricane Center. You can see explicitly strengthening to a Category 2 by 2:00 P.M. this afternoon, and perhaps to a category three major hurricane before landfall. That has been a pretty consistent message, the idea of rapid strengthening, rapid intensification. So, I want to show you this because we've been talking about how warm the waters have been in the Gulf of Mexico. They're currently running about two to upwards of four degrees Fahrenheit above where they should be this time of year. And this is way beyond bath water. We're talking hot tub water here. It's just incredibly warm. So, that's like jet fuel for strengthening hurricanes. And, unfortunately, that's what we anticipate with this particular storm. You can see it potentially making major impacts across the Florida Big Bend region. And also you can't rule out Apalachicola as well. Tallahassee, you are in the game here. We've seen a little bit of a westward nudge with this. Now, let's talk about the storm surge threat. And we've got a really unique way here at CNN to show you why this coastline is so susceptible. We're going to take you to the air and show you the Clearwater Beach and the beaches that line this particular barrier island that we happen to find ourselves on. That beach literally stretches for miles behind me. This water that you see over my right shoulder, well, that is just a few feet deep even if you traveled out, let's say 50 feet from here. So, that shallow nature coupled with the warm ocean waters means we've got a strengthening hurricane that's going to build up all of that water into this location. And if we get into the really specifics about it, Tampa Bay, we're forecasting anywhere between four to seven feet for some of those low lining susceptible areas. Also, as we get a little closer into the Clearwater Beach area where we're located that barrier island, you see the yellows and the oranges there, that is a concern we're really worried about four to seven feet, where we're located now. But if we go a little further north, the Big Bend is highly susceptible, one of the most susceptible areas in the nation for storm surge. Look at the reds, look at the oranges. That is because simply the shallow nature of the water but also the topography of the land. It's like a catcher's net. It's going to take all of that water being pushed up by a strengthening tropical system and it's going to push it onshore Cedar Key. We talk about Hurricane Hermine that happened in 2016, that was a Category 1. That brought six feet of storm surge to Cedar Key. We're forecasting 8 to 12. So, the potential there for inundation exists. This is an interesting map as well. Look at the potential of the wind gusts here in and around Cedar Key all the way to Tallahassee and Gainesville. We're talking over 80 miles per hour. And that includes inland communities as well. That swath of extremely heavy wind will move inland all the way to the Florida-Georgia border through the day on Wednesday and into Thursday. And this is also important. Remember, that this storm is not just a Florida storm. We're talking Georgia and into the Carolinas for Thursday and Friday. So, so many states at play here across the southeast. Boris?",

If those winds get to the 50 and 60 and 70-mile-per-hour winds, upwards of 80 and 100-mile-an-hour winds, they're not going to be capable to come and help rescue you until the danger for them has passed. You will be on your own. So, listen to what authorities are saying, get where you need to go. There is information online. And you can ask your local police officer. They know where to go.

Everybody is watching and waiting on a decision from the judge in this case to see if they will allow Mark Meadows to move his case to federal court. And now the judge alluded to the fact that this could impact all 19 defendants, including Trump himself, saying that this decision will likely set a precedent for other cases involved. And, look, we know four other defendants in addition to Meadows have already filed motions to try to also move their cases to federal court. And the former president himself is also expected to do the same thing. We saw one of his lawyers in the courtroom yesterday, as Meadows was testifying. So, that gives you an idea of how impactful and what's at stake here as the judge weighs his decision as to whether he's going to let Mark Meadows move case to federal court or not.",

The next day is arguably one of the biggest days in the Republican primary campaign, when most states are going to vote and vote for who they want to represent their party in the presidential election. And then also at the end of the month, you have the start of his hush money trial.So, a lot of different factors at play here, Trump going to have to weigh both the political calendar and his criminal cases as he tries to become the next president of the United States, and he's going to have to spend his days of the week in a courtroom.

Look at some of those other states in the lead-up to Super Tuesday. You've got Nevada. You've got South Carolina. You've got Michigan. These are big states. If Trump can rack up those numbers, it really matters. On the other hand, it ironically may give Donald Trump a reason to promote early voting, mail-in voting any kind of way you can get your primary vote cast earlier, which, as you'll remember, in 2020, he was so opposed to, claiming that that was part of the supposed fraud against all evidence. This was all during the sort of primetime COVID time. But the more support he can lock down before that March 4th date, before the March 5th Super Tuesday date, the less risk that trial might actually pose. It also, that March 4th date, allows him, in theory, and I'm sure he'll try, to argue that this prosecution is political. So, he'll try to use it to his advantage.",

At the time that this bill was going through, there were many people who said it would end up being directed at Fani Willis.
