But I will tell you, if you talk to those people who work with him, they really believe that he is an unconventional candidate.They, as you mentioned, want this unconventional campaign that really matches up with him, they want to reach people in different ways and go about this very differently. So clearly, this is one way to get attention and to do something quite different, right out of the gate. So what we know is that he will sit down with Elon Musk tomorrow and talk through some of this. Elon Musk confirming that at a Wall Street Journal event earlier today, but stopping short of endorsing him in any way, or saying that he has plans to endorse. So all eyes will turn to that well. They will also turn here to Miami, Jake, where he is going to gather his donors to talk to them about his presidential bid, and really try to maximize this moment. Again, going back to what his team wants, they want to really go on the offensive, they want a big blitz coming out of this announcement. So they want a lot of media attention, they also want a lot of money, they want to really have a strong showing with millions and millions of dollars right out of the gate. So you can bet that that's what they're going to be leaning on their donors to do to really bundle up that money and then move toward the next phase of this campaign.",
