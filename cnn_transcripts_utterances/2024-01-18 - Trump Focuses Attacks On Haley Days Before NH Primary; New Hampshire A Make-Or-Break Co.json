His new line of attack, tying her to Democrats. And with a Republican base still firmly in Trump's Make America Great Again camp, how can Democrats talk about and talk to MAGA voters? We will discuss. Plus, with just over one day left until a partial government shutdown, House Speaker Mike Johnson is under immense pressure to compromise. Can he pass a spending bill that includes changes to border policy without facing a revolt from inside his own party? Good day, everyone. I'm Kasie Hunt to our viewers watching in the United States and around the world. It's 11 a.m. here in Washington, Thursday, January 18. There are just five days until the New Hampshire primaries, 291 days until Election Day. This is today's STATE OF THE RACE. Welcome in. We've got just five days to go until the critical Republican primary in New Hampshire. Donald Trump is going for the knockout punch, throwing everything at Nikki Haley, as she tries to derail his seemingly inevitable march to the nomination. Here is just a little sample of his attacks on Haley last night. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, 45TH U.S. PRESIDENT: Nikki Haley is counting on Democrats and liberals to infiltrate your Republican primary. A vote for Nikki Haley this Tuesday is a vote for Joe Biden and a Democrat Congress. I actually think she might go to the Democrat Party. I don't know that she is a Democrat, but she is very close. She is far too close for you. In 2016, she stabbed the Republican Party in the back by siding with Barack Hussein Obama against the Trump travel ban. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Even in our home state of South Carolina, Trump's polling average there is near 50 percent. Here you can see in New Hampshire, he is up -- he is down at 39. America, meanwhile, is starting to come to terms with the emerging reality that Trump is going to be the nominee and that he is possibly going to be President again. Here is what Republican Senator Mitt Romney told our Manu Raju yesterday. He said \"I think a lot of people in this country are out of touch with reality and will accept anything Donald Trump tells them. You had a jury that said Donald Trump raped a woman. And that doesn't seem to be moving the needle. There is a lot of things about today's electorate that I have a hard time understanding.\" It's all, of course, because Trump voters have become more and more loyal to him over the past four years. Here is just a glimpse of how far those most loyal supporters are willing to go, courtesy of CNN's Elle Reeve. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

That just energizes Republicans even more to fight for Donald Trump and stand behind him. And if you look at what motivates Republicans, it's not necessarily Trump's tone and tenor.

But, we should know, Kasie, there isn't an agreement yet. Senate negotiators have been working for months. They are trying to get an agreement. They are close. They are making progress. They're right up against that deadline. And yet, even if they do find some kind of consensus, which a lot of Republicans are warning is very possible in the next couple of days here, the reality is that, does that bill go anywhere in the House of Representatives? Ultimately, it's up to Mike Johnson to decide if he is going to put it on the floor. That is the power of the speaker. Just because the Senate passes something does not mean the Speaker is obligated to actually make the decision to have his members vote on it. You actually saw this back in 2013, if you remember. The Senate passed this massive immigration agreement by the Gang of Eight. And then, at the time, Speaker John Boehner never put it on the floor of the House because there were threats coming from members of his hard right flank. And I think that Mike Johnson finds himself in that position with additional pressure because of what's on the line. Yesterday's meeting at the White House was brought together in part to emphasize to Republican members, Speaker Johnson specifically, that Ukraine is on the battlefield, that they need U.S. support. They needed it yesterday, and that this funding that has now become burdened by this immigration debate is essential in this time. And I think that that is what Johnson is going to have to weigh, the reality of the fact that he believes that Ukraine potentially should get more money with the other reality that doing so bringing it forward could potentially cost him his job. Now, I do think that there are questions about whether or not House Republicans really want to go through the rigmarole of another Speaker's race after what it did accomplish just a couple of months ago. But, I think there are some members who don't consider the broader dynamics of the party at this point.",

And you have Senate Republicans saying, well, our whole argument is that the border is an emergency situation. It's in a crisis, and we have to do something about it. So, even if we get something modest, why would we say no to it? And McConnell has been telling Senate Republicans behind closed doors that this is the moment to address border security. We need to take the deal, I'm told, is what he has been telling Senate Republicans during their private lunches. And he has been saying that under a Donald Trump presidency in the future, do you think Democrats would give Republicans the necessary votes to pass a border security bill? Obviously not, right, even with a Republican majority. And that's why you see people like Cornyn, John Thune, the number two Senate Republican, and other Senate Republican leaders saying there is no chance passed right now that we could get a border deal, especially not with Donald Trump in the White House.

So, that being John Barrasso of Wyoming. The other two John's, we call them the three John's, the potential McConnell successors, John Thune and John Cornyn are staying out of it for now. They have both publicly questioned Trump's viability in a general election. In Thune's case, Trump has even tried to recruit a primary challenger against him. This is a guy who could be leading the Senate Republican Conference when and if Donald Trump is back in the White House. So, it'll be fascinating to see how this race shakes up with only John Barrasso being the one to endorse Donald Trump.",
