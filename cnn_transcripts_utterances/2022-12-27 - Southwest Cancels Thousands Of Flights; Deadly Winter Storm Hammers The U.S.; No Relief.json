Well, it is the travel nightmare after Christmas, thousands of flights have been canceled across the U.S. after the monster Arctic storm that pummeled much of the country over the holiday. And, the Southwest Airlines, in particular, it is an utter catastrophe. Right now, the flight tracking website FlightAware shows more than 2,700 total cancellations in the U.S. on Tuesday, and of those, more than 90 percent are Southwest flights. The company says it's being forced to scale back its flight schedule to get operations back on track and get crews in the right places. Southwest CEO says it is the largest scale event he has ever seen.Meantime, passengers are stranded at airports, struggling to get answers on when they'll be able to reach their destinations. We've seen incredibly long lines at the airline counters, and tons of luggage piling up at baggage claims. Southwest has said these cancellations and delays could go on for several more days, meaning, it may be the weekend before many passengers can even rebook. And, here is more from a Southwest spokesperson. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

But, we have to look at the last worst day of cancellations in 2022, the day that broke the record until last Friday for 2022 was February 3. Not a holiday. A lot of people don't remember it. But, the airlines canceled because of a weather event then. They knew a major ice storm was coming across U.S., airports like Dallas-Fort Worth shutdown, airlines canceled thousands of flights preemptively, and what helped then is that people didn't get stranded.The problem with what has happened now is we also knew again that a horrific weather event was coming, and it was going to be almost nationwide. But, the airlines didn't really cut too many flights. Southwest cut a few, some airlines had a few cancellations. But, they tried to maintain those holiday schedules for the obvious reason that the one thing passengers won't forgive you is if you don't get them where they want to be. So, that kind of hit them. They also have a point-to-point network. They're not hub and spoke like American and Delta. They're more of a short haul, short medium haul. And, that means basically that when those pilots leave on a given day, like from Minneapolis, they go to Midway to Kansas City, down to Houston, to Dallas, to Phoenix, switch crews, and then they're off to like Ontario for the night. The issue with that is it's very difficult once those crews, once those planes get out of position, to rejuggle the whole system. It's a little bit easier in appointing spoke, and that's a different system than how Southwest operates.",

But, actually, if we look back to pre-pandemic, the levels were about the same for that summer also. So, people tend to have a bit of a short memory on that. But, if we look at like the highest cancellation day so far this year, which was last Friday, we'd actually have to go back a decade to Hurricane Sandy to have seen that kind of impact. But, if we go for the second worst day, there actually wasn't a storm 10 years ago, widespread blizzards, it sort of did the same thing. So, there aren't some weather situations that are just beyond what the airlines can safely handle.But, the thing I think we do have to remember here is that it has been 13 years that the U.S. carriers have not had a single fatal accident. We've weathered the pandemic. We've weathered hurricanes. We've weathered this storm. We have to at least take pride in that we have the safest form of transportation in the world right now going on with U.S. carriers. So, at least, that continues to be a very bright spot.",

But, it's an informal summit, and it's designed to sort of cement the alliance, both economic and security of these countries. Obviously, it takes on an extra significance this year. Russia tends to play the role of a peacekeeper in this group, and that, of course, is tested because of the war in Ukraine where Russia is the aggressor.Putin did acknowledge sort of security challenges this year. He said challenges and threats in the security sphere, especially from the outside, he said, are growing with every year, and he also acknowledged that there have been \"disagreements between some of the members of this particular group\", I think, the most dramatic example of which are the very deadly clashes that we saw in September breakout on the border between Azerbaijan and Armenia. Of course, that conflict does flare up over that disputed territory of Nagorno-Karabakh. So, that's one area of this. But, I think the optics we are taking into account as well, Russia is continuing to present itself as not isolated on the international stage, even as efforts by the West and Ukraine to step up to try to isolate it, and Ukraine, of course, in the last day trying to secure Russia's objection from the United Nations Security Council. So, that is significant to President Putin. And, of course, on the economic sphere as well, he said that trade between - sort of a multilateral trade within this group and growing more than six percent between January and October this year that may be due to some of the displacement of Russian trade from its Western allies. So, critical optics, but also practical alliances here, Rosemary.",

The country has announced that from January 8, it will no longer require inbound travelers to quarantine on arrival. They'll still need a negative PCR test, but the process will be more streamlined. China also says it will call COVID an infection instead of pneumonia, saying that's more in line with the characteristics and danger level of the disease. Even so, these changes come as the virus is spreading uncontrollably, putting huge strain on the healthcare system. And, CNN's Kristie Lu Stout joins me now live from Hong Kong with more on this.

Hours earlier, then attorney general Bill Barr had told the associated press there was no widespread voter fraud. According to the draft press release, anybody that thinks there was a massive fraud in the 2020 election should be fired. The press release was never sent and Barr resigned from the White House later that month. Since then, he has not held back in criticizing Trump's election lies.

So, at this point, we understand from one of the spokespeople that they say it is a clear provocation and an invasion of our airspace. And what the South Korean response immediately was, fighter jets being launched in the air and also attacked helicopters being sent up in the air. There was one incident, we understand, one fighter jet did crash, but the crew was able to safely eject. Now, we also know that there were reconnaissance aircraft sent by the South Korean defense ministry into the particular -- into Korean border area. And we understand from the military, some did go into North Korea military -- sorry, airspace as well, and they actually took photos of military installations. So, that, in a sense, was a bit of tit for tat by the South Korean's. It is fairly unusual for this to happen, but is not unprecedented.
