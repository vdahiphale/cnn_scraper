Poland's prime minister says about 100 fighters from the Wagner mercenary group in Belarus are headed toward the Polish border. He warns they could try to cross it disguised as migrants. The area is highly strategic. Poland's border with Lithuania is nearby, dividing Belarus, Russia's ally, of course, from Kaliningrad, a Russian territory. Meanwhile, Ukraine's military forces are gaining ground in their counteroffensive. Those specks of yellow, those represent the areas recaptured by Ukraine as it edges on the northern edge of the Russian- held territory near the Black Sea. And Russia is vowing to retaliate, accusing Ukraine of terrorism after a missile attack on the Russian city about 25 miles from Ukraine's border. Authorities say at least 14 people were wounded. CNN's Alex Marquardt is in the Ukrainian capital. Alex, just moments ago Russian President Vladimir Putin began speaking. What has he said?",

      "sentences": "Well, Paula, this is a really interesting moment because this is the culmination of a three-day summit between African leaders and President Vladimir Putin, and it was designed to essentially reinforce and deepen the ties between Russia and the African continent.But African leaders have really been expressing their concern about the ongoing war in Ukraine particularly when it comes to food supplies, food prices after Russia pulled out of the grain deal last week which has made food prices go up, has made things a lot more difficult to send food around the world, grain around the world, particularly to the African continent. So President Putin has been trying to walk this line between being essentially agreeable with these African leaders but standing firm when it comes to the war in Ukraine. He just finished a meeting with those leaders from Africa about the peace deal that they've put forward and he essentially said very politely that it's a peace deal, but he continued -- that it's a good peace deal, but then he continued to lay the blame at the feet of Ukraine, essentially saying that it's their fault that the fighting is ongoing, that the war even started, that there isn't peace now, that there aren't peace negotiations. He said that there can't be a cease-fire right now when we're being attacked. He claimed that he never rejected a peace plan, but he went on to compliment this African peace plan as being a good basis for conversations going forward. So Putin continues to play the victim here, continues to not take any blame, to deflect and lean on some of his old arguments that it was essentially Ukraine leaning towards the West that forced Russia into invading. So this summit with African leaders in St. Petersburg over the last few days has really been interesting in terms of highlighting the strains that Russia is feeling from the international community and the pressure that it is under including from some of its closest allies here specifically from Africa -- Paula.",

But it's clear that there's still a very long way to go. Where Ukraine is right now specifically on the southern front which is arguably the biggest priority for them, is they're consolidating gains that they've made over the past 72 to 48 hours. They've made advances in some places.And remember, Paula, the goal here for Ukraine is to push forward on that southern front. They've been prodding along the front, trying to find weak spots in that Russian line, trying to pierce through that Russian line. We heard yesterday that they had taken the town of Staromaiorske, that's a town that had been occupied for a very long time, and they did hail that as a victory. President Zelenskyy posting about that on his social media. We understand that elsewhere along the line that they are making progress. But it is small progress. It is slow progress. And the hope is that as they grind away at those Russian forces, as they pound at the Russian positions with artillery, with their infantry using those Western vehicles that they got and the training that they got from the U.S. and Germany earlier this year, that they will eventually be able to pierce through that line. And they're hoping that at some point once they do that that they can then accelerate this counteroffensive and really make some real gains in terms of splitting those Russian forces in the southern part of the country -- Paula. [16:05:03] REID: Alex Marquardt, thank you so much. And let's continue this conversation with CNN military analyst and retired Air Force colonel Cedric Leighton. All right, Colonel, thank you so much for being here with us. How significant is it that these Wagner forces are moving closer to Poland's border? COL. CEDRIC LEIGHTON, CNN MILITARY ANALYST: I think it's very significant, Paula. And you know, what's interesting about this, this is near the area that's called the Suwalki gap, and the Suwalki gap is it's this area between Lithuania, Poland, and Belarus that is really a vulnerable point for the NATO forces because it allows the Russians, it's an area where the Russians have transit rights or at least in the past had transit rights to take equipment and men into the Kaliningrad Oblast which is an enclave of Russia that Russia has had since basically the end of World War II. And that area is one that the Russians want to protect because that's where their Baltic Sea fleet is, if they want to also be able to project power into the Baltic. So what they're trying to do is they're trying to make sure, the Russians or the Wagner Group, is trying to make sure that they can maintain that connection to the Kaliningrad Oblast. If they can do that, then that, of course, puts forces at risk for NATO. And also in addition to keeping maritime forces at risk, of course, they're trying to keep Polish forces at risk and at least tie down Polish forces in the northeastern part of their country, whereas in the southeastern part, that's the part that faces Ukraine. And that's the area that, of course, could also see some action if the Russians move forward in that direction, as well.",

And it may not come to a shooting war, and hopefully it doesn't.

And so as a result of that, they almost always formulaically have to say the Ukrainians did it, and in many cases the Ukrainians did do it or at least they're somewhat responsible for it, but the idea that the Russians have is every time that the Ukrainians react to a Russian attack, the Ukrainians then, you know, are in that position.But the Russians then react to what the Ukrainians have done. So it becomes an issue where there's always, you know, a movement on one side responded to by the other, and that then comes into -- you know, gets into a snowball effect where there's a possibility of an escalation of this fight even further and in areas that go beyond the southern front or the eastern front in Ukraine itself.",

Jill and I only want what is best for all of our grandchildren, including Navy.\" Now a source familiar with this situation points to that resolution of this legal case last month as to why the president is now acknowledging this and why he hadn't acknowledged her previously. It's important to note that it was back in 2020 when a DNA test revealed that Hunter Biden was, indeed, the father of this child, that he started paying child support payments. They went back to court because Hunter Biden sought to reduce those child support payments. Now the question of, how involved is Joe Biden going to be in his granddaughter's life going forward?

It's been a chaotic week for the president's son, too, as his plea deal fell through on Wednesday for federal charges involving misdemeanor tax crimes and a gun violation. CNN's Sara Murray has more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SARA MURRAY, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR (voice-over): After a tumultuous day in federal court, Hunter Biden left with no plea deal after a federal judge said she was not ready to accept it. President Joe Biden's son arrived in federal court today prepared to plead guilty to two misdemeanor tax charges and to strike a deal to avoid a felony gun charge after a five-year Justice Department probe that Hunter Biden once predicted he would emerge from unscathed. HUNTER BIDEN, PRESIDENT BIDEN'S SON: I am absolutely certain, 100 percent certain that, at the end of the investigation, that I will be cleared of any wrongdoing.",

And they highlighted his substantial income from Ukrainian and Chinese energy companies, saying he did, in fact, have the funds available to pay his taxes in certain years but he failed to do so. Instead, prosecutors say he spent wildly on personal luxuries and expenses. (on camera): Now our team that was in the courtroom for this wild hearing. As it was wrapping up, the judge did address Hunter Biden and said, I know you wanted to resolve this, I'm sorry. But she said she has to be careful in how she's handling it. So it's clear that, for now, Hunter Biden's legal woes are not over. Neither, of course, are his political woes. Sara Murray, CNN, Washington. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

It also gives insight that for sure there may be other things lurking. And for the Justice Department, having a true ongoing investigation, that they've told the judge there is one, will really insulate them from congressional hearings.

There are some communities, particularly in the south, that close their public pools rather than integrate them.We also saw the expansion of private swimming pools as the suburbs began to be built in the '50s and '60s. And then cities really came under budget gaps and budget constraints. It's expensive to maintain a public pool. So we saw closures. And then more recently, cities have had a lot of trouble hiring lifeguards and staffing their pools, so that's led to closures, as well. And this impact really hurts low-income and minority communities hardest. And 79 percent of children in families making less than $50,000 a year don't know how to swim. Also much higher rates of black, Latino, and Native American children don't know how to swim. And a big reason for that is because of the lack of public swimming pools in this country.",

So it's about where everything else is. It's not contributing more or less, I think, than many of the other categories.But what -- you just told me is, well, the shares of spending is more, so it's not all about an increase in prices. And that's just because bought a lot of stuff during the pandemic. Now they're actually sick of buying stuff. So we're seeing people, you know, they're interested in buying refurnishing their home or buying a new appliance. That's not as strong as it was, but people are interested in spending more in services. That's been one of the things people have been concerned about as we knew inflation, which was primarily driven by rising prices for goods early on would spill over to services. And what we've seen is that inflation and the price of goods has come down, and, in some cases, the price of new cars, these things have really slowed. And in some cases, we've even seen reversals a little bit. So deflation, prices coming down. What we were worried about is that when, once we sort of recovered in goods, inflation would take off in services. And that hasn't really happened. We've certainly seen some inflation. But not enough to mean that we can't bring inflation down overall. And I'm not really worried that people's excitement to see Taylor Swift is going to make it harder for the Fed to fight inflation. And I think, you know, there's some mechanical sense in which consumer confidence does make it a little bit harder for the Fed, but to bring down inflation. But I think it makes it easier for the Fed to get that soft landing they want. They want to bring down inflation while at the same time allowing economic growth and employment to continue. And consumers believing in the economy, that the economy can and will remain strong is an important part of that. And the fact that that's happening when we're seeing pretty historic rates of people googling recession, what some people have called a vibe-session, I think is pretty remarkable.",
