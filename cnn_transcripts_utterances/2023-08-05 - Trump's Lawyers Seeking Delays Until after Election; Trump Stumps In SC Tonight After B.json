We being with a new deadline in the legal saga between Donald Trump and the special counsel following the historic the third indictment. Trump lawyers are now hitting back at a Monday deadline set by the judge overseeing his election interference case arguing they should have until Thursday to respond to the special counsel's request for a protective court order. Special Counsel Jack Smith is firing back telling the judge the delay is unnecessary. What's all this about? Well, the special counsel is seeking to stop defense lawyers from sharing with Trump copies of sensitive evidence. The special counsel is pointing to this social media post from Trump on Friday saying quote, \"If you go after me, I'm coming after you.\" Despite all of the legal battles, the Trump campaign is staging rallies where the former president is slamming the special counsel. Soon he's set to address reporters in the early primary state of South Carolina. Alayna Treene is there right now. Alayna, what are we expecting to hear from the former president tonight? Last night in Alabama, he was really going after special counsel Jack Smith and engaging in more of this volatile rhetoric that is obviously now going to be a matter in his case here in Washington. What more can you tell us?",

Last night in Alabama, he did all of those things. And I think you'regoing to hear him say a similar speech tonight. And also similar to last night he will speak to a receptive crowd. He'll be speaking to South Carolina Republicans in this room. And so I think you can anticipate him to feel energized by that. He knows the crowd that he is playing to. He knows that he can be defiant with them and that he'll get the reaction that he wants. I also just want to point out something he said last night.

He was attacked by Trump supporters on January 6th while he was defending the U.S. Capitol along with a great many other police officers. Mike, great to see you again. Let's just start with what you're seeing from Trump in this social media post. He said if you go after me -- we can put it up on screen, if we have it -- you go after me, I'm coming after you. That was what he put on his Truth Social media account last night. I mean, this is barely a day after he was arraigned in court and he's already inciting people with these kinds of messages. What did you think when you saw that? [17:04:51] MICHAEL FANONE, CNN LAW ENFORCEMENT ANALYST: It's just more of the same. This is the same rhetoric that the former president used in the weeks and months leading up to January 6th which obviously, you know, those of us who are grounded in reality understand what took place that day. But it's also deeply personal for me because as someone who's been outspoken against the former president, someone who advocated relentlessly for an indictment, you know, a lot of that rhetoric inspires attacks against myself and members of my family. Whether it's in the form of threats or individuals actually coming to our residence and harassing us.

He's concerned as well that somebody could get hurt in all of this.And there's a whole new cast of people that Donald Trump can put in danger with this kind of incitement. But it sounds as though this is the plan, to go out on the campaign trail and do this sort of thing. JONG-FAST: Well, Trump is always sort of doing the kind of worst thing you can imagine, right? Like that truth that we saw last night was shocking, but it wasn't unexpected. Right. We've seen him do things like that before. I think Trump world had said that three indictments somehow helped him, that once he got more indictments, and even yesterday night at an event, he said, you know, he just needs one more indictment to get the primary. And I think that is true. I think with Republican primary voters, this works very well. But the question is, can you grow the electorate? Can you convince a purple state voter that you really want to go along with this guy again? And I think that's what it's going to be. And look, he doesn't have to win the popular vote. He just needs to win the Electoral College. So it's a game of much smaller numbers in much swingier states, but I still think that this does not grow the electorate.",

This person, he announced, would spearhead the efforts to challenge the election.
