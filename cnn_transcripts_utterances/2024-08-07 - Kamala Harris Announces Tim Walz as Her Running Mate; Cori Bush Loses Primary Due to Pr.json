The NTSB is now investigating. A baby is among those rescued from a German hotel after it collapsed overnight. At least one person was killed. There's no word on what caused this collapse. Fire crews say that the building is still shifting, and they're still searching for several people who are missing. An extra bumpy ride for people on the Santa Monica pier after a 5.2- magnitude earthquake hit Southern California late last night. Officials there say there's a, quote, \"low likelihood\" of any deaths or damage. The quake was centered just South of Bakersfield. The Edgehill Fire destroying properties and injuring a firefighter in San Bernardino County, California. It is now fully contained with firefighters forced to battle the flames in 109-degree temperatures on Tuesday. All right. Tropical Storm Debby continues its path across the East Coast. Here you see damage in parts of Sarasota, Florida, where more than 17 inches of rain fell from Saturday morning to Tuesday night. And we are not done with it yet. Time now for weather. Debby is expected to make a second landfall on Thursday after it regained strength off the Georgia/South Carolina coast. Let's get to our meteorologist, Allison Chinchar, with more on this.

That is actually up from the overnight, because now that it's backup over open water, its able to intensify a little bit more. Very early into Thursday, we anticipate that to make a second landfall before finally getting picked up through that front and sliding up into the Northeast. In the short term, still the potential for some extra flooding across portions of the Carolinas, not only today, but also tomorrow. We see it shift a little bit farther inland as the storm itself begins to move inland, as well. But adding more rain is the last thing we need. Take a look at this video from Hilton Head, South Carolina. We can see the sheer weight of that rain collapsing the roof here. And very similar stories of all of that rain for much of both of the states here, both South and North Carolina. Forecast rain accumulation is still looking at widespread totals of at least four inches. Some spots could pick up an additional six inches or even more. But it's also not just the Southeast.
