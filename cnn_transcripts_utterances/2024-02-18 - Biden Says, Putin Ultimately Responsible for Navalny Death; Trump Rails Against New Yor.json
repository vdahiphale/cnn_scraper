I'm Anna Karen live from Hong Kong.Ahead on CNN Newsroom, U.S. President Joe Biden says Putin will pay the price for his role in the death of Russian opposition leader Alexey Navalny. But for the emboldened and seemingly unstoppable Russian leader, what does Western response look like? We'll discuss. Plus, Donald Trump is sounding off after a massive $355 million hit to his fortune, the former president campaigning in Michigan where he railed against the civil fraud ruling. And airstrikes hit multiple cities in central Gaza. Israel says it was targeting Hamas, but doctors on the ground claimed dozens of civilians were killed. There is continued and growing outrage over the death of Russian opposition leader Alexey Navalny. Russian prison officials say Navalny died Friday after a walk. Many western leaders, including U.S. President Joe Biden, say Vladimir Putin is responsible for Navalny's death. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN, U.S. PRESIDENT:  I've heard several things I haven't had to confirm, but the fact of the matter is Putin is responsible. Whether he ordered it or not, he is responsible for the circumstances that put that man in, and he is a reflection of who he is, and it just cannot be tolerated. I said there would be a price to pay. He is paying a price already. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Yet now, after the war, the full scale invasion of Ukraine, Russian civil society has been pushed even further to the margins with new and draconian media laws that essentially restrict free speech and make even the criticism of the war in the military, calling a war a war illegal, Anna.",

There's paralysis in the U.S. Congress. There's a huge gap in the hose pipe of weapons going to Ukraine, and that's already translating into victories for Russia on the battlefield. Ukraine was forced to retreat from the strategic town of Avdiivka just yesterday. And, really, this is the biggest boost to Putin's power. If he wins in Ukraine, if he can hold on to territory there, this boosts him in the eyes of Russians and enables him to maintain his very, very tight grip on power.",

He had charisma that appealed to all walks of Russian life, from liberals to sort of guys on the street. He made his anti-corruption message very, very strong. And he had called for Russians to come out and protest on the day of the election. He wanted everyone to gather at noon on the day of Russia's presidential elections in March.We don't know how many Russians would have actually responded to that call, given the very draconian new laws that Nathan was describing and the fact that now you can get thrown in jail for 15 years if you criticize the regime. Nevertheless, it looks like the authorities may have not wanted to leave anything to chance. We don't know how he died, of course. We know that he was kept in increasingly severe conditions in these isolation chambers, solitary confinement, and it may be that he just didn't hold out, but it certainly looked to everyone that a day before he died, he was in very good spirits.",

It's very difficult to do anything inside Russia. But probably the only way the west can respond is to step up and provide adequate arms to Ukraine.The mood in Russia is very different right now compared to before the counteroffensive. Then members of the elite were very nervous. They'd watched Ukraine take back Kherson Kharkiv, and this had dealt a huge blow to Putin's legitimacy. Most members of the elite were against the war. They saw it as catastrophic. And they would mumble and mutter privately about the need to replace Putin. And they would say, well, if Russia continues having military losses, then it's possible Putin will be replaced. They were speaking about how every first or second leader of Russia is removed illegally. But after the counteroffensive, the mood in Russia really did change, because they saw the west had been too timid in supplying Ukraine with weapons. It hadn't received adequate amounts of weapons. And you could see playing out what Putin had predicted, that the west would tire of the war, that western democracies were weaker than his authoritarian regime, and that time was on his side. And I think he really believes that. And you can see that reflected in the disarray and paralysis in Congress today.",

His name is quickly mentioned, and then they move on to Russia's strategic victory in Avdiivka.And we've seen the very, very heavy police presence on the streets trying to prevent anyone laying down flowers in Navalny's memory. And this is a very far cry to what we saw even three years ago when after Navalny's arrests, people poured onto the streets in the thousands in protests that some people compared to the protests in Belarus, which had nearly toppled the Belarusian president. Now, it's a much more muted response. People are very, very fearful and Putin is going to hope that fear and indeed apathy will continue because his Kremlin propaganda machine is now working full tilt.

Ukraine's president has been urging leaders to send more weapons, but in Washington, additional military aid for Kyiv is bogged down in partisan politics. And now the House has taken a two-week break, further delaying the $60 billion package. On Saturday Volodymyr Zelenskyy said, quote, dictators do not go on vacation.For more on this, I'm joined by CNN's Sebastian Shukla in Munich, Germany. Strong words from Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Were the leaders at the Security Conference listening, and will they step up and provide the aid, weapons, ammunition Ukraine so desperately needs?",

But as we were just hearing, the news of Alexey Navalny's death served as a bit of a bellwether for European defense and security officials gathering here.And I think it coalesced the thoughts of everybody meeting. So, it just and served as a reminder that, look, Ukraine needs support from its allies, and that the message then came from world leaders that President Putin cannot go unpunished, not only for the death of Alexey Navalny, but also for the ongoing war in Ukraine. So, for President Zelenskyy, when he turned up here yesterday, his message was clear, I need support, I need ammunition, and I need my strongest allies to come to my defense. The biggest issue that Ukraine is facing at the moment on the battlefield is the shortage of artillery and ammunition. Listen to what he had to say yesterday. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Malcolm, great to have you with us. Look, the fall of Avdiivka was a long time coming. I was there with artillery units on the outskirts of the town back in December. They had little ammunition against the Russians who, as we know, were throwing their soldiers into what was called a meat grinder. I mean, Russia had more men, more weapons, more ammunition. Ukrainians could not compete with this. So, you'd have to assume this was the right decision to pull out of Avdiivka.",

Adding to this was the fact, as you said, they were running low on ammunition.So, they were rapidly approaching the point whereby they literally could not defend their positions. And the danger was if they didn't withdraw, then the Russians could overrun them and either kill them on the spot or take them prisoner. And the Ukrainian military decided quite correctly that the sensible move was to withdraw from that location and set up new defensive positions to the west of Avdiivka.",

They've even gained a degree of local control of the air, which I think is important. But they have taken very heavy casualties to achieve their objective of taking this town. And now the question is can they sustain any momentum going forward to advance onto secondary objectives that lie to the west of Avdiivka.I think the assessment is that they probably can't. Both sides will stabilize their frontlines for a bit. The Ukrainians will try to build up their defensive positions where they've retreated to, to prevent the Russians from moving further west. The Russians will build up their military forces and restock and rearm so that they can try to launch more offensives going into the spring and ultimately into the summer. But, remember, this is one area along a very wide front that extends across multiple regions in Ukraine. And so the Russians are looking at playing this as a long-term game, a long-term strategy to try and wear down the Ukrainians, counting on a collapse in western support for Ukraine, starting with the U.S. House of Representatives in Congress.",

If the Russians can capture Kharkiv, that's a major Ukrainian city, that would require more than just the forces fighting around Avdiivka.It would require considerable forces elsewhere from Donetsk and Luhansk, the Donbas region. At the same time, they want to advance in the south, recapture area in Zaporizhzhia and Kherson. Ultimately, what they would like to do is capture Kharkiv and Odessa in the south so that they are then in a position to try and impose some sort of peace settlement on Ukraine, particularly if Ukraine doesn't have the military support coming from the U.S. and Europe that it needs to be able to fend off these attacks. So, we're looking at probably a scenario of this sort of steady advance by the Russians that are growing more powerful as the Ukrainians grow weaker over the course of 2024 and into 2025.",
