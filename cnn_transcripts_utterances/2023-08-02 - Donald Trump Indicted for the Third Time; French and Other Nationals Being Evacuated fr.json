I'm Rosemary Church.Just ahead on CNN NEWSROOM, former U.S. President Donald Trump indicted for a third time in four months, this time for his efforts to overturn the 2020 election. We will break down the charges and the potential fallout for the next election. Hundreds of French and other European nationals being evacuated from Niger as the political crisis deepens after last week's military coup. And Typhoon Khanun turns deadly and leaves hundreds of thousands without power as it slams Okinawa with high winds and heavy rain. We begin with an unprecedented moment in U.S. history as former president Donald Trump is indicted on criminal charges for his efforts to overturn the 2020 election. This indictment now marks the third time Trump has faced criminal charges. In this case, prosecutors allege Trump knowingly spread prolific lies of fraud as he remained determined to stay in power despite having lost. Trump is scheduled for an initial hearing Thursday. That's when he will be formally charged with four counts, including conspiracy to defraud the United States. Special counsel Jack Smith says his investigation will continue as he publicly addressed this latest federal indictment, which included six unindicted co-conspirators. Smith says Trump's repeated lies about the 2020 election fueled the attack on the U.S. Capitol. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

CRIME AND JUSTICE REPORTER: Donald Trump now faces federal criminal charges for trying to hold onto the presidency in 2020 and early 2021 in a sweeping set of allegations where the Justice Department is now accusing a president, a former president, but at the time he was president, of trying to defraud the government, block the Electoral College vote, and disenfranchise voters. So this is a serious set of four conspiracy and fraud charges, making this the third criminal case Donald Trump now faces as he runs for president, a third time. The allegations that the Justice Department outlined in these charges are largely a story that we have heard before, but these prosecutors that are presenting this from the special counsel's office went through a grand jury today. They are saying what Donald Trump was doing after the 2020 election was intentional fraud, a time where he was being told by his close advisors that fraud didn't exist in the election, that votes couldn't be found to deliver him the presidency, and that he needed to stand down after losing the election. Prosecutors say that Donald Trump tried to quote, defeat the federal government function through dishonesty. Now the parts of that effort they say was that he was using state legislators, that he was using illegitimate electors, the Justice Department, his own vice president Mike Pence, even the violence of his supporters on January 6 to his advantage. And this case called U.S. v Trump is only against Donald Trump at this time, making it different even from the case against him, also from the special counsel's office in Florida for actions he took after his presidency. But when this case, in D.C. district court, when it moves forward, it will be overseen by an Obama appointee, Judge Tanya Chutkin, a judge who is known to be -- to not suffer fools and to be a judge who is very interested in sentencing rioters from January 6th quite firmly. She has had many of them in her court before. She also has denied Donald Trump the ability to block records from his White House being turned over to congressional officials. So that is the judge who will have this case. But all of this still is not clear exactly how much of the case behind the scenes, how much of the investigation may remain. [03:05:02] We have these charges against Donald Trump. This case will move forward in court. But the Justice Department, even in this new indictment, on Tuesday they are outlining six conspirators, people like Rudy Giuliani, Sidney Powell, John Eastman, who were working with Donald Trump after the election. And the Justice Department is saying that though these people are not charged at this time, they helped Donald Trump in his disinformation effort. Katelyn Polantz, CNN, Washington. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

And despite all of those efforts to cause Donald Trump to allow there to be a peaceful transfer of power, he tried to hold on to the presidency. So this indictment, as you said, three conspiracy charges, one obstruction charge, basically says Donald Trump tried to subvert the democracy from this, our country, 250-year old United States, now having our entire democracy threatened by the efforts of Donald Trump.",

The jurors in this jurisdiction are likely to be more liberal, more democratic of not favorable to Donald Trump, not like the jurors likely to be in Florida.And you have a different judge in this case, Rosemary. That is very important. Tanya Chutkin, an Obama appointee, very tough judge, has proven to be tough, has been exceptionally tough with respect to those insurrectionists that have been in her courtroom, has given sentences in those cases that are longer in many cases than those recommended even by the prosecutors. And she has already denied a motion that Donald Trump filed trying to withhold documents and evidence from the January 6th Congressional Committee. So this is a judge that has demonstrated that she's prepared to hold Donald Trump accountable. One of her famous lines in that case involving the documents and turning them over to the January 6th Committee is that presidents are not kings. And I think that tells us a lot about how she's going to handle her courtroom and how this case will be handled. So I don't think we should assume that Donald Trump will be able to skate accountability in this particular case.",

It has moved operations to other regions in Sudan and across the western border to Chad, which has taken in more than 300,000 Sudanese refugees since the conflict began.

It's had to ban domestic imports of Ukrainian grain because it said it was severely undercutting its own farmers leading to a glut on the market. Of course it also comes as Ukraine is facing a real uphill battle trying to export its grain because of the now-defunct Black Sea grain deal. So this then escalated, the Ukrainians summons the Polish ambassador to make it clear that the comments about Ukrainian ingratitude did not, and I quote, \"reflect reality.\" Poland then summoned the Ukrainian ambassador to, for sort of nonspecific reasons and connection, they say, with statements made by Ukrainian government officials. It escalated even further with the Polish prime minister on Twitter saying that the Polish ambassador should never have been summoned in the first place, that this was a mistake given the level of Polish support for Ukraine since the war started. So when in a situation where essentially President Zelenskyy is having to wait in here and conduct some damage control. He in a statement on Twitter said, we will not allow any political instance to spoil the relations between the Ukrainian and Polish peoples and emotions should definitely cool down. The freedom and well-being of our nations, he says, the values of our Europe and the victory over the common Russian enemy are above all. So, look, this may now die down, but it reflects this very delicate reality for Ukraine that there are in some political circles a sort of creeping fatigue around what seems like unending support for the war in Ukraine, even from some of its most staunch allies. I think that's why you see that damage control for President Zelenskyy. It comes also after Russia tried to stir up tensions between Ukraine and Poland.

Their captain Pernille Harder scored a penalty midway through the first half, but it wasn't until the 10th minute of injury time at the end of the game that they could be sure of the win. That's when Sanne Trollsgaard-Nielsen made it two-nil, meaning that Denmark were able to celebrate for 28 years. Having finished second in the group, Denmark will now have a massive challenge against the co- host Australia in Sydney on Monday, whilst England's Lionesses will play Nigeria for a place in the quarterfinals. Back to you. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

He is scheduled to meet with Portugal's president, prime minister, and civil society leaders later today. Hundreds of thousands of young people from around the world are expected to gather for masses, vigils, and other events. This will be the first World Youth Day since 2019 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Looming over the event a report by a Portuguese Commission that says more than 4,800 minors were sexually abused by clergy over 70 years. Pope Francis is expected to meet privately with abuse victims. And still to come, Why UNESCO says Australia's Great Barrier Reef is not in danger, at least not yet. I'll ask a Greenpeace executive about that. (COMMERCIAL BREAK)",

And what UNESCO has done is said that the Australian government needs to change its regulatory and policy settings so that Australia is in line with what is necessary to keep global warming to under 1.5 degrees to give the great barrier for fighting chance. Now that's a really significant statement by UNESCO.",

That's worth a lot of money for Australia. So how much did that play a part in the decision this time around, do you think? And was UNESCO just taking the word of the government here?",

And that's really no more expansion of coal, oil or gas, no more billions of dollars of subsidies to coal and gas.Now, projects like for example, the massive Woodside proposal that would be the largest greenhouse gas emitting project to come forward in Australia simply cannot go ahead if we're going to be consistent with what is necessary to keep global warming under 1.5 degrees and give the Great Barrier Reef a fighting chance. And let's remember here that what Australia does really matters on the world scale because Australia is the third largest exporter of fossil fuels. So really what's significant here is there is an opportunity for this government to distance itself from the appalling record of Australian governments' past in not acting and to do the right thing by our Great Barrier Reef. That means no more expansion of coal, oil and gas.",

It is the meta threat.And I suppose what's really significant is not the words but the actions. And what UNESCO has called for here, really fundamentally, is action by the Australian government action to not expand coal, oil and gas is what is necessary. This is implicit in what UNESCO has said, which is that the Australian government needs to have policies in line with what is necessary to keep global warming under 1.5 degrees. That is what is needed here and that action is far more significant than any words on the page.",
