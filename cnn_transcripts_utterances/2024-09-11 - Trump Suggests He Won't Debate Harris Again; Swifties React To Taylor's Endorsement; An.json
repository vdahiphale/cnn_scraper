And I will note, I needed that makeup room far more than you needed it.Look, I'll walk you through the numbers here and just sort of give you an idea of what sort of cooking here, because I think there are multiple different elements. There is what happened last night. There is what might happen in a few days, and then there will be what will happen come November. All right. So let's just start off with last night and sort of put that into some historical context, right? You noted, of course, that Kamala Harris won that debate in the minds of viewers. And that, to me, is so notable because that 26-point win. What a difference from where we were back in June, right, when Donald Trump won that debate over Joe Biden by 34 points. So basically the exact inverse. This looks a lot more like what happened in 2020 when Joe Biden, in the minds of the viewers, won that first debate over Donald Trump. And a significantly wider win for Harris than Hillary Clinton had in that first debate back in 2016 against Donald Trump. And well -- what I will note is so interesting about this victory for Harris is that the sample of the debate viewers was actually a bit more Republican, a bit more Republican than the nation as a whole, and yet, Harris was able to win them over. All right. So Harris won last night. What does this mean for the days and weeks to come? All right. So let's go through history, all right, and say, OK. Do folks see a polling bump after winning the first debate? In fact, what we see historically is, yes, yes, they do. In fact, we'll go back the last four first debates, right, back in 2012. Mitt Romney won that first debate, and he saw a polling bump against Barack Obama. 2016, we mentioned it a little bit earlier. Hillary Clinton won that first debate. She saw a polling bump against Donald Trump. Joe Biden saw a polling bump against Donald Trump in 2020. And, of course, in June of 2024, Donald Trump won that first debate and knocked Joe Biden out of the race. So given how tight this race is right now, historically speaking, all these folks saw a polling bump of about two points or more. If you apply that to Kamala Harris, and we have such a tight race nationally, and in those key battleground states, don't be surprised if Kamala Harris opens up a little bit of an advantage, though probably still would be a race too close to call. OK. So that's a few weeks down the line. What about a few months down the line come November? This was the point that I was trying to get across, Bianna. All right. So you may see those polling bumps, right? But does that mean you'll necessarily win come November? Uh-uh. All right. Lost the first debate and won the election. Let's look at the five elections so far in the 21st century. George W. Bush lost that first debate back in 2004 against John Kerry, but he went on to win the election. How about Barack Obama in 2012? He lost that first debate against Mitt Romney, and he went on to win that election. And, of course, Donald Trump lost that first debate against Hillary Clinton back in 2016, and he went on to win the election. So the bottom line is, yes, Kamala Harris did well last night. She'll probably gain in the polls in the days and weeks to come, but whether or not she wins in November, if I have that answer for you, then I might as well go on a wonderful gambling --",

If you win the first debate, the most important thing is to maintain the momentum after the initial bump and also win over independence. Obviously, Kamala Harris made a lot of attempts to do that. She talked about gun ownership, the fact that she is a gun owner. She talked about, you know, praising John McCain. And also the number of prominent Republicans, including the former vice president, who have supported her campaign. Is that going to be enough to maintain this kind of momentum between now and November 5th?",

I think she becomes more of a potentialcommander in chief in the eyes of many voters. It's going to be interesting to see whether there is a second debate, although Harris says that she's open to that. I can see a scenario in which she was so successful in this debate she would like to end it there. From Trump's point of view, if he's widely perceived to have lost, it would be unlikely, I think, that he would agree to another debate. In the coming weeks, I think it's going to be important. If Harris does get a polling of bounce, that could be significant in some of these swing states, because in Wisconsin and North Carolina, for example, early and mail voting is going to start in a couple of weeks. So, you know, the half-life of that bounce could give her some votes that she perhaps wasn't going to get. As far as Trump is concerned, is he going to be able to make a case to more moderate voters that he really needs in these swing states to win the elections? He just didn't even seem to try to do that last night. It often seemed that he was more comfortable slipping into the rally persona of Donald Trump, which delights his base voters. As you mentioned, that slander against Haitian immigrants. That's the kind of thing he comes up with at his rallies, but it doesn't really help him win over the voters he needs if he's going to end up back in the White House. Trump has a ceiling of about 48 percent in national elections. I don't see any way in which he was able to expand that last night, but eight weeks is a long time. All sorts of things could happen inside the United States and outside the United States that Trump could seize on and change what this election is actually going to be about.",

Clearly, I mean, it's pretty safe to say objectively. I don't know what polls the former president was referring to when he said he won 80 to 20, but objectively, Kamala Harris was the victor last night and largely because she was able to bait him repeatedly.

In 2016, which this race feels a little bit like that to me, it didn't keep him from winning the Electoral College. So I guess I'm going to say that I agree with you that he didn't have a very good night, that she did meet the bar of plausibility. But at the same time, it may not change the national dynamic. I think the race is basically tied. And if they end up being 48, 48 or 49, 49, he's probably going to win the Electoral College. I feel a little about this debate the way I felt about his convention speech. You know, here's an opportunity for you to do something. And he just kind of missed the opportunity. It's not fatal, but it's probably disappointing to some Republicans that he didn't rise to meet the moment. But it's really no great shock that he lost the debate in a presidential campaign given that he's lost virtually every one that he's ever been in.",

But there was something that \"The New York Times\" noted that I think really stood out because that only was he on the defense, but they note that in answer after answer, the former president reminded Americans of his role in so much of what many would rather forget. That is the pandemic, that's his refusal to accept the 2020 election, and more obviously his role in appointing three judges, justices that would overturn Roe versus Wade.

She started off a little nervous and a little shaky. And the snap poll that CNN did, even though she was judged to have won the debate, on the economy, the specific question of the economy, he actually went up a couple of points and she went down a couple of points. So he may have scored a couple of points there under the radar. But it was the immigration question that got him off track. He got baited on a taunt about his rallies. And then as you pointed out, he took bait after bait after bait down the line. And that did not help him. At the end, he made the correct case, which is you've been in for three and a half years, why haven't you done any of this already? But that was an hour and 45 minutes later and should have permeated his entire strategy. So, I -- you know, look, I have viewed his image as being immovable, nothing ever changes. He does something good, it doesn't change. He does something bad, it doesn't change. She's got a more malleable image, people know her, but they don't know her. I have anticipated she'll get a little image bump out of this, but whether that's enough to wash off her responsibility for the last three and a half years is yet to be seen. She got a question about that on the economy and on immigration. She completely evaded those questions. She took no responsibility for it.

Now Blinken is there in a show of support, but he is also speaking with key Ukrainian leaders, including Zelenskyy himself, about their vision for the battlefield moving forward. And whether these, in fact, would be decisive in that progress. Now, to this point, U.S. officials have not indicated that they have plans to change those restrictions, to ease those restrictions. But pressure here within the United States is building. We saw Democratic Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Ben Cardin, come out with a statement just moments ago calling on the administration to ease the restrictions in light of relentless attacks from Russian President Vladimir Putin. Now, U.S. officials have said they are concerned about the escalatory impact to that, using those weapons to strike within Russia, to strike at targets close to Moscow could have.

We live this every single year and still reflect on the incredible loss and pain that this city in particular experienced, but also coupled with incredible resilience and strength. What are you saying there today? BRYNN GINGRAS, CNN U.S. NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Yes, absolutely. And really what hammer's home and the point you just made there, Bianna, is the fact when we're seeing all those people read the names of all of those lives lost on 9/11, 23 years ago today. There were grandchildren. You know, we really haven't seen many grandchildren quite yet. That's how long it's been. That now the children have had children who never met their grandparents. And that's something that really stuck out to me as I'm often here every year covering this. But this is the time where, yes, these families reflect. They say put politics aside. This is a day to remember those lives lost, but also a day to think about where we want to be as a country. Where have we been? Where are we going? And that is something that many of these families we talked to today in an election year wanted to really stress. One girl I talked to, she lost her father, a firefighter lieutenant at the firehouse, literally directly across the street from one of those towers. She says she thinks about her father today, but then she immediately turns to 9/12, the day after, that day where you saw American flags everywhere in this country. People were coming together. They were praying together. They were hoping that we were going to see better days. And that's where she really reflects on today and tomorrow. So it's definitely a day that is somber, particularly during those moments of silence, but it's also a day that these families really, it seems, as the years have ticked by, really want to stress unity and moving forward, and as a country as a whole and less divisiveness.

The system itself is expected to make landfall likely early this evening and then gradually slow down as it continues to make its way in towards states like Alabama, Mississippi, and eventually into Tennessee. Rainfall has already triggered a pretty significant amount over areas of Texas. Take Brownsville, Texas, for example. They've already had over seven inches of rain. To put that into perspective, that's more than they would normally see in the entire month of September. And they've had it in just the last 48 hours. More rain is expected, especially along the Gulf Coast Region. But even cities a little bit farther inland say Atlanta, Birmingham, and even Memphis expecting, maybe say as much as four to six inches of rain for some of these communities. Another concern right along the Gulf Coast is going to be storm surge. This area in red here just south of Morgan City, Louisiana looking at storm surge numbers around five to 10 feet. Another concern with Francine is going to be the potential for severe thunderstorms. We're talking tornadoes, water spouts, and even damaging winds and that stretches from the central coast of Louisiana all the way over through the panhandle of Florida. Winds are gradually going to start to tick up as this storm begins to get closer. So especially along the coastline here, you're going to see those numbers jumping 40, 50, 60 miles per hour.
