I'm Becky Anderson in Abu Dhabi with breaking news out of Syria for you today, where 50 years of authoritarian rule by the Assad family is crumbled in the face of a lightning-fast rebel offensive.In a statement carried out on state TV, the rebels declared they have, quote, \"liberated\" the capital, Damascus, claiming President Bashar al-Assad has been overthrown. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator):  With the help of God, the City of Damascus was liberated and the regime of the tyrant Bashar al- Assad was toppled. All prisoners from the prisons of the regime were liberated. The operations center of Fateh Damascus asked all brothers, jihadists, and citizens to preserve all the belongings of the Syrian State. Long live free Syria. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Rebels have been sweeping through the country since launching this offensive last week. They claim to have captured four cities in one day before reaching the capital. Well, a new video shows the rebel flag raised over Damascus hospital and military uniforms littering the street. U.S. President Joe Biden and his team say they are closely monitoring the situation and staying in contact with regional partners. Well, CNN Chief International Anchor Christiane Amanpour joins us now from Doha. And, Christiane, what do you make of what is unfolding, the significance both for Syria and Syrians, of course, and for the wider region?",

      "sentences": "Well, Becky, obviously, like everyone here at Doha, a meeting of regional leaders for the Doha Forum, the annual event, which brings foreign ministers, prime ministers, not just in the region from -- but from elsewhere as well, including American officials, there is a huge amount of surprise because of the lightning speed of all of this.Even though all these countries have excessive intelligence and all this operation where they can pretty much figure out what's going on, they were unable to understand that this was happening last week and how fast that it happened and how quick the denouement has been in the terms of the fact that it appears Assad has been overthrown, although his whereabouts still remain unknown. So, the big picture is that Russia, Assad's main backer, is weakened because of Ukraine. Iran is weakened because of the attacks on Hezbollah and the attacks by Israel. Hezbollah, which were the Syrian forces ground troops, are weakened. And as such, the rebels, who appear to be supported by Turkey, have found this moment of opportunity and have stormed up the country like a hot knife through butter. The big question will be what happens next, obviously, and we simply don't know. When I was on the stage here at the Doha Forum yesterday with the Qatari foreign minister and deputy prime minister, this is what he said. He essentially put it on the shoulders of Bashar Assad, who had not used, he said, the intervening few years of relative quiet in the country to make any inroads in terms of uniting the actual Syrian people around his government. Here's what the Qatari prime minister told me.",

      "sentences": "So, as you know, you know, in the intervening years, the region had started to rehabilitate Bashar Assad. The United States believed that Bashar Assad could be used as a bulwark in the region in a kind of reshaping Middle East since the Israeli war, essentially around here that have really weakened Iran's proxies in this region. We understand through reporting that the United States was even trying to peel Bashar Assad away from Iran.Well, all of that has now, you know, been completely demolished, whatever building blocks they were trying to achieve in this region, the post-Israeli situation here. And now, we understand that Russia says that it's potentially still supporting the regime, but there is no more regime. The Iranian foreign minister, who I was due to interview right here today in the next couple of hours about this whole situation, has been called back to Tehran, where there's going to be a meeting, we understand, on this situation. Remember, Iran and Russia have put all their backing on the Bashar Assad regime for the past 13 years. And this has all gone to come to naught right now. Last night, there was a meeting here at this hotel where I am between the Qatari prime minister and representatives, foreign ministers of Russia, of Turkey, of Iran, of all the nations that have really involved in this situation. But again, we don't know how this is going to unfold. And the most important thing I've heard from a human rights official is will this rebel coalition, you know, sort of identify itself by its respect for the minorities. If this rebel coalition respects the Alawites in Syria, who are the minority group who support the Assad regime, then it's potentially possible to do deals. But if it shows a vengeance in the aftermath of this power grab, then it's going to be a very, very different situation. And Syria could easily turn out to be even more of a failed state than it is right now. And that could easily sort of unravel the situation in this area. But don't forget, Assad was the dictator who 13 years ago cracked down violently against his own people who just wanted reform. They didn't even want to overthrow him at the beginning, but the response by the Assad regime to the original young people's demonstrations in the City of Daraa was what set off a multi-year civil war. And so, we're going to see who wins, who loses out of all of this, and what happens if there is a major realignment of forces and of order and of influence in this region at this time. Becky.",

You spoke to Bashar al-Assad back in 2005, as I understand it, ahead of the U.N. report into Rafic Hariri's assassination.

So, we can expect them to be much more involved in terms of stabilization so that the experiment goes well, so that there is no chaos the way it happened before in Libya, in Iraq, the U.S. intervention and so on.Israel will look at its border. Israel will be careful that none of these groups are getting closer to the border and potentially launching some attacks. But then, other countries, including Europeans, Gulf countries will try to shape the process in a way, but also to either favor their own interest for Gulf countries or for the Europeans to stabilize the situation because Europeans would not want the situation to deteriorate further. Europeans will be looking for stability, so potentially they will have to open dialogue with some of these groups, including groups like HTS, with whom there is no dialogue because the organization is still listed as a terrorist organization by European countries.

This particular moment reminds me of the Iranian revolution in 1979. Assad was really as brutal as Reza Shah of Iran who ruled Iran between 1953 and 1979.The Assad family has been in power from 1971 up to 2024. Syria could go both two ways, Becky. And you know Syria very well. One way, Syria could go basically descends into all out social, political, tribal, and religious upheaval, like Libya, like Yemen. Communities standing up, various communities, and taking arms into their own hands. Another way is that Syria could really begin the process of healing. This will take a long time healing in terms of state building, in terms of nation building, because Syria has been ruled autocratically and brutally for almost -- you know, from 1971 until the present. And I think the reason why I'm a bit hopeful because the Islamist opposition, in particular, has been trying to reassure Syrians, all communities, in the sense Syria for all Syrians, in the sense don't ever damage government properties, in the sense that basically they are really running a very tight show. But we have to wait and see, as you know, because in Iran, the situation after one year, the Iranian revolution morphed from a, you know, socially based, broadly based revolution into an Islamist revolution.",
