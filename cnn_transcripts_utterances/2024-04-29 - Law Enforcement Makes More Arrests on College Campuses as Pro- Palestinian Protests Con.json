The damage is unbelievable, what one governor is saying as deadly, severe storms the country. Sara is out. I'm John Berman with Kate Bolduan. This is CNN NEWS CENTRAL. This morning, college graduations are right around the corner with pro-Palestinian encampments set up on some of the very sites they're supposed to take place. Hundreds of students and faculty have been arrested or detained in sometimes violent encounters with authorities. In Boston, about 100 new arrests at Northeastern University after police broke up an encampment there. At UCLA, police in riot gear intervened after protesters breached the security barrier. George Washington University is beginning to see its encampment spill off campus onto the streets. CNN's Danny Freeman is in Philadelphia.

      "sentences": "You bet, John. This is day five of the encampment protest here at the University of Pennsylvania, and everything really has been mostly peaceful so far, although I will say it was a bit of a tense weekend because on Friday night, just about 24 hours after the encampment was set up, the university called on it to be disbanded. And as you can see, this encampment has only grown.Now, just to give you a flavor of what we're looking at here, you can see they are students here. They've just woken up there. There's breakfast, it seems coffee in that area. This, to be clear, John, started as maybe 10, maybe it dozen encampments back on Thursday now grown to quite a bit more than that here in the middle of the University of Pennsylvania. So let me tell you what makes this particular protest a little bit more unique than some of the others. So there are actually three universities represented here. There's students from Temple, students from Drexel, students from, of course, the University of Pennsylvania. And then also there are other folks from the larger Philadelphia community who have taken up camp here in this area as well. And initially the university so that they support the right for folks here on campus to protest and to share their voices. But then, like I said, that changed from Thursday into Friday when the university said that this encampment had blatant violations of university policies. They said that they had credible reports of harassing and intimidating conduct, and then also an incident of antisemitic graffiti that the university said this investigating now as a hate crime. But as you can see right here, the demands of these protesters remain the same and they say they're not going anywhere. They want the university to disclose a number of the companies that they may be invested in that have connections to Israel and then divest from those particular companies and investments. The thing I'll tell you, John, also is that we understand from the protestors here that they did have a chance to meet with some of the university leadership over the weekend, the university confirming that as well, but so far they have not been able to see eye-to-eye. These encampments are still here, and we understand overnight there have actually been more notice of trespassing signs that have been put up in this area of the University of Pennsylvania, saying that you are in violation of both students regulations, university regulations, but also of Philadelphia law. So as of now, things have been peaceful, John, make no mistake. But the tension between the university and these protesters at the moment, a bit of a standstill. John?",

      "sentences": "Yes, Kate. Law enforcement has certainly been thrust into the middle of this, particularly because so many of these protests are taking place on private property. There's no First Amendment right to protest on private property. And so when these universities say, hey, we want these people out of here, it's the police who have to do that. It's the tactics, however, that we've seen in some circumstances that have certainly drawn a lot of criticism, including one incident last week at Emory University involving a college professor.

      "sentences": "Now, as you look at that video, at the start of that, what you see is this professor coming up towards a group of officers who were attempting to put someone in custody. Now, at that point, I think anyone who served in law enforcement will understand that for that officer to try to get her away from that situation, that would be justified, but it's been taking her to the ground afterwards that has obviously raised serious questions. Under the letter of the law under the state of Georgia, battery on a police officer is something as simple as touching them in a provoking way. But of course, in law enforcement, what departments look for is judgment. People will understand that just because you can do something, is that the best course of action?It's worth pointing out that certainly since the 2020 protests that we saw across the country, I've heard from law enforcement people who said that one tactic they're taking is understanding there are now hundreds of videos that are often being taken at these incidents. If they see someone who they think isn't committing a serious violation, they can go back to the tape and then try to get that person later rather than seeing this violent encounter that we saw there. I do want to show you one example of the right way to do this. We saw this the last week at the University of Southern California where you have protesters who were surrounding this vehicle. A protester was taken and put into a squad car. That turned into this very volatile situation where it's essentially a standoff of sort, if we have that video. At some point, authorities ultimately determined that they were going to try to de-escalate, and you actually see them letting the individual out of the back of that squad car. Obviously, there was some kind of conversation that they had with this person. Interestingly, once that person steps out of the car, he then starts telling everyone else to step back, to push back, and to get out of that area. And so you see that decision being made by the on-scene commander to try to de-escalate that situation. Obviously, Kate, we're going to see more and more of these protests. Law enforcement will certainly be under the microscope as far as how they respond. Certainly, a lot of the actions raising a lot of questions. Obviously, though, there are so many other encounters that have happened as well where authorities are being asked to get people out of private property. Certainly, a very volatile situation.",

But elements to this case, right, we have a former president, Republican nominee, we have a tabloid tie-in, we have an adult film star. But really at the heart of this case is what you just said, that 34 counts of falsifying business records. And that's what prosecutors are now just starting to get into is that paper trail.So they said it was going to be sort of dense with paperwork that's going to have to be shown to jurors, and that's what we're seeing with this last witness that was just on the stand. And he's a banker that Michael Cohen used to set up those shell companies to first pay off Karen McDougal. Of course, that transaction never happened. But then they showed jurors basically how we set up another one. And that is to set the stage for paying off Stormy Daniels, of course, at the heart of this case. So that's where we're at right now with this trial. It ended on Friday with jurors hearing from Gary Farro, who is this banker. And we're going to see just more sort of paperwork lined out. We saw the same thing prior to him, which was Trump's longtime assistant at Trump Tower, where she kind of was showing how Karen McDougal and Stormy Daniels were contacts in the Trump Organization, how she actually saw Stormy Daniels at Trump Tower, though the defense said she might have been there for casting for \"The Apprentice.\" But yes, so the next couple of days well see how much is document- heavy, and then we might get into the big blockbuster witnesses again, like we saw with David Pecker. We've got Michael Cohen coming up, Stormy Daniels. So the next couple of weeks are certainly going to be busy.",

What you want to do is set the foundation for the jury and looking back now, okay, they've got three witnesses in. Things seem to be moving fairly efficiently, and they've given the jury the following. First of all, the jury now understands catch and kill, the sort of seedy underbelly of the \"National Enquirer,\" Trump-Pecker-AMI, that's important for the rest of the case.  They have also now established a groundwork to get him in the Trump Organization's business documents. That was the second witness, Rhona Graff, who was a long-time assistant to Trump, and now, with the banker who is on the stand, they are getting into the actual charge, the actual falsification of business records. So this is all you can ask for as a prosecutor after the first week of trial that's going efficiently and smoothly and you're getting in your main points that the jury is going to need later on.",

They got David Pecker to say that Michael Cohen is \"prone to exaggeration.\" And then when Rhona Graff came up, they used her on cross-examination, not to suggest she is some kind of liar or anything, but rather to humanize Donald Trump. They got her to talk about how he was a decent the boss and a man who she liked and admired.

He ended up drawing down on his mortgage in order to pay Stormy Daniels. So that's sort of half of the transaction. The other half is Trump then reimbursing Michael Cohen.

To me, there is no reason to hold off. I mean, here is the status quo. We had an initial batch of 11 alleged violations. The judge held a hearing on that early last week, and now we've got a second batch of for more where he is holding hearing next week end, he hasn't ruled on any of them and Trump continues to violate the gag order. Although we did cool off a bit this weekend, so maybe he is getting tired of it or maybe he doesn't want to have any more of these gag order hearings, but look it as a fact, there is not a lot the judge can do. The judge is not going to lock up Donald Trump, certainly not right now. He can only fine him $1,000.00 per incident, but look, we both have kids, like if you wait to enforce discipline, they're not going to get the point at all. They're going to run rampant. So you have to enforce discipline even if you have limited tools. I think it has to be swift and it has to be certain. So I don't know what the judge is waiting for.
