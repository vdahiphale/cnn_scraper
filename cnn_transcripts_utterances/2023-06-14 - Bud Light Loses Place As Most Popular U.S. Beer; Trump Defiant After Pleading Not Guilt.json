And also when we look at Russia, obviously, with Vladimir Putin at the helm, it's interesting that the Russian state news agency has covered this but they covered it exclusively from the angle of Trump maintains that he had the right to have these documents with no counterbalance in their report as to all the evidence against him. So underscoring as a leader that he has the right to do what he wanted to do. And in the United Kingdom in The Guardian, which I have here, there's been quite a lot of commentary linking Boris Johnson's political travails of the last week -- the fact that he had to resign after calling an investigation into him a witch hunt, a kangaroo court, a political hit job.
