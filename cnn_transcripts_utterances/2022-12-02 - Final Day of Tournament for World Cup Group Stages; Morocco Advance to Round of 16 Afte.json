Now they don't explode in the same way as they would if they had an explosive device on the end obviously, but they've got kinetic energy. They're loaded with fuel.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) PLEITGEN (voice-over): Mercenaries for Russia's Wagner private military company are fighting on some of the toughest battlefields in Ukraine. A social media channel affiliated with the group recently posted this video allegedly showing a severely wounded Wagner fighter trying to shoot himself rather than fall into Ukrainian hands. Now, the group has acknowledged a man from the Southern African nation of Zambia has been killed fighting on the frontlines in Ukraine. This is 23- year-old Lemekhani Nathan Nyirenda. Wagner's founder Yevgeny Prigozhin, known as Putin's chef, admits he recruited Nyirenda from a Russian jail and says he died a hero. I talked to him in the (INAUDIBLE) region, Prigozhin wrote in a statement. Why do you need this war? After all, the chance of dying is quite high. And he answered what I expected. You Russians helped us Africans gain independence for many years. The Wagner group saves thousands of Africans. And if I go to war with you, this is probably a very small way in which I can pay our debts.

But the odds still favor, even after today's report, that the Fed ends up moderating the pace of a rate hikes and go from 75 basis point to 50 basis points. I think when you really zoom out, though, today's report does show the very difficult job that the Fed faces here in terms of trying to tame inflation, and it does suggest that they're going to have to, one, keep raising interest rates next year and two, keep them at relatively high levels to get inflation down.

That's one testimony but we have seen parallels to that in Shanghai from eyewitnesses who say police were stopping pedestrians after protests in the vicinity of them. And stopping pedestrians and searching their phones for VPNs and for photos of previous protests. So that gives you a sense of the lengths that Chinese security forces will go to control and prevent forms of dissent. That said you also get a sense that people are frustrated. I'm going to direct you to a couple of videos that emerged just from December 1st, from two separate cities of residents. Not huge numbers of residents but people just breaking down barriers around their communities, the kind of things that the authorities have been putting up for the past year, to wall off residential communities from the outside world when their fears of COVID outbreaks, a sign of the sheer frustration that some Chinese are feeling after all of this zero COVID approach to the virus, a sense that some Chinese people are saying enough is enough.

Jiang was president of China from 1993 to 2003, famous for his trademark spectacles and for periodically bursting into song. His death has triggered a wave of nostalgia on the heavily censored Chinese internet. \"Who would have thought that movies, books and even World Cup livestreams have all been censored,\" one person wrote in a post.

There was also one solitary photo of the prince and princess of Wales in black and why. And typically accompanied by at least what to my ears sounds like breaking glass. So draw your own conclusions there. Of course it's well-established that Harry and his brother William, there is been a huge rift in that relationship in recent years. One that doesn't seem to be healing anytime soon. And this documentary series, and his upcoming memoir, seem to be taking a lot of oxygen and a lot of attention away from some of the things that the prince and princess of Wales are trying to accomplish and to try to draw attention to. Like these Earthshot Awards which will be presented later on tonight. Yesterday for, instance they were toured around the Boston Harbor, Becky, with the mayor of Boston who was said that they were delightful and generous with their time, though of course that's not what the British press is talking a whole heck of a lot about today. And then just quickly, you mentioned the presidential visit as well. We don't have a whole lot of information about that other than it is in the president's schedule for 30 minutes only to meet with the prince of Wales. Also interesting to note that Biden is going to the place that William was said to be at, not vice versa.",
