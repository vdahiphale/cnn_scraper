      "sentences": "Well, first of all, this is a special edition of our show. We're getting ready to welcome in the new year, and I wanted to take a look at the stories we've been committed to covering in 2024 that will continue to impact as we head into 2025.So this hour we'll revisit conversations about the future of diversity, equity and inclusion programs, increasing representation of people of color, from the census to our TV screens, our movie screens. But if there is any story that shaped our year the most and set the stage for what's to come next year, it's the state of the economy. The conventional wisdom is that those issues define the 2024 presidential race. So we'll start this morning with a look at how we can all get our money right in the next year. Here to share their insight are Troy Millings and Rashad Bilal. Together, they are the founders of the platform Earn Your Leisure. And they're the authors of a new book coming out in January, You Deserve To Be Rich, Master The Inner Game Of Wealth, and Claim Your Future. Gentlemen, thank you for being with me. Let me start here because for those people who are not familiar with your platform and all the arms of it, Earn Your Leisure sounds like a mantra. It sounds like a directive statement. So let's start with the philosophy of how you approach wealth, building money and finances. RASHAD BILAL, CO-CREATOR, EARN YOUR LEISURE: For sure. So our slogan is assets over liabilities. And that is something that is true in all things in life, but especially when it comes to money. So we're balanced people. We don't try to live like monks and tell people that they can't have any luxuries, but we feel that society as a whole has prioritized liabilities over assets. So we always encourage people to Pay themselves first to invest into the stock market, to invest into their 401(k)'s, to invest into real estate, to learn about cryptocurrency first as a priority and then with the money left over, have fun, go out, you know, go shopping, as opposed to what most people do with. They get paid and they have fun. After they pay their bills, they go out, they go shopping, they go to sports games, and then any money that's left over, they try to save it.",

      "sentences": "Okay, so let's break this down because you talked about a lot of investing, but for some people this morning, investments seems a little far off. They're living paycheck to paycheck. They're just trying to make last Friday meet next Friday, right? So if, Troy, we are talking to those folks specifically, what step one, how do they get out of what seems like just struggling to keep their head above water?TROY MILLINGS, CO-CREATOR, EARN YOUR LEISURE: Well, I think the first thing is to realize the mindset, right? The first thing is to understand that investing is for everybody. So it doesn't matter if you have a hundred dollars or if you have $10,000, you can participate in it. But I think the most important thing that people forget to do is actually create a plan. So first create a budget and see how much you're spending versus how much you're making and figuring out what you're going to do with that in between. Money, right? Do you have passive income? So we'd like to encourage people to do something called dollar cost averaging into the stock market because we know for one thing is that money will always replicate and appreciate over time if you put it into the economy. We've always taught people that saving your way to wealth is not the strategy, right? We have to invest, we have to make sure that our assets are appreciating over time. And so when you start planning and budgeting for it now, then the future is going to look a lot better than it does now.",

And so like you said, no job is safe in this economy, especially with artificial intelligence. And that's not going anywhere. It's going to replace a lot of jobs and a lot of jobs that people in our community are used to or accustomed having.So we got to figure out ways not to call them side hustles, but have side interests and side skills. So investing could be one of them. Trying to create a new business could be one of them. Or finding investment partners to create something new with is vitally important. Right. If we're looking at the future, working together is something that we have to look as an action plan to the future of our generation.",

And now the people who are financially stable, but they look at their top-line gross income or salary, and they think that number should buy me a better life than I have, a better lifestyle than I have.

      "sentences": "The only way is that you have to beat inflation. At a multiple, at least three times more than what inflation is. So investing is the only way to do that. And if you feel that you're not living the way that you should live based off of the money that you're making, that's because the money that you're making is not what you think it really is. So, you know, growing up, we always thought that $100,000 was the benchmark. That's what we come from, working-class environments. And when we made $100,000 living in New York, we realized that didn't really go too far.So that's why we really encourage investing. Because if you invest, then you're not, may not necessarily gain the benefits of that right away unless you're day trading or something like that. But over the course of time, your money is going to grow faster than inflation, so you'll be able to actually enjoy it at a certain point in time, as opposed to living in a situation where you're constantly making more money, but the prices of things constantly go up as well. So that's why it's vitally important to always put money into the market, put money into investments, but also increase your income over the course of time as well. Being an entrepreneur is not something that we just encourage because we want the freedom and the luxuries, but it also allows you to kind of gauge your income up as opposed to a job which usually stays the same over the course of time.",

How do we have some of those conversations if we want to do right by the people who did right by us, but the challenge of building wealth and growing financially is impeded? How do you approach those conversations?",

When President-elect Trump takes office next month, one of the administration's first cuts will likely be to DEI. And House Republicans appear eager to join in.Right now, they're backing the dismantled DEI Act. It would close all federal DEI offices, prohibit funding to DEI programs, amend the 1964 Civil Rights Act, and overturn Biden administration executive orders. Congresswoman Yvette Clark is the next leader of the Congressional Black Caucus, and she predicts extreme pushback to any moves House Republicans or President-elect Trump make to cut programs at federal agencies. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) REP. YVETTE CLARK, (D) CHAIR-ELECT, CONGRESSIONAL BLACK CAUCUS: People of color can't dream for what they can't see. And for generations, you know, there has been such systemic racism in our nation that individuals have been held back though they have the talent, the expertise, and the ability from advancing whether it's in the federal government or the private sector due to the lack of involvement, inclusion, there has just been those lost opportunities. And what DEI does is it reminds us of the diversity of our nation, that talent comes in every person. And so what's happening right now is a backlash to recognizing the multiracial, multi-religious, multicultural nature of our country. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

President-elect Trump's pick to lead the Pentagon is vowing to remove so called WOKE leaders from the Defense Department. Pete Hegseth claims, and this is a quote, that the dumbest phrase on planet Earth in the military is our diversity is our strength.I recently spoke with two people who have unique historical and personal perspectives on this. Captain Mary Tobin is a U.S. Army veteran. She served two combat tours in Iraq. She's a West Point grad and now a veteran fellow at Stanford's Hoover Institution. Retired Major General Dana Petard is also a West Point grad who also served in Iraq. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) CAPT. MARY TOBIN, VETERAN FELLOW, HOOVER INSTITUTION AT STANFORD UNIVERSITY: I think the case has already been made for the strength of diversity. We see throughout our military history thousands, millions of minorities, those who would be considered a part of the WOKE crew serving in the military, and not only support positions, but also those in combat units, combat situations. I think of my fellow women, my sisters in arms who have been trained as Rangers, who have been trained in naval special warfare operations, who have, who are right now serving at various levels within our military with valor and distinction. I think of my West Point sister, Captain Lindsey Heigler, who received an award for valor supporting special operations in Afghanistan. And I think of my own service being the only woman in field artillery units and combat aviation units. And so the case has already been made. MAJ. GENERAL DANA PITTARD, U.S. ARMY (RET.): Our U.S. military was desegregated in 1948. That allowed a lot of people of color talent to get into the military and to excel. My own father was a private in 1950, and he was able to reach the rank of lieutenant colonel in 1970. That would have never happened if the military hadn't desegregated. So there's opportunity there, but what really is, it's bringing the talent of America, whether whatever color you are, whatever gender you are, bring it to the forefront and you go as high as your talent will take you. The ship has sailed decades ago. As far as women in combat, yes, officially, maybe 12 years ago, that certain roles of infantry and armor fire pilots was opened up. But women have been in combat for decades. So that ship has sailed. We're not going back. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

That strongly signals that they were not serious commitments to begin with.(END VIDEOTAPE)",
