He never turns his neck, ever.And so, he just wonders why in that moment when he's going to look at -- he gets a chart that puts up -- also, rarely puts a chart up. It's just -- you know, usually, Trump rallies are all about that relationship between himself and the people that are attending. But he puts -- someone puts a chart up. He turns his head to point to it. Again, something he rarely does if you look at the different speeches that he gives. And in that moment that is when the bullet grazes his ear and he -- and, you know, I saw the blood immediately. And so, he saw that moment as something pivotal -- something powerful that -- not that he was shot but that he had made a decision that he doesn't traditionally make. Even is it really sort of conscious that he's doing something different. So he saw that moment as a way to rethink and regroup. And I also talked about that decision to make sure that he stands up and lets people know he's OK. And he talked about not it just really being about him being OK, but he thought it was really important to project strength. That the country is OK. That he knew he -- he said he was very aware not just of the people that were there but also that the whole world was watching. And he wanted to project that the country is going to be OK.

PAUL BEGALA, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST (via Webex by Cisco):  Well, first actually, let me say Salena is an old friend of mine, too. I've been doing this a long time. And I'm so heartbroken for what she and her daughter went through. And Urban, I know, had a lot of friends there. I've worked a lot in Pennsylvania politics. And David, I know you've had friends who were right there. And my heart and my literal prayers -- I'm a person of faith -- go out to them. It's almost impossible to answer your question, Kate. That someone this well-defined can be redefined. But this country is always open to it. You know, we are a really big-minded country. Mr. Trump has the opportunity now to be both strong and sympathetic. That's kind of not -- the latter half of that is not Trump's brand, OK? He's never been brand unity, OK? Joe Biden is. But he is brand strength. So if he can combine those, that would be really formidable. And I do think even I, as a Democrat -- I can't stand him, OK, but I wish him well and I would love to see him try to redefine himself.
