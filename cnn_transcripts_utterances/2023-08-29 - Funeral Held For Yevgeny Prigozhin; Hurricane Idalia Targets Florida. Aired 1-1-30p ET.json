You can see here the first signs of impact in the U.S. on the coast, folks taking pictures, Idalia's gusty winds whipping up waves at the southernmost point on Key West. A major concern right now is the risk of a dangerous, life-threatening storm surge. Water could rise as much as 15 feet in some areas. Ten Florida counties are now under mandatory evacuation orders. Dozens of school districts, colleges and universities are closed. And with just hours left, Governor Ron DeSantis is suspending tolls along highways, warning residents they are running out of time. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV. RON DESANTIS (R-FL), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  You will start certainly seeing effects of this in different parts of the state later on today. You still have time this morning to be able to make your final preparations. If you are in one of those areas that's in line for some of the major storm surge and you're told to evacuate, you have time to do that, but you got to do that now. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "The biggest risk right now would be landfalling waterspouts, also some pretty big gusts across the Lower Keys.But this is still about 200 miles West of Key West proper. And then along the southwest coast of Florida, some of those storms could actually make some small spins. This happens on the eastern side of any torn -- any hurricane. You could always get a tornado spin up, likely not big ones, just these small EF-0's and 1's. But, right now, the winds are picking up, Sarasota now 20 miles per hour. I was watching some video there out of Key West, and the palm trees are ripping there. So that could be at least 30, 35 right now. The storm itself is 85 miles per hour. It is not gaining strength that rapidly yet. We expect this rapid intensification, up a number of miles per hour over a 24-hour period, sometimes 35 miles per hour over a 24-hour period. But it's the storm surge up here in the Big Bend. Think of this like a catcher's mitt. This is going to catch all of the water. All of the surge that tries to come up along the coast can't go any farther. It's going to be from Apalachicola all the way down to Cedar Key. That's where the biggest threat will be. Now, for you, Tampa, four to seven feet. But that doesn't start until tomorrow morning. There may be even water running out of Tampa Bay for today. But then, by tomorrow morning, all the wind shifts back from the West. And then all of a sudden, you start to push that water back in, so 125-mile-per-hour landfall. When it comes to wind and damage in a big city, Tallahassee, you are in the way, so many big trees, so many things between you and St. Marks. St. Marks is going to get a significant tidal surge, likely 12 to 15 feet in downtown St. Marks. People there just need to be out. [13:05:04] But for you, Tallahassee, even a 90-mile-per-hour wind, which is in the forecast, will bring down so many power lines and so many trees that that's going to be a terrible place to be. If you don't have to be there. Get away and let this thing -- this is going to be a week or two before we put all these power lines back up. Here's the forecast radar. So, you see all of these storms coming onshore here. Every one of those could spin into a small tornado. And then across parts of Georgia into the Carolinas with heavy rain. Jim, I don't know if you knew this, but back before about 2000, more people died because of storm surge per storm than now. Right now, more people die because of flash flooding, because we know to get out of the way of the storm surge, but it's so very hard to get out of the way of the flooding. What would the people do here in Florida? Where would they evacuate? Up here? Well, you know what? There's going to be flooding there. So that's the rub here. Where do you go from here just trying to stay out of the way of all of the hazards, the wind, the tornadoes, the surge and the like? This is a long duration. It's going to probably make landfall sometime after midnight, before 6:00 a.m. tomorrow.",

And, of course, Idalia hit here last night as a tropical storm, and then this morning became a Category 1 hurricane, far less powerful than what Floridians are facing, but it caused flooding all across the western part of Cuba. Here in Havana, we have had heavy rain throughout the morning. It's mostly cleared now. And the Cuban government says they are beginning the process of seeing who has been affected, seeing what communities are still cut off, beginning, of course, the arduous process, the long process of restoring power. You have tens of thousands of people to the west of where I am who are going to be without power. Brianna, these are still the same people who are recovering from Hurricane Ian last year. So this is a hard-hit region, already people very much impacted by last year's devastating storm. And this certainly won't help, but not as nearly as powerful as a storm as what Florida is going to face in the coming hours, but quite an impact left here all the same.",

What that allows us to do, Jim, is not only do we have great men and women that work for the City of Tallahassee Electric -- and we are the largest utility provider in the Big Bend area -- but it's going to allow us to double our force so that, when we talk about restoration after the storm, having that type of manpower is crucial.
