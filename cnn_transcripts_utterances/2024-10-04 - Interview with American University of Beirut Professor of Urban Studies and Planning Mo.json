And a very warm welcome to the program, everyone. I'm Paula Newton in New York, sitting in for Christiane Amanpour. Lebanon has become a place of fear and chaos as Israel continues to escalate in the south and in Beirut. The latest strikes, according to an Israeli official, targeting a potential successor to Hezbollah's slain leader, Hassan Nasrallah. And Hezbollah is answering by sending projectiles into Israel, though with no casualties reported at this point. Now, within Lebanon, about a million people have already fled their homes, and desperation is reaching such a fever pitch that some people are crossing into Syria. All this as the world awaits Israel's response to Iran's strikes on Tuesday and any further escalation. Now, for those in Lebanon, it is, of course, a terrifying and uncertain time, and unfortunately, one that is all too real. To understand what life is like right now, we want to go straight to Mona Fawaz. She is a professor at the American University of Beirut. And we thank you for giving your insights as you continue to live this out hour by hour. The escalation of the war in the last couple of weeks has been, of course, devastating. I mean, think about this, it is the most intense aerial campaign outside of Gaza for two decades. So, a logical question is, how is everyone coping? I mean, what does every day look like right now?",

You know, you have been through tough times. You grew up during Beirut's civil war. In an opinion piece in August, you actually mentioned that then you had this aching sense of silence, signaling in your words a readiness for the next round of violence. Now, in recent months, of course, that violence, probably even you would tell me in recent days, it seeped back into everyday lives. What similarities do you see in the escalation? And do you think, though, that this is going to be a watershed, something that no one could have imagined would happen in 2024?",

I mean, this is acombination of what Israel called in 2006 the Dahiya doctrine, which is the doctrine in which they flatten neighborhoods and destroy people's lives so that people get upset with Hezbollah and basically, they undermine the party's control. And it's on top of this, the Gaza playbook. And that's not my words. This is the recognition of the head of the U.N. population fund today and many other responsible international figures that are pointing to this. It is basically a state that has gone rogue and that is -- has a belligerent posture and it's emboldened because it has the support. And so, yes, that silence is a silence of deep fear. And I mean, honestly, we've never had a day of peace since the State of Israel came to this region. I, as someone who has lived here, have never had a day of peace because we have that sense that the war can erupt at any point and that belligerence can come your way.

You know, I looked at your social media feed in a great way. You've been highlighting social media, the grassroots volunteers there every hour that continue to do the most -- to help the most vulnerable, but that is in the absence of so much government work that needs to happen. This week, the Lebanese foreign minister was asked on this show about the power and presence of his government. His response, the decision of war was not ours to take.

It's -- I mean, there are so many ways in which can -- someone can imagine that people from this region can live together as equal. But the problem is we have an ethnonationalist bully that basically does not want and has not wanted for one day to live with its neighbors in peace. So, this means that, basically, we don't choose war and peace. That doesn't forgive the Lebanese government, of course, from -- and not this government, but all the successive governments since the end of the civil war from having continued a policy of neglecting all the aspects of building state institutions. Of course, we are still to date run by warlords and their allies who bankrupted the country. So, I will not forgive them. I have actually tried all my life to be an activist and build an alternative.

More than 200 people now have been killed in this historic storm. Hundreds, though, think about that, still unaccounted for right across the states. People feel that no matter where they are, they are not indeed safe from the ravages of extreme weather and climate change. Now, a quick reminder, all the science says this is now the baseline. So, while efforts to reduce carbon, carbon emissions ramp up, all of those efforts we've been outlining on this program, so too must efforts to adapt infrastructure meet up this new reality and this new moment. Joining me now to talk about all of this is Leah Stokes. She's a climate policy expert at the University of California, Santa Barbara and Bob Inglis, a former Republican congressman from South Carolina, one of the states, in fact, that has also been hit by this historic storm. I do want to get to this storm that has just thrown everyone in the United States, even those who felt they were prepared.

You've done a bit of a mea culpa on this andyet have been working for years now to convince people that these matters. When you looked at the effects of the storm over the last week, did you think that this could, in fact, perhaps affect the U.S. presidential election? Maybe a more important question is, do you believe it should? FMR. REP. BOB INGLIS (R-SC):  I think the, you know, experience is an effective teacher. It's often a very harsh teacher. And so, we're being taught very harshly about climate change. But it has a way of getting through and it could well have an impact on the election. You know, I live in Upstate South Carolina. I'm joining you now from Utah at John Curtis Conservative Climate Summit, but there's no power at my house. I've got two daughters that live in Asheville, North Carolina. So, they had to de-camp to our house in South Carolina, but they're -- I've got a son-in-law that's going up today, again, yesterday. He was up there in a bucket brigade to dip water out of swimming pools, to take to the public housing complex to flush toilets. They were able to flush about 600 toilets yesterday. My daughter is up there handing out food in one of the very ravaged communities. These places are absolutely devastated. And so, to call it a hoax, that shouldn't go down very well right now in Western North Carolina, because I think everybody there realizes this storm came over very hot water in the Gulf of Mexico, gathered up in its clouds a great deal of moisture. And then, because of that warm water in the Gulf, accelerated toward Florida, hit there, but then carried that water way inland to a place like Asheville, North Carolina, and then dumped it. And so, I think the sense of vulnerability is real right now, across the southeast and especially in places like Western North Carolina.",

That is happening from Republican governors in South Carolina and Georgia and Democratic governors in North Carolina. And so, you know, this something that we can see bipartisan cooperation over. And I think that's so important because some people are taking this devastating disaster -- and my heart really goes out to Bob Inglis who is a wonderful person, and I feel badly for his family. And I really value that he is a Republican out there speaking about the links between climate change and a disaster like Hurricane Helene. You know, we have good people in the Republican Party willing to speak up. But the fact is that Donald Trump is not one of them. Donald Trump is saying that climate change is a scam in the wake of this disaster. He is saying that climate change is a hoax. He is saying things like these people will just be OK. And I want to remind people that there was reporting just yesterday that Donald Trump, when there were wildfires in California, withheld federal aid to people suffering from a climate disaster because he didn't think they were voting for him enough. And it was only when somebody showed him that actually there were lots of Republicans in Orange County, California, that he decided that they should send federal aid.

I'm telling you, the world is actually engaged with Taliban day and night, if I'm not mistaken, the figures, maybe around 10,000 meetings with the Taliban, not Americans, all the International Community.

Because now they have created 15,000 madrasas across Afghanistan. They have recruited 100,000 madrasa teachers. The question is where do they get that money? If woman in Afghanistan, dignified woman, having PhD and master degree, is after $20 to feed her children because she lost her husband in the war. It's heart wrenching for me, Christiane, to speak about all of this after 25 years. I get emotional. Because how long and for why we have to be sacrifice of all of this? And in five years' time, we will lose the whole generation to radicalization that embraces suicide bombing.",

And the question was, you know, how do we make sense of that behavior? Was this evidence of some kind of fundamental failing of the medical profession? And when you look closely at how Purdue fomented the spread of OxyContin, you realize they weren't relying on a flaw in the medical profession, they weren't even relying on the efforts of the majority of doctors. What they were doing was exploiting a very, very tiny number of highly problematic, highly susceptible doctors who they realized that they only needed a couple thousand doctors to start a national epidemic around OxyContin. In other words, one doctor who -- there were doctors -- one doctor who could be convinced to prescribe thousands and thousands of pills of OxyContin was sufficient. You didn't need to convince 100 to prescribe it 10 times, right? Then it was this exact same principle that drove the COVID pandemic, it was being driven by this very -- a small core. And if you want to understand why the OxyContin spread as quickly as it did, you have to understand the behaviors of a very selective group of doctors who were deliberately targeted by Purdue.",

These are not problems that rose slowly and steadily over time, they exploded at a certain critical moment in exactly the way that nonlinear phenomenon like epidemics do. Secondly, there is this dynamic of asymmetry, which is a powerful indicator of epidemics, that small numbers of people were moving them forward. But there's also -- there is a contagious element in both. You know, in one case, it's contagion that we understand biological contagion, but with OxyContin, there was a behavioral contagion that this was something that spread within communities where there was, you know, the exposure to someone who was an OxyContin user dramatically increased your chance of becoming an OxyContin user yourself.

So, if I had -- if I was to wave a magic wand and redo American immigration policies from scratch, what I would rather have seen, rather than have these surges followed by backlashes, followed by surges, followed by backlashes, a smarter thing to do would be to have a steady state at somewhere below what we believe to be the tipping point for a kind of -- for social unrest. So, never have -- and then what -- so you would -- so you could sort of avoid -- you could engineer your way out of these very socially unproductive and problematic backlashes. Because, very often, the backlash what's going on right now with, you know, Haitians in Springfield, it's just appalling. I mean, people who come to this country or working, who are here legally, who have revived the community. But -- so, backlashes are things that we desperately need to figure out ways to avoid. And I think something, you know, lowering the -- be careful not to exceed the kind of public threshold for -- is it -- would be a very wise strategy. That being said, you know, I'm a Canadian. Canada has been a country that, over the last 30 years, has quite happily, until very recently, sustained a much higher level of annual immigration than many other western nations. So, I wonder -- I would couple that advice with saying, it would be useful to go to countries like Canada and Australia and find out why they have managed to do maintain higher levels of immigration without that kind of public backlash. That's a very -- I've -- the Canada puzzle, as someone who grew up there and was an immigrant to Canada, myself, has always fascinated me. Canada takes way more refugees, and the public support for taking refugees is much higher than almost anywhere else. It's really a -- that has something to do with the story Canadians tell themselves about who they are, that that story includes a kind of -- that that they're a -- you know, a big empty country that wants to be filled up with people from around the world, like that's a very powerful story that's been told for 250 years in Canada, and how they've kept that story alive would be a very interesting thing to investigate.",
