I will show you those as we move through the course of the program. There's lots for us to talk about as we start a new week together. The former President Donald Trump is in New York court. He is defending himself on civil fraud charges. EU Foreign ministers are in Kyiv. It's a show of European solidarity, amid concerns of flagging support for the war effort. A Nobel Prize in medicine, two scientists for their work on mRNA vaccine that's used against COVID-19. Live in London, last day here in the UK, it is Monday. It's October the 2nd. I'm Richard Quest and as we start a new week, I mean business. A good day to you. The former President Donald Trump is in a New York courtroom. It's the start of his civil fraud trial that's at the heart of his business empire. Before entering the court, Mr. Trump denounced the proceedings. He attacked the New York attorney general, Letitia James, and claimed he was the victim of what he called the single greatest witch hunt of all time, (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Now, it remains to be seen whether they lose control of their properties. The State's attorney general is seeking $250 million in penalties. Elie Honig is our senior legal analyst. He's a former federal and state prosecutor. He knows a good bit of fraud when he sees it in the back mirror. Elie, look, I don't understand. Just help me on one simple point.

Last week, the judge even before the trial, gave the attorney general what's called summary judgment, meaning I find in favor of the attorney general against Donald Trump on count one, one of the seven, the most important of the seven claims, which charges repetitive, persistent fraud. The judge found Donald Trump committed massive fraud over many, many years. There are still six other claims remaining. Now at bottom, they do relate to fraud, but there are different technical legal requirements that go to those six that could make it more difficult to prove them. For example, you'll have to show a higher level of intent as to Donald Trump, and you may have to show what we call materiality, meaning there actually was some victim and some loss. Neither of those are required for count one, which is why the judge already has ruled in favor of the AG on count one, but the other six remain in play.",

He attacked the attorney general of New York as racist, providing no evidence for those charges. But as you know, Richard, those are frequent charges from this president whenever he gets on the wrong side of the law here. So the question is, how much this damages him in the GOP primary for now? Right now, none of these cases have done so. Right? And there are four of them going on, including, you know, the federal cases that deal with his attempts to overturn the election and mishandling of classified documents.

When the EU has had to sort of control him or bring him slightly more in line with other European countries, they have been able to do that by virtue of funds that would be stopped going to Hungary. So there are tools at the EU's disposal, you know, I think perhaps the biggest worry at the EU level is what happens in US politics, because the US is often the glue, the bigger glue that binds everyone together and keeps everyone sort of marching in the same direction. Poland, for example, another populist prime minister there, they just signed a $2 billion deal to modernize their military with the help of US funding. So you know, money speaks.

Two researchers who work led to groundbreaking COVID vaccines have won this year's Nobel Prize in Medicine. Katalin Kariko and Drew Weissman are both professors at the University of Pennsylvania. It was their studies on messenger RNA that helped usher in a medical revolution. According to the committee, the laureates contributed to the unprecedented rate of vaccine development, showing one of the greatest threats to human health in modern times. Jacqueline Howard is with me. I think besides obviously, the extremely well-deserved nature of this. I think it's the speed, isn't it? Normally, it can be decades after your work for -- on research and your findings before Nobel comes up with a -- with a prize. But this has been a matter of a couple of years.",
