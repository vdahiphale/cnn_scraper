No Labor Day holiday for the U.S. presidential hopefuls. Donald Trump says he'll vote against a Florida abortion rights measure. While Kamala Harris' CNN interview comes under the spotlight. A humanitarian pause in Gaza for a massive health drive. 640,000 children to be vaccinated against polio to prevent an outbreak of the killer disease. We'll have a live report from Jerusalem. And the social media platform X suspended in Brazil, a judge makes the order following a legal row with Elon Musk. We'll explain. And what would you do, anger in China after passengers go to extreme measures to silence a crying toddler on a plane. Just one of the many problems facing stressed out parents. That conversation coming up. But we begin here in the U.S. In the past couple of hours, Donald Trump has been speaking to voters in the battleground State of Pennsylvania. It's an issue in Florida that's actually making headlines, abortion rights. The Republican candidate on Thursday said a six-week abortion ban in the state was too short. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT AND REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  Well, I think the six-week is too short. It has to be more time.

It's all about demeaning them. It's all about cutting them down because he doesn't know how to run against a strong, accomplished, smart woman who happens to be a woman of color, a Black woman, of Asian descent, daughter of immigrants. It's like the biggest nightmare for Donald Trump is Kamala Harris. And so, she doesn't need to go there. She doesn't need to demean herself and lower herself to his level. She will let other supporters, other allies, point out exactly what I'm pointing out right now, which is that he is a racist, he is a misogynist, he is a xenophobe, he's a sexist, and he doesn't deserve to have the presidency for another four years. And what Kamala Harris said last night as well, which I thought was also brilliant and spot on, is that this is a country that focuses on optimism, that the leaders of this country, the mark of a true leader, is how much we can lift each other up, not tear each other down. And we know that every time that Donald Trump opens his mouth and J. D. Vance now as well, he tears people down, and specifically they tear women down. They tear women of color down. And I think it's going to backfire for them. It has already been backfiring. It's going to continue to backfire for them in November.",

His comments were quite confusing. His campaign had later clarified and Donald Trump himself just moments ago saying that he would, in fact, vote against that ballot referendum, which would keep in place a six-week ban in the State of Florida. That's one of the most restrictive bans in the country. And Donald Trump has been largely critical of that six-week ban, going back to the primary race, he ran against Florida's governor Ron DeSantis, but in spite of that, he is going to vote against a referendum that would expand access to as much as 24 weeks into a presidency. Of course, Donald Trump has been changing his position on abortion going through all the way back to his early days in politics. He has been on nearly every side of the abortion debate whenever it's been sort of politically expedient for him. Over the summer, we counted about 15 times where Donald Trump had changed his position on abortion over the years. And I guess now we have number 16.",

Vance voted against that measure. So, there's still a lot of devils in the details, but clearly making a play for women's votes here on an issue that is very much a concern of many in the post Roe aftermath in the United States. As for Moms for Liberty, this is a group that has been very influential in starting these sort of culture wars in the U.S. over K through 12 education. They have been instrumental in pushing Florida, for example, to remove certain books from schools, to get LGBTQ topics out of the classroom, to ban certain conversations about race, like critical race theory, and Donald Trump's agenda is very much aligned with them. So, this is a friendly audience that he is speaking of.

But what we do know is the IDF is claiming that it's killed 20 people now in this operation overall. It does now seem to be focused on Jenin. The IDF is saying that today three of those people it killed were Hamas fighters, one of them they say it was a senior commander in the area. All the 20 they say who have died they say were terrorists. Ministry of Health officials in the West Bank, though, say yes, 20 people have died, but they would count some of them as civilians. And certainly, civilians have been injured. And the governor, the local council governor in Jenin has been appealing for a pause in this military operation so that civilians can get out to get food, to get medicine or even, in some cases, take shelter. And we were looking at a video posted by some journalists this evening showing what appeared to be families with small children escaping through sort of rough woodland and hillside to get out of Jenin to get some safety, and that was in the east of Jenin. So, this does appear to be an ongoing military operation. The end sort of bounds of it, if you will. We don't know when they're going to come. But the IDF has been very clear that it has found bomb making equipment, they say that they've targeted terrorists, targeted and killed terrorists, and they've also detained almost 20 people, they say, are connected to terrorism.",

The reaction from Elon Musk in the last couple of hours has been swift. We knew this was coming because the Supreme Court justice, Alexandre de Moraes, had given X a 24-hour ultimatum, ordering them to name a legal representative. X had already announced that they would not comply with his order. And so, when the suspension order arrived, this is what Musk said on X, or formerly known as Twitter, the oppressive regime in Brazil is so afraid of the people learning the truth that they will bankrupt anyone who tries. That is, of course, if you think that everything that goes on Twitter or X is the truth. And what Musk is referring to in that posting on his social media is that there is a clause in the suspension order issued today that goes after individual users who might access Twitter or X via a VPN. That is a virtual private network, is how you can stream the internet, surf the net from a different location where you are. So, if you, for example, leave in a country like Brazil that enforces such an order, you could still access X by using a VPN and coming up from a different country. Well, if Brazilian authorities catches you, Lynda, surfing the internet via VPN to access X or Twitter, they could find you up to 50,000 reals per day. That is just less than $9,000 per day. Now, it's very hard to imagine how Brazilian authorities would enforce this order. But at the same time, catching anyone and slamming on them, the -- a nine grand of a fine gives you the idea of how serious this situation is in Brazil for 40 million people who access it every single day.

The pressure on their ears can cause pain, especially if they've got an ear infection. What's your advice for families traveling with young kids?",

      "sentences": "Yes. So, I think there are a few things that we can do. You know, there's no guarantees, and I too am a mom of three, so we'veexperienced it as parents. But there are some things that we can do. And one of them is choose your flight as wisely as possible. Meaning, you know, every child is different and especially, if you have multiple children, but if you know mornings are better, they are more engaged, they are happier then as opposed to afternoons when they get a little cranky. So, every situation is going to be different in terms of what flight you choose, but pick a good seat if you can. So, the closer up front you can sit the better because easy in, easy out. And I'm not talking about first class. I'm just talking about maybe logging on early to try and get a better seat. And of course, you can board early. But it's really not necessary to get on that plane and start apologizing to everyone. You know, we as humans hopefully understand and we feel some compassion. And, you know, there are people who like to give out goody bags and ear plugs. And all of that is great, but it costs money. Not everybody has that. So, I think for parents, it's important to be kind to yourself and understand that you might have to ask for help. You might be drinking juice and you might have to use your neighbor's tray table, if they don't mind while you're holding your baby. So -- and I think that it's important to keep them busy, you know, give them a little -- if they're old enough to understand, bring a little backpack with all new activities, you know, new little -- things that are going to keep their attention. Plus, I think it's important to talk to your child, you know, coddle your child, coo with your child. You know, this is what we do naturally. But what I'm saying is to just give yourself some grace because truly, this was an exception and we do know that there are other passengers that roll their eyes when moms and dads walk by. But I say, let's not do that. Let's try and smile and understand as these parents walk by with their toddler and their baby in tow.",

The U.S. surgeon general just declared parental stress a critical public health issue. And I just want to bring up a graphic, a statement from the report. He wrote, mothers and fathers now work many more hours than in 1985, but also spend many more hours every week on primary childcare, and that doesn't count their total time with -- spent with their children. Demands from both work and childcare giving have come at the cost of quality time with one's partner, sleep, and parental leisure time. Now, we know in the case of this one-year-old child who was traveling with the grandparents, they landed in Shanghai. The dad was there when they landed and apparently quite stressed, as you would imagine. Surely, these days parents need to give themselves some grace as well, right?",

You know, if somebody asks you to change -- to trade seats with them, if you want to, that's fine, but it's not necessary. I think that it's just important to be respectful to each other. You know, wait your line when you're -- wait your turn when you're deplaning. So, don't push forward and try and get out just because you don't have any bags, make sure that your bin space is close to where you're sitting when possible, so you're not taking up some other person's space, then they have to go backwards.
