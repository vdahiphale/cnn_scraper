Saying that she may have some issues with their policies but does not believe that it's a racist state per se. And suggesting that her words came across incorrectly.That came as we saw some prominent Democrats come out to rebuke those comments. And in a rare statement from Democratic leaders criticizing one of their own, Hakeem Jeffries and his fellow leadership -- members of his leadership team came out and said that Israel is not a racist state. And said that the -- they welcome the Israeli President Isaac Herzog's entrance to the United States and his decision to speak to a joint meeting of Congress on Wednesday. But in talking to Jayapal herself on Friday before she made these comments this weekend, she made clear that she did not agree with the decision of Speaker McCarthy to invite Israeli President Herzog to come to Capitol Hill. And she offered this criticism of the Israeli government. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. PRAMILA JAYAPAL (D-WA): The violence settled -- settler violence that's happening in Israel and the West Bank. The annexation of settlements that have been happening over the last several years. Netanyahu's collaboration with extreme right elements of Israel. And the fact that we are getting further and further away from the ability to actually legitimately talk about a two-state solution, with security for -- and self-determination for both the Palestinian people and the Israeli people.",

And this keeps happening over and over again. This is really a heat story as well because like United CEO Scott Kirby said it's thermodynamics 101. When the hot air rises, it turns into thunderstorms, and then that comes raining down on these major hubs. New York hit especially hard yesterday. Newark, a big hub for United Airlines, JFK, LaGuardia, there are ground stops there for a good portion of the day. And then Boston all the way down to DC. So, we're really not totally out of the woods just yet. Today is kind of the recovery day for airlines and a lot of passengers who are displaced by this, you know, some are waiting in these really long customer service lines to try and find another flight. I just heard from somebody coming on an international flight from Europe and they were not able to -- their flight initially got delayed. And they were not able -- other passengers weren't able to find a flight until -- a connecting flight until Wednesday.

And he's also not ruled out pursuing a potential independent White House bid in 2024.And that is really why Democrats are so concerned. They're really worried about the potential of a third-party candidate drawing support away from President Joe Biden. And tipping the scales potentially in favor of former President Donald Trump or another Republican nominee. Now, Manchin will appear later today alongside former Utah Governor John Huntsman. He's a Republican and someone that Manchin considers a friend. And Manchin will also be in the room with other people he thinks are friends. He's been associated with this group, No Labels, for years now. He's a former honorary co-chair of the group. And he really believes in their overall message of bipartisanship as well as their idea of putting forth a potential Senate or centrist candidate. Now, I should also point out, Kate, some of their -- Manchin's motivations here, I mean, one, he could raise a lot of money from doing this event. Particularly if donors think that there's a chance that he could run for president. He also will get a lot of attention from this. And we know that that's something that Manchin really enjoys. And he can use both of those things to fuel a reelection bid next year. And lastly, Manchin uses the word bipartisanship as a noun, an adjective, and a verb. And being the bipartisan guy in West Virginia is a good thing for him. And so really for Manchin, there's a lot of upside to this event not a lot of downside.
