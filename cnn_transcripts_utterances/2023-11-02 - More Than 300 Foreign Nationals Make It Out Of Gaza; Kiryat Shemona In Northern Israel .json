Rockets have been fired in that area. Hamas is taking responsibility for this. Jim, you are there on the ground for us. I know you've just witnessed the shelling yourself. Tell us about what you saw. JIM SCIUTTO, CNN CHIEF U.S. SECURITY ANALYST:  Yeah, this is definitely the most intense period of rocket fire from southern Lebanon since the start of this war on October 7th. We're hearing of dozens of rockets coming in. Most of them landing off target but that one in Kiryat Shmona hit a very busy traveled street there. A lot of these communities are under mandatory evacuation including Kiryat Shmona, although that hit near an area where Israeli soldiers congregate. And that's, of course, the concern. There is still a lot of people around up here. And this pace of rocket fire, something that had not been seen, so far. My team and I, we were coming back from the Israel -- the Golan Heights between Israel and Syria when we heard two big booms, one after the other. We looked out the window and can see -- this was the iron dome missile defense -- rocket defense engaging. And it took out two of the rockets. You could see the plumes in the sky as it happens. And then you heard more and more coming in. Again, the most intense period of rocket fire coming in from southern Lebanon in these last couple of weeks. And of course, Bianna, the concern had been, if and when Hezbollah and other fighters based in southern Lebanon would step up their attacks from the north on Israel and this is definitely an uptick. Whether this signals a larger participation by those Iranian proxies in Hezbollah in Lebanon rather in this war we don't know. But a great deal of attention and anticipation focused on tomorrow when the leader of Hezbollah -- Nasrallah, is going to give a highly anticipated public speech, his first public speech since the October 7th attacks, could he announce greater involvement from Lebanon? We'll be watching very closely. But tonight, something of a calling card, perhaps.

Those criticisms echoed by the Israeli Foreign Minister last week at a high-level U.N.meeting who said, and I quote him here, Qatar, which finances and harbors Hamas' leaders, he said, could influence and enable the immediate and unconditional release of all of the hostages held by the terrorists. He said of the international community should demand Qatar do just that. Well, I put that criticism to the adviser, to the Qatar Prime Minister a couple of days ago, and they really knock that back. They say these are provocative statements which they say really endanger lives. And they also point out that the Israeli National Security Adviser last week described Qatar's diplomatic efforts as crucial at this time. On the hostages, thew window is still open. I'm told by sources, talks are currently still ongoing. They say, albeit, and they've said this now for five or six days, these talks have been made more difficult. And this is from diplomatic sources who are heavily involved in what is going on in these talks. They say they've been made more difficult since the Israeli escalation on the ground. Of course, we are now very clear from the Israeli side who have argued that it is only by increasing the pressure on Hamas to free on Hamas that they will get these hostages free. So, you know that pressure is there, the criticism is out there. The bottom line is that Qatar is a key ally for Washington in this region. It has also kept back channel contacts with Israel. The head of the Israeli intelligence unit was here in Qatar according to sources just over the weekend. And of course, it keeps that relationship with Hamas open. But if that is to become a liability for Qatar, then I think, you know, there will be serious questions being asked here locally. Antony Blinken and the Qatar Emir last week announced that they had agreed to review the Hamas file once the hostages are released. Bianna, it is not clear what that means in terms of a future for Hamas leadership hosted here. But those conversations are clearly being had. Bianna.",

They want to see oversight. They want to see the accountability. They want to see an investigation into the corruption which has already been leaked out of Zelenskyy's administration. And so, for others, they see where the Iron Dome is necessary to preserve and protect humanitarian lives. And so, I think the right thing to do is not to try and continue to tether aid packages together to be able to vote on them separately and I support Speaker Johnson's decision to do this.

But I also think that we need to be very cognizant of the fact that places like TikTok and other social media has continued to drive this social and cultural revolution in our youth by poisoning and utilizing academia, as well. And so, it is unsafe for people to continue to be able to think that they can threaten others. We just saw this at Cornell University. We just saw this at NYU, where there are students who are literally in fear of their lives. We live in America where you should be safe to walk on the streets. You should be safe to, you know, believe in pluralism and our idea of being able to worship in any faith, and that was covered in our constitution. But I support one of the things that Marco Rubio said. If these individuals who are pro-Hamas, who are actually putting the risk in lives of Americans to make them feel in jeopardy, and they're on a visa, and they're not American citizens, I think we should revoke their actual visa and deport them back to their home.

Just to address this issue that we're seeing on college campuses specifically, and then we can speak to the global spread and rise of anti-Semitism, what do you make of Cornell University canceling classes tomorrow?

I'm not saying that it's the wrong decision. There is a lot of stress at Cornell after these really terrible threats that left the student, the Jewish student community, very much on edge, the community as a whole very much on edge. So, there's a lot of stress. I understand that. And so, perhaps this is warranted. But the response that has to come is some moral clarity on campuses and the recognition that what we're seeing now is related to Hamas' attack on October 7th. It's an unwillingness to simply call out that terror that's resulted in the slaughter of 1400 men, women, and children, and thousands injured, and hundreds taken hostage, and so many Americans among the dead and the wounded and the hostages. That's what's necessary. And as long as universities are willing to tolerate the kinds of things that we've heard on too many campuses of people praising what happened on October 7th as some sort of military action that was exhilarating, that brought great joy to the communities, that we're going to continue to see these kinds of threats and worse. So, we need university presidents, we need university leaders, just as we need corporate leaders to speak out clearly about what's happening and to condemn anti-Semitism that has resulted in the kinds of threats that we saw at Cornell.",

But until we see the kind of leadership that weneed from government leaders, from university leaders, from business leaders that set a tone that says that anti-Semitic rhetoric is simply unacceptable. On university campuses, it violates the codes of conduct. And if people violate those codes of conduct, then there should be consequences. And when the violations are serious, they should be expelled. This isn't about free speech. This is about setting a tone for a campus, for a business, and for the country that says, this is just unacceptable. There are people walking around in cities across America, tearing down the posters of people who are being held hostage by Hamas in tunnels, babies, kids, women. Think about that. Think about the fact that if people were walking down the street, as happens routinely, and they see an image, they see someone who posted an image of their pet that is missing, they would stop, they would take it in, they would feel bad. But somehow, we've reached the point where people walk down the street and see the faces of hostages being held by terrorists and tear them down as some sort of statement. That's what we have to combat. We need to be proud Jews. That is what I believe, it's what AJC believes, but we also have to be vigilant and we have to expect leadership across our country and across the world.",
