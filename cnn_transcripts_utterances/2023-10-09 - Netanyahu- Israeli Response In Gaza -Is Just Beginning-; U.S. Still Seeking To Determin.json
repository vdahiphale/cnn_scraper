      "sentences": "I'm Anderson Cooper live from Tel Aviv alongside Boris Sanchez and Alex Marquardt in Washington, D.C.Buildings in Gaza in flames tonight as Israel's military air assault on Hamas continues through the night. Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, says this is just the beginning, speaking just moments ago, just the beginning of his country's response. The quickly escalating war between Israel and Hamas began, as you know, Saturday around 6.30 AM with that surprise Hamas terror offensive that left hundreds of civilians slaughtered, dead. Just last hour, we learned volunteers in southern Israel collected more than 100 bodies from that massacre. Hamas claims to have taken more than 100 hostages. Islamic Jihad says they have taken 30. Now Hamas warns they will start killing them if Israel strikes Gaza without warning. I want to go back on the ground with CNN's Nic Robertson, who is, I believe, still around Sderot. Nic, talk about what you are seeing there this evening.",

      "sentences": "Yes. We've heard the fighter jets in the sky. We haven't heard any major, massive explosions coming from Gaza for a little while. There haven't been any incoming artillery shells fired by - rather, there hasn't been any incoming rocket fire from Hamas into this area in the past hour or so. So in that way, it's been quiet.But I think one thing that we're picking up on in that slightly quieter state that it is, is outgoing artillery fire. We've seen howitzer weapons being deployed around here by the IDF. We've seen some of the sort of mechanized, very big howitzer guns that can fire a long distance. And we know from previous standoffs and situations with Hamas that this is the sort of area where the Israeli Defense Forces put - have emplacements of howitzers and they'll use those howitzers to fire artillery shells, which can be very precise onto precision Hamas targets within Gaza. We can hear the outgoing shells and very faintly hear some thuds detonating at the other end. Now, the Israeli, the IDF is not saying that it's using howitzers at the moment, but they have done in the past, been very open about it, standard warfare procedure. So it appears that potentially as well as alongside the fighter jets with those precision airdrop munitions, there's a possibility that the - a lighter weapon is also being used at the moment, the artillery shells, to target Hamas, to target their firing positions. That would be very much in keeping with what Israel's done before and very much in keeping of it now, sort of getting a footprint on the ground here, getting a forward momentum in keeping what the prime minister is talking about here, which is building up and putting pressure on Hamas, the military hardware we've seen coming in place over the past 24 hours plus now in place, it seems, some of it, and is being used to target Hamas in Gaza, Anderson.",

We're re-listening to his comments just to make sure of that. But so far, it seems like he was talking in generalities. What are you seeing on the ground?",

That's one of the major crossing points that they used, this humanitarian - so- called humanitarian crossing point they used to attack.

I have never seen anything on the level of what we've been seeing going into the Gaza Strip over the last 24 hours - 2 million people there. Of course, the vast majority of them are civilians.Tonight, there is no food going in, no fuel going in, no electricity. It is dark. It is quieter right now. But it has been a horrendous day. The latest death toll that we're hearing is that 560 Palestinians have been killed, and I think there is an anticipation that that number is only going to get much higher as the coming days unfold and it's unclear for those civilians who are trapped there where they can go, what they can do, how they can protect themselves, Anderson.",

It goes towards the Gaza border fence and we just saw another large military convoy come down the highway and then take that left-hand turn down there towards Gaza. It doesn't mean that they're going in, but what you could see very clearly about that convoy, it was loaded up with boxes and supplies under tarpaulins, the troops in their combat vehicles as well. They had a lot of supplies lashed on the back. There was - without giving away too many military details here of what we're seeing unfolding in front of our eyes, this was a unit that was going in with everything they needed from food to fuel, to troops, to weapons, to go in and stay somewhere and maintain a presence there for an extended period of time. And as I say, that road that they took, it goes only one place towards the Gaza border fence, indicative of just more forces being deployed ready to help secure the border or for any other potential mission that might come their way, such as an incursion, Anderson?",

In terms of a - of the Israeli operation inside Gaza, what should Israeli forces expect if there was to be a ground incursion?

It was really more of a terrorist attack. But what the IDF will bring to the battlefield will be shock effect. They'll bring tanks. They'll bring deception. They'll bring things that, once they isolate targets, they will be killed very quickly.I think right now, again, their ground forces are staying out as the Special Forces are making sure that they've got any chance of capturing hostages from intel that they know. I think you're going to see a lot of stories come out of the rescue of some of those hostages by some very brave Israeli forces that are going to go in quickly in the night, middle of the night right now and rescue them, and then try to do that, because it's so close to when those kidnappings took place.",

I know there's, right now, projecting 10s of thousands, it might even be low, it could be hundreds of thousands. There's going to be significant collateral damage. Hamas is making a bet that the Israeli government and the IDF won't be able to get away with that as they try to show that on social media. But again, just when the Prime Minister said, they're not going to stop, they're just going to do whatever they can.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK) [15:18:39] COOPER: There are certainly a lot of questions and concerns about whether Iran had anything to do with Hamas' terror attack on Israel in terms of planning and funding and coordination. U.S. Intelligence officials are actively trying to determine exactly what, if any, role Iran played. Iran obviously backs Hamas and is right behind Islam Jihad as well, which operates in Gaza. Iran's president called the attack a victory. Its foreign ministry claims that Iran was - that any claims that Iran are involved are \"accusations\" made for what they call political motives. Susan Glasser is a staff writer with The New Yorker. She joins me now. She just penned a piece about National Security Adviser, Jake Sullivan, taking on another crisis entitled \"Jake Sullivan's Trial by Combat Inside the White House's battle to keep Ukraine in the fight.\" Susan, I appreciate you being with us. Can you just talk about - I mean, obviously Iran is a major backer of Islamic Jihad and Hamas. What do you think about the possibilities of a direct link between Iran and the Hamas attacks?",

There's a certain pattern to these things. It's usually an exchange of rocket fire between Israeli forces and Hamas forces in Gaza. Everybody seems to say this is going to be different. What do you think this looks like moving forward? I mean, there's a lot of unknowns, obviously. Does Hezbollah get more involved? What sort of incursion does take place in Gaza? And also, what the international response to it as people around the world watch Gaza City without electricity being pummeled? GLASSERBut right now, I think we can already say that this is going to be different than the previous exchanges of rocket fire and retaliation. That cycle has been broken by a dramatic terrorist attack. So I think that we are looking at what the Israeli government has already called a full-scale war. That's not a term that they have used in the previous rounds of this and I think that we're at a rupture point.",

Is it possible for them to really effect - if the elimination of Hamas as a fighting force, as a threat to Israel, is the goal as stated by the Israeli government, can you do that without being on the ground in Gaza?Yes. I mean, right now, it seems like people are almost expecting and bracing for a full-scale ground conflict in addition to the exchanges of missiles and rocket fire that we're seeing, that an air operation alone might not be sufficient. The question is if and when Israel regains physical control over Gaza, what then? Remember, Israel's already occupied Gaza and didn't want to have anything more to do with that. Hamas has been, such as it is, the governing authority in Gaza. If that is not sustainable, then what authority will there be there? I just - I think we're facing a world of pain and unknown consequences from this. But it's hard to see how Israel avoids some form of ground offensive.",
