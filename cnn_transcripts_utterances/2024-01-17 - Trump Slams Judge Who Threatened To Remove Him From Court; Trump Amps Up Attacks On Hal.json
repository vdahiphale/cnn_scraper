Jean Carroll's defamation damages trial against Trump and why the former president was nearly given the boot.Also tonight, Trump is escalating his attacks on GOP presidential rival Nikki Haley, referring to her birth name and Indian heritage in an online rant. Trump returning to his racially charged playbook with the critical New Hampshire primary now just six days away. And there's more breaking news. President Biden has wrapped up an urgent meeting with top lawmakers. Did they find any common ground on the divisive issues of Ukraine and border security? I'll ask a key player who was in the room, the House minority leader, Hakeem Jeffries. Welcome to our viewers here in the United States and around the world. I'm Wolf Blitzer. You're in The Situation Room. And we begin our coverage tonight with breaking news, court wrapping up for the day after very tense dramatic moments during E. Jean Carroll's defamation damages trial against Donald Trump. The judge at one point threatening to remove the former president from the courtroom for repeatedly making comments during Carroll's testimony. CNN's Kara Scannell is outside the courthouse in New York. She's got details for us. Kara, just how contentious was it inside the court today?",

And she was describing the impact of Trump's statements, saying that he didn't rape her, denied knowing her, and said that she made up the claims to help sales of her book.So, as she was beginning to testify, saying that his lies, quote, shattered her reputation, that was when we first saw Trump starting to react to this. He shook his head side by side as if to say no. And throughout her testimony, he was leaning over talking to his lead attorney, Alina Habba. Now, at one point in a break, when the jury was out of the room, Carroll's attorney raises to the judge saying that she could hear him saying words such as con job, saying this was false and a lie. And so she raises issue to the judge. The judge had asked Trump to be careful about what he was saying, but it continued. And then again later on, this came up again and the judge had this very tense exchange with the former president in court, the judge telling him if he disregards court orders, Mr. Trump, I hope I don't have to consider excluding you from the trial. I understand you're probably eager for me to do that, Trump replied audibly. I would love it, the judge said. I know you would. You just can't control yourself in this circumstance, apparently. Now, this was a series of tense exchanges with Trump's team. His lead attorney, Alina Hanba, also had several exchanges with the judge. She renewed her motion to cancel court tomorrow so Trump could attend his mother-in-law's funeral. The judge told her he didn't want to hear this. He already had ruled on the matter, telling her at one point to sit down. So, Trump's lawyer after court, Trump continued his anger against the judge. Here's what he said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT: He would rather have me miss the funeral or go to the funeral, miss the trial. And that's a nasty man. He's a nasty judge. He's a Trump-hating guy. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

That's what is going to determine whether or not you get not just compensatory damages to make up for the harm she suffered, but punitive damages to punish Trump if he has bad intent.

So, the fact that he wants to be at the second trial, and that was a trial, by the way, that he was accused of raping her, and the jury found him guilty of that, as well as defamation. So, this trial, the defamation has been established, as you were saying, it's just about damages. And so he doesn't have to be here, but he's choosing to be. And so the judge is reminding him of that. And as a result, he has to comport himself in a way that is appropriate. You can't, for example, call out and say things so that the jury can hear. The time for that is if you testify under oath. You're not allowed to make remarks from sitting at the table.

It sounds like wherever she goes, she tries to speak to that base. A few weeks ago, she could barely say that the Civil War was rooted in racism. It was around slavery. Now, she is trying to appeal to moderates and independents. She tries to also appeal to the very racist base of the GOP. And so these voters cannot actually trust who Nikki Haley will be should she get the nomination, but she also understands that in New Hampshire, a lot of these voters who are independent and moderate, some of them do vote Democratic in the general election. And so she's trying to make sure that she has a message in case she gets the nomination. What would her general election message be? And so it is very confusing of who she is at times because she's trying to speak to all of these different voters. And so we'll see what happens depending on how well she does in New Hampshire, because I'm also sure that she's very concerned that Ron DeSantis is in her backyard in South Carolina while she has all of her attention on New Hampshire.",

To the conversation we're having about what's going on in New Hampshire, St. Anselm College just released a survey tonight. They've got Trump ahead 52-38. Among Republicans, Trump was at 65. But among independents, Haley was at 52. So, you can see what she needs to do. But you can see in any state where Republicans are the dominant turnout faction, Donald Trump is doing quite well.
