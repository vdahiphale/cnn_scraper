The Israeli military is warning residents in the city of Tyre in southern Lebanon to immediately evacuate some areas due to ongoing military operations against Hezbollah.On Tuesday, Israeli airstrikes targeted sites in south and northeast Lebanon and Beirut's southern suburbs. The Israel Defense Forces claims two buildings flattened by one strike were Hezbollah weapon storage facilities. There's been no word on casualties there, but Lebanon's health ministry says at least 10 people were killed in two other strikes. The U.N. human rights chief says he is appalled by an Israeli strike on Monday near Beirut's Rafic Hariri University Hospital that caused significant damage and killed at least 18 people. The IDF says it hit a Hezbollah terrorist target. Meantime, the IDF says a possible successor to the late Hezbollah leader and other commanders of the Iran-backed group were killed in an attack in Beirut earlier this month. Hezbollah is yet to confirm that claim. Well U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken is in the Middle East and just a short time ago, Sirens delayed the top U.S. diplomat departure to Saudi Arabia. He reiterated the need for a ceasefire in Gaza. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ANTONY BLINKEN, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE: In the space of a year, it's managed to dismantle Hamas' military capacity. It's destroyed a bunch of its arsenal. It's eliminated its senior leadership, including most recently, Yahya Sinwar. This has covered the cost -- great cost to Palestinian civilians in Gaza. Now is the time to turn those successes into an enduring strategic success. And there are really two things left to do. Get the hostages home and bring the war to an end with an understanding of what will follow. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "Well with just two weeks until election day, former President Donald Trump spent his Tuesday starting off with a roundtable with Latino and Hispanic voters and leaders.Now, part of that is because Donald Trump's campaign, their strategy in this final stretch is to really target specific demographics that they think could help them on the margins. And that's because they recognize that this election is going to be incredibly close and they want to not only siphon voters away from the Harris campaign but also try and turn out low propensity voters. Now, one of those key demographics is Hispanic and Latino men and that's in addition to them targeting black men as well as female voters. But part of what Donald Trump was trying to do was when he was speaking with them, he talked about the economy, about energy, both things that are of course very core to his stump speech. But then he also went into detail about immigration. Now, it was the typical rhetoric we have heard from Donald Trump. He criticized Harris's handling of the southern border and he claimed that many migrants are coming over illegally to commit crimes in the United States. Now, I often am asked, does this strategy actually help Donald Trump when he's trying to target Hispanic and Latino voters? But the Trump campaign believes that it does. They think that many voters actually who have immigrated here have done so legally and that the border is one of their top issues. I've actually heard similarly when I'm speaking to Trump supporters at rallies. I talked to many people who have migrated here legally and they do argue that the border is one of their top issues. Now, also part of what Donald Trump did during that roundtable was demean Harris. He went after her for being lazy and slow and also criticized her for having a low I.Q. Take a listen. DONALD TRUMP (R), U.S. PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Who the hell takes off? You have 14 days left and she'll take a couple of more days off too. You know why she's lazy as hell and she's got that reputation. There's something wrong with her too. She's slow, low I.Q., something. I don't know what the hell it is.

So I don't think this will be the end of some of those personal attacks on her.But I also want to preview just what he was doing on Tuesday night, which was he was back in North Carolina. This was his second day of campaign events in North Carolina. He also made three different stops there on Monday. And I think that just underscores how important North Carolina is to the Trump campaign's strategy. Remember, this is a state that he won both in 2016 and in 2020, but when he was up against Biden in 2020, it was the state that he won by the smallest margin. So this is something they recognize is not guaranteed. And I will also tell you that from my conversations with Trump's advisors, they had really thought North Carolina was going to be an easier win when they were running, when Donald Trump, I should say, was running against Joe Biden. They recognized that Harris has a lot more enthusiasm in the state, and that's part of why you're seeing him campaign there so aggressively. Alayna Treene, CNN, Washington. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

      "sentences": "So let's start with that bombshell article in your publication \"The Atlantic\" where Jeffrey Goldberg writes about Donald Trump Apparently saying in the closing days of his presidency that he quote \"needs the kind of generals that Hitler had.\"Two sources confirmed Trump said this, one of them former Trump chief of staff General John Kelly who also said in a \"New York Times\" interview that Trump fits the Definition of a fascist and has previously said that Hitler did a lot of good things. Now the Trump campaign denies all of this. What's your reaction and what impact will it likely have on voters with just less than two weeks to go to election now? BROWNSTEIN: Yeah, this is an extraordinary moment. I think it is the testimony from John Kelly, who let's remember is a retired four-star general, the former head of the Southern Command, who was Donald Trump's cabinet secretary at the Department of Homeland Security and later his White House chief-of-staff, saying today publicly, amid all the tradition and reluctance of former military officers to say anything that affects American politics. He is saying publicly that based on his close personal interaction over years with Donald Trump, he believes he fits the definition of a fascist does not understand the basis of American constitutional democracy and is fundamentally an authoritarian. It is a stark a warning as we have ever heard. I believe about a presidential candidate from someone who was at his elbow in the White House for years. I'd believe his longest serving chief of staff. And you know we can't say yet what impact this will have except it does reinforce what we have already seen what we saw yesterday when Vice President Harris campaigned with former Republican representative Liz Cheney across three white collar suburbs outside Philadelphia, Detroit, and Milwaukee in the states that are most likely to decide the presidential race, appealing to the white collar Republicans, sometimes thought of as Haley voters, who are the most uneasy with Trump. I suspect we're going to hear what General Kelly said quite a bit on television and radio between now and the end, and it really poses I think a very stark choice for all Republicans who are finding a way to kind of bite their lip about their reservations about Trump. This is very stark testimony and a very clear warning.",

That the Ford argument that the country would be torn apart by a trial of an ex-president, I cannot imagine them finding persuasive, especially after arguing, as they have, that he is an existential threat to American democracy.So, you know, I don't think there's anything in that interview that's really going to change things very much. I mean, you know, we are we're talking about a race at the margins. You know it's interesting I mean Harris is obviously more competitive than Biden was among voters of color and as a result is more competitive in the Sun Belt battlegrounds of Georgia, North Carolina in the southeast, Arizona and Nevada in the southwest. But even though she's more competitive it's not clear that she can really win any of those which means that her path to the White House may be the same as Biden's in the end which is sweeping the three Rust Belt battlegrounds that were in the blue wall, that Trump dislodged from the blue wall in 2016, places where she was with Liz Cheney yesterday, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. And those are states where the election administration process is, I think, in safe hands, Democratic governors and all of them. Ultimately, the Electoral Count Act reforms passed by Congress in '22 give the governor the final word on certifying the winner. So Trump can rage and storm and you know the speaker of the house, if Republicans hold the house, may support him and create mischief down the road but he doesn't control the government this time. So his ability I think to try to undermine the election is significantly reduced.",

One of the first things we expect to see is a group photo of all the delegations involved.I think that will be a real moment for Russia in terms of the message it wants to send to the West, that it has failed in its efforts to isolate Russia, and I think it is a measure of Russia's ability to sort of gloss over its unprovoked aggression in Ukraine and to find a willing audience for that around the world with this now-expanded BRICS grouping. It's not just rhetoric, it is now taking its place in this very broad global alliance encompassing some 40-plus percent, almost half of the global population. And it is really emphasizing that fact. One of the major Russian talk shows played a montage last night of U.S. Western leaders talking about how isolated Russia is and in a split screen the arrivals that we saw yesterday of Xi Jinping, of Narendra Modi, Cyril Ramaphosa of South Africa really making a mockery of those Western statements. So that is the sort of, the messaging that we're getting from Russia and I think it is something that Western countries now more than ever are going to have to factor into their calculus when it comes to Ukraine and their support for its ongoing defense. So in terms of what we're expecting to see today a meeting of the BRICS there, the nine members of that now expanded group President Putin will continue with his many bilateral meetings that he has trailed that he's going to have over these few days. We're expecting to see him meet with Turkish President Erdogan not a BRICS member. In fact, it is a NATO member, but still attending this summit also with Maduro of Venezuela. So a number of different meetings one thing that has got a lot of attention is that the U.N. Secretary General Antonio Guterres is attending this summit. Ukraine has expressed extreme displeasure about this, saying that he did not attend a Ukrainian peace summit back in June, but he has decided to go to Russia for this. His spokesperson said that this was simply because there were so many critical world leaders there. He attended the last BRICS summit in South Africa and he would be reaffirming his well-known views on Ukraine and the need for a just peace under the U.N. charter. So a lot of critical optics expected today.",

And the two men, of course, had met multiple times, dozens of times over the years. So that frequency of their meetings, even after the Russian invasion of Ukraine, really is a testament of the strength of this relationship.And in recent years, we, of course, have seen bilateral trade soaring and military cooperation increasing between the two countries, really living up to that much touted description of a no limit partnership. Now, of course, China is increasingly being perceived as the more dominant, the bigger brother of this relationship because of the economic cloud and political influence of China under Xi Jinping. But still, Xi could use something from Putin as well, including affordable and steady energy supply, but also Russia's support on a number of important political and ideological issues for China on the global stage. And indeed, we have seen the two governments increasingly in lockstep on many of these policy and messaging fronts in the United Nations, for example, and that is probably going to continue. But what's interesting is Xi made a note of saying how this relationship is non-alliance, non-confrontational and non-third party targeted, but I think many analysts would back to defer because what's been bonding these two men increasingly, of course, is their shared desire and their willingness to reshape this U.S.-led world order. And that, of course, is why BRICS is increasingly important for both of them as this alternative platform, especially as Xi put it, in times of unprecedented change and chaos. And he said once during their previous meetings that Xi Jinping and Putin themselves, they are on the driver's seat in seeing through these changes and reshape this global balance of power.

And it's not clear what exactly are the orders that the Israeli government is giving to the Israeli military who is contracting the fighting.And it's not just me who says this, but it's Israeli high-rank defense officials who believe that the war -- that at least most of the goals of the war were achieved long ago. nd of course, after the killing of the leader of Hamas in Gaza and, say, in the world, Yahya Sinwar, just last week, the difficulty is that the IDF, Israeli Defense Forces, believe that this war cannot be, cannot end and cannot be won without the closing leg of a political settlement without discussing the day after, who will be a viable alternative to Hamas? What can be, what sort of a regime, what sort of government, some kind of a new page that will be an alternative, not just for the Israeli population on the border, and of course to guarantee their safety, that something like October 7th will not happen again, but also for the Palestinians. Mr. Netanyahu has other considerations that are superior to these, he is afraid to the integrity of his coalition, and he's afraid that if he will call the Palestinian Authority to help, which are basically the only alternative to Hamas, then the right, ultra-right-wingers in his coalition will disassemble that, and he puts that as the first, maybe the only priority.",
