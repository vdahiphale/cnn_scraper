More than 300,000 Israeli reservists have been called up. CNN's Nic Robertson was able to speak with some of those soldiers as they get ready for what's ahead. He's live for us in Sderot, Israel, about a mile east of Gaza. Nic, what did you hear from them?",

I talked not only to some of the troops that are -- that potentially could be going into Gaza this this time whenever the order comes through, but also some that were involved in the last incursion back in 2014. You know and there's a recognition here that perhaps Israel is in something of a catch 22 position.Because Hamas can hide out behind civilians who don't evacuate the areas, as the IDF asked them to and therefore the harder you go after Hamas, the more civilians potentially get injured. The bigger the international outcry, you're forced to back off from attacking Hamas and you don't entirely defeat them. The training, nevertheless, to try to achieve beyond that and crush Hamas. That's really well underway then. This is what we saw. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ROBERTSON (voice-over): Close to Gaza, preparations underway for a much anticipated ground offensive. Troops from different units training together. There is an urgency here. They have to be ready, fast.",

MAJOR OFEK, GIVATI BRIGADE COMMANDER (through translator): We expect to go to war, we expect to destroy the terrorist organization, Hamas, kill its governments and kill every last terrorist. That's what we plan to do and that's how it will be. ROBERTSON (voice over): The last time the IDF went into Gaza targeting Hamas leaders was 2014. Ariel Bernstein was 21 in the Special Forces, one of the first to cross the border. ARIEL BERNSTEIN, FORMER ISRAELI COMBAT SOLDIER We were just afraid that there's something waiting for you at every corner. ROBERTSON (voice over): But his experiences then have left him questioning the tactics today. Back then, like now, the IDF warned civilians to leave and Hamas told them to stay.

(END VIDEOTAPE) ROBERTSON (on camera): And of course, that's the primary concern of the 10s, if not many, potentially hundreds or so of thousands of troops who are waiting for that order, Anderson.
