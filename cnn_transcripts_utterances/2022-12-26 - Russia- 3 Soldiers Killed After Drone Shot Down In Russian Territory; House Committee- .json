Now, the incident happening 500 miles southeast of Moscow. CNN's Melissa Bell is in Paris and has more details.

      "sentences": "Well, that airbase you just showed is also over 300 miles from northeast of that Ukrainian border. We really are well deep into Russian territories here. Now, it's not the first time, Amara, that that airbase has been targeted. In fact, it was hit back on December 5 when another airbase also deep inside Russia was hit.Now, this is something that Ukraine neither confirms nor denies. But we have heard from Ukrainian officials today in the shape of the head of the Ukrainian Air Force saying that this is the consequence of Russian aggression. And that's about as close as you're going to get as a recognition of responsibility, but really a remarkable show of force of their ability and their determination to strike deep within Russia. And that, of course, an embarrassment on the Russian's side. The fear now, Amara, is that after this happened on December 5, what followed were retaliatory strikes into Ukraine. Now, what we've seen -- been seeing over the course of this weekend before this overnight strike on Russian territory took place were a series of strikes at several dozens of course in Kherson, that important city in the South that was liberated only last month. We've also seen on Sunday more strikes, not just in the Donbass region but from Zaporizhzhia all the way up to Kharkiv. The fear now is that in retaliation for this drone making it as far as that airbase, we could see what we saw just after December 5, and that could be more retaliatory strikes on Ukraine. That is certainly, Amara, what the country is bracing for. We heard on Sunday night in his nightly address, the Ukrainian president warned that the Ukrainian people needed to get ready, to prepare themselves mentally for what he expected to be dark and difficult days as we head towards New Year's Eve. That is the expectation. That is the fear, of course, as targets including critical infrastructure, continue to come under attack. A difficult few days are expected in Ukraine as a result of that strike in Russia. Again, not quite recognized, but certainly alluded to by Ukrainian authorities, Amara.",

Thank you so much.So, joining us now to help us understand the situation on the ground, CNN military analyst, and retired Air Force Intelligence Officer Colonel Cedric Leighton. Also, here former longtime CNN Moscow bureau chief Jill Dougherty. Welcome to you both. Hope you both had a happy holiday so far. Colonel, let's start with you. I mean, what do you think of you know, what the intended target of this drone attack was? And the fact that it struck so deep inside, you know, Russia, what is the strategic significance of that? COL. CEDRIC LEIGHTON, CNN MILITARY ANALYST: So, Amara, good morning. This is a very significant place because Engel's airbase is actually one of the major bases where the Soviet or excuse me, where the Russian bomber forces, it used to be the base for the major Soviet bomber regiments, and it's been around since the 1930s. So, this base is the place where Russia launches some of its attacks using cruise missiles against Ukraine. Basically, what they do is they send up bombers, either Tu-95s or Tu- 160s, and they loiter in an area that is off of Ukrainian airspace, but it's close enough for them to lob cruise missiles against Ukrainian targets. So, when the Ukrainians did this, when they attacked this base, allegedly in the early part of December, and apparently today, what they're doing is they're sending a message that even from a strategic standpoint, the Russian forces are at risk. So, what's significant from that standpoint is also going after the ability of the Russians to mount these kinds of attacks against the Ukrainian infrastructure.",

And I was just reading his comments, and of course, you've got to parse it right, because he says we are ready to negotiate with everyone involved about acceptable solutions. So, he obviously has put conditions on a potential negotiation. Is he serious about the offer or is this just lip service?",

In the eastern world, the Orthodox world, usually January 7. And so, the fact that Orthodox Christians in Ukraine are beginning to celebrate Western Christmas, Western Christmas has religious but also kind of a symbolic, I'd say almost political significance of joining the West being part of Europe.And so, as this war goes on, there are a lot of really important cultural changes that are going on that maybe we can't quite see at this point. But here's a -- here's a moment that I think we ought to note where things really are changing in the minds and the hearts of people.",

      "sentences": "So, this is going to be really interesting, Amara, because one of the things that you have to look for is how frequently the Russians are doing these kinds of attacks. And one of the things I've looked at is the fact that the Russians seem to be mounting these attacks on kind of a weekly basis. What that might mean is that the Russians are running short of cruise missiles and armed drones and other weapons that they're using against the Ukrainians, especially against the Ukrainian infrastructure. And so, they're kind of husbanding their resources, if you will, buttrying to use as much maximum effect as they possibly can, hitting targets, likely infrastructure in order to wound the Ukrainian war effort, and ultimately Ukrainian society. If they continue with this pattern, what I think they're doing is they're stalling for time. But we may very well see an acceleration of these attacks if they are able to ramp up their industrial production capability and if they're able to get other weapons from places like Iran. So, it is one of those areas where there's a lot going on, but the Russians are limited in their capacity to strike back.",

      "sentences": "Correct. This has been a long process to get to this point, a process that in fact dates all the way back to late 2020 when Congress in a bipartisan fashion overrode former President Donald Trump's veto and created this naming commission set to look across the military bases, names, facilities, ships even, and rename anything that commemorated or memorialize the Confederacy. And they did it in three different parts.The name and commission first. They looked at base names, then they looked at the academies themselves, and that's where West Point comes in. Take a look at what they found when they looked at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point. 13 different references to the academy. And this is part of what will be changed according to a letter from the commander, a portrait of Confederate military General Robert E. Lee and Jefferson Hall, a bust of Robert E. Lee, a bronze triptych at the main entrance of Bartlett Hall, that's the science building there. And that in fact shows a hooded member of the Ku Klux Klan that made quite a bit of news when that came out, as well as renaming some of the bases, the facilities, and the streets there as well. And this is again all part of a process. For example, that was also looked at base names across the military and recommended that Fort Bragg be changed to Fort Liberty, Fort Gordon to Fort Eisenhower, and there were other names as well. The West Point is that it will begin this process calling it \"a multi-phased approach\" so we can expect it to take a bit of time. But it's all part of this process to stop the military from in any way commemorating or memorializing the Confederacy, Amara.",
