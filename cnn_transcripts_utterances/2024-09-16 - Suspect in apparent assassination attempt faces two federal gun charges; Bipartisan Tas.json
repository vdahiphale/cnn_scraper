Routh was in federal court today and prosecutors are now charging him with possession of a firearm while a convicted felon, as well as possession of a firearm with an obliterated serial number.Now, this afternoon, Trump is meeting with the Acting Secret Service Director Ronald Rowe. Rowe apparently plans to stay in Florida as this investigation plays out. CNN's Carlos Suarez is live force outside the Trump International golf course in Palm Beach.

Now, according to the criminal complaint that was filed against him,Routh's route's cellphone data shows that he might have been in the area for nearly 12 hours, in the area where he was spotted by the Secret Service on Sunday afternoon. So we're talking about from about 1:59 in the morning on Sunday to about 1:31 in the afternoon. We're told that several bags, including that SKS-style rifle and a plastic bag containing food was also found at the scene. Now, this afternoon, we're also getting our first look at the moment that Routh was taken into custody by the sheriff's office about an hour north of the golf course here in West Palm Beach. He was arrested by the Martin County Sheriff's Office. Here now is the moment that he was taken into custody. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MAN #1: Driver, walk straight back. Keep walking.

But let's start with what you just started with there, criminal history. Public records do show that his first brush with the law dates back to 2000, but it was really in 2002 when he became known to North Carolina law enforcement.Now, CNN spoke with a former officer in Greensboro, North Carolina, and she responded to a 2002 incident where he barricaded himself inside a building after a traffic stop. He eventually pled guilty to felony possession of a weapon of mass destruction. Sources tell CNN that that was a fully automatic weapon. Public records also reveal other minor financial crimes in North Carolina. But then he moved to Hawaii, where he set up his own business and worked on what is being described as a nonprofit constructing small shelters for homeless people. But then, there was some sort of a change a couple of years ago. Routh became very vocal and then personally involved when it came to the war in Ukraine. He traveled to Ukraine, where he said he wanted to join the fight, but was told he was too old. He was age 56 at the time. So he's put his effort into trying to draw attention to the plight of Ukrainians. He saw it as a battle of good against evil, and he thought the entire world should come to Ukraine's aid. I want you to take a look at this interview during a protest in Ukraine's capital in 2002. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

This gets kind of to the heart of that question about the Secret Service right now. You know, it's a bit of a two-edged sword. On the one hand, the protective operation they had in place for the former President yesterday actually worked the way it's supposed to. You have those advance agents who are ahead of him on the golf course. They are kind of clearing threats as they go. They perceived a threat. They addressed it with firepower and mitigated that threat to the President in that moment. That's the way it's supposed to work.But it raises all kinds of other issues about like how is it that these threats are getting so close to him and why was there not maybe a more strengthened perimeter around the course, especially in light of the fact that we know that he would eventually have been completing that 6th hole, moving on towards the 7th hole. That cart path connecting those holes is basically 10ft, 20ft off of the fence where we know this guy was holed up for almost 12 hours. It's really frightening.",

It's good that he didn't go full on barricaded yesterday or that would have ended up in a firestorm of bullets. I'm not surprised that he was somewhat accepting of his fate when he was finally taken out of the vehicle. He knew -- you could tell by the way he set up that position around the fence, the way he's using the hanging, the backpacks on the fence, possibly including ceramic shock plates, to maybe use those things to deflect incoming fire or to protect him, at least to conceal him in some way. So he's someone who has shown us indicators that he knew that ultimately law enforcement would be looking in his direction and coming to get him. So I think that makes sense with his kind of his resignation yesterday on the side of the road.But, yeah, I can't imagine that he's -- I would expect that he seems like someone who is undergoing some sort of a mental or personal crisis that might be pushing him to these points.",
