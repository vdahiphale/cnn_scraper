Let's head to Washington and join CNN's Senior White House Reporter Kevin Liptak. So Kevin, this is the first time we are going to be seeing President Biden since he dropped out of the race.

He actually founded the Cancer Moonshot initiative when he was vice president following the death of his son, Beau, from a particularly aggressive form of brain cancer. He revived it when he returned to the White House with the goal of cutting by half cancer deaths in 25 years, which is quite an ambitious goal. But experts say that it is achievable with the right resources behind it, and that is exactly what he'll be doing in New Orleans today.He'll be touring a medical facility at Tulane University and announcing $150 million in new research grants, specifically focused on trying to develop better technologies that would allow surgeons to better remove tumors from cancer patients, things like imaging technologies or high-powered microscopes. It's part of an initiative that the president put together with Democrats and Republicans at the Department of Health and Human Services, and it's part of what he calls his unity agenda, trying to find areas where both parties can agree. And that is certainly something that you're going to hear from President Biden over the next several months, really, as he tries to calibrate his focus on these legacy items. What he wants to do is ensure that the money that has passed for these things is going out the door before he leaves office. His aides have had to recalibrate in some ways how he is going to spend the next several months. He's obviously no longer running for president, and he will have these specific areas where he'll be focused. One of them is the economy and trying to lower prices. He also wants to ensure that the legislation that he's passed while president is being implemented. Of course, he'll also be focused on foreign policy, the war in the Middle East, the biggest item there. Of course, he's also focused on getting his Vice President, Kamala Harris, elected and to that end, we will see the pair of them out for the first time since she became the Democratic standard bearer talking about the economy at an event on Thursday.",

CNN's Jeremy Diamond is joining us now from Haifa, Israel. And Jeremy, Israel obviously preparing for possible retaliation from Iran and its proxies for the killing of Hamas leader. All of this ahead of these key talks, which we expect to take place on Thursday.

Well, first of all, I think the word expect is critical here in terms of those talks on Thursday and that's because that is the expectation from the United States' point of view, from the mediator's point of view. But we also know that a lot could happen in the next 48 hours that could upend that expectation, and that's because what we are watching is indications, according to the United States and Israeli government officials, that Iran will likely retaliate against Israel, will carry out this attack after nearly two weeks of vowing to do so. But some uncertainty about whether or not they would actually follow through.And now, the expectation is that that Iranian attack could come in the coming days, perhaps even before those talks on Thursday, and should a significant Iranian retaliation arrive in Israel before those ceasefire negotiations scheduled for Thursday, it could obviously upend those talks altogether. And yesterday, what we saw was a two key European leaders, the Chancellor of Germany, as well as the British Prime Minister speaking with the Iranian president, urging him to de- escalate the situation, to restrain a further Iranian response. And today, we are getting indications from the spokesman for the Iranian foreign ministry that they have no intention of doing so. Instead, the spokesman for the Iranian foreign ministry, Nasser Kanaani saying in a statement that European countries are \"shamelessly demanding that Iran not retaliate against Israel for violations of its sovereignty\" and saying that Iran is \"firm and resolute in defending its sovereignty and won't ask for permission from anyone to exercise its right to do so. So, that is an indication that Iran is a sticking to its plans to retaliate. We don't know exactly when that will come, but we know, of course, that the size and scope of that Iranian retaliation will be critical for the future of this region and of course, for those ceasefire talks as well.",

But with the regime shrouded in secrecy and Kim rejecting any foreign assistance, the big question is, how much devastation has been hidden from the eyes of the world? CNN's Will Ripley reports. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) WILL RIPLEY, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): On his emerald green bulletproof train, loaded with supplies from the capital Pyongyang, North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un is portrayed as a hero on state TV, traveling to areas devastated by flooding. Record rains left entire towns and villages under water, just miles from the Chinese border in the northwest of the country. State media reports thousands of evacuations, but no deaths, a claim impossible to verify with no foreign aid organizations allowed in. Kim delivering a defiant speech from the railcar carrying his armored limousine, declaring with confidence, North Korea is fully self- reliant, rejecting all offers of international aid, even from allies, China and Russia, at least for now. Some fear Kim's deepening military partnership with fellow strongman Vladimir Putin could be giving his economy and confidence a boost. Russia effectively vetoed United Nation's sanctions monitoring earlier this year, opening the door for illicit trade, the U.S. says, perhaps emboldening Kim to shut the door on international aid and diplomacy. LINDA THOMAS-GREENFIELD, U.S. AMBASSADOR TO THE UNITED NATIONS: We are prepared to have an open dialog with the North Koreans without preconditions. We want to pursue diplomacy. RIPLEY (voice-over): U.S. Ambassador to the U.N., Linda Thomas- Greenfield visited the Korean Demilitarized Zone this spring, telling outfront at the time, any top-level meeting like Former President Trump's summits with Kim would require lots of legwork.

South Korea's unification ministry accuses Kim of trying to shift focus away from the devastating flood damage, visible even in these carefully edited state TV images.

She is trying to capture some of the center. And she knows that voters, especially swing voters, don't like Trump, but they're not sure about her. And so, she's trying to create a narrative that suggests that she's very acceptable, she's middle of the road, more maybe a little center-left. She has to counter the Trump attacks that she's a radical leftist. And I think that's what we'll be seeing at the convention.",

And John King's piece about the voters in the suburbs is just spot on.The voters are still somewhat volatile and up for grabs. And Kamala Harris has a chance to introduce herself to those voters. They -- she's a known quantity, but not a well-known quantity. And so if he can set the narrative as opposed to Trump setting the narrative of who she is and what she wants to do, she'll go a long way, and being kind to Biden is something that a lot of Democrats are saying that's a nice thing to do.

The worst cities are desert cities like Phoenix, Arizona, where paramedics now travel with body bags full of ice to treat people suffering from heat, exhaustion or heat strokes.CNN Chief Climate Correspondent Bill Weir is with us.

If you take the 50 biggest cities in the United States and count the number of days above 95 Fahrenheit or 35-degrees Celsius, back in the '70s, you had about 1,000 -- 1064 days or so you could count on, on all of those 50 cities. Last year, it had nearly doubled to 1,857 total days.One reason that things are getting worse is that these hot days are kicking in sooner. If you look at the calendar, what used to start middle of June or late June, can now start mid-June. As we move on to the next graphic, and then it can the last into mid-September. So there's an extra almost a month of hot days built in over this time. But not all cities are equal. And the cities that are in Texas and Arizona are really the ones suffering the most. Las Vegas, 83 days above 95 degrees, and that is a big jump over what it was even a generation or two ago. San Antonio has had the biggest leap. They had a week worth of 95 degree temperatures back in the '70s. It was 13 weeks last year, a jump of over 1,200 percent. Nashville is getting hotter. Atlanta in the south, Baltimore and Washington on the East Coast, having a scorching 2024 as well. And then when you look at the next graphic, really the three hottest cities in the country that are really having to adapt the fastest are all in Arizona -- Phoenix, Mesa, and Tucson, 158 days in Phoenix in those super scorching temperatures, Christina, there.

They went on to say, we are deeply disappointed by the notification and are going to continue to pursue every possible avenue and appeal process, including to the Swiss Federal Tribunal to ensure the just scoring placement and medal award for Jordan. So that's the next step. It's going to go to the Swiss Tribunal with that video evidence, the U.S. says they have. Now, during the competition, as you mentioned, Christina, coaches have one minute after the routine to file an appeal to the judges. Well, Romania's original complaint said the U.S. took too long, to which the Court of Arbitration agreed. They said it ended up being four seconds too long, a minute and four seconds. But the U.S. says they have that video evidence saying they actually did the appeal in 47 seconds. So, we'll wait and see what the Swiss Court has to say about all of this.

And there is actually another gymnast involved in all of this. They thought her score was wrong as well, that she should probably get a bronze as well.And the IOC, they could have nipped this in the bud, Christina. They could have just looked at all of this and said, you know what, the Paris Games, they were so good. We don't want any stains. Both of these girls deserve a bronze medal, and that's what we are going do.
