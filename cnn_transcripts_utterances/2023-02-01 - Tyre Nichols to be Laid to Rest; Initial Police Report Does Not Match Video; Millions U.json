They have interacted in the past both by phone and a meeting. When Biden was vice president, McCarthy was majority leader. They would have breakfast at times at his home in the Naval Observatory. But their relationship is at best -- according to advisors -- described as cordial, professional to some degree. And now extraordinarily important. And the reason why is a deadline that's just a few months away. The debt limit deadline that is now looming over Washington at this moment. President Biden saying explicitly day after day there will be no negotiations. McCarthy saying that's what this meeting should actually start.

Today we will be seeing strikes by teachers, part of the United National Education Union as well as transport worker, civil servants and universities as well. Next week we're expecting strikes by NHS workers. But the figures are significant. We heard just yesterday from the general secretary of the National Education Union, Kevin Courtney. He spoke to the national board plus the BBC and said that he is expecting at least 200,000 teachers to be part of today's strike. Schools are expected to be closed or partly closed. Network Rail has warned that there is going to be significant disruption up and down the country. But of course there is questions around what the government is doing. They say their door remains open. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak will take questions in Parliament today. So, this is certainly said to be a hot topic.

But this radioactive -- what people have been calling, needle in a haystack was thankfully been found. The capsule was found earlier today, at 11:13 a.m. local time on the Great Northern Highway just two meters or about 6 feet from the side of the road. Now the Department of Fire and Emergency Services, they broke the news on Twitter. We've got the tweet for you. And they said this, quote: The DFES coordinated search efforts for a radioactive capsule have been successful. The positive result of locating the tiny object over a 1,400 kilometer area is testament to amazing inter-agency teamwork in the face of seemingly insurmountable odds, unquote. And the search took place in a stretch of the Australian highway that is roughly the size of the California coastline. So how did they do it? How it they find it? Well, they swept the area very slowly. They drove these special vehicles with flashing hazard lights that had the specialized radiation detectors. And they drove them slowly up and down the highway, both directions at 50 kilometers an hour or about 30 miles per hour. As for the size of the pallet, it is super small. Let's bring up this graphic. It's from the Department of Health in western Australia and it shows the size of the capsule compared to a coin. You can see the capsule is only 8 millimeters by 6 millimeters. Very tiny -- I'll just turn my pen that I'm holding right now. It is roughly the tip of the pen that I'm holding up at this very moment. Now the alarm was raised on Friday when authorities discovered the capsule was missing after a truck inspection the truck was transporting it from Rio Tinto's Gudai-Darri mine in Gudai-Darri to Perth -- a four day drive.
