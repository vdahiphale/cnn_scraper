And as I said, a large number of them have lost the use, the function in their eyes or in their hands.

So we have been instigating a disaster plan where, you know, different hospitals can deal with this. And indeed, you know, this was an action two days ago, where we had 1,100 ambulances transporting almost 2,000 patients from in different parts of the country. And at one point we were transferring patients from the south of Lebanon to the north of Lebanon and almost 90 hospitals were receiving those patients. Now this was something that helped us really absorb these almost, you know, 2,500 patients within a very short period of time. And a lot of those patients are still in the hospital. You know, up until now, we still have 11,343 patients still in hospitals.

Including those comments from the Israeli defense minister, talking about a new era of this war, talking about the center of gravity of this war moving north. But also as we are seeing military movements, including the 98th Division, a key fighting force in Gaza, over the course of the last year, being redirected away from the Gaza Strip toward Israel's northern front. That doesn't mean  that war is inevitable and, for now, we also have -- we should note that we haven't seen other key moves that we might anticipate before an all-out war, including, for example, the callup of additional reservists who would be sent to the northern front. That for example, has not happened yet but there is no question that, following these two days of deadly attacks in Lebanon, the deadliest for Hezbollah since the beginning of this war. With at least 38 members of Hezbollah having been killed over the course of the last two days, 33 of whom were likely victims of these pager and walkie-talkie attacks, there's no question that the temperature is very high at this moment. And that Hezbollah, as we are likely to hear from Hassan Nasrallah, as he is speaking now, is vowing to retaliate and that is because they have been so directly hit, not only in terms of the numbers of casualties here but also in terms of the way in which they have been -- their vulnerabilities have been exposed. And they have been embarrassed and they are weakened by these attacks, not only weakened from kind of resources and organization standpoint but weakened from a public perception standpoint amid the -- when we think of the psychology of this war. The psychology that Hezbollah very much needs to keep in mind with its supporters and with the Lebanese public as well. So we will wait and see what Hassan Nasrallah avows will come in terms of a response. And we will wait to see what that response will be, because it is that response that will likely determine what comes next and whether or not we are indeed spilling into that all-out war that has been feared for nearly a year now. Or whether these two parties will, as we have seen before, once again, step back from the brink.",

This is, as Nasrallah calls it, this is a support front for that war. Hezbollah cannot afford, does not want to become engaged in something along the lines of what we saw in 2006, where, for 34 days, there was an intense war focused largely in the south. But here in Beirut and in the southern suburbs known as Dahiyeh in Arabic. That entire neighborhood was pounded to smithereens. They don't want to see that. There is no support in the wider Lebanese public for war. And unlike 2006, Hezbollah cannot depend on friendly countries in the region to help rebuild those areas that have been destroyed. So there is no appetite. And I think they will probably, given a choice, would simply like to continue this daily exchange of fire between Israel and Hezbollah but limited to the border area.

And that's because this is a senior adviser to the Israeli prime minister, whowas going to Washington, who is presenting what sounds like a ground -- grand bargain proposal. But it is also a grand bargain proposal that is very likely dead on arrival, should it even arrive in Hamas' hands. And I actually spoke with an Israeli source familiar with the negotiations, who told me that there is no indication at this stage that this proposal will be the basis for new negotiations with Hamas. And that's because what he is proposing does sound like a grand bargain. It would entail an end to the war altogether, the release of hostages and that exchange of Palestinian prisoners in one fell swoop, in just one phase of an agreement, rather than the kind of three-phase process that has been the subject of negotiations for months and months. And it would also include the exile of Yahya Sinwar outside of Gaza. The problem is there's no indication that Hamas and that Sinwar himself is interested in an exile deal. It has been discussed at various other phases of the negotiations as something that would happen perhaps in the later stage of a ceasefire agreement. But officials have said that, every time it has come up, there was no sense that Hamas, that that was something that they would go for. So for now, what it seems to be is really a messaging play by the Israeli prime minister's office to put together this kind of grand bargain proposal and then point out that Hamas is the one refusing to agree to it.

Didn't break thesound barrier, dropping more flares again, flying right north of Beirut, flew right over the city. OK. So obviously, the timing of that overflight was no mistake or coincidence. Clearly, the Israelis wanted to detract -- distract the many viewers here in Beirut and in Lebanon as he makes that speech. But what we heard Hassan Nasrallah say was that Israel has crossed all red lines with the attacks, the pager blasts and the walkie-talkie blasts yesterday in Lebanon. He said that, in a sense, Hezbollah and Lebanon got off lucky because he said that the intention was to kill as many as 4,000 people with these blasts. Clearly, the death toll, according to the ministry of health was 37. That was 12 -- yes, on Monday -- rather, Tuesday, with the pager explosions and 20 yesterday with the walkie-talkie blasts. But certainly it comes at a time when tensions are very high. And when an Israeli fighter jet flies over Beirut like that, that only increases the fears that an escalation is coming for Hezbollah. What we saw is that Tuesday and Wednesday, saw in a 48 hour period, the highest death toll for the group since the 8th of October when hostilities broke out between the two. So it -- definitely we are not hearing a secretary general of Hezbollah who is extending an olive branch, suggesting that perhaps it's time to step back from the brink. Certainly, in this instance, it was Israel that made the first move, with these two days of wireless communications devices blasts. But certainly I think, when you talk about Hezbollah's audience, its support base, it cannot back down at the moment. I haven't seen yet any specifics on vows of revenge.

And with the Israeli chief of the general staff saying that they are ready to implement, basically implement war operations, what I think were going to see is movement forward of Israeli forces at least getting ready to move into southern Lebanon, probably up to the Litani River. If they do that, then the idea would be to take that territory, rid it of Hezbollah fighters as much as Israel can and then give a safe zone basically to the northern Israeli towns so that the residents can return there, which is a war aim of prime minister Netanyahu's. So that's one possible scenario for the IDF to prosecute this war. It does meet with -- it does, in essence, serve to fulfill Netanyahu's political goals and his war aims.

And remember Hezbollah used to really pride themselves on having trust with its followers, defies (ph) capability.  So this really was a speech so far of reassurance, trying to reassure his followers that the party continues to basically acknowledge challenges, mistakes. And he also acknowledged the fact that the followers are paying deeply and dearly for being part of Hezbollah. At the same time, I didn't hear any message that Hezbollah is willing to escalate more than the rules of the engagement with Israel. He really went out of his way to say, well, look, basically what we will do, we will continue to support Gaza. And to answer your question directly, I think Hezbollah faces a major predicament. And the predicament is, it wants to retaliate. My understanding is that Hezbollah really wants to retaliate without triggering all-out war with Israel. Nasrallah has made it very clear that Israel is trying to drag Hezbollah into war with Israel and with the United States. So nothing changes.

In the meantime, investigators believe Iranian hackers have attempted to tip the scales in the upcoming U.S. presidential election, saying there's been documents stolen from the Trump campaign to people associated with his political rivals. The Harris campaign says individuals connected to the Biden election campaign were contacted on their personal email accounts with what looked like a spam or fizzing (sic) attempt. CNN's Katelyn Polantz is tracking the story for us. Pretty remarkable to be honest, Katelyn, in terms of what we've been seeing. Tell us about what we know.",

      "sentences": "Yes, a series of statements from U.S. intelligence officials during this presidentialcampaign includes one yesterday, where they say quite explicitly the Iranian government is attempting to stoke discord and undermine confidence in the electoral process. U.S. intelligence officials are able to say this because of a series of apparent attempted hacks or hacking and then dumping. Hack and dump is the way the government talks about this sort of operation from people connected with Iran. The example that is being acknowledged now by U.S. government officials and by the Kamala Harris presidential campaign is an effort over the summer. After Trump campaign documents were stolen, to get private information about the Trump campaign or from the Trump campaign into the hands of Biden campaign individuals, people working for that campaign. It was an unsuccessful attempt. But specifically the way it worked was, in June or July in the summer, the Iranian connected cyber malicious actors. They were able to get Trump campaign documents through a phishing scheme of people around the Trump campaign. And then sent stolen, non-public information, apparently in the text of emails, unsolicited emails, where they were pinging people in the Biden campaign at the time. It looked like phishing to some of those folks. The material was not used, a spokesperson from the Harris campaign said yesterday. So that material was not spread more widely because of this. But now Donald Trump is accusing of the Biden-Harris campaign to be bad actors in this foreign interference effort. But the Harris campaign is strongly condemning efforts by foreign governments or actors to try and interfere in U.S. elections, something that is clearly taking place and we're learning more about by the week.",
