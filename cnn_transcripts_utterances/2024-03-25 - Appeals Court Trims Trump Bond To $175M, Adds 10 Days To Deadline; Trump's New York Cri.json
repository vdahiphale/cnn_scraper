Those properties, while they were potentially set to be seized as early as today as he faced a deadline to post a massive $464 million bond in his New York civil fraud case.Trump's team was scrambling because he could not make that payment, but in the 11th hour, an appeals court handed him a major lifeline. Now to secure the bond, Trump only has to pay $175 million and he has an extra ten days to do it. So will he make that payment and doesn't mean he's off the hook for the other $289 million of that judgment against him. We're going to explain all of that just ahead. But while Trump is claiming victory here, I can't win them all. Today, Trump also learning his New York criminal hush, money trial will begin on April 15th, sooner than he'd hoped.

The other hand, they want to know that you actually do have the money you can pony up if you do not prevail at the appellate process. And so this is part of a two-fold thing. It sounds unfair to a lot of people that think I got a handy over money to appeal my case. That's really what it's about. And so, ponying up in this way is huge.

If he does post the bond, then she's foreclosed until appeals over. But if he fails to post a bond, she can start collecting 10 days from now. Really important point that Tom made, the amount that was reduced today is not the final amount that he owes. He owes -- he still owes $454 million. He only has to post now $175 million on bonds.

You've got the idea. This is for many people news. You've already heard back before he was initially the president United States. And he wants you to think of that in the rearview mirror. But in reality, a lot of what Alvin Bragg's case involves more than three dozen some counts, I should say about the issues of falsifying records and beyond are things that were not necessarily contemplated immediately. And then Michael Cohen trial that could be more expensive in some ways. And so he would like you to look at this and say, this is all in the past, they all or trying to get you to the past. It's all Biden's fault here, but Biden is number one, not involved in this at all? This is a state-level prosecution. No more than a mayor is beholden to the president, is a Manhattan D.A. beholden to the attorney general of the United States, Merrick Garland. But it all fits the narrative that this is the system and everyone against him picking on him and hoping somehow to embarrass him to shame him, and to suggest that he cannot pay bill most or that he would be so bothered by the fact that had this allegation that he would pay to avoid it. This is remember, after the \"Access Hollywood\" tape was known to the general public, that he is going to have suggest that he was somehow so sullied by this assertion of at least one extramarital affair that he went to great lengths to hide it to this degree.

This is the words he used for them to move through into Ukraine implicating the Ukrainian authorities in organizing the attack, something that Kyiv has categorically denied. And of course, Washington's denied it as well. The problem is with that theory is that this is a highly militarized border. There's a war going on between Russia and Ukraine, particularly in that area around that border area.

The largest and most significant ones that well falling off of a 777 leaving San Francisco a plane skidding off the end of the runway in Houston, of engine fire of a flight, leaving an airplane and had to come back right away. Those are a bit more interesting, and those have caught a lot of scrutiny of the FAA, but it's really important to differentiate here. There's the MAX-9 issue which really exposed a quality control problem and systemic issues at Boeing, which led to the now resignation of their CEO by the end of the year and then there are these one-offs which have been really put up in lights more lately because of that MAX-9 door plug blot and how dramatic that was. It's really important to remember here, that the last time someone was killed on a commercial airliner in the United States was back in 2019 -- 2018, that was sort of a freak incident, a fan blade flow of an engine killed a passenger on board. Last time, there was a fatal commercial airplane crash in the U.S., 2009, that was the Colgan Air crash lead to really significant changes of regulations and requirements for pilot training.
