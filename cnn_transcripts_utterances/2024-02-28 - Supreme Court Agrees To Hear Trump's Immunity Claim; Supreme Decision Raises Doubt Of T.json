I'm Abby Phillip in New York. April 22nd, that's a date that you should circle on your calendar. It may go down as a defining day in the history of the republic. It's the day that the Supreme Court says that it will hear oral arguments on the question hanging over the 2024 election like a guillotine. Is Donald Trump immune from prosecution on charges that he interfered with the 2020 election? Is he immune from anything related to that violent January 6th insurrection that he encouraged? Now, the high court revealed its plan in two dry paragraphs. The justices set out a clear timeline there, one that collides directly with his other trials and with the election that is very much underway. March 19th, for example, is the due date for briefs. March 19th is also the day when voters in Arizona, in Florida, in Illinois, in Kansas and Ohio all head to the polls. That's when 350 delegates are on the line in the race for the Republican nomination. Now, the courtroom clash does give Trump a chance to forever make an imprint on how this country operates, that is if the court agrees with his lawyers that presidents are above the law just because they're president. It's an argument that every court so far has soundly rejected and it also makes it possible, maybe even likely, that Trump can get exactly what he wanted, a delay in his trials beyond the 2024 election. So far, the special counsel's office on the other side of the case isn't commenting. And as we come on the air, neither is the Biden White House nor President Biden's campaign. Now, Trump himself, well, here's what he said just last month. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP (R), FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT, 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: It's the opening of a Pandora's box and it's a very sad thing that's happened with this whole situation, when they talk about threat to democracy, that's your real threat to democracy. And I feel that as a president you have to have immunity. I've read a lot of legal reports lately and scholarly reports that are saying you really have to have a president of this country has to have immunity, or they're not going to be able to function in office.

So, the judge would have to build in a couple months for trial prep for motions for discovery.

Jack Smith asked them to skip the D.C. Circuit to move this case along. They declined to do that, and they have gone at a very leisurely pace in addressing the appeal now from the D.C. Circuit and now have set the argument for the week of April 22nd. All of that is a gift to Donald Trump.

Because one of the things that the circuit did, which is interesting in how they worded this order, the circuit said the indictment alleges that this was all done in his capacity as a candidate as opposed to the president. And so, really, if the Supreme Court is going to focus on what he did as a president, what they're likely going to do is not send it back to the circuit.

Because everything else on this calendar is after that. And you know what is actually just after Friday the 1st is Super Tuesday the 5th. That is when a lot of delegates on the Republican side of the aisle be decided. A majority will, in fact, be determined at least by Tuesday, March 12th. And then Trump is probably, if the polls are correct, is probably going to clinch the nomination between Tuesday, March 12th and Tuesday, March 19th. That means that he very well could get the nomination before anything else happens. Now, you'll notice the hush money trial is set to open on the 25th of March. And then you basically get this long rule. You get the Supreme Court arguments on immunity, which, of course, we've been talking about all this program. And that's not happening until late April. Then the Fulton County prosecutor proposed trial doesn't even potentially start until the 5th of August. My goodness gracious, how late is that? It's actually after the RNC, the Republican National Convention, which actually occurs in July. And that might not actually be the case. So, you're getting all of these things, Abby, that are starting really, really late. Now, this is just when these trials may be beginning. When could these cases actually be decided? Will they be decided before the election? Well, if you listen to the judge in the New York case, probably for the New York hush money case, but classified docs, Georgia election, federal January 6th case, it is all unclear at this point, could be only one trial is, in fact, determined before the November election.",

Only about a third of voters, just 32 percent of voters, view the charges in that case as very serious is by far, Abby, the weakest case in the minds of the Americans. And it may be the only one that is actually determined before the election.So, then the question is, Abby, you know, how do Americans view this in terms of whether or not they view it as potentially disqualifying for Trump? So, this is the New York hush money charges, disqualify Trump for the presidency, if they are true, look here, all voters, only 30 percent, Abby, only 30 percent of all voters view the charges as disqualifying if they are, in fact, true.

It's so far out that it makes it difficult for this case to be heard before the election. There's no case before the Supreme Court today or probably in a decade more important than this case. Roe v. Wade, right up there, may be more important. But this case determines whether or not we know for the next election if our president is a crook, as Richard Nixon asked. Richard Nixon was a crook. And I suspect that the American public wants to know what a jury would think of Donald Trump. Did he try to steal the election? Was it a coup d'etat? Was it an insurrection? Was he involved? Did he know what he was doing? I think we've seen the facts brought out distinctly by the January 6th committee and by the press and everybody else. This was something Donald Trump engineered.
