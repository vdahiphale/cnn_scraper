      "sentences": "Hello, everyone, and welcome to \"Amanpour.\" Here's what's coming up.Carnage in Gaza cannot continue. That's a new warning from the U.N. as Israeli forces take control of Gaza's largest hospital. Then, I speak to U.S. Senator Chris Murphy, who says the civilian death toll is already too high. Plus, the power of words. American Israeli historian Omer Bartov defines genocide. And Islamophobia in America. Journalist Laila El-Haddad talks to Hari Sreenivasan about the troubling rise in hate crimes. Welcome to the program, everyone. I'm Christiane Amanpour in London. After weeks of fierce fighting, Hamas says Israel has gained control of Gaza's main hospital, where thousands of civilians have been sheltering. Once a vital medical center in Gaza, now many of Al-Shifa's wards look like this, damaged and deserted. Doctors say the hospital's main building has effectively ceased functioning and that the situation inside is catastrophic. Israel claims to be conducting a targeted operation against Hamas, a command center underneath the hospital. The medical officials and Hamas have both consistently denied this. U.N. Aid Chief Martin Griffiths says he is \"appalled by the scenes and that hospitals are not battlegrounds.\" Nada Bashir brings us the developments at the Al-Shifa Hospital. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) NADA BASHIR, CNN JOURNALIST (voiceover):  Weeks of bombardment had already left Gaza's largest hospital in what has been described as a catastrophic situation. Doctors at Al-Shifa working under impossible circumstances, caring for hundreds of patients as Israel's military incursion moves inside the hospital. DR. MOHAMMAD ZAQOUT, DIRECTOR GENERAL OF HOSPITALS IN GAZA (through translator):  The occupation soldiers are still on the ground floor. They are searching employees, civilians, even the injured and patients. Some were stripped and placed in dehumanizing and miserable conditions. BASHIR (voiceover):  Israel's raid on Al-Shifa has been described as precise and targeted, focused, they say, on claims of a Hamas command center beneath the hospital. But it is civilians, including medical staff and patients, that have been caught in the center of this unrelenting battle.",

Well, the terrible situation developing in the Middle East, we'll probably most likely be on the agenda when U.S. President Joe Biden sits down with China's President Xi Jinping in San Francisco. Ahead of the high stakes talks, I've been speaking to U.S. Senator Chris Murphy, who's been warning for weeks about an unacceptable civilian death toll in Gaza.

So, the top U.N.humanitarian official, Martin Griffiths, has said, this carnage cannot be allowed to continue.

This is the first time that you and I have had the chance to talk about this.Israel has to destroy Hamas's military capabilities. The world cannot permit Hamas to be able to launch an attack like they did on October 7th. And war is difficult. It's ugly. Civilians often get hurt, and Hamas makes that much worse, as you know, by embedding themselves and their equipment and their assets inside civilian buildings, inside hospitals and churches and schools and mosques. So, that's Hamas's decision to use human beings as shields. What I have said, though, is that the number of civilians being killed right now inside Gaza is unacceptable and it's unsustainable. And in fact, I think it's contrary to Israel's long-term security objectives because Hamas is going to grow in strength, potentially if the civilian death count remains this high. So, I think that Israel has to begin to make different targeting decisions. I will be honest with you. I am not privy to the intel on this specific asset. But ultimately, the civilian numbers, casualty numbers have been too high and I think Israel has to begin to make different decisions even well it continues the fight. I don't support a ceasefire. I think Israel should continue the fight against Hamas. I just think the civilian death count has become too high.",

I want to know what you think these same concernsare doing to your allies in, in the rest of the world. For instance, Jordan, for instance, others. And you probably saw \"The Washington Post\" op-ed by King Abdullah, who says that we need to stop this before \"we reach our moral breaking point.\" Karim Khan, Chief Prosecutor at the International Criminal Court, says we are witnessing a pandemic of inhumanity. I've had the French president -- the former French president, telling me that the world used to really think about, you know, peace.

You're talking about large numbers of innocent human beings dying, but this allbegan with 1,300 Israelis being brutally murdered by a terrorist organization, a terrorist organization that then retreated to Gaza and used human beings as shields to try to avoid accountability. And so, I think it is important to understand the nature of Hamas and to also understand the moral cost to the nation if Hamas -- to the world, excuse me, if Hamas gets away with this. There has to be accountability for Hamas. And so, I don't support a ceasefire because Hamas has made it perfectly clear that they will use that ceasefire in order to regroup and carry out similar attacks against Israel, and it's a message to other terrorist organizations that still may have designs on hidden in the United States that they could get away with future attacks with the same kind of impunity. So, what I believe is that the fight has to continue against Hamas, but the pace of the fight and the decisions regarding targeting have to change as well to reduce dramatically the number of innocent people who are being killed.",

But certainly, a lot of people are also saying there needs to be some thought and planning for the day after. For instance, still trying to plan for the two-state solution, which also King Abdullah called for. I spoke last night on this program to one of the, you know, previous sort of Israeli Palestinian negotiators. This is Daniel Levy, what he's telling me about, you know, the possibility of coming back to the peace table after this war. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DANIEL LEVY, PRESIDENT, U.S./MIDDLE EAST PROJECT:  Israel has largely neglected the idea that one does politics with the Palestinians. One does solution-oriented approaches. And therefore, it's been difficult to get that answer in any kind of clear fashion. Now, I think the most likely outcome is that Hamas will continue to exist. Its military capacity may be downgraded. Politically, it is probably stronger than before. There will still be a Hamas. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

I think it's also important for the Biden administration to continue to press for there to be changes in the pace of this conflict to protect civilians. But what is also true is that this crisis has once again showed the centrality of American leadership to the extent that Iran has chosen not to enter this conflict, which was not a foregone conclusion at the beginning, it's because the United States of America and Joe Biden Made clear to Iran that there could be significant consequences for them if they entered the fight against Israel. It has been American leadership that has stopped this conflict from spreading. And so, China hopes and Xi hopes that American influence is fading. That ultimately China will be the most important power in a place like the Middle East. Israel didn't call the Chinese to come in and try to stop this conflict from spreading. The Gulf allies didn't run to China to try to figure out a way forward. No, they turned to the United States. And so, I think Joe Biden walks into this meeting with another reminder to Xi that America still has the strongest system of allies around the world. So, I do hope that they get a limited set of agreements here, whether it be on climate or fentanyl or defense communication. But I think that this has been a strong advertisement that America is still the most indispensable nation in the world.",

Joe Biden has made a big down payment on that conversion, but the rewards have not been received yet in the amount that individuals want. I don't worry about this polling a lot because when voters go to the polls, when they actually cast ballots, they are overwhelmingly electing Democrats. They just don't believe that Republicans are responsible grownups any longer who deserve to be in charge of local, state or national government. And so, well, the latest polls may cause some consternation, the fact of the matter is that over and over again, as we saw just last week, when voters actually show up to the ballot box, they're choosing Democrats, and that, I think, will still be the case next fall.",

People are horrified by what they see and hear is happening in Israel and in Gaza.

And once things happen, it's, first, very difficult to stop them. And then, as we know, it's very difficult to bring people to account as well. So, I think that one should always on the side of caution and warn when there's sufficient signs, both in terms of how people speak about a potentially targeted group and then what sort of actions they are taking before genocide actually begins.",

And, you know, war crimes are defined as serious violations of laws and customs of war and international armed conflict against combatants and civilians. And I think the disproportion in the number of civilians killed is so great that there's probably the case for speaking of war crimes, possibly also of crimes against humanity, which are extermination or other mass crimes of civilian populations. For genocide, what you need, according to the U.N. 1948 resolution on the crime of genocide, is to say that it's the intent or to see the intent to destroy in whole or in part a national, ethical, racial or religious group as such. That is that the violence is intended, is intentional or with the intention of destroying the group, a particular group as such. Now, if we think about the case that is going on now, there have been statements by Israeli political leaders, by Israeli military leaders which have genocidal echoes about flattening of Gaza, removing the population out of Gaza, treating the people there as the bible instructed the Israelites to treat the Amalek, that is to kill the men, women and babies. So, intent, in fact, has been expressed by Israeli leaders. Whether this is happening on the ground, I'm not convinced that, right now, there is intentional killing of civilians, but there is totally disproportionate killing of civilians, disproportionate in a relationship to the military goals declared by Israel itself.

One has to remove it as a hegemon in order to move forward. But if the Israeli political leadership and other states were to speak about the next step that is of changing the relations between Israel and Palestinians and moving towards some resolution of that conflict, then that could spell a different policy also on the ground.

But I would say that in a larger framework, clearly, the people who are in the Israeli government now, there's some very radical people in government, people like Ben Gvir and Smotrich, those are people whose goal is to empty the country as much as possible. The country, I mean, mandatory Palestine. So, it includes the Gaza Strip and the West Bank, to empty it as much as possible of its Palestinian population and to settle it by Jewish settlers. If you think about it from that point of view, many of those people speak now of the war in Gaza as an opportunity, not as a tragedy, as an opportunity to finally implement their own political goal. So, as long as these people are in government, the danger of that being ethnic cleansing or genocide or combination thereof is high because that is the actual political goal. If they're removed from government and if Hamas is removed from the paradigm, then we can think about a completely different political scenario.",

But it is defined in a particular way, and it doesn't mean that war crimes or crimes against humanity are any better. They are just defined differently.

Why are you saying that the U.S. is failing to uphold international law? EL-HADDAD:  Well, it's -- the biggest burden, which -- burden of proof, which is proving intent to commit genocide has been proven for us in numerous statements by Israeli officials themselves. And our government here, the United States, has been abetting that, abetting the unfolding genocide that has already -- whose intent has already been proven by way of diplomatic cover, by way of $14 billion in aid and by way of rhetoric as well. So, you know, we have the military support, the diplomatic support, and so on, the political support. And so, that is what makes this circumstance -- this specific instance, so unique, so different than other, instances where the United States has provided unconditional support for Israel.",

I was asked to participate in a round table with Arab -- members of the Arab-American and Palestinian-American community in the State Department. I was also asked to participate in a -- later on at the height of the attacks on Gaza at the White House, which I declined, because frankly, it got to the point where it was feeling performative and not really bearing any real results. It was just something the administration was doing to be able to allay fears and say, we hear you, we feel you, but they don't. And it's -- the message has been delivered loud and clear that they've lost our votes in 2024. And these efforts, frankly, are falling flat amongst the Arab and Palestinian and Muslim communities in the United States.",

EL-HADDAD:  I keep saying that ceasefire has somehow become a dirty word that you see our politicians literally engaging in, you know, verbal acrobatics just to be able to avoid saying it, right? And the message that we keep getting from them, from different legislators that I've personally met with and officials, is that, oh, it's going to be bad optics, right? It's going to make it look like, you know, we're caving in And, you know, Biden even use that word. He said, we, he didn't see -- he didn't say, excuse me, Israel. Does that make, as he's suggesting, that that the United States is admitting that the United States is complicit in this? Who knows. But the fact remains that they consider a call for a ceasefire to be bad optics as though somehow Hamas would be winning, that they would be caving. But the reality is the -- a large number of Israelis themselves are now calling for a ceasefire, coming out and protesting, let alone, you know, Americans as well, because there's no winners in this. There's no winners in war.",

And considering the emphasis you'reputting on the way that the administration is talking about Palestinians and about the conflict, do condemnations matter and does it matter if President Biden condemns the actions of Israel or if you condemn the actions of Hamas? EL-HADDAD:  I think it sends a strong message, but I think what's more important again is actions, you know, actions to me speak louder than words. And the actions of our government so far have been subpar to nonexistent. We've only heard over and over again that your lives as Palestinians simply matter less to us than the lives of Israelis.

I just want to cite a couple of things that they've received more than 1,200 calls for help. This is in the context of the war that's happening right now, and that's a 216 percent increase over the previous year. Essentially, people are calling into this organization talking about anti-Arab bias in their lives. And what's your reaction to that? Have you been experiencing this? EL-HADDAD:  Unfortunately, it doesn't surprise me. I have personally experienced this. I, myself -- along with my daughter, I was attending a rally in Rockville, Maryland last week where -- a very peaceful rally, calling for a cease fire, where directly adjacent to us was a very vocal vitriolic counter protest that were shouting at us. And as you can see, I'm very visibly Muslim. Things like animals, barbarians, we're going to take your heads go back home. Murderous Muslims will kill your brothers. You're not welcome here and on and on. My own daughter experienced this when she was walking in Washington, D.C. a few weeks ago. She also wears hijab and somebody yelled at her baby murderer. She has faced significant pushback at her school here in Howard County, Maryland as well in trying to organize something as simple as a walkout to call for a ceasefire. I've received hate mail in my actual mailbox. Calling on Israel to kill every expletive, I don't want to say, who gives birth -- basically any woman who gives birth to future rats and, threatening words, saying to kill them all. This has become, unfortunately, the new normal, or I should say abnormal in our lives. We remain vigilant. But the unfortunate reality is at a time when I should be grieving my family -- and I've lost several family members in Gaza, direct family, as well as dozens of extended family -- I'm having to look over my back. And, you know, while it doesn't surprise me, the real problem here again is the way that the administration has gone about this. And it's a direct result, I would say, of the dehumanizing and racist rhetoric that Israel has been using to justify its massacres in Gaza that then our administration here has essentially been promoting regurgitating a lot of these lies. And that has a direct impact effect on not only Muslim- Americans and Palestinians, but as well as Arab-Americans and a lot of people of color as well, who are none of the above.",

I was actually in Boston and I was a graduate student. And they were terrifying times. I won't lie, especially, for Muslims who were not U.S. citizens, it was difficult for everyone. But I felt particularly vulnerable as a stateless Palestinian and was myself detained and threatened with deportation to where I have no idea at some point while I was pregnant with my son in Logan Airport. I'll never forget those days ever. And I tell that story to my children over and over to teach them to be resilient, to teach them to speak out, to teach them to seek due process. I actually filed complaints against the FBI and that bore fruit, to teach them never to give up. And I -- the message I give them, especially my daughter is the struggle is long and it is real and it is necessary. So, don't give up and don't get too comfortable because you have to not only speak out on behalf of yourself and your people, but on anyone who is the victim of a grave injustice and -- of which there are many that our government here has perpetrated. And so, that's, in summary, the message I give her without victimizing her in any way or giving her this mentality that she's somehow a victim.

What do you mean by that?EL-HADDAD:  I think this really hit home for her for the first time, meaning what was happening to Gaza and to her family in Gaza and how that was directly related to herself here as a young Palestinian, visibly Muslim-American. And so, I call it her coming of age moment in the sense that she was suddenly in the throes of all of this, at the receiving end of hateful vitriol that was being hurled at her at the receiving end of intimidating tactics as she was trying to do something as simple as, you know, call for an end to hostilities. And she couldn't believe that this was happening and I -- you know, I didn't want to tell her, well, welcome to the club, but that's why I call it her coming of age moment. She suddenly realized this is real and there are real threats and, you know, people will say things to her that are mean and hateful and try to silence her when she simply tries to speak out in support of freedom and equality for her people. So, this is the unfortunate reality we live in, but again, it's a moment that I hope she will learn from and, you know, a teachable moment. It's unfortunate that it had to come in this way.
