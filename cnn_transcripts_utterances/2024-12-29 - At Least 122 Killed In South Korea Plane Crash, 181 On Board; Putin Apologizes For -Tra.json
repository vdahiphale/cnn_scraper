Officials now say that nearly everyone on board a plane that crashed in South Korea has died. 181 people were traveling from Bangkok on a Jeju Air flight. So far, rescue workers have confirmed the deaths of 96 people.Two crew members have been rescued, but they say that the remaining passengers and crew are presumed dead. The Boeing 737-800 jet crash landed at Muan International Airport. Firefighters believe the accident was caused by a landing gear malfunction. Now, this video shows the plane dragging along the runway with no landing gear in sight. Moments later, the plane burst into flames. South Korean officials say hundreds of emergency personnel are at the crash site to help identify the remaining victims and to record the exact locations where people have died. CNN Correspondent Mike Valerio is following this breaking news from Seoul. Mike, just tragic news at a time when so many families are celebrating the holidays. What is the latest?",

      "sentences": "So, Kim, I think an interesting detail that's just come into our bureau here in Seoul, we heard from the CEO of the airline, Jeju Air. And he told reporters a short time ago that this aircraft had no history of accidents or anything that would suggest that some disaster, some catastrophe like this would happen.Now, of course, the most arresting piece of video that we have is what we all have just witnessed, the aircraft, the Boeing 737-800, approaching the runway with seemingly no landing gear deployed from its belly and then careening into an embankment and then crashing into that embankment. We do not show you the fireball in that moment because it is the end of life for perhaps 179 people on board. We want to be respectful of the families and everything that they have been through. Speaking of the families, so many of them are congregated at this airport, which is about three and a half hours south of Seoul, where we're coming of you -- coming to you from right now, Kim. And we have reports from the journalists who are gathered there that there are people who are just absolutely inconsolable and who are wailing and who just, you know, cannot wait a single moment for first responders to identify their loved ones. On last count, there have only been five people who have been identified publicly in the briefing room where families are converging at this airport. So in terms of how we got here, this is a Jeju Air Boeing 737-800. We should point out, not a MAX aircraft. It's a slightly older version of the 737. It takes off from Bangkok just after 2:00 a.m. local time and is due in here in South Korea in the 9:00 hour. So everything appears to be fine based on the open source intelligence that we've been able to see up until the very final moments of its approach. Now, we're working here at CNN to bring in video that shows, or I should say appears to show, perhaps some sort of explosion near one of the engines. We don't have that video yet. We just want to do everything we can to be sure it's authentic. But it is playing nonstop, I should tell you, on TVs here in South Korea, showing perhaps an explosion near one of the engines. And one of the lead first responders has brought in the possibility of bird strike, Kim, into the equation, saying, I have the quote right here, \"The cause of the accident --",

It's a wildly popular airline here in South Korea. Again, the CEO telling reporters within the past hour that there was no issue, no series of problems or accidents with this aircraft. But to that end, we could expect to see people from Boeing, specifically from Washington State, where the aircraft was manufactured coming here to the Korean Peninsula with, again, potentially the NTSB. This is how investigations like this have unfolded before, to just make sure that this was an incident specific to the aircraft and not something that the wider fleet of 737-800s would have to worry about.

But the second thing that really concerns me is that these aircraft, the 737, one of the most reliable and well-used aircraft, not only in the United States, but in Europe. And it is capable of landing without landing gear down, and in an emergency situation like this.My concern is that after it touches down, that there are blockades and items on -- near the runway that they collided with that may have caused this severe explosion once it hit the ground. So a well- designed airport would not have had any kind of blockades there, the aircraft could have landed and slide off the runway onto the grass, and it should not have been able to -- it should not have had any interference with these blockades. So that would be the first thing as an investigator I would be looking at, is certainly this tragic loss of life perhaps could have been avoided had the airport been designed and prepared for this type of emergency landing.",

So that would be my first step. The second would be the flight data recorder itself to tell me what was going on with the systems on board the aircraft. You have to rule those things out first if there was something that failed on the aircraft. And as you mentioned, Boeing and the NTSB will most likely be there at the investigation as well to determine if there's anything specific -- anything beyond that specific aircraft that needs to be dealt with fleet-wide, which would be done immediately.

Investigations are still ongoing, but nearby Ukrainian drone attacks in the moments preceding the crash have led some officials to believe that the plane may have been downed mistakenly by Russian anti-aircraft defenses, with officials in Azerbaijan saying that the plane came under external, physical, and technical interferences while in Russian airspace. Meanwhile, several aviation experts and U.S. officials have said that perforations seen in the fuselage are consistent with shrapnel damage from an explosion, but the cause of the holes in the wreckage has not yet been confirmed. Investigators are continuing to assess the evidence, including two black box recorders which were recovered from the wreckage, as well as, of course, eyewitness accounts. Remarkably, 29 people out of 67 on board the flight survived the crash, some of whom filmed their final moments on the flight. One survivor describing a loud bang being heard and felt before the plane began to descend.

The voice recorder, which is the second component of the black box system, according to our reporting, has not been found yet.But the data recorder recovered. So that will be used in concert, assumedly, one can only hope, with hoping that the two people who survived this crash are in good enough condition and will ultimately survive and be able to tell investigators what exactly happened. To that end, we have new reporting from the land ministry here in South Korea. They gave a briefing about what they've been able to find out so far. And I'm just going to read you part of the Korean translation of what we heard a short time ago. So from this briefing, it says, quote, \"In the first round of investigation, the authorities listened to the communications between the pilot and the control tower before the crash. The jet initially attempted to land on runway number one when the control tower warned of bird crash. Not long after, the pilot called mayday. The control tower then instructed the plane to land in the opposite direction to land on runway 19. The pilot followed the instruction. And as he was landing the plane, it hit the localizer and then crashed into the wall.\" So the localizer is part of the instrumentation on a plane that helps the pilot to land correctly when we're talking about the horizontal orientation to line up with the runway. So the biggest takeaway from these quotes translated from Korean into English is that the pilot called mayday as this flight was ending. And that the control tower warned of bird crash, which gives credence to some of the things that we had been hearing from the chief of the fire department from the locality where this happened, that bird strike is being considered a possibility that perhaps began a chain of events that led to the cataclysmic crash that we've all witnessed earlier today, Kim.",

Now, whether or not it's a little bit unclear, whether or not the undercarriage collapsed on landing, or whether the undercarriage was not deployed at all, this is a really serious issue that I think, you know, obviously investigators will be very much focused on.Fundamental system that works on these aircraft and all aircraft, you know, literally tens of thousands of times a day, the undercarriage lever goes down. You get three greens. If you don't get three greens, you get a red or three reds or whatever, depending on which part of the gear is deployed. If that's the case, if you got reds, then you talk to the control tower and they will visually tell you whether or not the gear is down or not. They had perfect weather, so a flyby of the control tower would have been easily possible. And then if the gear had not deployed, then the next stage in an emergency like that would be that all the fire engines would be laying foam all over the runway and there would be all sorts of fire and emergency protocols put in place and equipment ready for this particular type of landing. So, the only explanation at this stage is that for some reason, either the pilots forgot to deploy the undercarriage, and again, there's warning systems for that as well. There's a ground proximity warning system that tells the pilots that the ground is too close and that the undercarriage is not deployed. So there are multiple warning systems in place to prevent such an accident. So obviously way too early to tell. The black boxes will now become critical. That's if the pilot have not -- if the pilot did not survive this accident, any control tower conversations as well. This one's perplexing. You've got a beautiful fine day.

These images released by the National Archives after a lawsuit from a right-wing pro-Trump legal organization, and the photos show what we've known for a while, but we've never seen, that there was at least one photo op between Vice President Joe Biden in 2013 during a official visit to China where he met some of Hunter Biden's business partners from the private equity firm, DHR Partners.You can see the pictures of Hunter Biden introducing his father to these Chinese business executives, and they all posed, all smiles for this photo op. Now, not only are we seeing these images for the very first time, but we also saw pictures of Joe Biden introducing his son to top Chinese government officials, including Chinese President Xi Jinping, one of the most powerful figures in the world, as well as the vice president of China at the time, who was also participating in some of those bilateral meetings. So this is important because these pictures of Joe meeting some of his son's business partners undercuts the unequivocal denials that President Biden has previously offered, where he said that there was never any contact between him and his son's business affairs. Now, we've known for a while that those denials haven't really held up. They weren't true. They weren't accurate because it has come to light that there were some dinners, some phone calls, and some meet and greets, and some photo ops like the pictures that you saw here. That being said, Hunter Biden himself testified to Congress earlier this year, and he said, yes, there were photo ops. Yes, maybe I put him on speakerphone once or twice, but we never discussed any substantive business, and he was not involved in the financial arrangements whatsoever. A former Hunter Biden business partner here in the U.S. testified that he thought Hunter was selling the illusion of access, but not actually selling access. Now, Republicans have argued that pictures like these and all of these contacts amount to a corrupt and illegal influence peddling scheme. But of course, I have to note that the Justice Department spent years investigating Hunter Biden and never charged him with violating any lobbying laws or any sort of corruption whatsoever. Hunter Biden's attorney released a statement about these pictures saying, quote, \"These attacks trying to twist these images into something they are not is just more of the same old tired, misinformation spin from some Republicans who can't let go of their ridiculous conspiracy theories\".
