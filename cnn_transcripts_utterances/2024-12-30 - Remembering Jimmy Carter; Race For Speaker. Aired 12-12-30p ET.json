I'll talk to an acclaimed journalist who covered the 39th president for more than five decades.Plus a, \"complete and total endorsement.\" Donald Trump just offered that belated Christmas gift to Mike Johnson, who's fighting to keep his gavel when Republicans choose their next speaker this week. And Musk versus MAGA, the richest man in the world says he's willing to \"go to war\" on a critical immigration issue. And Donald Trump says he's siding with his billionaire bestie over his hardline anti- immigration base. I'm Phil Mattingly in for Dana Bash. Let's go behind the headlines Inside Politics. \"The bond over our common humanity is stronger than the divisiveness of our fears and prejudices,\" former President Jimmy Carter delivered those powerful words 22 years ago as he accepted the Nobel Peace Prize for his accomplishments after leaving the White House. You can see the flags flying half staff where Carter held the oval office from 1977 to 1981. And while he lost reelection, the 39th president left an enduring legacy as a champion for peace and human rights here in the US and across the globe. CNN's Ryan Young is in Carter's hometown of Plains, Georgia, where he died peacefully yesterday surrounded by his adoring family. Ryan, that community was so critical to the former president's life, his role in the White House and afterwards. What are people saying there on the ground?",

      "sentences": "Hey, Phil, this is a tough moment, obviously here in Plains. A lot of people celebrating the former president because they really see him as a son of this entire state. So as we walk through this area, people have so many stories about the Jimmy Carter that they knew.Across the street at the center over there, the man said Jimmy told him to stay open the day that he died because he wanted to make sure tourists had a place to go. We do know the memorial service is set for January 9th. And through that, there'll be a celebration of plains, and that's what the former president wanted. There are so many people who are expected to come from across the world to pay their respects to a man who did so much with his life, not only as president but obviously after being president. We talked to the mayor who has talked about how not only was he a good friend to this area, but he was someone that everyone here had some sort of interaction with. So as we move forward, Phil, we will be hearing stories on a day to day basis about how Jimmy Carter was connected to the state of Georgia.",

Ryan Young for us in Plains.I want to turn to the former anchor of this program, used to be called \"Judy Woodruff's Inside Politics.\" She's now a special correspondent for PBS NewsHour and has been covering Jimmy Carter since 1970 when he was the governor of Georgia. This photo we're going to pull up right now, it's from February of 1976 when Judy was questioning then presidential candidate Jimmy Carter. Judy, thanks so much for coming back to \"Inside Politics.\" I want to start with kind of this moment. I'm always struck by the lead of an obituary, which sounds a little morbid, but it tells you a lot. The length of it, which is Jimmy Carter's isn't just that he was the 39th president or that he was a governor. It is about six, seven, eight clauses in one, which I think underscores the legacy that he left even after the White House.",

I assumed he was talking about something else. But when you were covering that race, his second race for governor back in 1970, did you ever foresee what would happen over the course of the next decade?",

He had served in the Navy under Admiral Hyman Rickover, nuclear submarine commander. And he brought all that, if you will, engineering background, along with this fierce determination to do what he could to improve the lives of people across the state of Georgia. And he, as I say, he beat a former governor to win that race.There was always this -- he wasn't a natural politician and he's not somebody who loved going around shaking hands. But when you were with him, he could fixate those blue eyes on you as if you were the only person in the room. And that was a gift that I know served him well as he then went on and as you know, in 1976, to run for president, winning the Iowa caucuses, going practically door to door, spending the night in people's homes in Iowa -- coming in second, I should say, after undeclared in Iowa. But that was enough to catapult him. And again, defeating all expectations, he was someone who was constantly underestimated.",

The country was dealing with inflation, high price for gasoline, and then, of course, the last year of his presidency was consumed with the Iran hostage crisis. He was never able to get those hostages, American hostages, home until Ronald Reagan had just been, had just taken office. And those were the things that consumed us then.But in the years since, there has clearly been a reappraisal, a reminder that the Camp David accords, the peace agreement between Israel and Egypt which Jimmy Carter was determined was going to happen. It took him 13 days at Camp David, but he the force behind that peace agreement that lives to this day. The Panama Canal treaties, another enormous achievement during his presidency. The fact that he put human rights on the map, the appointment of Paul Volcker to be the chairman of the Federal Reserve, someone who by the way went on to raise interest rates to fight inflation, which hurt Jimmy Carter politically. But Carter did what he thought was right for the economy. So there is a new appreciation today of what he was able to -- excuse me, accomplish as president as well as the enormous achievements of his post presidency.",

      "sentences": "In the nearly 50 years since Jimmy Carter won the 1976 presidential race, a lot has changed. There have obviously been technological advances of the internet, cellphones, the entire world of streaming. But politically, even more is different.Take a look at Jimmy Carter's 1976 electoral map. That's right, Texas is blue, California is Red. Now let's fast forward to November of 2024 and Donald Trump's winning map. The red and the blue, they've essentially completely inverted on some level. The question is, how did it happen? So to get into all of this, I'm joined by some incredible reporters. The New Yorker, Susan Glasser, CNN's Kristen Holmes, and the New York Times, Carl Hulse. Carl, I want to start with you because I think everybody tries to figure out in the wake of an election, particularly one like we just saw, is this a realignment? Is this a one off? What does this all mean going forward? When you talk to people on Capitol Hill every single day, what's their view in terms of what this signifies going forward, 2024? CARL HULSE, CHIEF WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT, New York Times: Well, I mean, our politics is cyclical, right, and you can see that from that map. Things just keep on evolving and changing, and there seems to be a backlash. You know, when I've been thinking about Jimmy Carter, I thought, well, there's the guy who paved the way for Bill Clinton, right? But Bill Clinton, in some ways, paved the way for Newt Gingrich and those politics. And I think what struck me about the Carter situation is the unity around him right now, right? It shows how polarized our politics have become because it's striking how everyone has come together and finally made the decision, you know what, Jimmy Carter was a good man and we can all agree on that. We might not agree much more about our politics, but we can agree on that thing. But it's going to be interesting to see how the state funeral sort of interacts with the other quadrennial things that are about to be happening here in new congress, the certification of the election, the inauguration. It's going to be very interesting to me.",

But I do think one of the interesting things about comparing when Jimmy Carter got elected to what we're seeing right now is still what was going on with the government and the people of the United States of America, which is kind of similar.If you actually look at the election process at the time, you had the Vietnam War, you had people who were disenfranchised with what they were seeing in the government, and they saw Jimmy Carter as a potential change, an outsider. And it's not that different than what we saw in this election, which were people who were very unhappy with the current state of the government, in particular, not just the economy, which was also an issue then, but just the government structure. And then you saw this person who claims to be an outsider, not necessarily an actual outsider, but claims to be an outsider, coming in and saying they want to disrupt the system. And I do think that's one thing that is similar in the two. However, obviously these are two completely different people that we're looking at.

      "sentences": "Well, first of all, we should note that is an enduring accomplishment in a region that has not had enduring examples of peace, the peace between Israel and Egypt has held. And I think that in and of itself makes it worth studying.Now, there were, you know, years that led up to it. And yet you mentioned my colleague, Larry Wright's amazing play, which I recommend to everybody, \"Thirteen Days.\" But what it shows is that Carter's personal determination really was important, that it was not the foreordained conclusion that we might think that it was, given how long Israel and Egypt have managed to keep that peace. So that's number one, I think that's important. Number two, Carter, he determined to expend his own political credibility, his own time in office on making this peace deal in the Middle East. He shocked his vice president, Walter Mondale, on his very first day in office by saying that he was personally going to be invested in this seemingly hopeless cause. I think that's really notable how presidents choose to spend their time. But it also goes to this political dilemma that we're talking about, which is how is it that Carter became a one term president, in part it was by flouting the demands of politics and saying, I'm going to do what I perceived to be right. And that, by the way, is the major difference between Jimmy Carter and the incoming occupant of the Oval Office, which is that people responding not to their concerns about the government per se of the Watergate era, but about the corruption of one man in the presidency, Richard Nixon. And it was Carter's personal integrity, his morals, his values, and the perception of that, I think that helped him to become the president. Partially why we're going to be celebrating his extraordinary life over the next couple of weeks is for that reason, is because of who he was as a person even if sometimes when that worked against him as a politician.",

Well, not for the one House Republican who has already said he won't vote for Johnson. Congressman Thomas Massie just posting on X, \"I respect and support President Trump, but his endorsement of Mike Johnson is going to work out about as well as his endorsement of Speaker Paul Ryan.

So if you're in that position, I mean, you could see a repeat of the Kevin McCarthy marathon. I just -- it's hard to -- but I think Trump is recognizing something right now, is that he can't have this instability as he starts out, right? You know, he's trying to get things done. He's trying to pull Mike Johnson across the finish line. I'm just not sure he's going to be enough.
