Just ahead.Rage and anger, Yulia Navalnaya speaks out against Putin's regime after the unexplained death of her imprisoned husband. Trying to regroup. The future of Ukraine in jeopardy after a Russian victory and stalled USA. And several killed in the latest Israeli airstrike will show you how the situation remains dire for children in Gaza. Alexei Navalny's widow is laying the blame squarely on Vladimir Putin for her husband's death. She is accusing Russian authorities of hiding the opposition leader's body so they can cover up the cause. The 47 year old Navalny died suddenly on Friday in an Arctic penal colony. Seemingly in good spirits one day earlier in a video court appearance. Navalny's spokesperson says authorities will not release the body for at least two weeks as they perform a chemical examination. His widow says they're just buying time until traces of his poisoning disappear from his system. Yulia Navalnaya is vowing to pick up her husband's cause and will fight for a happy, beautiful Russia. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) YULIA NAVALNAYA, ALEXEI NAVALNY'S WIDOW (through translator): I ask you to share your rage, rage, anger and hatred with me towards those who are daring enough to kill our future and I address you with Alexei's words which I believe it is not a shame to do. It's not a shame to do little but it's a shame not to do anything. It's a shame to make yourself intimidated. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Now, that is dead on arrival because the U.S. says that it will veto it. It's unclear that this U.S. draft resolution would have any more luckbecause, of course, there are other veto-wielding members of the Security Council. But what the U.S. is saying in this draft resolution is that there should be a temporary ceasefire and that all the hostages should be released. And it also says that the reason that it's planning this resolution or planning to table this before the U.N. Security Council is to forestall this mooted Israeli ground operation in Rafah. It says because it wants to avoid the possibility of additional displacement of Palestinians, many, of course, of whom have been displaced multiple times to eventually end up in Rafah. It's particularly concerned about this displacement pushing Palestinians over the border into Egypt and the implications for peace and security, with the unsaid words being the concern about the decades- old peace treaty between Israel and Egypt. Now, at the same time as all this is going on, for the first time we've had an Israeli war cabinet member, Benny Gantz, drawing a direct line between these hostage negotiations, which seem to be at an impasse, and this mooted ground operation in Rafa with Benny Gantz saying that if the hostages, more than 100 of whom who were kidnapped on October the 7th during those terrorist attacks led by Hamas, if they are not released in time for Ramadan on March the 10th, then that ground operation will proceed.

An expert tells CNN this can cause physical ailments, including a flat face or crossed eyes, as well as other genetic mutations that could weaken the tiger's defenses against disease.Well, joining me now to discuss this and more is Uma Ramakrishnan, a professor and senior fellow at DBT/Wellcome Trust India Alliance, an independent charity that funds research in health and biomedical sciences in India. And we're great to have you with us. Tell us what makes these tigers golden? UMA RAMAKRISHNAN, PROF. AND SR. FELLOW, DBT/WELLCOME TRUST INDIA ALLIANCE:  So basically, it's a mutation or a spelling mistake in the DNA when the DNA is copied. Work from 2017 based on captive golden tigers in the U.S. showed that a mutation in the CORIN gene, a single letter spelling mistake, causes this unique phenotype or appearance. However, we do not know whether it is the same mutation, the same spelling mistake, which is responsible for the golden tiger we are seeing in Kaziranga, you know, in the last few days.

So it is either inbreeding or genetic drift, you know, chance changes in allele frequencies. And also, I should caution that before we jump to labeling inbreeding as negative, that's actually inbreeding depression when you see health effects on individuals. And we have seen inbreeding depression in captive individuals of tigers, not necessarily golden, but, you know, other phenotypes like white tigers. And this is why, for example, zoos have decided not to selectively breed for these phenotypes. Now, we don't know what exactly is happening in the wild.

So mapping that, you know, the genetic variant to how it looks is really a challenge even in humans. As you know, we don't know what genetic basis for, like, say, a disease is very easily.

The first thing I'll say is this was not a study into which brains are better.It was very much using this new A.I. technology, which is really interesting to go over lots of different scans and see if there is a difference between men's brains and women's brains. Because, you know, in the wider world, lots of people have made up their minds, of course. But within science, it's been a massive argument for a very long time. And what they found that there were parts of the brain where there were key differences. So in terms of learning and how we respond to rewards in particular, and they had 90 percent accuracy. So this does actually resolve a massive debate that's been going on in science for many years. So it does feel like a bit of a breakthrough. And it has been published in this very well-respected journal, which was peer reviewed. So I think a big talking point in science today.",

So why some women, some men may experience different types of disorder and whether that's connected to the way their brains are effectively wired. So it could have quite a profound effect on certain neurological illnesses, if I can call it that, or disorders. If they want to treat that, then they will be treating men and women differently. So that's really where all of this came from.But I think, you know, there will be some conversations out there as well. Much more, you know, universal conversations about how men and women react differently to different situations around the world. But as I say, I'm not getting into that.",
