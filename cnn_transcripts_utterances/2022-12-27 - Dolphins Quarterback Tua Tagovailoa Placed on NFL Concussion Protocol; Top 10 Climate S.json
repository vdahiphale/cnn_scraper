And then, you know, whatever those circumstances are after you deal with after, but it's about the human being and making sure he's squared away.(END VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "Well, now, it's a health issue and this goes back to the Buffalo game where he experienced the first head injury and was allowed to come back out from halftime and continue to play.And then subsequently, I mean, four days later playing on Thursday night, he had that gruesome head injury and concussion that we all witnessed and it was very shocking. The fact that he came back a couple of weeks later and continued to play, now he has, you know, these compound concussion issues. There is something there that he definitely needs to take this serious. Because whenever you're dealing with your brain, your head, those types of injuries, everyone is different, people bounce back differently at different times. But this is something that he's been dealing with since that first initial Buffalo game. And, you know, football comes secondary to life and your standard of living and you know most current players don't realize that. So, you as a team, as doctors you have to protect players from themselves and I'm not seeing a lot of that right now.",

We know that Tua Tagovailoa had discussed his symptoms with doctors but we weren't quite sure where he stands on whether he wants -- we're taught to play, right. When you're an athlete you're taught to play through the pain. How much say does the player have in making these kind of decisions?",

      "sentences": "Well, the player has a lot of say. You know, I've in the history of my 13 year career I played with several injuries that had no business playing with but that's the game. This is a team sport and when you play an intricate part of that team like a quarterback, you know your team is better with you there. It's hard for a player to leave those guys in the locker room hanging. So, sometimes we have to protect us from ourselves and that's what needs to happen here.If Tua is having these problems over and over again, it would be in my opinion the best interest for him to not play the rest of the season. And I know they're on the cusp of going to the playoffs and things like that, but at a certain point health becomes bigger than the game.",

Because there have been updated helmets that we've seen the NFL mandate for practices, some updated play helmets, you know that's one thing, right. But is that really enough? Because when you look at what can happen to someone who gets CTE and who's been hit over and over and had concussions over and over, their life can be shortened or is really badly impacted.",

      "sentences": "Yes, and every player is different, like I said earlier. Some players are more susceptible to having concussions and lingering symptoms. It seems like this is going on with Tua, especially since this past game. No one can pinpoint when this happened.And the fact that after the game the whole next day he goes in and then talks to doctors about some issues that he's having regarding the concussion. That's the alarming part for me because we didn't see anything. I know he got sacked one time or he got brought down to the ground and hit his head. He seemed fine. But now we don't know. So, now there's a situation here where, you know, Tua may be the type of person that these concussions have a longer, lingering effect that can ultimately affect his standard of living moving forward. SIDNER: OK, there's a fierce argument going on in my family and other families, because every time you see someone that gets a concussion, someone that has one of these head injury and you know it could affect them for the rest of their life potentially. Do you think that parents are starting to say, like, I'm not going to let my kid play football anymore? Do you think you'll start to see, unless something is done for the health of the players to try and deal with these concussions. Do you think you'll start to see fewer and fewer people wanting to play youth football, for example.",

But a global pledge to phase out fossil feels was stonewalled by oil-producing nations. At number five, an increasingly unpredictable water cycle brought the kind of floods seen once every thousand years. From Dallas, where they got a summer's worth of rain in a day. To Death Valley, which set a record with two inches of rain in one of the driest spots on Earth. 43 lives were lost in flash floods and mudslides across six Kentucky counties.",
