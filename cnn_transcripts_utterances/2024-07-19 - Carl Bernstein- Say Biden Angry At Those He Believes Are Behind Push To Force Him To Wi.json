      "sentences": "Tonight on 360, new reporting from legendary journalist Carl Bernstein on President Biden's anger at those trying to force him to withdraw.Also, new details on the mindset of the gunman and lapses in security after the attempted assassination of the former president last weekend. And later, how a simple software update turned into one of the biggest global tech meltdowns in history. Good evening. We start with breaking news. That new reporting from veteran journalist, Carl Bernstein on the immediate future of President Biden's campaign and the powerbrokers and major donors inside his own party trying to get the president to stop. It comes as a source tells CNN that President Biden, at home in Delaware and recovering from COVID is, \"seething at the pressure campaign and those behind it.\"   Today, nearly a dozen Democratic lawmakers came out in a steady progression calling on the former president to withdraw, 34 congressional Democrats now want him to give up his campaign. A Democratic lawmaker tells CNN that House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries is not discouraging more members from doing so. Today's defections include senior and younger members of the Democratic Caucus, progressive member -- progressives, also members of the Hispanic and Black Caucuses, as well as a third and fourth senator. Also today, Congressman Seth Moulton, who called on President Biden to exit about two weeks ago expanded on his reasons in an opinion piece in \"The Boston Globe,\" writing, \"More recently, I saw him in a small group at Normandy for the 80th anniversary of D-Day. For the first time, he didn't seem to recognize me. Of course, that can happen as anyone ages, but as I watched the disastrous debate a few weeks ago, I have to admit that what I saw in Normandy was part of a deeper problem.\" Thats a comment that could renew concerns about Biden's ability to serve another four years. But also, unlike most other pleas to withdraw concerns about his ability to serve now. Today's rounded defections follow more uncomfortable moments for the Biden campaign this week including an interview with the BET Network that was taped Tuesday, in which he appeared to stumble over the name of his Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN, (D) PRESIDENT OF UNITED STATES OF AMERICA: Because he didn't get it, because I named the Secretary of Defense, a Black man, I named Ketanji Brown because of the people I've named.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JEN O'MALLEY DILLON, BIDEN CAMPAIGN CHAIR: Absolutely, the president is in this race, you've heard him say that time and time again. He's also hearing from voters and what they're saying is, we've got you Joe. We are in this, stay with us.

Because the message that these donors and bundlers wanted to convey to Chuck Schumer, especially to Hakeem Jeffries, was, we must have this election go forth without Joe Biden being our candidate and you need to do more Mr. Leader. Mr. Leaders, plural, to ensure that he is not going to be the candidate. So, we have kind of a retribution almost felt in the air and it's not a very pretty scene.",

But there also is a movement among Biden's aides and those who have served him for so long, they want to see this end with a pretty picture. They want to see this end with Joe Biden and the Democratic Party looking like winners, not like losers. And right now, there is a kind of chaos that is prevailing and people are looking for a way out. They are talking about Monday as a possible time for the president to, in some way, make an announcement or have an announcement be made, that he will no longer be the candidate for president of the United States of his party, not a definite Monday pick, but it's looking that way.

It's the only issue Democrats have then and now -- who can beat Trump?Biden won 44 primaries and caucuses 44. He had never won one before in two campaigns for the presidency. He won all of them because Democrats decided he was the best one to beat Trump. Now, Democrats are reminding that he can't beat Trump. The difference is not because he's had a better -- but terrific president. It's because they think he's too old and the vast overwhelming majority of Americans think he is too old. There's not a strategy to get around that. And so yes, the legacy -- look at Nancy Pelosi, she's even a year or two older than the president. She handed off the gavel. She built a very strong bench, handed off power to Hakeem Jeffries and others. The Earth turned on its axis. The party succeeded. Everything was great and President Biden has built a terrific bench. It starts with the vice president but I can name you half-a-dozen governors, who also would beat Trump. I think Kamala Harris beats Trump, and I think a lot -- Whitmer, Cooper, Beshear, Wes Moore in Maryland, Josh Shapiro in Pennsylvania. I could go on.

Hillary Clinton had a huge head start and Bernie Sanders had a huge head start.And the question was never whether Joe Biden could be a strong general election candidate. The question was, could he win the nomination? And by most estimates, the answer was, no. So, just because you give people advice that they don't want to hear, it doesn't mean that you don't care about them or that you don't honor them, or anything like that.

Nobody is doing Joe Biden a favor right now by telling him that he can win this race, that Maria talks about the grassroots, you showed the -- I think this reflects what's going on out there, 65 percent of Democrats think he should step out of the race. These elected officials who are being lightly dismissed here; they have to win among that very grassroot population that we're talking about. And they're hearing from their constituents because at the end of the day, the thing that's important is, do we defeat Donald Trump? That is what is important and what gives you the best chance to defeat Donald Trump. That's what Democrats are asking themselves, and they've -- they are despairing about what they've seen in the last few weeks with the president and they think that we need a change to do that. There are 12 other new members of Congress who came out today and asked him to step down because they're worried that hell not only lose, but also that there'll be losses up and down the line. Some of them are people who served with him for many, many years, like Sherrod Brown of Ohio. You can't be mad at all these people. They are not all people who are hostile to you. Certainly, Barack Obama has love and affection for Joe Biden and deep appreciation for what he did over eight years as vice president. But love and affection may lead you to give advice that he doesn't want to hear. And I hope that he gets past if he is angry as Carl suggests, that he gets past this anger and recognizes that this isn't all about -- it's not about, all about him, and it's certainly not a condemnation of him.

But at a security screening point, when you see a range finder that's used in making ballistic calculations, that should set off alarms. And it did. They broadcast over the radio after he left the secure area where they knew once he went through the mags, he wasn't armed. But he was carrying this thing and they said, keep an eye on him. Of course, he ends up way outside the secure area. You know, all of those buildings away later. And then, of course, he manages to sneak up there, to the roof.",

More to learn.Today, in Butler County, Pennsylvania, we want you to know hundreds of people gathered to pay respect to Corey Comperatore, who was killed as he protected his wife and two daughters during the Trump rally last weekend. Motorcycles, fire trucks made their way through the area to honor the former fire chief. His members of the community line the roads, many holding signs. This casket was draped with an American flag on top of one of the fire trucks. And as a tribute, the procession made one last ride by his fire station. A private service was held at a church. Corey Comperatore was 50 years old. This Sunday night, be sure to watch my weekend show, \"The Whole Story,\" for a deeper look at America's long and bloody history of political violence and its motivations.

Four presidents have been assassinated in our history and many others have either been violently attacked or nearly assassinated. Her father nearly assassinated and she said, we are not a nation that is a peaceful nation all the time. When you look at our political history, it's actually from almost the very beginning. We were a history -- we had a history of violence. And so she said, we've got to look at ourselves. She said, I looked at my timeline after Donald Trump was nearly assassinated. And she said, people that I know and care for and know are good people. We're saying some heinous things. She goes, I had to stop looking at it. I was so disturbed. And the other thing that really bothered her is when she saw what the crowd did after the attempted assassination in Pennsylvania of former President Trump, where the crowd turned to the media and started saying F you and being really vitriolic with the media, blaming the media. She said, there is a man who has been killed here. A father, a firefighter who had been killed and two others who were terribly injured. And then you had a president nearly assassinated and this is your response to your fellow Americans. So she was really disturbed and she was the one that said, I think we're at or maybe even potentially worse than the 60s. We are going to see this reverberate through the country and she's worried there's going to be more violence.",
