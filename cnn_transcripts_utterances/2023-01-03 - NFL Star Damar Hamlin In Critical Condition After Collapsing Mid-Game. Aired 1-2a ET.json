He tackled the Bengals wide receiver Tee Higgins, stood up, but then collapsed. Buffalo Bill's team trainers got to Hamlet within 10 seconds after he collapsed. An ambulance was brought onto the field, and he was administered CPR and also, we are told, defibrillators, which indicates possibly, and again, we don't have any specific information, but possibly that it has something to do with his heart. That is why you do CPR and the defibrillator. We have a lot to get to this hour. Joining me now is CNN contributor Bob Costas, who's on the phone, and CNN sports anchor Coy Wire. Coy, I do want to start with you because you were just part of this NFL conference call where they made clear they don't have any specific updates on Damar Hamlin's medical condition, which is something I think we are all waiting for. But they did provide some new information. Coy what did they tell you?",

We can see how hard this is for you to see what happened on the field, because you've been on that field, you've been in these situations. And, yes, it's a game, and yes, you're all superstar athletes, but you're human beings. And all these human beings saw this happen before their eyes to someone they care about. They care a lot about.Bob Costas, I want to bring you into this discussion and again, I want to be clear. What we're all concerned about and what we all want to know is about Damar Hamlin's condition. And we just don't have any information about that at this time other than we're told he's in critical condition. He's in the University of Cincinnati Hospital, which is one of the great facilities in this country. He's in a terrific place to get the best care, surrounded by loved ones. We know his mother was at the game. Some of his teammates have gone by to the hospital. We're not sure if they're still there. But, Bob, to the moment that Coy is talking about the football side of it, which admittedly is the less important side to see a game postponed like this, it isn't something we've seen before. This is a moment.",

Their primary concern, their primary concern along with everyone else is Damar Hamlin's health.And Coy, as we've been hearing, the Bills are on their way back. The team plane is going back to Buffalo from Cincinnati. Some players will stay behind to be with their friend Damar Hamlin, but what do you think that's got to be like to get onto that plane to leave, to go back to Buffalo?",

I mentioned my teammate who was paralyzed, Kevin Everett, he was a teammate, tight end rather from the University of Miami. And we continued to play that game somehow try to put the blinders on and have that next snap mentality and power through the game. And then I just remembered I wanted to go home and call my parents and be there with my wife and hug her extra tight.You know, it's going to be a very difficult plane ride home for those players. A lot of them probably won't sleep tonight because we saw it happen on TV, John. We saw replays. But you don't see what these players and coaches are seeing when you're there on the field and you're standing just feet away from your teammate. I've seen eyes rolling back in heads. I've seen arms and hands quivering and shaking uncontrollably. I've heard noises coming from teammates that you just don't want to hear. So, it's going to be really tough for those guys tonight and for the rest of the season praying for Damar Hamlin that he will be OK and that the team can rally around him and his family and give them all the support they need. Maybe he'll be back on the field, on the sidelines with them as they continue to play the rest of the season.",

That's the Bills coach Sean McDermott there, quarterback Josh Allen, Stefon Diggs also there.It's got to be really hard for all of them. Coy standby, if you will, and Bob, stick around too. We now have with us Adam Benigni, who's the sports director of Buffalo television station WGRZ, who was at the game. Thank you so much for being with us. And look, let me just first ask you because what everyone is so desperate for at this point is any kind of information about Damar Hamlin and his condition, anything you're hearing from your sources or people within the team.",

And the secondary has had to step up and has done a very good job, you know, proving himself and his talent on the football field this year.But his -- I believe I heard you earlier last hour when I was on with you for a brief time or dialed in for a brief time. You were talking about his charity with the toys and the amount of money. I don't have the update on what's been raised, but it's just the last I think I saw was $700,000, and it's probably shut up from there due to the donations and the outpouring of support for him tonight, but very community oriented and kind of fits with if you look at the way the Bills reacted on the field tonight under such an extreme circumstance. This is an extraordinarily tightknit group that is very supportive and active in the community as well. So, as people get to know and obviously after this, we'll get to know much more about Damar's community work and his charity that falls in line with a lot of the, quite frankly, the culture that Sean McDermott and Brandon Bean had been able to build with this franchise here in Buffalo. So, extraordinarily well liked by his teammates, as I said, a tremendously tightknit group. I think made even further so by the mass shooting on the east side of Buffalo, east Buffalo this summer and the way that the players reacted to that widespread community support, but so many of them came out in the Choose Love T shirts that we've all seen the pictures of. And so, I would say that Damar Hamlin and his community work is an extension of what so many of these Buffalo Bills players represent. So when you hear about many of his teammates wanting to stay back here in Cincinnati and not fly home to Orchard Park tonight, in light of the NFL's decision to have them do so, it would give you a sense of the level of commitment that exists and the bond among this team. you know, Stefon Diggs, one of the leading players, top receiver, Ubered to the hospital because he just felt he needed to be with Damar Hamlin and his family. So, what we've seen from Hamlin falls in line with so much of what this team has represented beyond the football field.",

Again, it would be premature of me to, you know, offer any specifics at all in regards to his condition. I believe that should come from the NFL or from the Bills themselves when that time is right. But, you know, we can, you know, confidently report that he was given CPR and that we know he was taken to a level one trauma center here, the University of Cincinnati Medical Center, which is about 4 miles from the stadium.",

The league has done a conference call with some of their executives that wrapped up maybe 45 minutes ago, and we learned on that call and have since clarified that all of Damar Hamlin's teammates are returning to Buffalo this evening.

He collapsed after a collision during the first quarter of Monday night football. The Buffalo Bills against the Cincinnati Bengals. Hamlin fell on his back just moments after getting up from a tackle. He tackled the Bengals wide receiver Tee Higgins.I want to bring in Dr. Megan Ranney, an emergency room physician and deputy dean at Brown University School of Public Health, and Dr. Anthony Cardillo who's also an emergency room physician to get a sense of what we saw. And I want to make clear, there's been no official statement about the medical condition other than he is in the hospital with critical condition. But no official statement about the nature of the injury itself. So, Dr. Ranney first to you, what did you see? DR. MEGAN RANNEY, EMERGENCY ROOM PHYSICIAN: So I actually am on vacation, arranged my day in order to see the Bills game. I'm a lifelong Bills fan. And so we're sitting, watching the game with my family and when you first watched it, it looked like a regular tackle. As he ten went down, you saw folks come out on to the field, saw him surrounded, saw my fellow emergency physicians rush out to treat him.

ANTHONY CARDILLO, EMERGENCY ROOM PHYSICIAN: Well, there certainly are. But I have to agree. This is pretty much developing into what we think commotio cordis. This is a traumatic injury to the anterior chest. And it has to happen at the exact time when the heart is hardest being prepared to beat again during that re-polarization cycle. This is extremely rare, however, it's almost like getting struck by lightning. It's that rare. It has to be acute trauma to the anterior chest just at that right moment. And looking at how this is unfolding, when you watch that video, the trauma, the trauma to the chest is pretty consistent with what you'd expect to induce this. The second is the way he stood up and then fell backwards. You see that kind of fall (INAUDIBLE) when you have a cardiac event or dysrhythmia where the heart is not beating 100 percent and pump blood up to the brain. That causes you to pass out. It's all developing as though it is this phenomenon. And, then of course, he was pulseless almost also immediately after he fell down again indicating that his heart was in a lethal (ph) rhythm or a ventricular fibrillation. Now it's likely a scene, we're hoping that CPR was started immediately. And that that AED was available. The automated external defibrillator was available and he was shocked quickly. Those are the immediate lifesaving therapeutic interventions that would've saved his life.",

And more importantly, you need to have AED everywhere in our community. It is a life saving technology when the heart is fibrillating. The only thing you can really do is administer that electrical shock. And we are hopeful that that's what happened on the field.",

And he would've been intubated emergently. And heart hopefully, would've come back. And the real clincher here is going to be how long was he down for? How long before he got mouth to mouth resuscitation, or a bag valve mask -- someone breathing for him. And more importantly, how quickly he was defibrillated. Now, what happens now is? He's young, he's healthy, he's an athlete, he's well conditioned. If the heart came back, he is certainly back to normal or close to normal physiologic status. It's really going to be dependent upon how much brain anoxia he had. And this is all speculative, which is all the physicians now are watching what happened. We're looking at the type of trauma that he had, how he fell down, and then how his care unfolded. It is really all pointing towards this traumatic dysrhythmia that would've happened. And really, it's going to come down to his underlying strength, his conditioning and how long he was without any oxygen.",

Been an NFL fan since -- as long as I can remember.It was a typical routine play, where you have the wide receiver catching a ball across the middle, it turns up the field. And the defensive back tackles them, they both jump up. And, you know, when I saw Damar jump up and then he fell back down to the ground, I knew that was something that we hadn't really seen before. We had seen players, you know, unfortunately unconscious on the ground. We've seen players tear ligaments, break bones, which are all horrible but this seems a lot different initially just because he had stood up and he wasn't stumbling around, he stood up for a few seconds and he fell back down. And that was concerning and I saw the concern on the players' faces. And you can always tell when a player is really injured because you'll see the players from both teams, motioning frantically over to the player sidelines. Motioning over to the sidelines tell them to hey, come, this player needs medical attention immediately And you saw that. I think you saw Joe (INAUDIBLE) who actually Damar had fallen into. You saw Joe (INAUDIBLE) pointing down to the ground and motioning over to the sidelines for the medical staff to come out and you saw the players after a few minutes couldn't really see what was happening on the field because they were all crowded around. But when both benches cleared, to me that was significant because usually that doesn't happen, even when players have concussions which are obviously, you know, traumatic brain -- traumatic injuries and those are really tough. Or when a player has, you know, some type of season and the injury that's unfortunate for anyone, you'll see players that are on the field come out and they wish the player well. But both benches cleared, and you saw players on both sides, players from both teams crying. I've never seen that before. And it just underscored the severity of the injury. And I think that, you know, when we heard the announcers that were speaking said that they were administering CPR, that for me really did it because we have never, I personally had never seen that before. I've been following the NFL as long as I can remember. I've played for ten years. I coached. And on any level, high school, college or the pros I had never seen anyone be administered CPR while on the practice field or the game field. So that was obviously very troubling.",
