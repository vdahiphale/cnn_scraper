Right now, it's our understanding that Trump is likely to do his surrender towards the back half of the week.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REID (voice-over): Now, here's what's going to happen when he goes to surrender. He is going to surrender to the Fulton County Sheriff's Office, and this process typically involves a mugshot and fingerprints. And the mugshot is important here because remember at the federal level, they did not take a mugshot of the former president because they said, look, we use those, they don't release them, but they use them for law enforcement if someone goes on the lam. And Trump is one of the most recognizable people in the world. They don't really need a mugshot for that. And it's unclear if Fulton County is also going to make that kind of exception. (END VIDEO CLIP) REID (on camera): Another big difference between the state and federal appearances here is that he's just going to be processed next week. Then, a judge will schedule a court hearing. At the federal level, all of this happened on the same day. So, the judge will have to schedule a hearing and the district attorney has asked for the initial appearances of all of these defendants to happen the week of September 5th. Victor, Amara.",

The problem will be, among other things, is that's not completely accurate. So, in other words, yes, you might have been the president, and you might have been doing certain things as your job and as your role as a president of the United States. But what was allegedly occurring here was a fraud that goes wellbeyond the means and responsibilities. The responsibilities of the president, I remind everyone, if they don't know, is not to count votes, is not to challenge the votes in the state of Georgia. That is not his role. There are people who can do that, but that is certainly not him. So, he's going to have some difficulties taking that case and bringing it to the federal courts.",

That is certainly not the case. It's used routinely by states in much, we'll call it smaller or less frightening types of situations. So, this is not atypical when there's a belief to be a structure, and an organization, as likely as that term can be used, or a crew or a group of people with a criminal objective and a criminal goal, and they all share in that goal and that criminal objective here to overturn the election in Georgia.But specifically, in the state of Georgia, it's a five-year minimum. That is a significant and heavy sentence. So, when you have people at the top, meaning President Trump and his 13 charges and people at the bottom or far lesser, they are exposed to that same five years and if I am one of those people, if I'm one of those individuals charged, there is a strong likelihood that I might consider saying, hey why should I go to prison for five years when I'm a really small piece here?

Take Hurricane Hilary, for example. FEMA pre-positions, knowing that that's coming in, and they can at least try to prepare for the recovery on the back end.Without those funds it just makes it all the more difficult. Now, the White House has been monitoring this and they have requested 12 billion dollars in additional funding, but that's a request that's part of a broader supplemental going to Congress that already faces an uphill battle.

But then, they feel bad about the economy overall. And I think that, that is a -- it's we're at an unusual economic moment that we haven't had in quite a while here in America, where we do have a very, very strong job market. We've had inflation for a while, and I think people are sort of trying to think through how to understand that. And, you know, obviously, I think that we're at an inflection point here, and the sense that inflation has come down quite a bit. So, I think you could see people start to feel better about the state of things just because they're not watching the prices in the grocery aisle, just steadily tick up, trip after trip the way that they were previously.",

I know there's more data to come over the next four weeks. But if we're looking at another rate increase? SMIALEK: Yes. So, this is the several trillion-dollar question at the moment. Nobody, nobody knows the answer to whether we are going to have another rate increase in September at this stage. Wall Street is betting probably not. I think the assumption is that we've seen a lot of slowing in inflation and the Fed is going to want to see how that plays out a little bit more before putting any more restraint on the economy, before hitting those brakes harder. But it's clearly still something that officials are talking about. You know, I think the economy has surprised them with how strong and resilient it has been. It's surprised everybody, you know. Nobody was penciling in growth tracking it anywhere near the level that it is currently. And the job market just keeps chugging. You know, employers are hiring a lot. They're getting wage increases. And so, in an environment like that, I think the question is, can Fed officials feel comfortable that inflation is going to slow down the whole way? And I think they're going to be parsing the incoming dating -- data releases to try and figure that out. And we could get a little bit of color on this point from the Fed Chair Jerome Powell, who's going to deliver a big speech at Jackson Hole, which is the Feds big annual conference this Friday.",
