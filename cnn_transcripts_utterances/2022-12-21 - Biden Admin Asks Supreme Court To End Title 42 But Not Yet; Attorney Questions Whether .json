Earlier he was seen arriving in Poland before getting on a plane for Washington. U.S. officials say that an American military aircraft was involved in bringing him to the U.S. It is his first trip outside of Ukraine since Russia first invaded 10 months ago. It's a chance for him to rally support for a critical new package of military aid. CNN's M.J. Lee is at the White House. CNN's Lauren Fox is on Capitol Hill. M.J., tell us more about what you're learning about obviously what was a really sensitive trip in actually getting President Zelenskyy to the United States?M.J. LEE, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT:  That's right. Keep in mind that this was a visit that was kept tightly under wraps until the very last minute. and what we learned from a senior administration official overnight is that the planning has been under way for about the last 10 days or so that a potential visit was first raised on a phone call between President Biden and President Zelenskyy on December 11th. And once President Zelenskyy accepted the invitation, then the work really started to make sure that certain security parameters were met. You can imagine how high the security risks are given that he is of course a wartime president. And my colleague Kevin Liptak and I can now report this morning that a U.S. military aircraft was involved in bringing President Zelenskyy to Washington and that the U.S. was very closely involved just in general in bringing him here and will be involved in getting him out of the U.S. And he is not going to be staying long, Kaitlan. He is going to be here in the White House in the afternoon, and then in the evening, of course, he heads over to Capitol Hill to address members of Congress. And right after, we are told, he is going to be leaving the country. And of course, I should mention this new Ukraine aid package that the president is going to be unveiling that amounts to some $1.8 billion. This includes that important patriot surface-to-air missile system. This is one of the most some sophisticated long-range missiles and something that Ukrainians have been asking for for a very long time. So Kaitlan, just setting up the day for a very, very important day here at the White House.",

She wants to make sure that people are in the chamber for this historic moment.She officially invited Zelenskyy last night in a formal letter inviting him to address a joining meeting of Congress. And I just want to read you part of that. She said, \"The fight for Ukraine is the fight for democracy itself. We look forward to hearing your inspiring message of unity, resilience, and determination.\" We should note that this comes at a critical moment in the House of Representatives because they are slated to vote on that huge spending package, which includes nearly $45 billion in assistance for Ukraine. Of course, a lot of Republicans who are going to be in the chamber are being asked to vote against that by their leadership, so it just shows you, is anything that Zelenskyy says tonight going the change the minds of some of those Republicans in the audience about that vote?",

So they will sit almost like an extended range dome on top of the systems the U.S. already has provided.Remember when the U.S. provided U.S. manufactured NASAMS. Those are medium range air defense systems that have proven very effective in taking out some of the Russian barrages we've seen targeting civilian and energy infrastructure. There's also the shorter range components of that, like stingers and other MANPADS that the U.S. and others have provided. But the patriots are a much longer range system that will enhance Ukraine's ability at air defense. It is meant to disrupt these constant Russian barrages we've seen, targeting civilian infrastructure, targeting military targets. This will help Ukraine defend its own territory. But it comes, of course, with complications. These are complex systems that will take Ukraine some time to learn how to operate these, how to maintain them, how to sustain them. And that's part of the challenge here. It takes about 20 weeks to learn how a team of dozens operates a patriot missile systems. They'll have to learn that as quickly as possible. Don, Ukraine has shown an ability for their soldiers to learn complex U.S. systems quickly. This is one more system, a crucial system they'll have to learn as quickly as possible.",

He says that on the day-to-day, Moscow police is great, but it's questioning whether they have the experience to handle a quadruple homicide. Look, before this case, Moscow had not recorded a murder since 2015. But despite all of this, the chief of police in Moscow, James Fry, responding and saying that he is in charge, that he is leading this investigation, and that he believes his team is capable of moving forward and of solving this case, saying that combined, the team has more than 90 years of experience, also pointed to the help that they're getting from the state police and from the FBI. In fact, more FBI agents were added in recent days. And the experts that I talked to telling me look behind the scenes.
