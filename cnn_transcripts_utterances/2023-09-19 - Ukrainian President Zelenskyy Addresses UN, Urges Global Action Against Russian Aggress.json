This is, of course, happening as Ukraine's counteroffensive is grinding away for months.It's making progress, according to senior U.S. and British officials I've spoken to. But a concern is the American public is losing patience and some U.S. officials questioning just how far, in fact, Ukraine can go. Here at home, a recent CNN poll showed that a majority of Americans oppose now sending more money, more financial assistance to Ukraine. House Republicans have stripped those funds out of a proposed spending bill, possibly setting up a showdown in Washington. That is the harsh political reality here at home, something that not only the U.S. president is facing, but, of course, Volodymyr Zelenskyy of Ukraine as he takes the podium today. CNN senior U.N. correspondent Richard Roth is here with me. We're also joined by retired Army Lieutenant Colonel Alexander Vindman. First to you, Richard. The president tried, it seemed this morning, to internationalize the crisis in Ukraine, to say it is a threat to the very mission of this building, of the nearly 200 nations that are members of the United Nations. Is that a message that was received well by this group? There were some times. In fact, that was the only applause line I believe President Biden received today.",

He talked about the lessons of the 20th century being that nuclear war should be something that should be avoided at all costs. He talked about how that is now a very real threat from the Kremlin, and he described how the Kremlin is also weaponizing other aspects in its invasion of Ukraine, energy and food, as well as displaced children.It was a very notable moment in his speech as well when he talked about shady deals in back rooms, and he alluded to the former head of the Wagner mercenary force saying, ask Yevgeny Prigozhin if Vladimir Putin can be trusted.",

      "sentences": "It was really interesting how he constructed this speech. I actually thought it was fascinating and very effective delivery. So he started off by talking about how we learned over 50 years to control nuclear weapons because we thought that was the Third World War. And he said along the way, we forgot to control other forms of weaponization. And then he went through his list, using food as weapons, using oil and gas as weapons, using nuclear energy by his reference to how the Russians have been attacking the Zaporizhia nuclear plant, then grabbing children, bringing them all back to Russia and made the point that Vladimir Putin has already been indicted by the International Criminal Court for that role.So, he was basically saying the moment has now come. It is now evident from the invasion of Ukraine that we need to have the kind of regulation on this kind of weaponization that we put on nuclear weapons. That's a very tall order at a time that Russia is still a member of the Security Council with veto rights, that China, which has largely sided with Russia, is as well. But it was an effort, as you said, to elevate this beyond Ukraine and basically say, this is the 1930s and you're next.",

One is maintain support, the alliance structure, keep them on board. And two is attempt to persuade those fence-sitters, those many countries in, let's say, Africa that are reliant on food supplies, or Asia, or South America. And I think he did that pretty well. What he did was he internationalized the conflict also. He tied the events that are occurring on the ground in Ukraine to what it means for the international stage, the use of nuclear, the nuclear power plants as dirty bombs, the food scarcity, food security issues, the energy as a weapon. I think he did that quite well.And I think he probably didn't really win that many hearts and minds, but he did the best he could. And certainly he also made, I think, a key point that we've done a good job as a globe looking at deterring nuclear war. We need to do a better job at doing the precursor to nuclear war, World War III, which is how do we prevent large-scale global war. So I think on those points he did quite well.",

This may be the first time he will be able to look across the table and see a Russian representative.

One more question for you, Alexander Vindman, if I can, because there is an enormous amount of nervousness here, which I hear from European leaders, both here at the UNGA, but prior as well, as well as U.S. officials, American allies around the world and Ukrainian officials, that if there is a new president in 2024 in the U.S., particularly if that new president is Donald Trump, that U.S. support for Ukraine will end.You, of course, served in the Trump administration. You were central to what was Trump's first impeachment, which involved the then U.S. president pressuring Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden and withholding military assistance to, to do so. What is your concern, and how big a change would it be in terms of U.S. and Western support for Ukraine if Trump were to be reelected? What would that change be exactly?",
