Today, we continue our Women`s History Month journey recognizing just a few of the many remarkable female changemakers who have made a difference in our world. And as March draws to a close, we turn our lens toward Dr. Peggy Whitson. This retired NASA astronaut has spent more time in space than any other American. And she was the first woman to command the International Space Station. We sat down for an inspiring talk about chasing our dreams, shooting for the moon and walking among the stars.

The NorthernLights are more visible than usual because of a geomagnetic storm which disrupted the Earth`s magnetic field. Such storms happen when strong surges of solar winds called coronal mass ejections reach Earth. Side effects of increased solar activity are the auroras that dance around Earth`s poles. And the timing of this geomagnetic storm with an erupting volcano in Iceland puts nature on full display. (END VIDEO CLIP)",
