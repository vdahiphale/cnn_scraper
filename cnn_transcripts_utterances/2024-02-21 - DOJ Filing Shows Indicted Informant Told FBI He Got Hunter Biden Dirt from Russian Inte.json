      "sentences": "Well, Phil and Poppy, this information about Alexander Smirnov comes to us because the Justice Department is afraid of what he will be doing if and now that he is going to be released.So, what happened here was this man, Alexander Smirnov, an American citizen, was charged with a crime of lying to the FBI. He had been talking to them as an informant for ten years, talking to his handler nearly every day, passing them information. And then some of that information, the Justice Department says, was false, the information where he was trying to connect Joe Biden and Hunter Biden at a time when Joe Biden was the vice president to Burisma, that Ukrainian energy company, something that has smeared the Bidens politically for a couple of years now. That was false. That's what he was arrested on. And then just after he was arrested, Alexander Smirnov tells the FBI just a week ago that information from Russian officials about Hunter Biden was being passed to them. So now this calls into question a lot of what has been out there about Hunter Biden and a lot of these political smears trying to connect him to Russian intelligence. One of the things the Justice Department wrote to the federal court before Smirnov's hearing yesterday in Las Vegas was Smirnov's efforts to spread misinformation about a candidate of one of the two major parties in the United States, that's Joe Biden, continues. What this shows is that the misinformation he is spreading is not confined to 2020. He is actively peddling new lies that could impact U.S. elections after meeting with Russian intelligence officials in November. So, a lot of questions remain what is true from this person who was funneling information to the FBI. Was he lying about all of this? Was he going to continue meeting with Russian intelligence? The judge released him yesterday at this court hearing, allowing him to be released on his own personal recognizance. So, he didn't have to post a bunch of money or anything like that. The judge said political ramifications were not enough to keep him in jail no matter what the Justice Department fears.",

So, this should have no impact on the actual pending indictments, plural, against Hunter Biden.And it's important to note, by the way, the person who's been charged with the FBI's investigation is the special counsel, David Weiss, a person who was put in office as U.S. attorney by Donald Trump in 2018, then confirmed to the Senate in 2019. Now, the special counsel has brought two indictments against Hunter Biden, one of them the federal case in Delaware relating to firearms possession, the other a federal case in California relating to tax fraud. Neither of those cases appears to be implicated by anything this particular informant, Mr. Smirnov, said or any of his information. So, I think those two cases will continue on. We have seen reporting the Hunter Biden's attorneys are going to argue that, well, to the extent the FBI relied on this person's statement at all, they should have to go back to the deal, the plea deal that they had in place, because the reason that the FBI backed out on that plea deal, according to Hunter Biden's lawyers, is because they were relying on faulty information from Mr. Smirnov. I think that's an interesting argument. I think it's perhaps overly aggressive. So, I think those two indictments are going to stay in place and proceed.",

And now it is crumbled all together.I mean, the primary information that he provided to the FBI on which the House relied is essentially that there was this multimillion dollar bribe payoff made to Hunter Biden and to Joe Biden.

And whatever comes out of that appeal, whatever is left of this verdict, maybe all $350 million-plus, maybe some smaller number, maybe none of it, but whatever comes out of it, Donald Trump then has to pay.
