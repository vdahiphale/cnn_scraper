Lawmakers in both parties demanding to see the findings of a House ethics investigation of Matt Gaetz for allegations of sexual misconduct and illegal drug use. But the house speaker hopes the report is never released. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. MIKE JOHNSON (R-LA):  No, I mean, I think it's a terrible breach of protocol. The rules of the House have always been that a former member is beyond the jurisdiction of the Ethics Committee. And so I don't think that's relevant. I'm going to strongly request the Ethics Committee not release the report. That is not the way we do things in the House. And I think that would be a terrible precedent. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Let's start with the process, to your point, right?What the former president, president-elect is doing right now is what every president-elect does in this moment, decides who he wants to be in his Cabinet, announces his intent to nominate them. So we have a number of those picks. It's a little dangerous putting up this screen right now because you never know when another TRUTH Social is going to announce another pick. But obviously we have been talking a lot about them over the course of the last several days. Some of them, as Chris was just noting, are controversial. All of them will have to go through the Senate process. So what is that process? So the president-elect announces who he wants to nominate, will eventually have to send those nominations up. Then the Senate committees that oversee the agencies or departments where they're nominated will go through what is a vetting process, then eventually a Senate committee. And then that committee will have to vote to send those nominees to the floor. They could vote them down as well, but that's usually the process, send them to the floor. Then the full Senate will have an opportunity to vote. Now, it's worth noting most of the time presidents get deference. Republicans have made clear the president will get deference here as well.

Now, over the course of the last several administrations, the timelines have ranged from 60 days for President Biden's entire Cabinet to be confirmed to between 90 and 100 days for the former president, president-elect now, Donald Trump and Barack Obama.

Bush to be the secretary of defense. Being a former member of the chamber, you assume that person's going to get through the process. He ended up failing. It was a shocking moment, the only nominee rejected by a Senate vote in the course of the last 50 years, was the subject of an FBI investigation into drinking and sexual harassment. What mostly -- what happens generally for all the other administrations, I think Trump had six nominees, they were withdrawn.

This is where Trump is aiming at, at least at the moment. So he's not aiming at annexation of anything. He's aiming at a peace deal.

I do not get the sense from all the people I talk to that there's any intention by Trump or his team to give a carte blanche for the settlers or for Netanyahu to annex the West Bank. And I will tell you another thing. When I speak to people in the Palestinian leadership, they tell me that they were very surprised by Trump's positive tone in his conversation with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas and his emphasis on the fact that he wants to try and get a deal this time around. But the key will be the war in Gaza and, as part of it, some sort of a hostage deal. And in two months, this will be Trump's responsibility. And just to give you a sense, tonight, on one of Israel's big television channels, there was a poll that showed that 69 percent of Israelis want the hostage deal and only 20 percent want the war to continue. Netanyahu for now is with the 20 percent and not with the 69 percent. And the question is, where is Donald Trump going to be?",
