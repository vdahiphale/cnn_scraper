In a little less than 17 hours from now, the Democratic National Convention opens at the United Center in Chicago, where delegates will celebrate their nominee, Vice President Kamala Harris and her vision for the future. She comes into this pivotal week riding high. New national polls out today show Harris taking the lead over Republican Donald Trump for the very first time since she announced her candidacy less than a month ago. Hoping to build off that momentum, today Harris and her running mate, Governor Tim Walz, are meeting voters in western Pennsylvania, trying to drum up support in the key battleground state. CNN's Eva McKend and Kevin Liptak are tracking the latest on the campaign trail. Eva let's begin with you there in Pittsburgh. While the vice president and her pick have arrived in Pittsburgh, they also boarded a bus, right, called the \"A New Pathway Forward\" emblazoned along the side of it?",

So think meeting voters at phone banks, canvassers, retail shops. I caught up with a canvasser here, a volunteer. She was out on those doors yesterday in the Pittsburgh area trying to reach Republicans and Independents. And she was encouraged by what she saw. She told me that those voters that sort of leaned right at least expressed some openness to her to supporting the vice president. Meanwhile, the vice president facing criticisms from the right for her economic plan. But here's what one voter told me. She actually lives abroad now, but still votes absentee in Pennsylvania.

We do know that he is preparing his speech this weekend at Camp David hoping to frame Kamala Harris is the natural successor to the legacy that he started while he was in office. Kamala Harris will also be on hand for this speech. We will also hear from Dr. Jill Biden, the first lady. After that, the Bidens will take their leave and essentially hand over the convention to Kamala Harris. And they have listed out sort of list of themes for the rest of the week. I won't go through them in extensive detail, but I'll tell you on Tuesday, it's called \"A Bold Vision for America's Future\". We'll hear that evening from the former President Barack Obama and his wife, the former first lady, Michelle Obama. On Wednesday, the theme is \"A Fight for Our Freedoms\". We'll hear then from the vice-presidential nominee Tim Walz, the governor of Minnesota. And then on Thursday, the theme is \"For Our Future\" and that will, of course, feature that incredibly important speech from Kamala Harris accepting the Democrats' nomination. Of course, her team hopes that will propel her into the heat of the election in the fall. And that really is the goal here to try and maintain this enormous swell of momentum that Kamala Harris has been enjoying. Of course, the polls now show her taking a slight lead, but make no mistake. This is still a very close race. Her advisers do acknowledge that this will be a tight election all the way up until November. That's part of the reason they've already reserved $370 million in ad space in the Fall, really hoping to put Kamala Harris in front of Americans all the way up to the election. And certainly when you talk to her advisors, they acknowledged the hard part is yet to come, Fredricka.",

She says she's going to lower the cost of food and housing starting on day one but day one for Kamala was three-and-a-half years ago. So why didn't she do it then? What they're doing is a communist takeover of our country. Her plan is very dangerous because it may sound good politically and that's the problem with four more years of Kamala your finances will never recover. They deposed a president -- it was a coup of a precedent. Joe Biden hates -- this was an overthrow of a president. Have you heard her laugh? That is the laugh of a crazy person. That is the laugh of a crazy. The laugh of a lunatic. Because as soon as she laughs, the election's over. I say that I am much better look can that her. I think I'm much better looking, much better.

But some of the thorniest of issues Hamas wants to have control over its southern border, over Gaza's border with Egypt. And that's a red line at the moment for Israel. Israel wants to be able to control the movement of displaced people back from the south of Gaza to the north. It doesn't want them to have weapons. This is a red line at the moment for Hamas.
