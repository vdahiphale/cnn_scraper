And, you know, my view is if Ukraine's aid is not sustained, then it's only a matter of time before they will be unable to continue to repel Russian assaults in the Donbas and elsewhere, and it's only a matter of time before other allied assistance will falter as well. And then the question will be, how long can Ukraine hold out? How long will they fight? How much terrain will they give up? Now, on the other hand, I do think it's important that the president continue to connect the importance of aiding Ukraine with what it means to Americans. He needs to talk about how the 60 plus billion dollars in assistance that's being proposed isn't going straight to Ukraine. It's actually coming back to America's factories and defense companies and employees. And he needs to talk about the strategy in the end game.

You don't want them interrupting the flow of logistics coming off of the causeway and hitting the beach. And that's really another big unknown. Who's going to handle the security on the beach at the landing point and then who's going to be in charge of distribution once it hits the ground?

I love you.\" And a few minutes later, you wrote another email to say, \"As of now, my plane is probably making an emergency landing. I love you. I am calm.

Nope. I'm talking about the Oscars. And one thing is for sure, the era of Barbenheimer is coming to its grand finale.Both films are up for best picture, but they are facing some pretty stiff competition for movies like Golden Globe winner \"Poor Things\" and Martin Scorsese's \"Killers of the Flower Moon.\" Lily Gladstone is nominated for Best Actress for her role in that movie. She is the first Native American to be nominated in that category. Now, there's no Best Actor nom for Leonardo DiCaprio, but there is one for a friend of the show, Jeffrey Wright, for his role in \"American Fiction.\" Here's what he told me when we chatted. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JEFFREY WRIGHT, OSCAR-NOMINATED ACTOR: These nominations are made by our peers, our colleagues, and it has been really gratifying that they have looked at our work in this film, not just mine, but everyone involved, because the film is nominated for Best Picture as well. But they've looked at our work and they said, yeah, yeah, we like it. (END VIDEO CLIP)",
