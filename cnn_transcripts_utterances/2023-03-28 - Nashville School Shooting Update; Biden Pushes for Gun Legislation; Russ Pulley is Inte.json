The victims were three nine-year-old children, and three teachers at a private Christian elementary school in Nashville, Tennessee. Police are calling this a calculated and planned attack. This morning we are learning new details about the shooting. New surveillance video shows the suspect, identified as 28-year-old Audrey Hale, shooting through glass doors, as you see there. The violence lasted roughly 14 minutes before two officers confronted, shot and killed Hale. The mayor of Nashville told CNN THIS MORNING, it is time for the federal government to act on gun control.

Tell us first, Carlos, about what we're learning this morning about how much planning went into this shooting. CARLOS SUAREZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, Jim, good morning. So, according to the chief of police out here, we are expected to get a look at some of the body cam video from the officers that responded to the site of this school shooting. The chief of police also said we should be learning a little bit more about the other sites that the 28-year-old shooter planned to visit after opening fire inside of this private Christian school. Now, according to authorities, the 28 year old was ready for a confrontation with police from the get go. According to investigators, she had several rounds of ammunition. She had planned out this entire attack, according to some writings and statements that authorities are attributing to her. They say that she knew exactly what she was doing. She laid out this attack. She knew the entry points to this school. And so we're expected to learn a little bit more about some outstanding questions in this investigation. Now, overnight, we also learned about a direct message, a DM, that was set by the 28-year-old shooter to a former basketball teammate. Averianna Patton tells us that she received this DM shortly before the shooting yesterday morning. It reads, quote, one day this will make more sense. I've left behind more than enough evidence behind. But something bad is about to happen. Now, Patton says that she received that message a little bit before 10:00 in the morning and that she called authorities right around the time the shooting happened, but according to her, an officer did not show up to her house until 3:30 in the afternoon. And so that is one of the questions that remain unanswered out here is why officers perhaps did not show up to her house a little bit sooner. The chief of police was on CBS this morning and provided a little bit more information on where the investigation stands right now. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "All right, so late last night, authorities here in Nashville released surveillance video from inside of the school. The video is about two minutes in length, and it shows the shooter essentially making her way inside of the school. You can see that video there. She shoots through a glass door, is able to crawl in, and then is seen walking through the hallway of this school.The gun -- the shooter, rather, spends some time in one office and then seems to be walking down a hall. At one point she passes by what believe -- what appears to be, rather, like the children's ministry. Authorities out here, Jim, tell us that the six people that were shot were -- were not targeted. It appears that they just happened at random. And so we believe that some of this encounter may have played out in the hallways of the school, considering that the surveillance video, as you can see there, the alarm's going off, show this 28-year- old shooter pointing that gun right there as she walked inside of the school.

This part is always hard because you get to learn more about the victims of the shooting here. Six of them. All three of the students were just nine years old. There's the face of one of them, Hallie Scruggs. The images from her are from 2019. She was the daughter of the lead pastor at Covenant Presbyterian Church, which was affiliated with the school. The other two children, their names, Evelyn Dieckhaus and William Kinney. The adult victims, 61-year-old Cynthia Peak. The other two adult victims were school employees, 60-year-old Katherine Koonce was the head of the school. Mike Hill, 61-year-old, he worked as a custodian there. Those are the faces of the victims of this shooting. Well, the facts are simple. They're sad and familiar. Three nine-year- olds are dead, killed in their school. Guns are now the leading cause of death among children in this country. This according to the CDC. The details vary from shooting to shooting. A locked side glass door that was shot out in this case. The results do not. Powerful weapons, swift and violent loss of life. When I picked my daughter up from school yesterday, I wondered if the same could happen there. Maybe some of you wondered the same as well. GOP Senator John Cornyn, a key negotiator on the gun safety package passed in the last Congress, said on Monday he does not believe anymore legislation will move in the next two years. I would say we've gone about as far as we can go, he said. This morning, President Biden is calling on lawmakers to keep trying. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

They really tried to work through what was possible after the Uvalde elementary school shooting last year. And they came up with some modest reforms. And many Republicans argued that was significant, that they had given a lot, and Democrats argued they'd given up a lot in those negotiations to get something through Congress.I think a couple of things that make this more difficult today than it was last summer also is the fact that House Republicans are now in charge in the House of Representatives. That means that it is up to a Republican speaker, Kevin McCarthy, to decide what comes to the floor. And I would just note that he has a very, very far right conference. In fact, some of his members wear, you know, AR-15 rifle pins on their suit jackets. And I think that that is just the reality of where things stand in Congress, even though there is a Democratic controlled Senate.",

Well, Tennessee is one of 25 states in this country that allows anyone over 21 to carry a concealed weapon without a permit. Lawmakers in the state are considering several pieces of legislation that would even further loosen restrictions on firearms. Lawmakers have introduced a bill that would allow all residents from age 18 to carry handguns without permits, a proposal that would allow residents to openly carry any firearm, including shotguns and AR-15 style rifles, like those used in this shooting, without a permit as well.

When I first got the call, I went to the scene and communicated with the police officers who were there and then immediately made my way to the church where the children were being brought to reunite with their parents. That was a fairly deliberate process. So, the children were in the fellowship hall below the sanctuary where the parents were being told to arrive. You know, it was a pretty amazing scene there. The teachers were doing what they do. They were teaching their kids. And if you went in the fellowship hall, you would think there was school going on. The kids were reacting just like it was a makeshift school room. And the parents, obviously, it was a different emotion up there as they waited to reunite there with the children from such a tragic event. So, it was very deliberate and systematic to make sure that it was done properly.Yes, I credit the police department and the school for doing that well. Yes, but it was very emotional, as you can well imagine.",

And a senior U.S. military official tells me that decision, quote, definitely limits our ability to gather intelligence related to the war in Ukraine.When we first reported the new routes, one U.S. official told CNN they were part of an effort to, quote, avoid being too provocative. The Biden ministrations wants to avoid any incident that could escalate into a direct conflict with Russian forces. Were told the drone flights will continue this way for the time being. Well, the Ukrainian military says that Russia fired 15 combat drones overnight and Ukrainian air defenses were able to destroy 14 of them. This comes as more military help has just arrived in Ukraine in the form of three Leopard tanks, donated by Portugal. And the first British battle tanks have also made it to the country, along with other western made armored vehicles.

Today he was in Sumy, in the far north, visiting troops, visiting wounded troops and handing out medals and rallying the troops. He's done this now over the last several days, Jim. He was in Zaporizhzhia before that, in Bakhmut, right on the front lines in the east. And you have to feel that this is significant and maybe signaling possibly bigger things to come from the Ukrainian military. Of course, everyone is wondering whether this counter offensive that has been talked about may happen in the coming weeks or even months.And you're right, there was a strike overnight by Shahid drones, those Iranian drones, on the capital Kyiv. A pretty substantial attempted strike. The majority of those drones were taken down by air defense, say the Ukrainian. So, that's good news from the capital's point of view, of course. And, yes, these significant military assets are now arriving in the country. You have the Leopard tanks coming in, in dribs and drabs. Also the Challenger U.K. tank. This is significant. Now whether they can come in quickly enough for the Ukrainians is a different story. But just to see them here and the Ukrainians, obviously, Jim, advertising the fact that they are in country is certainly significant. We've spent time with volunteer groups, battalions, training, getting ready for what we believe might be this counter offensive when all these assets are in place. Then the question is, will Ukraine strike and at which part of this vast front line. Jim.",
