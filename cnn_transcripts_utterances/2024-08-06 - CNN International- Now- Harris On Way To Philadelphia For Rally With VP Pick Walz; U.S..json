      "sentences": "It's 8Thanks so much for joining me today on CNN NEWSROOM. And let's get right to the news. You are looking at a live picture in Philadelphia. The crowd filing in to see Vice President Kamala Harris introduce her running mate. He is Minnesota Governor Tim Walz. Walz, high school football coach, teacher, Army National Guardsman, who brings with him more than a decade in the House and now two statewide wins in a big Midwestern state. Walz became a dark horse in Harris's expedited VP search in the final days and had what one source told CNN was great chemistry with Harris, which helped her make her final decision. Walz is already in Philadelphia for that event just moments ago, Harris gave a thumbs up as she took off for the key swing state, kicking off a week-long battleground state blitz launching this new Democratic ticket. With me now for more, CNN senior White House reporter Kevin Liptak. Do we know the decision-making behind the scenes why she chose Walz?",

      "sentences": "Well, I do think that chemistry that you mentioned was a very big deal for Vice President Harris. She is a vice president. She knows what a relationship with a president can be and what it can't be. And she was very intent on finding someone who she could have a vibe with.And as she interviewed these candidates over the weekend, Mark or Tim Walz was the one who had the best chemistry. They have a similar sense of humor there around the same age and I think when you talk to her campaign advisers, certainly his biography played a huge role. You know, he's someone who has not spent his entire career in Washington. He was a high school teacher. He was a coach. You know, this is someone who came to politics relatively late in life. But it was this interpersonal relationship that was so important for the two of them. And that is how she picked this. She found him trustworthy. She thinks he'll be loyal. You know, it's a hard thing to be a vice president. You have to operate in the shadow of someone else. That's not something every politician can do or can do easily, at least. And that's what they think they've found in Tim Walz.",

When he was in Congress, he was a relatively moderate congressman. He was focused on agriculture issues.By the time he went and became the governor, his record became a lot more progressive. He saw things like enshrining the right to abortion in Minnesota, legalizing the right to legal marijuana recreational marijuana. So he does kind of span this ideological spectrum that the party is looking for. The other thing that the Harris folks are looking at is messaging and you've seen that just over the last couple of weeks. He sort of debuted this idea of Trump and his running mate J.D. Vance as weird. I think there's a little bit of a clip of him saying that. Listen to this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV. TIM WALZ (D-MN):  These guys are just weird. That's who they are. So, it ain't much out. Don't give them the power. Is he a danger to women's health? Yes. Is he a danger to world peace? Yes. But don't give him more credit than he needs. He's just a strange, weird dude. And how often in the world do you make that bastard wake up afterwards and know that a Black woman kicked his ass and sent him on the road. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And first of all, I just want to note that over the past several weeks, we've been reporting this, that the Trump campaign has really struggled to define Vice President Kamala Harris herself. They've been trying to workshop different attacks to see what sticks with her.However, they have been really hot out of the gate after they learned that Walz was going to be her pick with the attacks. They're trying to paint her the same way we're seeing them paint Harris, which is to define him as more liberal than both Harris and Joe Biden to try and really focus is on his record as governor. I think you heard Kevin there explain how in Congress, his 12 years in Congress, Walz was actually a little bit more moderate. They don't really want to focus on that. They want to focus on his record as governor and tried to paint him as being very progressive and pushing the Democratic ticket to the left. And we did hear Vance talk about this today when he was in Philadelphia I want you to take a listen to what he told reporters. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. J.D. VANCE (R-OH), VICE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  Tim Walz's record is a joke. He's been one of the most far less radicals in the entire United States government at any level. But I think that what Tim Walz's selection says, is that Kamala Harris has bent the knee to the far left of her party, which is what she always does. Kamala Harris is running as a San Francisco liberal. She has governed as a San Francisco liberal and she's chosen a running mate who will be a San Francisco style liberal. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

He grew up in a small town in Minnesota, but they're trying to argue that he will have the same types of policies as Kamala Harris. And specifically that she had when she was attorney general in California. But, look, as to your second question, Jim, it's hard to say how concerned they are. I can tell you who they were more concerned about, and that was Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro. When I talked to a lot of Donald Trumps advisers, they said that they were kind of had a sigh of relief today when they saw that Harris did not select Shapiro because their big concern was that Shapiro could help her in Pennsylvania and of course that is a state that both campaigns believe is crucial to them winning in November.Another key line of attack, I know that they're going to be using is not necessarily about Walz, but against Harris, not selecting Shapiro, what they've been trying to argue is that she did not choose him because he's a -- he's a Jewish governor. People have criticized as them on the left for how he has handled his kind of being critical of the war between Israel and Hamas and the demonstrators and the protests around that. They're saying that that was something that Harris ran away from. So, you're going to hear a lot of this type of language and rhetoric as they continued to figure out how do we define not only Walz but Harris overall.",

Charlie, so the conventional thinking about the number to candidate that a lot of thinking that Governor Shapiro of Pennsylvania was in the running right up to the final minute here was that he might make a difference in winning Pennsylvania for the Democrats.So my question is, one, do you believe that? Do you believe it was a mistake for her not to go with the Pennsylvania governor? CHARLIE DENT (R-PA), FORMER U.S. REPRESENTATIVE:  Well, let me just first say I know Tim Walz. He's a friend and he was a good, honorable congressman. He served as a moderate congressman when he was there. But I thought that Josh Shapiro provided more value to Kamala Harris for the simple reason that there were a lot of Shapiro Trump voters in 2022. If you look at the map, Trump -- I mean, Shapiro won in a lot of places that Trump did. I could not say the same thing about Walz and Biden. Walz and Biden, when you look at the electoral map 2022 in Minnesota. They basically wanted the same areas. That is not true of Josh Shapiro. And if you look at the Philadelphia media market in particular, and that's about 40 percent of the vote of the entire state. That's where Shapiro is, especially strong. And that's where Harris needs to run up the numbers. And I thought on the margins, Shapiro could have helped her win Pennsylvania? So I thought that Shapiro was the obvious smart choice because Harris has no path to victory in this election without Pennsylvania, she can't win without it. So I was really quite surprised. And also Shapiro could probably help Democrats nationally was some of the erosion they're experiencing but Jewish voters in the aftermath of the Israel Gaza war and all that's been happening there.",

I think there -- there's Pennsylvania, there's also voters are around the back battleground who are going to meet whether it's Walz or whether it was Shapiro are going to meet these candidates and really liked them.And then the other thing I would notice what is the impact and that taking away from Walz or anybody else, what is the impact of the vice presidential pick generally historically? And historically, it's not that great. It's more likely to do harm than it is to actually provide a boost. It's fun and it's exciting for us to all to talk about it. It is a very early decision for our campaign that's still new, brand new. Ultimately, we've seen in past years, we did a study once wants where we tried to look at different potential VP picks for Trump in '16 and there was only one candidate who were hurt him? Nobody really helped him. And the only candidate potential candidate who heard them was Ivanka, if he had picked Ivanka, which was being circulated and floated at the time. So if you picked Ivanka, that would have hurt him. Everybody else, it would have had no change. So I think by that measure, is it really true that one candidate would have guaranteed a state or have this impact? I don't know if that's true in this election the way it hasn't necessarily been true in previous elections.",

The U.S. believes an attack by Iran and/or its proxies is likely in the coming days. Hamas has just announced Haniyeh's replacement. He is Yahya Sinwar, the mastermind of the October 7 attacks now, the top official in Gaza. We're also learning that President Biden today spoke separately to the leaders of Qatar and Egypt about continuing diplomatic efforts to deescalate regional tensions.

Good to have you on Steven. Thanks so much for joining. First, I want to begin on this decision by Hamas to name Haniyeh's replacement as Yahya Sinwar, the architect, of course, of the bloody brutal, brazen October 7 attacks. What's the significance of that move? STEVEN COOK, AUTHOR, \"THE END OF AMBITION: AMERICA'S PAST, PRESENT AND FUTURE IN THE MIDDLE EAST\":  Well, I think it underlines the fact that there is not going to be a ceasefire in Gaza very soon. There's been a lot of focus on Prime Minister Netanyahu's efforts to undermine or walk away from a ceasefire. But Yahya Sinwar has not wanted a ceasefire either. There are text messages and other messages from him to the now deceased Ismail Haniyeh, suggesting that he believed that there was no need for a ceasefire because he believed that Hamas was winning in the Gaza Strip. So I think when Secretary Blinken said a while ago that the two sides were on the 10-yard line, I think he meant they still had 90 yards to go because we're not anywhere close.",

I mean, he's a counterpoint to the kind of conservative populism that both Trump and Vance are promoting.He appeals to those same constituents, but with a message that government has a role to play with a message that pluralism and diversity are not something to be scared of.
