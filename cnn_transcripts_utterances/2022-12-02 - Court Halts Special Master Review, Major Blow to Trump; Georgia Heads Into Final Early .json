This decision is a huge blow to the Trump team and frankly a big win for the Justice Department.This three-judge panel made up of three Republican appointed judges, ruling that the special master should not be involved in this case. Here is a part of what they say in this ruling. The law is clear, we cannot write a rule that allows any subject of a search warrant to block government investigations after the execution of the warrant. Nor can we write a rule that allows only former presidents to do so. So, the appeals court making very clear they do not believe there should be some kind of special carve out for former President Donald Trump simply because he is a former president. Practically this could mean the Justice Department gets these documents. These are not the documents that were marked classified but this is the whole mess of other documents that were seized from Mar-a-Lago sooner than they would have otherwise. But of course, the X factor is if Trump's team will appeal. They could potentially take this to the Supreme Court. Sara Murray, CNN, Washington. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

It's a three day tour and right smack dab in the middle of it yesterday, day two, we had the release of Harry and Meghan, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex's Netflix docuseries trailer. It's less than 60 seconds long but in that space and with very little dialogue it makes abundantly clear that it is going to cause huge headaches for the royal family. So, in that trailer you see pictures of Harry and Meghan, some of them they are looking quite upset, quite anguished, maybe even in tears. And you have Harry talking about the need to protect his family and Meghan saying, when the stakes are this high, doesn't it make more sense to hear our story from us? Of course, we've heard part of this story already when Harry and Meghan gave that explosive interview to Oprah Winfrey last year. And Meghan made the claim that within the royal family there had had been, quote, concerns and conversations about how dark her son's skin might be when he's born.

But for a skier and snowboarder like myself, we want to see the snow piling up over the Western U.S. and it is going to do that this weekend. In fact, this is not a typo. Got to point this out. 1 to 3 feet of snow. This is the Sierra Nevada mountain range across central and southern California -- central and northern California, I should say.Elsewhere, we have anywhere from a foot to a foot and 1/2 of snow across the central Rockies. This is thanks to two separate winter storms coinciding perfectly with the meteorological start to winter. So, here's the first one. Moving through the Great Basin as we speak. So, the Rockies into Colorado as well as Utah is getting hammered with snow right now. Coming to an end quickly across Southern California and then will get a brief lull in the activity before late tonight and into the day on Saturday. It picks up in intensity. This is the secondary storm system that's going to bring us more snow. So, we're really going to pile this on as it taps into moisture. In fact, we've got this high resolution forecast snowfall totals and this is just incredible to see. This takes us through the next three days, the potential for over 2 1/2 feet in places like Mammoth Mountain and Into Squaw Valley ski resort. And it's not just the mountains that are experiencing the snow. Salt Lake City could have some travel impacts, just west of Seattle and the Puget Sound. The lower elevations of California, that'll be rain. It'll just be simply too warm for that to fall as snow. But I mentioned before the break that there are other concerns associated with the passage of these storms and that is mainly the wind. In fact, wind gusts on the front range of the Colorado Rockies into Colorado, perhaps into the Denver International Airport causing some delays. We could have winds in excess of 60 miles an hour. The problem here, you coincide that with dry conditions, the ongoing drought and gusty winds, you're going to have some problems with critical fire danger. So, that is a problem and a concern today across portions of Kansas and into the Oklahoma Panhandle. Mostly cloudy conditions though across the central portion of the country. If you are along the East Coast, no problems with the exception of Saturday maybe some light rain. But, Bianca, I don't know, do you like the snow as much as I do?",
