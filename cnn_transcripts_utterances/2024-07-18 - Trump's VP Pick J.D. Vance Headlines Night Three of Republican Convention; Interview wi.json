We've got you tied right here from the CNN political grill right here in Milwaukee on day three of the Republican National Convention. The very day when Senator J.D. Vance accepted the Republican vice presidential nomination.Now his speech tried to give you a little bit of this and a little bit of that, saying sometimes reintroducing himself and of course his biography, his childhood in Appalachia, his lower middle-class to the Marines to Harvard trajectory. It also highlighted his deep distrust of Washington and his prescription for ridding the swamp of a fever. He says that solution is Donald Trump. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. J.D. VANCE (R), VICE PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: from Iraq to Afghanistan, from the financial crisis to the Great Recession, from open borders to stagnating wages, the people who govern this country have failed and failed again. President Trump represents America's life last best hope to restore what, if lost, may never be found again. A country where a working class boy born far from the halls of power can stand on this stage as the next vice president of the United States of America. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Whether it plays for Republicans outside the room who say that some no longer recognize their party, we don't yet know how it resonates. But we do know that there is quite a split screen happening. One that is maybe delighting Republicans and the other ticking off Democrats, who desperately want to turn the page because while Democrats are in the middle of a kind of a \"Game of Throne\" style back and forth over who should be their nominee, Joe Biden, the president, is publicly insisting that he is the nominee, end of story.But CNN reporting tonight says that there are two key pieces of information that might be signaling a kind of sea change. One, Joe Biden has gone from saying that Kamala Harris can't win to asking, can she win? That may seem like a small turn of events, but it does show that he may be more open to possibilities, that it is not him. And number two that former House speaker Nancy Pelosi has apparently privately told the president that the polls show he cannot win versus Donald Trump, and that it will get worse that Biden staying on the ballot will somehow sink any hopes of Democrats winning back the House. But I can't help but wonder which came first, the conversation about him staying or people actually wanting to have that conversation. We'll get to all of that, but first, let's begin with the convention and joining me now is North Dakota governor and former Republican presidential candidate, Doug Burgum. He spoke tonight at the RNC. Governor, thank you so much for being with me this evening. GOV. DOUG BURGUM (R), NORTH DAKOTA: Laura, great to be with you. Quite a party CNN throws here.",

The coalition of the Republican Party now is common sense and working class families. If you're someone in our country who gets a paycheck, you're getting crushed by inflation, interest rates, all of these things that are economically -- real wages down under Joe Biden.They were up over $4,000 per family under President Trump. So we've gone from the Trump economic miracle to this malaise that we're in now, and that J.D. Vance is going to be in a position to really speak to those workers, and like we saw earlier this week, the head of the Teamsters endorsing President Trump. And I think, again, when you see truck drivers, it's not just the economics, it's the fact that Joe Biden has got a war on American energy. And the guys that are driving these 18-wheelers, they're not going to ever be driving an electric 18-wheeler because half their load would have to be batteries and it doesn't work in cold weather across these states, Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Ohio.

Vance has a different obviously role that he has played including in Silicon Valley. Certainly he's had the working class background.I do wonder to what extent his past professional experiences either alienate or draw in other voters on that point. But let me ask you, because a lot of the conversation has been about the vice president pick, and there is a vice president right now, Kamala Harris, who is being talked about on the other side of the aisle as potentially topping the ticket. One, what do you make of the Democrats having this conversation about a change in ticket possibly late in the game? And also, what would it look like for the policy positions of Trump against a Kamala Harris presidential candidate? BURGUM: Well, the chaos on the Democrat side I don't even know how to describe because, you know, every day who's going to be the candidate, who's going to be the vice president, what will the process be to try to select one. Every day that that party doesn't know who they're supporting is another day closer to the election day in November. It's another day lost of fundraising. It's another day lost to the building party unity. So every day there's that chaos that's good for President Trump and it's good for America because I believe President Trump's policies are unleashing U.S. energy, closing the borders, stopping the wars, turning around inflation, getting our economy going. Those things are good for everybody. They're good for independents, Democrats, good for Republicans.",

I know I watched the news.More times that either Harris or Biden because we've had North Dakota National Guard down there. I think it's one of the most under-reported stories every day. You know, there's something else going on, we report on that. But at the border with the crossings that are happening, people on the terror watch list, the amount of people that just come through, get processed, they're given a court date that's 2028, 2029. We have no idea. It's not even computer work. They're given paperwork. And how do we sort out where 10 million people are in our country? And so it is just -- it is absolutely, I don't know how you have national security in any nation in the world unless you have border security and of course we're a place where people want to come, where the American dream, but we have to make sure that we're doing that in a way. And I don't think the Republican Party is ready to have a discussion about fixing legal immigration until we secure the border. With the border secure, I think then that conversation has started.",

In 2024 under Joe Biden, it is $63,000.That means people under Joe Biden are making more. The poverty level under Donald Trump was 22 percent in that hometown. Under so Joe Biden, it's 19 percent. So the facts are things are better for people. The reality, though, is that people are not feeling it. And so that is the challenge that Joe Biden and this administration has constantly felt is that they haven't been able to say, you might not be feeling the direct impact, but I am fighting for you. J.D. Vance talks about I'm from Ohio. I went to Ohio State. I think we missed each other by three months, literally. It's a matter of Ohio is a labor union town. J.D. Vance voted against the Pro Act which would protect labor protection. J.D. Vance voted against NLRB, the National Labor Review Board restrictions to help protect workers. So when we talk about who is fighting for the working people, I would agree Democrats haven't done a good job in conveying that message.

We're told that Biden responded with defensiveness, which frankly is expected given that he is the incumbent who's got the delegates. And this all of course also comes as we learned that Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer has expressed similar concerns. However, we're also learning that Biden has become a little more receptive about the future of the ticket, even asking advisers, do you think Kamala can win? On top of this, Biden is suddenly off the campaign trail. Why? Maybe Mercury is retrograde, I just don't know. But he tested positive for COVID-19 today and he is back home in Delaware for the next few days. We've got Bryan and Ashley with us. They've made up, don't worry about it. Also, Kaitlan Collins and Phil Mattingly are also here as well. I got to ask you, guys, first of all, the fact that this is happening, I mean, I joked about Mercury and retrograde. But Dems can't catch a break. Now, the president has COVID. KAITLAN COLLINS, CNN ANCHOR, \"THE SOURCE WITH KAITLAN COLLINS\": Yes, it's because also, you know, we've talked to White House officials and Phil knows this as well, we both have covered President Biden from the White House, is that they were really hoping to hit a few homeruns in this stretch. Tomorrow we have three weeks since the debate, it's hard to think of that. And they were hoping to have him out on the trail, doing interviews, showing that he is capable and that it was just that one bad night. And this kind of just -- you know, the cherry on top of everything where he has struggled to break through I think in those interviews, the one with Lester Holt, the one with BET.

It was a competent picked by Donald Trump, in my opinion, in the sense that, if you're going to win, then you get someone in like J.D. Vance, who's going to be the heir apparent. He's 39 years old. He's friends with Donald Trump Jr. I thought that he might choose a Doug Burgum, a Glenn Youngkin, even a Nikki Haley or Marco Rubio to try and broaden the base. I don't think that's J.D. Vance's utility. I think the Trump camp thinks they're going to win.
