Donald Trump back on the campaign trail and two critical states, before heading back to New York for his hush money trial today. And Marjorie Taylor Greene daring Democrats to stop her from forcing a vote to oust Speaker Mike Johnson. Five a.m. here in Washington, this is a live look at the UCLA campus where it is 2:00 a.m., the middle of the night, basically. Good morning to those of you who are here on the East Coast. Good evening to those watching out west. I'm Kasie Hunt. It's great to be with you this morning. We do have breaking news right now. Police have now entered the makeshift pro-Palestinian encampment at UCLA, and there's been a standoff between police and protesters, going on all night long after demonstrators were ordered to leave and refused. Police have been surrounding the encampment for hours now, all of this developing one night after violent clashes between the two protest groups. CNN's Nick Watt is on the campus of UCLA. He's near the encampment. Nick, what are you seeing at this hour?",

      "sentences": "OK. As you mentioned, the police have gone into the encampment, which is behind me and then we have a line of California highway patrol, and then we have a line of LAPD facing the group that I'm with.This is a group of pro-Palestinian protesters were gathered over the past six or seven hours since the rumors swirled that there was going to be an incursion into the camp. This crowd has gathered. Now, obviously, it is 2:00 in the morning the law enforcement I assumed was hoping that a lot of this crowd would have dispersed by now. They have not. It's little thinner than it was, but it is still big. So the geography here is, I'm on the east side, lines of police, the encampment, and then another group of pro-Palestinian protesters on the other side. Now, what we have been hearing from inside the encampment, a lot of these people are watching live streams. It appears that some, for some reason, law enforcement has gone in and then moved back slightly and that has been and cheered by people as some sort of victory, unclear exactly what is going on. So I'm not going to make any conclusions about it. But people here are, they are saying that this is a victory. Now, this encampments been there for about a week after some violence last night where counter-protestors through firecrackers sprayed chemical there were physical altercations since then, the very hands off police presence completely changed. Today, this campus swarming with LAPD and California highway patrol building up to this, which is the move into the encampment. The encampment has been illegal all along, but the university has put up with it not wanting to create a flashpoint. Last night, that all changed. Tonight, we see them moving in. And now, they're concerned. That encampment has been there for a week. They're concerned a lot of human waste in there. They're concerned that some of those protesters have bear spray. So I was told by a source, this is going to be a slow and methodical process for a few hours now, there have been buses, L.A. sheriff buses parked about a mile away waiting to take those people arrested away? The operation is underway, as I say, slow and methodical. So expect this to last for some time. We will be here watching it play out. Back to you.",

      "sentences": "This has been something that Donald Trump has done repeatedly as he has faced other legal proceedings, but this is the first time where it is true when he says trial is keeping him off the campaign trail, right? He is required to be in court. The days the court is in session.Now, he seemed to I know he played golf at least one day that the trial was off our earlier, but this time he tried to use the time that he had to go out and do these rallies on the campaign trail. What you heard there from him was fairly typical complaints. But the reality is the gag order question is a serious one that were going to see again today. The judge has threatened Trump with jail if he keeps doing it. What is your expectation for what were going to see in court today, and how Trump seems to be handling how he talks about the trial in the wake of the gag order punishments?",

      "sentences": "Well, Kasie, so what I think we saw yesterday was especially striking given that Trump was not backing down, if anything, doubling down on his group claims of grievance and frustration with the judge. So given that what were going to be seeing today is a debate over the potentially holding Trump in contempt of court for his various comments attacking the judge directly, attacking witnesses, and the entire process here.We're really seeing campaign candidate Trump and the political incentives that he has here to lean into his brand of grievance running up against the legal fact that he as you said, could be thrown into jail if he has continued to be hold into contempt. So, we'll make that make a lot of sense for illegal defendant to be taking this stance in court. It makes a lot of sense to lean into Trumps brand here as a political figure. HUNT:  Yeah. Well, certainly I mean, I think my question remains, what is the difference between a general election and a primary election campaign on this question? Because obviously these are swing states in a general election, Wisconsin and Michigan, it's going to be very, very close whether this helps him there with a general electorate. He is going to need independents, is a question. Trump also weighed in on the campus protests, which is something that is unified Republicans. And the current president, Joe Biden, has not said anything about it on camera yet. I think underscoring during the challenges he has. Here's what Trump said about the campus protests.

We're not talking about what's going on in the Israel-Palestine conflict at the moment. We're talking about what's going on in these campuses, which is a situation that conservatives are -- have been talking about for decades now, saying that left-wing, you know, activists on college campuses are a site of disorder, are a site of weakness. This is something that conservative feel very comfortable leaning into and something that they have a lot of experience focusing on.And it's something that Democrats feel that they need to play defense on. I mean, this is why mike Johnson, who is facing a lot of challenges in Congress himself at the moment, has visited Columbia University and called for the president's resignation there because this is something that can unite his conference at a time when they're very, very fractious, otherwise.",

The protesters were ordered to leave late last night, but they have yet to move out. And now, even more pro-Palestinian demonstrators have gathered behind the police line. Demonstrations are now spreading outside the U.S. We've seen protests popping up in Europe and Canada. And now, there's a university in Iran trying to involve itself by offering scholarships to any students who are expelled during these protests. CNN's Max Foster joins us now, live from London. Max, I'm going to set aside the fact that if you went to the university in Iran on a scholarship, I don't think you'd be allowed to protest something that the government didn't want you to protest. So there's that. But let's talk about the international response and sort of how these protests are being perceived overseas as well. What are you seeing in Europe and across the rest of the world?",

The Biden administration is pushing hard at -- for a ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas, who they're fighting against. And the obviously Benjamin Netanyahu is a critical piece here.And \"The Wall Street Journal\" writes in the paper this morning that Netanyahu's poll numbers have stabilized in the wake of Iran's drone and missile attack on Israeli soil of a couple of weeks ago and the Biden administration, of course, is under pressure as these protests have expanded. They say Biden needs the Israeli leader deliver a halt in fighting that could ease domestic pressure over the conflict. And yet it doesn't seem as though Netanyahu is under as much pressure to do that as he might have been. Or maybe, maybe the fact that these poll numbers are stronger actually, take some pressure off, considering it's the right-wing that is demanding that he go in to Rafah. How do you understand how the situation in Israel is putting pressure, Netanyahu's domestic political situation is putting pressure on the ceasefire negotiations?",

He's still very weak so when we see the poll numbers increasing, then that would reflect, I think Israelis starting to believe in his strategy.I mean fundamentally the problem with a strategy is he had these two outcomes that he wanted destroying Hamas, releasing the hostages, neither what she's achieved and the longer it takes, the harder it is for him to keep that support. But, you know, there -- if you're an Israeli, you feel under fire. And the fact that you felt under threat by Hamas at one point now feel under threat priestly from Iran, it does -- it creates fear and you're looking for strong leadership. And in many ways, you're seen as a strong leader and we've talked before, we are, we should never underestimate Benjamin Netanyahu, but he still hasn't got the result that he needs. And he also needs America supports and Americas very frustrated about the complete lack of aid still getting into Gaza. You know, that's the red line for them. And it's, you know, there's no resolution to it. Another Erez crossing being opened up, but we haven't seen anything substantial coming in on land in terms of aid, and that's a big problem for Netanyahu in terms of his wider support.",
