But we can also observe that Russia will not give up this stolen privilege voluntarily. Therefore, the UN General Assembly should be given a real power to overcome the veto.

John Kirby, a top national security official told reporters the government agencies are still weighing the possibility of sending these weapons to Ukraine.

You mentioned there Kharkiv, there's also her Kherson, Lviv, Kyiv. This is widespread across Ukraine and in some cases very far away from the frontline.A reminder here that this is something that Ukrainian civilians have been dealing with throughout this war. Not just the attacks, but the fear of these attacks happening at any moment in any area of Ukraine. Just those attacks in Kherson that resulted in two people died. It was two men in a dormitory that was hit. Meanwhile, in Kyiv there several were injured, including a nine year old girl. These are civilians. These are not soldiers and this is a devastating reminder of what is continuing. While the diplomacy is playing out in New York and now as Zelenskyy going to DC, this war is very much still happening and impacting civilians on a day-to-day basis. Now all of this, this news overnight will be good ammunition really for Zelenskyy while he's heading to DC to meet with Biden, but also, crucially, to meet with lawmakers on the other side of the aisle that might have doubts about continuing to fund Ukraine's counteroffensive. This is why these kinds of attacks that Russia is continuing, this is what Zelenskyy will be showing as the reason why they continue to need aid. They continue to need help in this counteroffensive. And you mentioned there this aid package that the White House is now planning to give, notably not these long-range missiles. Again, something that is likely to be on the agenda when Zelenskyy meets with Biden today. Why not these missiles? This is what he has been specifically asking for. These army tactical missile systems. They have a very long-range and can reach behind enemy lines. Now clearly, the U.S. is offering a lot of other things including antiaircraft capabilities that will be crucial for protecting against exactly this kind of Russian shelling that we've seen overnight. And that is very important, particularly as we go into the winter months. But these long-range missiles are crucial for a counteroffensive, for pushing back into Russian infrastructure in this war. And clearly that is something Zelenskyy is going to be asking about today, when he meets with Biden.",
