Thank you so much for being with us. Stephanie, I want to start with you, because it seems that the Trump campaign is making a deliberate choice to see the spotlight, something they don't do a lot. And I want to read from some of your latest reporting. You write, that, aside from a celebratory rally last Friday, Trump has largely gone silent, even canceling a planned television interview with a Virginia network, according to local outlet 13 News Now. After flirting with announcing his vice- presidential pick in the days before the debate, his campaign reverted to their original plans to unveil the pick closer to the Republican convention. So, a rare less is more strategy from the Trump campaign?",

He's seeded the spotlight, as you've mentioned.And in doing so, he's been able to focus the negative attention on President Biden's debate performance to show the Democratic infighting and to project, you know, Republican strength. They don't have the same problems and it seems like the polling has been helping them ever since the debate. And so, we're seeing that the campaign has largely allowed the advisers to do the talking for President Trump. And instead of, you know, potentially unveiling a vice presidential running mate, he's decided to hold off on that announcement, which is something that we were expecting, but there was discussion among sources that it had told me that they might have unveiled it earlier should the debate not have gone the way that they were hoping it to go.",
