      "sentences": "Good evening and what a day and welcome to a week of testimony from perhaps the most consequential and controversial prosecution witness in the former president's hush money trial, Michael Cohen. A one-time fixer, attorney and according to his memoir, designated thug for the former president. He's now a convicted felon and self-admitted perjurer, but despite that resume, he took the stand today as the single individual who can, should the jury believe him, do what no other witness can, testify to multiple direct conversations with the former president about the then candidate's alleged knowledge and even authorization of every critical step of the alleged hush money crime that forms the basis of the 34 felony charges against him.Plus, Cohen can testify to the prosecution's allegation that the so- called catch-and-kill scheme was a political move designed to win an election. Cohen today quoted Trump telling him he wanted Stormy Daniels' allegation under wraps until after the election, quote, \"If I win, it has no relevance. I will be president. If I lose, I don't even care.\" Prosecutor used texts, call logs and emails wherever possible to document Cohen's testimony and tried to front end the credibility issues the defense will certainly use against Cohen. Afterwards, the former president addressed the news media. He had harsh words for the trial itself and the judge, but no mention of the witness, suggesting the gag order may be having an effect. Joining me now, criminal defense attorney, Arthur Aidala, former federal prosecutor Jeffrey Toobin, and a slew of my colleagues who were in the courthouse on this huge day, anchors Abby Phillip, Kaitlan Collins, Laura Coates and also correspondent Kara Scannell.

When he was answering that question and explaining why he did it, which is because it was paperless, no documents would come in the mail to his home saying that he took out a $130,000 line of credit because his wife didn't know. And he was explaining that he looked directly at the jury for sustained periods of time and was kind of walking him through it.

He was not that person on the witness stand.When he first got there in the morning, he had his hands to his side, almost as if he was sitting on them. He kind of had - his body language was so close to the vest.

They want to have the person who, at that time, what were you willing to do, what did you do, but more importantly, at whose behest did you do so. We hadn't heard much testimony up until now about the directions that were given by Donald Trump, who he was giving the instructions to. We heard today. I want you and David Pecker to work together; you and Allen Weisselberg to figure this out. The instructions given in a way we had not seen before. And there was also a moment where they took the wind out of the sale of the defense argument to suggest that, look, he's a liar in all capacities, why believe him. Well, he says, one, I lied routinely for Donald Trump. That was part of my job. He knew that I did that for the media. The other part was the big question everyone asked. Why did he record that phone call or that conversation between himself and Donald Trump? He says, fronting the issue, I did it because I wanted David Pecker to remain loyal to Trump. I did it because I wanted to show Pecker that he didn't intend to pay the money.

But this moment to hear -- I mean, and it's Michael Cohen's word that we're going off of.
