Don't worry about it. I think they ought to tell people what's going on. They'd get a lot of credibility from people to say, okay, he's struggling with something. Let's give him a chance. John Fetterman did that and people reacted very positively. I think the Mitch McConnell people just take a lesson from Fetterman and tell us what's really happening with the senator.",
