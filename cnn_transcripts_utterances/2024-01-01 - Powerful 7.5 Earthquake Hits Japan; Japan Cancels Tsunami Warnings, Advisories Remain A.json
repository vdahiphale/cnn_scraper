It's middle of night there. Collapsed homes and there is still the possibility of people trapped under the rubble. We are seeing videos of the moment of impact are showing an office building. All right, from another vantage point, we saw people who were at a bowling alley. They were there to celebrate the New Year. Again, this hit at about 4:10 in the afternoon Japan time. At this bowling alley, you can see people racing for cover underneath the tables there. SOLOMON: Now the 7.5 magnitude quake struck Japan western coast.

The tsunami warnings haven't been entirely lifted. And this is because the Japanese government and authorities are very concerned about potential damage.We know that hundreds of police officers, about 1700 firefighters, thousands self-defense force personnel have been dispatched to this area in order to try to evacuate people to get them to safer places. Of course, when the earthquake happened at 4:10 pm local time, people were expected to drop their things and evacuate immediately to higher ground. But we're hearing reports of being of people trapped under their houses, so unable to get out really. And of course, the military personnel are there in order to try to help people to safety.",

And I asked him what kind of damage this sort of earthquake it caused?DR. ZHIGANG PENG, GEORGIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY: Because of the event of this size that we expect a lot of aftershocks. And as you probably know, houses in Japan are very strong. The mostly wooden building structures, so they can withstand some of the shaking. But if you have continuous vibration mostly aftershocks, then that could cause some damages. And as you've already pointed out, that sometimes if it caused fires that could become another problem. So those are primarily two things that I think, you know, people in the epicenter region -- you know, really have to watch out.",

This obviously makes it difficult to get aid and to get rescue operations underway. If they're in any way needed, obviously, there is more shaking and whatnot in other places as well.And I'm glad you brought up aftershocks because I think in some ways the very term diminishes the threat. These are earthquakes. They may not be as powerful as the initial earthquake, but the repetition in and of itself can be very dangerous. Can you explain that?",

But there's always a very small percentage. We're talking about maybe like five or 10 percent chance that an aftershock can be larger than the initial event.And in that case, of course, we call the aftershock as the main event, and we call the previous event as the mainshock. So, things like that could happen, but it's a very small probability. But it's not zero. So that's one thing I'd like to point out to your audiences is that the sequence is still unfolding.

      "sentences": "Yeah. It's not to toughen assignment are held. But certainly, President Biden does have a plate full of significant issues heading into the new year and they all take on this new degree of consequence against the backdrop of the 2024 election. And I think at the top of that list has to be this issue with the southern border and immigration. And you do see the president really trying to pull every lever that he can to try and ease some of that crisis.Certainly, he's under a lot of pressure from Republicans, but also from a lot of Democrats, mayors and governors who are seeing the consequences of this in their own regions. This is part of the reason President Biden dispatched that high level delegation to Mexico last week to talk with the Mexican government about this. Some Mexican officials who will be back in Washington in the coming weeks to continue those discussions. That sort of the diplomatic front. You also see this parallel effort in Congress talks between Republicans and Democrats on enacting some new rules on the southern border. President Biden has said that he's open to some significant concessions when it comes to rules on migration, when it comes to deportations. But remember, this is all tied up in President Biden's request for more money for Ukraine and Israel. Obviously, those two overseas conflicts have taken up the bulk of the president's time over the last several months. And that will obviously continue into the new year. We are actually entering quite a critical stretch for the war in the Middle East. U.S. officials watching very closely to see if Israel starts shifting down its conflict there as they have been urging. And the Secretary of State Antony Blinken will be in Israel later this week. Of course, this is all happening against the backdrop of the '24 election and certainly President Biden will begin ramping up his campaigning in the weeks to come. What you've heard from a lot of Democrats is that he hasn't necessarily said enough about former President Trump. That I'm told will change. We will start to hear President Biden talking more and more about what he says are the threats to democracy posed by a second Trump presidency. Now, we have not seen that much of President Biden over the last week or so in St. Croix. But we did see him coming out of dinner a few nights ago and someone asked him what is new year's resolution was? And all he said was to be here next year. SOLOMON: OK.

I think at this point, individuals who are still in this race are more than likely running to be considered a second to Trump, meaning they're running mate, Nikki Haley, Ron DeSantis. I even think individuals such as Tim Scott, who has been very favorable in his remarks about the former president as of later, all eying of being his running mate.But the reality is for Trump, I think you have to ask yourself, who's going to give you some advantage with women voters and independent voters going into 2024 election. And I think the Biden administration is going to have a really difficult time trying to paint Trump only as an anti-democracy candidate if he's able to find someone who's more palatable to some of those swing voters.",

There's still too much noise going on in this Republican primary.But I think Iowa and New Hampshire are going to fix that. I do think also that, you know, with respect to Nikki Haley, she had a lot of momentum, John. And I think she hurt herself this past week with the gaff on slavery, the omission, if you will about something that was really obvious. And I think that the Biden campaign -- you can kind of see this already with some of the tweets like the president immediately hit back to Nikki Haley and wrote, it was slavery, right? When she didn't get the answer right for the question asked about the causes of the civil war. And so, I think that they're going to go after Nikki Haley and show that she's not at all a candidate that's palatable to the senator or to independence. In fact, she's just as bad as Trump. [12:20:00] And I think whatever this ticket ends up being, if it's Trump and DeSantis, or Trump and Haley, although DeSantis says he's not going to run as a running mate. I think they're going to paint him as an extremist threat to democracy -- you know, campaign and I think that's going to be what the campaign is going to be about to be honest.",

If I were advising the president, I would focus a lot on the economy. You guys had a segment a few blocks ago that talked about how things are improving economically.Look at the job numbers. We can expect in this new year for the Fed to decrease. Basis rates, which is a good thing for people who are trying to buy homes, particularly young people in my age group. I also think that the administration is doing the right thing by having the vice president crisscross the country, talking about reproductive rights. If you look at how effective Democrats were down ballot, including in my state of Virginia, you saw significant victories against Republicans and races that the Republicans should have won on the question, on the issue, on the topic of abortion. So, I think focusing on those two things, what a little bit of the anti-democracy talk against Trump could be an effective message for the Biden, Harris administration going into November, which will likely lead to a reelection?",

You know, President Biden has a record to run on Donald Trump, seems like he's going to have a record that he's going to have to run with.
