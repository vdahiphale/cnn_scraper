Americans with different perspectives aren't talking to each other, but here, they do. (END VIDEOTAPE) PHILLIP (on camera): Good evening. I'm Abby Philip in New York. Let's get right to what America is talking about. There is news breaking just moments ago that the New York City mayor, Eric Adams, has now been indicted on at least one federal criminal charge. The indictment, as of right now, is sealed, so it's unclear exactly what charge or charges Mayor Adams will face. But he will become the first mayor in the city's history to be charged while still in office. Federal investigators have been looking at his campaign fundraising, at foreign influence violations. And Mayor Adams has denied any wrongdoing despite resignations left and right from right inside of his administration. We're going to discuss this at the table, but, first, let's go to CNN's Chief Law Enforcement and Intelligence Analyst John Miller, who's been a part of New York City for quite a long time. I mean, John, first of all, what do we know about all the various things that Mayor Adams could be facing here, which adds to a level of complexity, given that we don't yet know what the charges are?",

      "sentences": "Well, this is basically five investigations, one into alleged foreign influence from China, who allegedly -- they're investigating whether a key aid to the mayor was co-opted to do China's bidding within the city administration, similar to the case we just saw with an aid to the governor.nother is a case into two deputy mayors and the school's chancellor, and that is looking into how contracts were awarded, specifically contracts that were awarded with urgency on issues, like migrant housing and other things, security contracts and more, a special assistant to the mayor. The police commissioner was probed because his twin brother was allegedly going around shaking down bars for money on the idea that he could either ease up on police enforcement or perhaps increase it if money wasn't paid. So, you see this flurry of activity. But they're separate. The mayor's investigation, that's the FBI. The deputy of mayor's investigation is being led by the U.S. Attorney's Office and other agencies. The foreign counterintelligence section of the FBI is looking into the alleged Chinese foreign influence. But, Abby, as you pointed out, what it has caused is a storm of subpoenas, seizures, search warrants among the people closest to the mayor, which, of course, has cast a large shadow over the administration, over City Hall, and over, you know, the Adams campaign, which is going to face an election within a year.",

      "sentences": "Yes. I mean, he's up for re-election next year. There are a number of people lining up to replace him. He's made a lot of political enemies just in his time as mayor, and many of those people have already started speaking up, calling for him at this point to resign.John Miller, please stand by for us as the story continues to develop. We're going to bring it in to the studio here at the table. Joining us in our fifth seat is Manhattan Criminal Defense Attorney Stacy Schneider. Stacy, as John just pointed out, it's a lot of different investigations. I mean, I think we will have a conversation here with this group about the political implications of it all. But from a legal perspective, what do you think is the most likely scenario here for what he could be facing given what we know about Eric Adams, the mayor, and what he's being investigated over? STACY SCHNEIDER, MANHATTAN CRIMINAL DEFENSE ATTORNEY: So, based on the evidence that's been seized from different members of the administration and the fact that the New York City mayor has had his own cell phones and iPad seized by the FBI, what I suspect might be coming down is one of the allegations, and this is going to be a public corruption indictment, very likely. But one of the allegations that has been floating around is that there was a member, a former member of someone associated with the Turkish government or a liaison to the Turkish community, as well as someone who worked for a Turkish airline, and that there was some kind of fundraising done with Turkey that enabled, allegedly, pressure to be put on the New York City Fire Department to approve the building of a high rise in midtown Manhattan for a brand new Turkish consulate. So, that's some of the alleged facts that are floating around that might turn up in this sealed indictment, which will be released tomorrow, but the most shocking part of all of this, besides the fact that New York City top administration officials under the mayor have been dropping like flies, resigning left and right, the mayor's own counsel just resigned, you know, apparently because, allegedly, he wasn't listening to her advice. Whatever the typical reason is that lawyers resign in the middle of investigations, that's usually it. But the fact that the New York City mayor has been investigated in this way and all these people who had their phones seized in his administration, I think this indictment is going to be multipronged regarding many, at least five, they're talking about, foreign governments where there's been some kind of allegedly improper activity. But we'll see what the evidence turns up in the indictment.",

      "sentences": "It is incredibly stunning. You know, this is someone, I mean, for context, not only the mayor of, you know, New York City, this incredible institution of a city when it comes to this country, but also someone who just a couple of years ago, when he was elected, was being touted. He touted himself as the future of the Democratic Party. He was presenting himself as the person who best represented the path forward for the Democratic Party. He is now being indicted for what sounds like public corruption.GRETCHEN CARLSON, JOURNALIST AND CO-FOUNDER, LIFT OUR VOICES: And he was a police officer. And I think the most striking thing to me is if you just look at his childhood and his background, you know, he had skirmishes with the law when he grew up in a single parent family. And then he ended up being able to rehabilitate himself and became a police officer and rose to the ranks of becoming the mayor of the biggest city in the United States. But to hear these types of allegations potentially in charges, it doesn't sound like it's a one- off. The other thing I had heard was that potentially they were bundling campaign funds together and then they were reimbursing people for those funds, which is, I guess, a violation of campaign fundraising. So, earlier today, AOC called for his resignation and I was wondering if that had something to do with anything or if she had prior knowledge, but it's just very sad. PHILLIP: Yes. I mean, I think that the circumstances were starting to collapse on Eric Adams. It is a question now of what happens next. Does he resign? Does he get pushed out by the governor, Kathy Hochul? What happens now, because the pressure is mounting? TARA SETMAYER, CO-FOUNDER AND CEO, THE SENECA PROJECT: Yes. Well, right now, I think the question of who's running New York City is a legitimate one. And for Eric Adams, I mean, if you've been following this, I don't think anyone is surprised that it has come to this point. And, you know, he's been very arrogant throughout all of this knowing that these things have been swirling around, right? Self pride comes before a fall. And I think this is a perfect example of that in politics with Eric Adams. And it is a shame, because he does have a great American story, as Gretchen mentioned, overcoming his childhood and to become the mayor of the greatest city in the world, in my opinion, but you can't do this with corruption. And the Southern District of New York would not have made a move like this unless they were pretty rock solid on the evidence that they had. And once your phones are seized by the feds, that's never a good sign, and so we all know that had happened. And the fact that it's coming from multiple fronts is also highly problematic. I don't see how he stays, but then, again, in the era of Donald Trump, where you deny, deny, deny, deny, I wouldn't be surprised if he tried to stay and it puts the governor of New York in a situation. What does she do then?",

I remember during the Clinton era, he chose to fight an impeachment. It wasn't a criminal charge. But, you know, the line has been set. If you fight, you line up your allies and you move forward.

It is from a sitting Republican congressman, Clay Higgins of Louisiana. He's referencing the legal immigrants currently in Springfield, Ohio, who are now, by the way, suing Donald Trump and J.D. Vance for pushing baseless conspiracies about them. Quote, these Haitians are wild, eating pets, voodoo, nastiest country in the Western Hemisphere, cults, slapstick gangsters, but damned if they don't feel all sophisticated now, filing charges against our president and V.P. He's talking there about Trump and Vance, by the way, who is not the vice president.He goes on, quote, all these thugs better get their mind right and their ass out of our country before January 20th. Of course, that would be when Trump would be sworn into office if he wins. Now, after that post, Higgins was confronted on the House floor by Democrats in the Congressional Black Caucus. Higgins would then later delete the tweet. But he also later said that he stands by the words and doesn't regret them. That is quite the difference in how the events actually transpired and what House Speaker Mike Johnson said about it. Listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. MIKE JOHNSON (R-LA): He was approached on the floor by colleagues who said that was offensive. He went to the back. I just talked to him about it. He said he went to the back, and he prayed about it, and he regretted it, and he pulled the post down. That's what you want a gentleman to do. I'm sure he probably regrets some of the language he used, but, you know, we move forward. We believe in redemption around here. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Nobody's going to sit down and read the 82-point plan or the 82-page plan. But when she has the opportunity to do these interviews, she really has to capitalize on them.

So, if they didn't get an opportunity to see the interview, they're certainly not going to read this long thing. So, they might see clips of this on social media or they might see clips of it presented on a show like this.And when you look at what she said in the interview, I don't think she was as detailed as people were calling for. She really struggled to answer the question of how she's going to pay for some of these things. She says raise the taxes, but guess what? She may not have a Democrat-controlled Senate. And she struggled on the tariffs questions, as well. Of course, they not only kept a lot of the tariffs from the Trump administration, they actually expanded some of the ones with China. And I don't think she was really able to articulate when she talks about, yes, tariffs can be good but not always. It's a very powerful tool, I think, in an arsenal for a president when you come to dealing with countries like China, who have very unfair advantages. They don't pay for capital. A lot of their companies are owned by the government. They don't pay a living wage. And then on top of that, they don't have environmental control. So, they're able to produce things at a much lower price than what we are. So, the tariffs can't be useful there. However, they can't always -- they're not always useful. When you talk about pharmaceuticals or things that people need that we simply don't always produce here.",
