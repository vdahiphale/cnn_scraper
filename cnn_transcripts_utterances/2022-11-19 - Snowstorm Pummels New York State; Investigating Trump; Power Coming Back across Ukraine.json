The U.S. Justice Department has appointed a special counsel to take over two of the most sensitive probes involving the former president.On Friday, U.S. attorney general Merrick Garland named veteran prosecutor Jack Smith to take over the Mar-a-Lago investigation. He'll also handle key elements of the January 6th investigation as they relate to Mr. Trump. Mr. Smith has held numerous posts at the Justice Department and has served as chief prosecutor in a special court in The Hague, where he investigated war crimes. For more on Friday's announcement from the Justice Department, here is CNN's Evan Perez in Washington. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) EVAN PEREZ, CNN SR. JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT:  Attorney general Merrick Garland appointed war crimes prosecutor Jack Smith to serve as special counsel to oversee two criminal investigations related to Donald Trump. The decision was triggered in part by the former president's decision in recent days to declare a third run as a presidential candidate. Smith most recently worked as a prosecutor in The Hague, overseeing Kosovo war crimes. He'll take over investigations stemming from the alleged mishandling of classified documents, which the FBI retrieved in a search from Trump's Mar-a-Lago home, as well as portions of the January 6th investigation, dealing with Trump's efforts to impede the transfer of power after the 2020 election. Garland said the appointment was intended to show that the investigations will be done with independence. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MERRICK GARLAND, U.S. ATTORNEY GENERAL:  Based on recent developments, including the former president's announcement that he is a candidate for the next election and sitting president's stated intention to be a candidate as well, I have concluded that it is in the public interest to appoint a special counsel. Such an appointment underscores the department's commitment to both independence and accountability in particularly sensitive matters. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And we have an attorney general who is appointed by one of those two men, obviously who is appointed by President Biden. So while the Department of Justice is independent, what I think Merrick Garland recognized today is that he doesn't want it to look like a political appointee of one of the candidates. President Biden is just trying to take down the other candidate, former president Trump. The other thing is this actually insulates attorney general Merrick Garland a little bit because now that House Republicans will be in control, they're going to have a lot of hearings about these investigations. And if he has a special counsel, he can say, you know what, I'm not involved in these investigations anymore, I can't answer your questions.

Of course, Russia doesn't wait that long. Each time is attritional and further degrades the system when missiles came in Thursday. They completely threw the power grid across the country out of kilter. That's what took those 10 million homes offline.

So there are, as President Zelenskyy said, 17 different regions in this country where they are power outages in homes from four to eight hours.

One issue that the United States and China are not really cooperating on is the issue of North Korea, which has been launching missiles at an unprecedented pace throughout the year. Including this ICBM launch of what North Korea calls a new kind of long-range missile, capable of striking, according to the Japanese government, pretty much anywhere in the United States and potentially most of the world, excluding some portions of South America. If you look at the possible trajectory distance of this missile that was tested, the missile test was pretty striking when you look at the photos released by North Korean state media on Saturday morning. It was rising up over the Sunan area of Pyongyang. Kim Jong-un was there with his wife and, for the first time, his daughter, believed to be around 9 years old, appearing right alongside her dad as they walked around this gigantic missile. Dwarfed by the size of the transporter erector launch vehicle that was used to fire the missile basically more than 3,700 miles or 6,000 kilometers up into space before it splashed down in the waters near Japan. Had the trajectory been different, the missile could have traveled much farther, the Japanese government warns. Yet there has been little in terms of substantive consequences this year, with all of these North Korean missile launch events, at least 34. North Korea claiming to have launched around 50 ballistic missiles so far this year. That's more than any other year in North Korean history.

DOUGHERTYSo I think his influence certainly has increased; that would be one thing. But you know, whether or not that really is what's driving things, perhaps it is but I think a lot of this is simply driven by Putin himself, who shows no sign of going back. You know, there's a debate in the United States right now, in the Biden administration, as to whether or not, you know, they would urge Ukraine to come to the negotiating table. And I think, you know, the division there is that some people feel the Ukrainians actually have been doing very well. And maybe now is the time to lock in some of those gains. But there are others who look, as we've just been discussing, at this, you know, prospect of a very long war and say, well, you know, the Ukrainians ought to just continue. But we cannot tell them what to do. That's the mantra from this administration. And the phrase, again, you know, is nothing about Ukraine without Ukraine. And they continue to say they really mean it.",
