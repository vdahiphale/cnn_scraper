You're in THE SITUATION ROOM. We begin this hour with our midterm countdown and the crucial choices facing voters with just three weeks to go, three weeks before the Election Day. CNN National Politics Reporter Eva McKend following some of the hottest races out there beginning in the key battleground state of Georgia. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) EVA MCKEND, CNN NATIONAL POLITICS REPORTER (voice over):  With three weeks until the midterms, voters are already flocking to the polls in large numbers. In Georgia, the state set a midterm turnout record for early voting with more than 130,000 voters casting ballots Monday. On the trail today, Republican Senate Nominee Herschel Walker defending his transparency when it comes to reports he allegedly paid for an ex- girlfriend's abortion in 2009 and encouraged her to have another two years later, even as he now acknowledges the authenticity of a $700 check he sent the woman. SENATE CANDIDATE HERSCHEL WALKER (R-GA):  I've answered that question time and time again and my campaign now has been about going forward because I've been honest.",

When you look at poll after poll, it shows that the top issue for voters across the board remains the economy, it remains inflation, and far fewer people say that abortion is their number one priority.

What if anything can we make of what appears to be a very, very engaged electorate out there? NIA-MALIKA HENDERSON, CNN SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST:  That's right. Listen, voting up so far 85 percent in Georgia over what it was on the same day in 2018. That is good news for democracy. We don't know yet what the makeup of the electorate was on the first day of voting and we don't know what it will be when all the voting wraps up. Republicans are looking to see if they can get their voters out, and those are older voters. And if you're a Democrat, you want to see a more diverse electorate in terms of age, in terms of race, African- American voters, obviously, Latino voters, and Asian-American voters as well. Folks looking at Georgia also trying to figure out what the new election laws and voting laws will mean for voters there. There were a lot of concerns from a lot of people in Georgia and in looking at Georgia to see if there would be sort of voter suppression as a result of the new laws on the book there. But this suggests that at least people are showing up. They're engaged. They're interested and maybe they believe what politicians are saying, which is that this is the most consequential midterm election in quite some time.

Karine, thanks so much for joining us. As you know, for President Biden to make good on his pledge to codify Roe, Democrats would have to keep the House majority, pick up Senate seats and eventually change the filibuster rule as well. That's a very tall order. Is the president setting himself up potentially for failure? KARINE JEAN-PIERRE, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY:  So, I'll say this, Wolf, and thank you so much for having me. Look, I can't get into politics or talk about elections, you know that, because of the hatch act. So, I'm going to be careful in what I say, as I'm standing right in front of the White House here. Look, what you heard from the president is his continuous fight to fight for millions of women across the country. When we saw what the Supreme Court did in this unconscionable decision to overturn Roe, it put millions of women's lives at risk. And here's what's at stake, Wolf, and this is why this is so important, and this is why you'll continue to hear from this president on this issue, and we have, is that we're seeing these draconian laws across the country by Republicans that are putting forth laws that, again, is going to put women's health at risk, but also criminalizing doctors for doing their jobs. And if you look just right behind me at the Capitol, you have Senate Republicans who are introducing national bans. And the president says this. If there's a national ban on abortion, it's not going to matter if you're in a red state or a blue state, abortion will be illegal all across the country. So, this is what is at stake. That's what you heard from the president today.

What I'm saying to you, the president has been clear on what needs to happen. We need to make sure, and he's speaking very, very clear about this, that Americans need to make their voices heard. There is so much at stake now right now in this moment when we're talking about women's health, when we're talking about the difficult decisions. These are not abstract stories when we hear about women who have to deal with a miscarriage, unfortunately, or we hear about a rape survivor, or we hear about a woman that is in an abusive relationship. These are private decisions, personal decisions that they should be made. And the president believes we should treat women with compassion and with dignity, and that's what he's going to speak to.

President Biden clearly wants to bring attention back to the abortion rights issue before the midterms, but is that a mistake when so many Americans have these other worries right now? JEAN-PIERREAnd also it is also important to talk about the economy. The president yesterday talked about -- he put a statement out about hearing aids, making sure that hearing aids were available for 30 million Americans just across the country, saving thousands of dollars. That matters. That's going to put money back into people's pockets. Tomorrow, you're going to hear from him talking about gas prices. The president took historic, historic efforts in the past several months to make sure that we brought gas prices down because of Putin's tax hike. And it's 98 days, we saw prices go down because of the president's plan. So, we're going to hear more from him tomorrow. Look, we are doing everything that we can.

So, here's the thing, Wolf, and we -- when the president walked into the administration, he took bold action in making sure that our economy got back up, right, got started again.

The judge, Raymond Dearie, the special master in this case, is holding a conference call with the Justice Department and the Trump lawyers, and that he clearly was not happy about the amount of information he was getting from either side about these documents that may have potentially been in dispute that were seized from Mar-a-Lago.You know, the judge at one point told the sides, where's the beef? I need some beef. And at another point, he said I have no patience from either one of you on this point. It gives you an indication of sort of how messy, how slow moving this process is going to be. In one of the instances, they were going back and forth about this one specific letter. It was a letter that was addressed to the Justice Department from the Trump team but it had not been signed. And so Dearie was saying to the Trump team, did you guys ever send this letter? They're not answering. He's saying to the Justice Department, did you receive this letter? They're not answering. So, you can see where the judge's frustration is. He wants to get a better sense of exactly what's going on with the documents that are in dispute and also just what the universe of disputed documents is going to look like so that they can make progress and work through this, Wolf.",
