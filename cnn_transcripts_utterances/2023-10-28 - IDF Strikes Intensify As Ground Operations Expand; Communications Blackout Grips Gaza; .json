Our team here in Tel Aviv have to go to a shelter Friday afternoon when the air raid sirens went off once again. We heard several loud booms, and later authorities here said several people were injured after residential building was struck by a missile, including a 20-year-old man who suffered head and limb injuries. And, Max, once night fell, Gazans told CNN that they were witnessing some of the most intense airstrikes since the war began. There was widespread power, internet, and cellular service outages across the Gaza Strip. The Palestinian telecom company that provides mobile service to Gaza says that the intense bombardment resulted in the destruction of all remaining international routes connecting Gaza with the outside world, leading to a complete interruption of telecommunications services. And several United Nations agencies now report they have lost contact with their local staff in Gaza as most of the communication capabilities of the yang cave appear to have been interrupted -- Max.",

They have caused significant damage to the buildings in Gaza city and north Gaza. So I would think about now the right time for a ground incursion. But I would also ask, what is left now?

The world is certainly damaging Israel.But the Israelis seem to be losing -- I wouldn't say losing interest, but they're becoming more and more concerned about the possible casualties here. Hamas is assumed to be ready and waiting, and wants these rallies to advance and be attacked. Hamas cannot attack Israel very well apart from some relatively small warhead rockets. So they need the Israeli army to come forward, if you like, so they can score some pyrrhic victories. And die in some sort of hero manner. The Israelis are mounting these raids, which are getting more and more tense, and the bombing last night was very intense, as I said, it looks as though this is the prelude to a ground invasion, and as you just said the domestic situation in Israel is turning against a full scale invasion.",

A local service providers had most of the phone and internet links have been decimated as Israeli airstrikes pounded the enclave.As a result, communications inside Gaza with the outside world are severely disrupted. Multiple humanitarian groups say they can't get in touch with their teams on the ground. Some Palestinians who've made to maintain connection reached by CNN said they've split their family, so at least some members would survive in case of an Israeli strike. Others talk about hearing explosions, but without stable communications, they can't check if their families are okay.

OMAR ABDEL-MANNAN, FOUNDER, GAZA MEDICA VOICES: Yeah, absolutely, Max. Just to update you, we are a team of doctors that have been in touch and direct communication with medics and surgeon on the ground in Gaza since day one of this, which is probably 18 days ago now. In the last almost 24 hours now since 6:00 U.K. time yesterday, which I think would be around 1:00 Eastern Time, we have had zero, zero messages, zero ability to make phone calls, and absolutely no communication with over 300 people that we have tried to contact. These are doctors, surgeons, paramedics, brothers, sisters, fathers, mothers, friends of ours, colleagues, and we are getting no direct communication whatsoever. So, there has been literally not a single human soul's voice heard from Gaza since yesterday evening. This is a highly unprecedented situation. This is extremely concerning. The lack of communication, the Palestinian Red Crescent released a statement yesterday just had the fact there is no commission coming out of Gaza as putting patients, doctors, and the population at risk of mass casualties. They are unable to call ambulances on 101, which is their emergency helpline. They are unable to check on their family members if they're alive or not. And we are really disturbed by the implications of this blackout. Frankly, this is a new level, new territory that we've never entered before. The U.N., yesterday, I spent all evening while this was happening discussing whether they can have a cease-fire. And they resigned it over a week ago, and warned of a risk, this is directly quoted from the U.N., a risk of genocide happening in Gaza right now. There have been thousands of civilian deaths. Two children are dying every 15 minutes in Gaza. I am absolutely sure this rate has gone up in the last 12 hours. The majority of deaths are women and children, disproportionate amounts are.

The Qataris have been very instrumental in negotiating the release of hostages. But there was a breakthrough that came through yesterday, that there was some kind of hope and momentum that was built to release a number of hostages. And this is quite important -- there was hope -- talks about yesterday, before we saw the aggressive ground offensive that had occurred by the IDF. That hope has now dwindled, we do not know what this means going forward for negotiations. But the IDF said specifically that we should ignore the rumors of the release of a number of hostages, saying that they have put them down to psychological terror. The number of hostages also released by the IDF says the number has also increased to 229 right now. And again here, Max, what does this intensive ground offensive mean for negotiations, that is the big question now.",

And that people were bringing embodies, as well as the injured on bikes, on donkey carts, by car, and even by foot. I want to tell you to take a listen to what he had to say. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DR.

In response to that, we saw the Hamas-controlled health ministry releasing a 200-page document with 6,000 names, with age, and gender to basically validate the number of lives that have been lost in Gaza. The IDF now, Max, also saying that Hamas is using hospitals as, quote, to wage war, and that of course creating another element of fear that the people who have gone to hospitals for assistance and for refuge now at risk.",
