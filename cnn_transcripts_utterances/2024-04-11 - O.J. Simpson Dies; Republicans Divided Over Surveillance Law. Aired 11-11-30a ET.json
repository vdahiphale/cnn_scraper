Certainly, that is what happened yesterday on the floor of the House of Representatives.And we should just underscore how unusual it was before this Congress for rules to go down, these procedural votes, in this kind of fashion. Usually, if you don't like a bill, you don't vote for the bill, but the tradition had always been that the majority party would help get the process started on the floor. That is simply what this rule vote was. And yet they still couldn't get it over the finish line. Right now, what we are hearing from the speaker's office is that there is a hope that they might be able to go back to the House Rules Committee, restructure this rule, and create some kind of harmony among Republicans to actually get this debate started on the floor. But, again, they are up against a deadline, as intelligence officials are making clear that they are very concerned about FISA not being reauthorized by the April 19 deadline, arguing that the impact on their ability to collect intelligence would be severe at a time when there are so many threats happening against the United States at the same time. Now, there is a big question right now about what Johnson's future holds, what his speakership holds, given that threat from Marjorie Taylor Greene. And Republicans are just frustrated with the level of tumult and chaos that they are experiencing day to day working in their jobs. Here's one of those members. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. TROY NEHLS (R-TX):  All you have to do is say, we have got seven more months until the presidential election. Let's try to not completely burn the damn place down. Let's not burn the place down. Let's just get Donald Trump to do -- that's it. That's what we should focus -- that's my focus. We're dysfunctional. We are. It's become somewhat embarrassing. And it may bite us in the butt a little bit in November. My focus is Donald J. Trump now, because we can't -- nobody can manage this conference.

We do want to read that for everyone.And it says: \"On April 10, our father, Orenthal James Simpson, succumbed to his battle with cancer. He was surrounded by his children and grandchildren. During this time of transition, his family asks that you please respect their wishes for privacy and grace, the Simpson family.\" You know, Wolf, there are really two O.J. Simpsons, because one is that football hero that this country adored for so many years. And, in Southern California, I think those of us from Southern California believe that we got to know him originally because, as a graduate, he graduated from USC, was the Heisman Trophy winner. He was everything to people in Southern California, after then going on to the Buffalo Bills and also the San Francisco 49ers. But when I really started talking with him personally myself was at that Las Vegas trial. I was the correspondent for his Las Vegas trial. It was kidnapping. It was armed robbery. I think people thought of it sort of as a funny thing, a joke, but the courts in Nevada thought of it as very serious, because the potential was decades in prison. But, every day, I would go to the courthouse, and he was there. He was on bail. So he would just be in the hallway. He would be in the gallery. He'd be talking to people. Once he found out that I was from Southern California and I was a USC graduate, he wanted to talk to me all the time, because his passion was football. His passion was USC. He loved it. And he was very -- he wasn't nervous about what was happening at that trial, although the evidence was not good against him, and he was ultimately convicted on all counts and all of his cronies. It was all his golfing buddies. And they had gone to try to retrieve what had been his personal property, but it was owned by someone else at the time. Unfortunately, some of them had a couple of guns, and so it became an armed robbery situation. But he just took it in his stride. But he was very nice to everybody, very humble to everyone. And everyone knew what he'd been through in California and all the questions that remained about the murders of Nicole Brown Simpson and also Ron Goldman. But he was convicted on all counts. He was sentenced to 33 years in prison over three decades. He served it out in Lovelock, Nevada, which is a northern -- a central -- outside of Reno, Nevada. And he served nine years, and he was released. And I was there when he was released, as the correspondent for the network. And it was a very subdued thing. But he stayed in Las Vegas. The next day, we heard he was golfing once again at home in Las Vegas. And that's where we believe he stayed for the remainder of his life. But there were definitely two O.J. Simpsons. And now secrets are possibly gone forever because the murder of Nicole Brown -- Nicole Goldman -- Nicole Brown and Ron Goldman, we may never know the real truth. The jury acquitted him in 30 minutes. We know that. So he was acquitted. But what really happened to the lives of those two people may forever become a secret.",

This, to me, really started with O.J. and the Hertz commercials that Bob was referring to, that the -- as a girl growing up in Toledo, I knew O.J. because I was such a sports fan and such a nut about sports. I, of course, knew him for his Buffalo Bills days and the big 1973 season, when he ran for over 2,000 yards, 2,003. I will always remember that number. And, of course, I knew him as an athlete. But I also knew him as a pitchman and that crossover appeal into every living room. So, even if you didn't love football, you knew O.J. because of his ability to transcend sports and, of course, become the businessman and the pitchman that he was. And then the trial, and, of course, the civil trial, which you -- you know, the civil case he lost, and the fall from grace, it was extraordinary and well-deserved, absolutely self-induced, and a man that would never be seen the same again, and so, yes, truly an American story, cultural, sports, everything, the rise and fall of O.J., but a major, major part of our lives for the entirety of our lives.",

We fanned out because we knew this story was going to be so huge and threw every resource from \"The Washington Post\" at this story. And I ended up being in California. The sister was very nice to answer the door, did not want to speak to me. That was fine. And then I flew to L.A., and I helped out with the coverage there for several weeks. This was an extraordinary time, when news organizations had money to throw at these things. We don't as much now. And just the amount of journalists, the amount of reporters, it was alluded to earlier, the number of superstars in the media who started or gained fame, as well as, of course, the lawyers, Kardashian, of course, so much of our cultural history and more, it came and emanated from that, kind of launched from that story, as well as careers in the media. And so, yes, that was a big deal for me. I remember covering it. And it was all hands on deck, Wolf, everyone. This is so big, and we know it's so big.

Everyone remembers, \"If the glove doesn't fit, you must acquit.\" And I think, when you talk about the division of the country, I think Johnnie Cochran, the attorney he was, the person who certainly I look up to still to this day, it was about really having a trial that deflected and talked about the racism of the LAPD and really made that front and center as to why O.J. should be acquitted, questioning the issues with respect to the police protocols, the police practices, what they did, how they focused and targeted on him, to the exclusion of other evidence. Just assembling a dream team -- it wasn't only Johnnie Cochran. You remember Barry Scheck. You remember Ron Goldman -- you remember a number of other people who were on that dream team with regard to what they did in challenging DNA and looking and assessing chain of custody issues in terms of the evidence was contaminated in any respect, whether or not the blood that was there belonged to him, what -- just challenging every piece of evidence. And so I think what they did, Wolf, in really acquitting him was to focus their efforts not on the deaths and on domestic violence and on other issues which would have pointed to his guilt, but talking about Mark Fuhrman and the N-word and racism. And just, in some respects, yes, it did divide the country. In other respects, it was a feeling of that there was finally justice for a person that some thought and certainly his team thought was falsely accused. That's very controversial. Obviously, he was found liable with respect to the civil case, but, as it related to the criminal case, he was acquitted. And I think that was done in large measure by the -- certainly the tremendous lawyering that was done in that case. And I think any lawyer, such as myself and others, learned a lot from that. And -- but I don't want to deflect, of course, from the deaths that took place and the loss of lives, obviously, that occurred, that affected and impacted so many and, of course, those families, the Goldman family and, of course, his ex-wife, but pivotal moment in history, one that will go down forever as really starting a culture of people being attracted to a cycle of trials and covering trials and what those trials meant and following every moment. Invention of Court TV and the aftermath, and just certainly inspirational for attorneys such as myself to look to other models of how we could perhaps have careers of our own.",

      "sentences": "It really did.I mean, look, the reality is, is that it was -- it came to all of us every day. And I could remember, in just finishing law school and becoming a prosecutor in Manhattan, of how everyone was just glued to every moment of the trial with respect to every witness, the evidence that was introduced, looking at Judge Lance Ito and how he conducted his courtroom. Looking at the motions, that the defense were challenging every bit of evidence, looking at blood splatter evidence, looking at DNA, looking at what we see there as the glove doesn't fit moment, looking at how the prosecution put together its case, looking at the defense theories of the case. We followed, everyone followed every moment of that trial. And I think it really led to a fascination of not only crime and criminality, but how the media could cover this, what people thought of it, and whether or not this could really be an industry of its own, right, the invention of Court TV, the fact that there have been so many trials since, Wolf, that have been covered by CNN and other networks. Because we know that people are interested in justice, people are interested in injustice, and people are interested in a search for the truth, and, certainly, people are interested in assessing whether, in their view, because they have seen it, and they were the 13th juror, whether the jury got it right. And so this will be a case that's debated throughout all time as to whether the jury got it right here. But I think great lawyering and a great legal team was able to overcome a significant amount of evidence in this case to perhaps acquit their client. And, at the end of the day, it's whether there's proof of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. And if that standard is not met, then, obviously, a jury acquits, and that's exactly what they did in this case.",

Notwithstanding all of those things that the defense brought up, it was not only a surprise that he was acquitted, but at the -- really the quickness in which he was acquitted. But I think, again, it was because the defense really put it to the prosecution. And prosecutors, I think, learned from the case that you can't take anything for granted. You have to deliver your case. And even in the face of things that can conceivably be obvious, you still have to really teach your case to the jury in the most effective way possible. And, again, there's two people who were dead here. That is a significant thing. And I think their families are ailing to this day and will be ailing for the rest of their life. So, to us, it was entertainment. For -- to them, it was about an injustice, that they believe, right, the Goldman family, of course, and Nicole Brown Simpson, But the fact is, is that, wow, from a lawyering perspective, it was lawyering 101. And while it may have surprised, that is, the verdict, people who looked at it, at the end of the day, that's our system, 12 jurors establishing proof of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. And to the extent that you can't do that, our system demands and requires that a jury acquit. And as Johnnie Cochran said, as we continue to look at the gloves there, \"If they don't fit, you must acquit.\" And those themes are important, because they teach lawyers that you're telling a story to a jury every time you get before one. Whether you're a prosecutor with your narrative, whether, of course, you're a defense with your narrative, you have to teach your theory of the case. You have to tell your story. And to the extent that you connect that story to a jury, you prevail. To the extent the jury rejects your story, you do not. And so I was indeed surprised at the verdict. But that's our system. We respect the system of justice. It'll be controversial, Wolf, to the end of all time...",
