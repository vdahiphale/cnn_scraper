It is 09:00 a.m. in Washington. It's 06:00 p.m. here in Abu Dhabi. I'm Becky Anderson. You're watching \"Connect the World\" and wherever you are watching, you are more than welcome. Also coming up this hour, lawmakers in the U.S. have another challenge today, getting to the U.S. Capitol, more on how that harsh weather is affecting Washington and the wider country. Well, just days before he leaves the White House, the Biden Administration is facing a multi-billion-dollar lawsuit from US Steel and Japanese Company Nippon Steel, more on the merger block but those companies are calling purely political. And a star started evening in Hollywood last night, the Golden Globes Ceremony dazzled with great Red-Carpet outfits and, of course, award winners. Well, the stock market in New York will open about 30 minutes from now. It is a shorten working week. The New York Stock Exchange will be closed on Thursday to mourn the death of Former President Jimmy Carter. More on those markets as they get up and underway about a half hour from now. Well, in four hours' time, the U.S. Congress will meet to certify Donald Trump's re-election as president in what assuredly will be a very different scene. What happened on this day four years ago? It is, of course, January the 6th, and that is when in 2021 Trump support his storm to the U.S. Capitol in a deadly insurrection that disrupted the peaceful transfer of power. Well, today, no such protests are expected, and the Capitol Building is under heavy security. Well, Trump's certification today capping a remarkable political comeback for a man who will be sentenced as a convicted felon next week, while running out the clock on a handful of other court cases now dismissed or in major legal limbo. Jeff Zeleny connecting us today from South Florida, where Trump Jeff has spent most of his time since being re-elect and let's talk more about today's process and what we can expect in Washington. JEFF ZELENY, CNN CHIEF U.S. NATIONAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT: Well Becky, it's an extraordinary turn about four years ago, of course, as you said, supporters of President Trump were breaking into approaching the Capitol trying to interrupt the peaceful transfer of power. Today, that is not going to happen, at least not expected to happen. The Congress will come together in a joint session of Congress, the House and the Senate, to do the duty that they have done, of course, throughout the course of this country's history, and that is to certify the presidential election. It's a formality, quite frankly. But four years ago, it was turned into a spectacle, a violent one at that. But today, it does mark the dramatic turn about how Former President Donald Trump, now President-Elect Donald Trump, has used the events of January 6th as an asset, turning a deep political liability into a strength that, of course, helped him win a re-election in November over Vice President Kamala Harris. And a side note, Becky, Vice President Harris will be presiding in the United States Senate. That is her role as the vice president. She will be presiding over her own defeat. She said in a video statement over the weekend that she believes this is the core part of democracy. There will be no challenges to this election, so she will join the ranks of vice presidents in history. Al Gore also doing the same back in 2000 certifying her own defeat, a dramatic turn-around from four years ago.",

And today we'll be seeing you know what this -- what this day is supposed to look like, which is a peaceful transfer of power, which is from one president to another, from one party to another. And it's going to go -- you know, it's kind of a very boring event, usually, and obviously that changed four years ago. Senators will bring over mahogany boxes, over from the Senate to the House as Jeff mentioned, Vice President Harris will oversee the certification. And really, it's just a nod. It's a formality of Congress saying we saw that this is how the states voted, and we are -- you know certifying it. There's no vote that takes place. And honestly, members of Congress will probably be done by 03:00, 04:00 p.m. and can go about their day.",

Enough is enough. REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY (R-CA): The president bears responsibility for Wednesday's attack on Congress by mob rioters.

And I just want our viewers just to get a sense of what he said, quote, in time, there will be Americans who didn't witness the January the 6th riot first hand, but we'll learn about it from footage and testimony of that day, from what is written in history books, from the truth we pass on to our kids.

They call it -- you know, they say that we want to look to the future, that the media and Democrats want to focus on the past. And that we overstated what happened on that day, which obviously we did not. There's footage for everyone to see. But yeah. I mean, Democrats see it as something they want to keep pointing to, but they also saw it as a losing political message. I mean, the reason they feel like they lost the House, the Senate and the White House, is because they focused too much on this abstract concept of democracy. Joe Biden went around saying democracy is at risk, and voters wanted to focus on kitchen table issues. And so, I don't know how much of a political message it will continue to be, but definitely the only people you can find on Capitol Hill talking about January 6th are Democrats these days?",

Well to the Middle East now, where Israel is denying a report on what would be a major stepforward in cease fire and hostage negotiations. Now, Reuters reported that Hamas approved a list of 34 Israeli hostages to be exchanged in a possible cease fire deal, but the Israeli Prime Minister's office says that is an old list from last July. Meanwhile, a former Israeli soldier who fought in Gaza has fled Brazil to avoid potential prosecution. He was on vacation when a Brazilian judge ordered an investigation into war crimes allegations against him. Jeremy Diamond watching all of these developments for us. He is in Tel Aviv today. Jeremy, let's just get an update on the, excuse me, in direct negotiations that, as we understand it, have resumed in Qatar. Caveat, you know, we've been there before, but there had been some optimism around these talks, and we know there are some significant stakeholders moving around the region at present.

      "sentences": "Well, listen, last night, we got this glimmer of hope, as Reuters reported that Hamas had approved alist of 34 Israeli hostages to be released pending a final agreement with the Israeli government, while that would still require an agreement on the other side of that equation, meaning the identities and the numbers of Palestinian prisoners to be released in exchange It did appear to be the first glimmer of progress, real progress, that we have seen in about two weeks. But the Israeli Prime Minister's office today is denying that report, saying that that list of names was one that Israel had submitted back in July, 34 hostages whose release it was demanding during the first phase of a cease fire agreement. And what Israel says it is still waiting for and what it actually needs, they say, to move forward with an agreement. Is a list of the living hostages remaining inside of Gaza, because we know that of the roughly 100 Israeli hostages still being held today, at least 36 of them are believed to be dead. And several more, perhaps even several dozen more could also be dead, although their deaths have not yet been confirmed. Still, this week has brought the return of these negotiations between Israel and Hamas, indirect negotiations, of course, as an Israeli negotiating team flew to Doha, Qatar, a Hamas delegation there as well. Brett McGurk, a top adviser to President Biden is also believed to be in the Qatari capital, and Ron Dermer one of the senior most advisers to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, is in Washington this week, meeting with Biden Administration as well as incoming Trump Administration officials. So, it is clear that talks are back on the table right now. What is less clear is whether or not there can indeed be an agreement. But in the meantime, the situation in Gaza, of course, is growing ever more disastrous. We have seen in just the last 24 hours that 48 people have been killed, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health. Hamas also raising the stakes by releasing a video of the 19-year-old Israeli soldier Liri Albag, who was taken hostage on October 7th. Clearly, all sides here raising the pressure as these negotiations enter yet another critical week, Becky.",

The Israeli embassy facilitated his exit from Brazil after war crimes allegations were leveled against him by the Hind Rajab Foundation, which has been tracking the activities of current and former Israeli soldiers who fought in Gaza. That prompted a Brazilian judge to direct police to order to open an investigation into this Israeli soldier, former Israeli soldier, and therefore the Israeli embassy promptly securing his exit from the country of Brazil. But this is not the first time that we have seen this foundation bringing allegations of war crimes against Israeli soldiers. As they have been traveling abroad, they have also sought the apprehension of Israeli soldiers visiting Thailand, Sri Lanka, Chile and other countries, the Israeli government making clear that this is a growing concern for them and also casts light on the fact that Israeli soldiers have been documenting their activities in Gaza, and that now is being used against him by various organizations and investigators, Becky.",

This was all going onduring the heat of the 2024 race for the White House, and both parties were trying hard to win over Rust Belt voters and manufacturing workers. And don't forget U.S. Steel is based in the must win battle ground state of Pennsylvania. And so, in this lawsuit, the companies argue that the review process was not driven by national security as it should have been, but it was driven by politics. Now, among other things, the lawsuit alleges that President Biden ignored the rule of law to gain favor with the steel workers union, that national security was exploited to help try to win an election, and that regulators on CFIUS, that's the Committee on Foreign investment in the United States that they fail to conduct a good faith review. A key line from this lawsuit that we just got this morning says that the President's decision was based on illegitimate and self-serving political considerations, a clear violation of the entire CFIUS process, which was created as an apolitical safe guard to protect national security. Now, Treasury is declining to comment. We've reached out to the White House. I would note that President Biden, when he announced this decision on Friday, he argued that a domestic steel industry and that steel workers are the backbone of the country, and that a strong steel industry is critical to national security and to supply chains. And we should also just point out, though, that this deal faced bipartisan opposition. It was not just President Biden and Vice President Harris who were opposed. It was also President-elect Trump and Vice President-Elect J.D. Vance. So, Becky, no matter who won this election, this deal was always going to face an uphill battle.",
