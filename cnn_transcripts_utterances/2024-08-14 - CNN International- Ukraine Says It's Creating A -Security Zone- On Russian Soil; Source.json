We begin in Russia, where Ukrainian forces are advancing further into the country. A truly remarkable reversal of fortunes, two-and-a-half years since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, a week into this surprise incursion. And the Kremlin still does not seem to have answers to attempt to push the Ukrainians back. Overnight, Kyiv conducted its largest attack on Russian airfields since the full-scale invasion. Kyiv now claims to control more than 1,000 kilometers of Russian territory. That is similar to the amount of Ukrainian land Russia has seized this year, the Russian foreign ministry said today that peace talks are, quote, on pause for a long time. CNN's Fred Pleitgen has the latest on this Ukrainian offensive. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

Ukrainian troops sweeping through a Russian village behind a U.S.-supplied MaxxPro armored vehicle.Kyiv soldiers taking down the Russian flag in another town with Ukrainian TV reporting from the scene. Ukraine's top general telling President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, the advance continues. Troops have advanced one to two kilometers in various directions, he says, and then adds, since the beginning of this day, we've taken captive about 100 enemy soldiers. The Ukrainians say they want to create a buffer zone in this part of Russia to stop Moscow's army from attacking Ukrainian territory in the future. But the blitz offensive is also a major morale boost for Ukraine, commander fighting side Russia tells CNN, catching the Russians off guard. They were shocked by such a rapid advance, he says, they were in tactical encounters and willingly surrender to the defense forces. And then every warrior, every soldier who defend their homeland probably had a dream team of stepping onto Russian soil and destroying the enemy there. These feelings are impossible to forget. While the Russians claim they are stopping Ukraine's assault, releasing this video of their jets dropping powerful glide bombs, Ukraine says it shot down a Russian warplane and a security source says it launched the biggest drone attack on Russian air bases since the war began. Russian leader Vladimir Putin has vowed a crushing response to Ukraine's incursion. But even Kremlin controlled TV acknowledging that won't be so simple. UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator): Unfortunately, I must say that in some settlements, the enemy is holding that ground and we will need to fight them out of there. That will not happen as fast and as easy as we wanted to.",

Nic, I wonder Hamas won't be present I guess they're going to keep an ear to the wall to these negotiations here.

That you have because their proximity talks and they're sequential so you have the mediators and the U.S. in the room with the Israeli team, which is the head of Mossad, the head of Shin Bet, and the general who's in charge of intelligence around the hostages. They're all in a room together and then it's after that previous talks where the mediators will then go with the output of that meeting and then go take it to Hamas.We're kind of in that position at the moment. My understanding is that Hamas will certainly have the availability to engage with the mediators and that they're putting a position forward, which is that's going to be done only on the basis as you said there, that they believe that Netanyahu -- Netanyahu is serious. So I think we're positioned here for a similar outcome to what we've had so many talks before. So the question comes down to Israel's in the room first, what did they hear from the mediators coming forward on the table? What do they hear from Bill Burns, the head of the CIA, who will be there. And what is the mandate? The critical part, what is the precise mandate their Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has given them? He's under a huge amount of pressure, right? So is he going to concede to a little bit of that pressure internationally from the United States and others? Or is he going to hew a position that's much closer to his hardliners who just very clear, you cannot compromise on a ceasefire in Gaza. You cannot give up the border with Egypt. You cannot give up the crossing to Egypt, those points. So, you know, there's potential for some diplomatic movement here. And then there's a potential for that to go into a room with Hamas at some point. But the question is, is that going to be enough for Iran? Is it going to be enough for Hezbollah?

I don't think anyone's under any illusion in a way, the heat on Israel over the last few, few months, if you will, as far as a potential for attacks -- major attacks on Israeli territory by Iran, by Hezbollah. It's been creeping up the temperature on that is up. So while two- thirds of the population, roughly according to latest polls here want to see Netanyahu's team do a deal, get the hostages out, I don't think anyone's relaxing. But you're right, tonight into tomorrow should feel a little easier.

As you mentioned, we haven't seen that in almost 3- 1/2 years. And it's easy to forget, but two years ago, we had 9 percent inflation in America. You could see it on that chart. That spike to 9 percent was driven in large part by the skyrocketing price of gasoline and a whole bunch of other items, and thankfully, we are miles away from that. Now I do want to stress, this does not mean that life is suddenly cheap. It's not, it doesn't mean that we're back to pre-COVID prices. We're not and we're not going to be, but this does show that prices, they're going up at a more gradual pace. And that is good news. Economist Justin Wolfers, a few moments ago, he told CNN that he thinks it's now safe to say that the inflation crisis is now behind us. Now, when you look at some of the categories here, it's clear that some things are still getting more expensive uncomfortably so, right? Like electricity or the cost to rent or car insurance. All of those have gone up rapidly, but there's other things that are getting cheaper like new cars, used cars, appliances, and one that I know, Jim, you'll be happy to hear, men's suits, getting a lot cheaper. So, all of that is encouraging, and yes, it does cement the idea that the Fed is going to be able to finally cut interest rates at the next meeting in September, which, of course, is the last time they meet before the election and the question is, how big of an interest rate cut do they do?

So he has knowledge that.But the reason that he's so focused on the economy is because of the inflation rates today versus before COVID, and this is something he has said over and over again, because if you talk to voters, they do believe that the economy is getting better. But when it comes to inflation, they still believe they can't afford the things that they need in terms of groceries, in terms of gas. Donald Trump, he used to ask the same question, were you better off when I was in office? Obviously referring to those pre-COVID times. Now, whether or not it is fact-based, Donald Trump is here to deliver these remarks on the economy. But the big question, of course, is whether or not this speech is actually going to turn out to be as speech about the economy. Jim, when I talked to his senior advisers, when I talked to the people who are close to him, they believe that he can win this race, despite the enthusiasm that we've seen around Kamala Harris, despite the fact that we have seen a polling boost for Kamala Harris, they do believe at the end of the day, Donald Trump could take back the White House in November, but in order to do so, he needs to stop talking about what he's talking about and focus on things like the economy. When we looked at that polling back when Joe Biden was in the race, he constantly, pulled ahead of Joe Biden in terms of handling the economy. They want him to go back to that. They want him to talk about the economy and talk about crime, to talk about immigration, the things that people believe, and this is according to polling, he did better at when he was in office. They also want to link her, Kamala Harris, to the policies of President Joe Biden. Of course, she's part of that administration. But right now, Donald Trump has been completely off message. He has been posting fringe theories from the Internet. He has been attacking some of his allies, including Governor Brian Kemp in Georgia during a rally there, a state that is critical. So, right now, what you're seeing is Donald Trump's team around him trying to cultivate an energy, particularly in this venue which we'll go over in a second, where he will stay on message. So what they've done here, this is a smaller venue. It is -- people are seated. They're not standing at a rally atmosphere. And it's being billed as a speech on the economy and nothing else. They are planning on doing this around the country to try to get these kind of policy issues out there. But, Jim, the question is whether or not he's actually going to be on board with this plan. They can do whatever they want in terms of telling him what to say, writing speeches for him, making smaller venues. But the end of the day, it's him and we know for certain right now, Kamala Harris is underneath his skin and when he gets back into a corner like that, he tends to not focus on the issues, but instead on the personal attacks.",

Let's bring in Ron Brownstein of \"The Atlantic\", Molly Ball of \"The Wall Street Journal\". Good to have you both here. So we know the economy is top of mind for voters in this election cycle.

I think what she's more likely to do is lean into the elements of her story that can be brought to bear here. I think she's probably going to talk a lot about her work as attorney general California prosecuting companies that were seen as ripping off consumers in various ways and, look, and look at various options for taking a more aggressive stance in that way, nationally. You know, it is interesting. I mean, you know, people are talking a lot about whether she has laid out a lot enough of her policies and if you listen to her stump speech on any given day, certainly in Nevada on Sunday, there was more than enough there to finish did it to keep them occupied for the first two years of a of a Harris presidency. There are details that we don't have and we may never get before November, but there is really no confusion about what the top priorities of a -- domestic priorities of Harris presidency, are things that were passed in the House during Biden's first two years and blocked by Manchin and Sinema in the Senate.",
