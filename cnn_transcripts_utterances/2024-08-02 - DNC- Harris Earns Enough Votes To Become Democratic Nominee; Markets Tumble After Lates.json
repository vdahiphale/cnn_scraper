      "sentences": "Yes, those days after the convention were some pretty tough days to do television, I have to tell you.So in the Democratic Party, we have nominated the vice president every single time a vice president has run for office in the modern era. So you think about whether it's Hubert Humphrey or Walter Mondale, Al Gore. So it would have been irregular for us not to nominate a vice president. And if you think about the last two vice presidents to get elected to the White House, whether it was Joe Biden, who just got elected, or it was George H.W. Bush, how people felt about the president they worked with was a great indicator as to how they ultimately -- whether they ultimately succeeded. You know, Al Gore won the popular vote. I've worked in that campaign. He won the popular vote, but people had mixed feelings about Bill Clinton. And we had a mixed result, right? And that election ended up with George W. Bush. What we saw last night, when the vice president and the president we're together on that tarmac, it's the strength of something that I think people will ultimately come to regard Joe Biden for. While his poll numbers have been in the doldrums, a lot of people feel very positively about him. And he has the chance over the course of the next couple of months to keep reminding people why they voted for him. And obviously, this moment where he decided to take himself out of the race for the sake of the country is something that people feel very positively about. So I just think Kamala Harris is on a good standing as somebody who's been vice president to a president that people I think are going to hold in higher regard and the powers of incumbency. These moments where national security is at play, the economy's at play. She really will have a leg up on Donald Trump, who, in a way, right now, is fighting an octopus. Because he's got Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, Barack Obama, the Clintons, all these people with national standing, who can come at him from any direction.",

She sort of accepted it on a phone call just moments ago, right?She -- she called herself the presumptive nominee, but there's nobody really running against her. So it's fair to say she will be the Democratic nominee. We have Molly Ball with us, who's been patiently waiting and listening alongside us. Molly, your reaction to this news. It -- just about a month-and-a-half ago, no one really saw this coming.",

      "sentences": "No. I mean -- I mean, maybe a little bit, right? She was the vice president, so she was the next in line. And we had already seen the Trump campaign start to make arguments, calling her a sort of president in waiting because of the concern about Joe Biden's age.So she was a factor in the campaign. She was someone who was being scrutinized. But obviously, it has been a pretty head-spinning news cycle for all of this to have changed so quickly. And we have seen both campaigns just have to hatchet and throw out their playbook and start from scratch with really unpredictable results. So I think, you know, Jamal put his finger on it earlier about sort of what the promise and the problem are for Vice President Harris. Which is, on the one hand, she is a potentially history-making candidate. She is potentially the first woman president, first black woman president, the first president of South Asian or Asian descent. And all of those things code to voters as new, as change. And in an atmosphere where the electorate really is not happy with the direction of the country and wants change, that, in addition to her being much younger than Joe Biden, is very powerful in terms of the way she comes across. On the other hand, she has been a part of this administration. And this administration and its policies are not popular. Joe Biden's approval rating has gone up since he quit the race, but he's still not popular. And so to the extent that she is seen as part of that problem, part of the status quo, that is going to be the main thing she has to overcome.",

I think we can all agree on that, so far, as this has rolled out. Which leads us to the question of, when is she going to have a misstep? They're just part and parcel for being in a campaign. And I wonder -- you know, perhaps one opportunity for that could be giving an interview. I wonder what you are seeing ahead that could be these moments that could be challenging for Vice President Harris?",

      "sentences": "Yes. I think they said that they're waiting until should be officially becomes the nominee to actually engage with it. Well, welcome to this new phase of the debate over debates now that she has crossed this threshold.By the way, as we we're sitting here, I just thought that they sent out a fundraising appeal where she says, \"I've just secured enough delegates to win the nomination, please donate,\" to Isaac's point about wanting to keep injecting sugar into this. But I do think, you know, the Trump campaign had committed to a September 10th debate on ABC as the second debate after the CNN debate in June. Clearly, they have not completely pulled out of that yet. But they've made clear indications that that is not their desire anymore to do that debate, either on that date or with that network or what have you. So I do think we are sort of in this moment here, A, will there be a debate? Let's hope so for the American people. Because that is extraordinarily valuable to voters to see the options before them side-by-side. So I certainly hope there is. And there will be pressure for him to do so. When it happens, where it happens, how it happens, what that said. I think when you do replace a candidate on top of the ticket, I don't think it's unreasonable that there's a new negotiation around what that is. And I think that's what these campaigns are going to have to engage in now.",

And so both Joe Biden and Donald Trump agreed to that first early June debate because they thought it was both going to serve their interests.That obviously did not prove out to be true. It did not serve Joe Biden's interests, clearly, the way that he performed at that debate. So the question, Brianna, I asked back is sort of like, whose interests does it serve? And I think that you can still make the argument that there is interest for both of them, that they could both get something positive out of the debate. You were just talking about different slices of voters in key states now. I do you think with, as we see the enthusiasm for Republicans around their nominee and now for Democrats around their nominee, we've gotten back to actually a more traditional place in American politics. Where the partisans or rallying around and this fight over the middle, I think, whereas Joe Biden was fighting to actually energize his own team back onto the field, that doesn't seem to be Kamala Harris' concern right now. And so now I think we're back into this very traditional -- like these seven battleground states, these voters in the middle of the electorate that are going to have to be swayed one way or the other. And I think there's probably value for both candidates and debating to appeal to those voters.",

The NASDAQ, 2.5 percent.The good news here is that actually this is off the worst levels of the day, if you believe it. At one point, the Dow was down nearly 1,000 points and the NASDAQ was down 3 percent. Investors are clearly pricing in the greater chance of at least a slowdown in the economy. They're also betting that the Fed is going to have to come to the rescue. Look at this. The odds of a large rate cut at the next meeting in September, a 50-basis point cut, this was looked at as very unlikely just 24 four hours ago when it was at 22 percent. Now, the markets are pricing in basically a two in three chance that the Fed is going to have to do a big rate cut in September. That is quite the move in a short amount of time. And it does reflect this growing sense that maybe the Fed is late, right? Remember, the Fed was late back in 2021 to respond to inflation, waiting too long to raise interest rates. Now there's concerns that it's waiting too long to cut them to respond to these cracks that have emerged in the jobs market. One last thing I'm going to leave you with, though, is let's look at where the markets have been over the last year. It's true that today has been an ugly day. Yesterday was a bad day, too, for the market. But look at this. We are well above where the market was earlier this year. You can see things are obviously getting a little bit bumpier in the market. And that reflects the fact that the risks have risen as far as what happens to the economy. But thankfully, the market is still up over the past year. It's just gotten more volatile -- Boris and Brianna?",
