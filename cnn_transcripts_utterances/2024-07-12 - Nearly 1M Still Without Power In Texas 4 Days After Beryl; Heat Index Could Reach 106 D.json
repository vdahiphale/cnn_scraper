The heat advisory is posted by the Weather Service because of the lack of electricity, not actually getting over the threshold to even qualify. But if you're feeling like 102 and you don't have but fan on you.College Station had a rain shower earlier. So there are showers that are popping up in the Houston area. Even the cloud cover helps. But of course, the rainfall helps, as well, cool down some things, at least for a while. And then the sun comes back out and then the heat and humidity come back. And so you kind of hope for one and hope for the others. But the normal high today, you're going to be 93, 92 degrees. And even today, only 87. So, yes, it feels sweltering, but it could be a whole lot worse. If we we're in the middle of this heatwave, which is out to the west, we'd be talking a completely different story. Where Vegas, again, three consecutive days just 118 degrees. It has been brutal out there. At least this ridge of high pressure is not over the central part of the country, where six consecutive days for Vegas at 115. Even right now, I mean, looking at my clock, it's still only 10:30. And Las Vegas is already 105. It doesn't even cool down at night. Part of the problem. Also part of the problem with Houston where the temperatures at night are only getting down to the upper 70s, so even opening the house and hoping for a breeze doesn't get you too far -- Boris?",

That somebody went into the Santa Fe's sheriff's department to bring ammunition that they said they believed came from the same source as that live bullet that was in the firearm that ultimately fatally shot Halyna Hutchins. Of course, the big question since this whole saga began nearly three years ago is, why was there live ammunition on that set? And how did it get there? That question has never been resolved. Now, Baldwin's defense is saying, if we had this evidence, maybe we would have known, why weren't these bullets sent to the FBI to be investigated. So much more to come.

I mean, one of the things that the Supreme Court often does when it establishes new law, as it did here, is it doesn't really explain all the various scenarios that are going to be impacted, right?It allows lower courts to figure out, in the first instance, whether -- how the new rule applies and whether it matters in terms of overturning a conviction. So in the first place, we're waiting for Judge Merchan to make a ruling about whether any official acts, evidence, actually was presented and received at trial. And then whether that requires striking testimony, overturning that conviction, ordering a new trial. So I think he'll do that in the first instance. And it seems to me that the Trump team has an uphill battle to argue that this was official conduct, as opposed to private conduct, giving -- given what the subject matter was of the Hope Hicks testimony and the case in general.",

Some of it was clearly official business, stating policy and so on and the president's views on things.But a lot of it wasn't. He also used it as his personal account. And I think you can certainly parse through all of his tweets and kind of put them in one bucket or the other. So that's what the judge is going to do here. I mean, he's going to go through all of the tweets that we're put into evidence and decide whether or not they arguably are official conduct or private conduct. And then that's going to determine whether or not they we're properly admitted. So this is a painstaking process that's going to happen here, which is why it was so smart of Judge Merchan really to delay sentencing and go through this with a fine-tooth comb before it gets to the appellate courts. So that he can be the first person in the first instance to decide whether it was official or not, which is as it should be since he was the presider of the trial.",

And we will see then what Judge Merchan says about that. He might even try to get a stay from a higher court on that. But in any case, I don't think we'll see a sentencing and any sort of sentence being implemented.
