This chip or this device actually sits on that top, that part of the brain. And when you think about movement, can't move. These are patients who are quadriplegic or have ALS. But just thinking about movement, that releases a characteristic firing of neurons. And this device says, oh, OK, that's the firing of neurons that looks like when someone wants to move a cursor this way or move a mouse this way. And eventually, the device learns what those, those electrical patterns look like. And after learns it well enough -- and that can take weeks, if not months to learn -- it connects to a Bluetooth device, which can then control things in your environment. Your smartphone, your mouse on your computer, things like that. The person is not moving, but they're just thinking about moving, and that's what's causing this, this change in the devices around them.",

And again, just keep in mind, we're talking about a very specific part of the brain. You're really looking at motor function here, in terms of something that you can improve. What you just saw there with that video and some of these promises, that's talking about human consciousness and cognition and things like that. That's not an incremental step, John. That's an exponential step. So I say years before we get to the point where it becomes a reality for people who have quadriplegia, it's much longer than that, even, for the idea of being able to capture cognition and be able to link it to a device as -- as Musk is talking about.",
