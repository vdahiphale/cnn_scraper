I'm Jim Acosta in Washington.This morning, we are following breaking news within hours of each other on New Year's Day, an attack in New Orleans and an explosion in Las Vegas. And investigators are now looking into whether they are both connected. Right now, authorities are rushing to piece together why a Texas man, Shamsud-Din Jabbar, ran a truck through Bourbon Street, killing at least 15 people. The FBI is conducting search warrants in multiple states. Investigators say they don't think the attacker was solely responsible. Just hours later, and about 1,500 miles away, the explosion outside the Trump Hotel in Las Vegas, fireworks, gas tanks and camping fuel packed into a Cybertruck detonated, killing the driver and injuring seven others. Let's get straight to CNN's Ryan Young. He is live for us in New Orleans. Ryan, what's the latest on the investigation?",

I can tell you the streets here are packed as tourists and football fans have started to reemerge and hit the streets, especially with that game coming in the next few hours. But look behind me, Jim, that's the street that's been the focus so far. Sanitation workers have been down there trying to clean and get this street back open, Canal and Bourbon Street, where that horrific attack happened and 15 people were killed.What we do know, as I talked to a sanitation worker, he says he saw things down there that he will never be able to forget because it's almost indescribable the carnage that's down there. As we show you this video, we know the suspect Shamsud-Din Jabbar, 42, a U.S, citizen from Texas, and an Army veteran, had an ISIS flag on the back of the Ford F-150 lightning that he had rented from a Turo site and then drove from Houston here. But there's been a lot of conversation about how he was able to get that big truck on the sidewalk past the barrier. In fact, the police chief talked about the fact that some of the barriers weren't working and it was a part of a construction project that they were getting all together. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SUPT. ANNE KIRKPATRICK, NEW ORLEANS POLICE DEPARTMENT:  Well, they were not able to be up and running, and that is because it was under repair. We were aware of this issue, and that's why we were using patrol cars. That will be changing today. We will have much heavier equipment to harden these softer targets. So, the city had a multimillion dollar package for repairing this infrastructure obviously in time for the Super Bowl, but it was not complete at the time of this event last night. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

We don't help the situation by entering into it.

And I think and I pray that other city leaders are looking at every single thing that's happening in the city of New Orleans. So, there are lessons learned. They're looking at certain one-offs that might be occurring in their jurisdictions to figure out if there are some connections.This happened in the first three hours of a new year. It was planned.

We don't know about his ability with these rudimentary explosives. We want to figure out who rented truck, whether or not there was any connection to the rented vehicle in Vegas.

This tracks with Sharid Mowgli (ph), Carlos Leon Bledsoe, Nidal Hassan is probably the closest, most comparable thing.The perpetrator, used a Ford F-150 Lightning vehicle that weighs over 6,000 pounds, likely because of its ability to cause extensive damage, just like what's occurred in Europe hundreds of times. I would imagine that he absolutely, after he got into the city, was checking out and was casing the French Quarter, looking for the softest target. And, you know, there'll be an after-action report to go back and look at surveillance camera footage, public safety cam to see if we can track that vehicle and its whereabouts for the days and hours leading up to this horrible attack.",

They didn't just attack my home where I live here in the city of New Orleans. They attacked all Americans, not just Democrats or Republicans. They attacked Americans and our way of life. Football is a huge part of that. I don't think it's serendipity that this happened on the cusp of the Sugar Bowl.

President Biden did speak to the nation last night where he said that this was a despicable attack and said that he and his team were working to learn more about exactly why and how this attack transpired, but also whether the suspect had any accomplices. The president shared some of the information they do have about the suspect, the fact that he is an American citizen and a former member of the military. And President Biden importantly said that he had posted videos indicating that he was inspired by ISIS. Here is a bit more of how President Biden characterized the ongoing investigation.

Three officials said he was on active duty serving in Germany, and he was on leave when this happened on New Year's Day. He has not been identified publicly, and authorities are still trying to work out whether this was a terrorist attack.Now, just to recap a little bit of what happened behind us just 24 hours ago approximately, there are still police presence here around the valet area of where you pull into the Trump International Hotel just off of the Vegas Strip. This Cybertruck that he allegedly rented was rented from Colorado from the Turo rental platform. Authorities say that he drove it here to Las Vegas by 7:30 A.M. on New Year's Day, that he drove up and down the strip, and then about an hour before the explosion, drove past the Trump Hotel as well. And police did make note that the damage was really limited because of the body construction of this Tesla Cybertruck, saying that, you know, the front glass of the Trump Hotel behind us did not even suffer any damage.

The fact that he's active duty on leave from Germany is just something that sets him apart in so many ways from the terrorist profile we've become accustomed to in these attacks and raises real questions as to what was this event in Las Vegas. Was it an attack on the building? Was it a calculated suicide?But his training for a 36-year-old, 19-year veteran, active duty U.S. Military Green Beret, special operations training risk management and vulnerability certification, intelligence operations, this really sets him apart in terms of a higher level of training and capability than anyone we would have seen in a similar attack. So, again, Jim, it goes back to the question of what was this, the idea of getting the Elon Musk signature car and bringing it to the gold Trump sign in Las Vegas, driving from Colorado Springs. It really suggests he's trying to send a message with visualization. But he -- allegedly, if he is the same person whose body was found in that car, they still haven't been able to identify that body, but they know who rented the car, if he is the individual inside, apparently, he chose to press that detonator and then remain inside as this conflagration went out.",
