Then getting everybody on board. That includes diplomatic staff, family members and some nationals of other countries, and then getting them out safely, refueling in Ethiopia and continuing on the way to Djibouti. All of the members of the staff there, the family members, as well, evacuated safely on those military aircraft. Of course, the risk was that this ceasefire, which both of the warring parties had committed to, would fall apart. And we already know there were violations of it, and it seems tenuous at best. But that was a real risk. However, U.S. officials who briefed reporters after the operation itself said that the helicopters did not come under fire on their way in or on their way out. Of course, the more difficult question now: what happens to some 16,000 or more American citizens who remain in Sudan, many of them dual nationals. So Sudanese-American. The State Department confirmed that it did reach out to at least some of them to inform them of convoys arranged by the UAE and Turkey to try to get out of Khartoum and either exit through Port Sudan or try to cross some of the land borders. Meanwhile DOD is considering setting up some sort of surveillance of the land routes out of the country and is considering also trying to set up a deconfliction mechanism as it watches very closely the situation, even as it deteriorates in Sudan.

Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov is due to discuss the grain deal with the U.N.'s secretary general on his visit to New York this week. And the Russian foreign minister had harsh words for the U.S. for refusing visas to Russian journalists seeking to cover his remarks at the U.N. Sergey Lavrov said in an interview that Russia will not forget and will not forgive the decision. However, Russian media reported last week that most members of Lavrov's delegation did receive U.S. visas. Well, inside Ukraine now, another day of relentless Russian shelling and missiles, left homes and other buildings damaged, from Kharif in the North to Odessa in the South. The darkness of night could not hide the extensive damage the barrage caused. Ukraine says the attacks spanned the entire Eastern front lines but that its forces did not give up any ground. The Ukrainian military also says Iranian-made drones have been trying to attack its air defenses, which you see here. A spokesperson says it is evident Russia has replenished its drone supply. To the South, social media reports suggest Ukrainian forces may have crossed the Dnipro River into Russian-held territory.

These four countries and through Asia on this long-term project that really dives into understanding how climate change is affecting so much of their lives.

Becoming scarce in that area and just understanding how people are -- are participating involving themselves with water, whether it was the bathing in the hot springs or looking for drinking water, or whatever that might be. And just the connections that we have and how that is indicative of so much of 2022. Because that might not be there in 2023.
