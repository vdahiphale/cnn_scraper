      "sentences": "Well, for weeks we have been hearing the IDF say that they believed that Hamas used the Al-Shifa Hospital which is in Gaza City, one of the biggest hospitals in Gaza, as essentially a command and control center. They had this entire 3-D template that they showed at a briefing one day of what they believed Hamas's infrastructure underneath that hospital looked like. We haven't seen the extent of what that showed, but they have showntunnels and videos that they say stretch underground of the Al-Shifa hospital that they say links back to that hospital. So we are now hearing from the IDF that they have detained the director of that hospital. They want to know what his, quote, involvement was in those tunnels and what you saw underneath that hospital. He is being questioned, they say, by the Israeli security agency. And depending on essentially what he tells, they say, will determine whether or not there is going to be further questioning here. The question is whether or not there is going to be outrage over this given this is the director of the hospital. We've heard from other hospital officials, doctors, who they don't work there all the time. I'm thinking of Dr. Ghassan Abu-Sitta who is a British Palestinian doctor that went in after October 7th to help treat patients. He said that he had no knowledge of this. But obviously this is going to be a question that Israel has for this director of this hospital. One thing that we should note is we're speaking of hospitals and speaking of places that desperately need aid. It is any medical center that is still able to operate in Gaza right now. So many of them can't because they don't have those crucially needed supplies. That is a major part of the deal that we're not talking about enough. It's the humanitarian aid that is expected to part of this hostage deal going into Gaza. CNN's Eleni Giokos is live in Cairo where we're expecting to see that aid go in once this deal does begin. Eleni, I wonder, have the drivers of these trucks, have officials there on the ground heard anything about the timing here?",

And more than what we've seen, listen, we've heard from Egyptian side of the border, our team on the ground saying that two fuel trucks have already entered Gaza. That's the normal quota that we've been seeing over the past few days. But it's the big question on the aid.Now, this truce is going to allow a lot more to get into the Gaza Strip which is desperately needed. And you've alluded to some of that. We know medical supplies are completely running out, food, water, and, importantly, fuel. We actually spoke to one little Palestinian boy that was injured and was evacuated into Egypt, and this is what he thought about the four-day truce. Take a listen.

Doctor, thank you, thank you for being with us. Just listening to Hadas right there speak with our colleague Clarissa Ward says it all. She knows as a mother her children will be forever changed. How do you even start to help them?DR. HAGAI LEVINE, HEAD OF MEDICAL TEAM, HOSTAGES AND MISSING FAMILIES FORUM:  We are here for them, Poppy and Erica, all the time. And they need us. The families are in right now a working position throughout the last more than six weeks, and now these days, it is so complicated for them, they don't know what is going to happen. Every delay of even one more day is very, very challenging for them. They don't know how their beloved will come back. And we are -- with all the families, I must say, that all the families need support. And you said about the Red Cross visit to the other hostages, regardless of any agreement, that is basic right of anyone that was abducted, innocent people who were abducted, to receive the visit to be treated properly and to provide families with sign of life. That must be done. And we are with all the families, and the process of the recovery for those who will come back with, God willing, this week will be very, very difficult.

And that is something that will take a long time to bring back trust in the kindness of people and the support that the families get from all around the world is helpful for the families to feel that they are not alone.When the hostages come back, they were treated as objects, not as humans, by the Hamas. We need to bring back the humanity. I must tell you, it is in a sense some reminding of the survivors of the Holocaust. That's the kind of unique situation, and we don't know happened. Some of them don't have a home to return to because in Be'eri and other places, the entire communities and their homes were literally burned. So yes, it will be very difficult. We need to be sensitive and just imagine the process, because they're not going to immediately go to a safe place. They start from Hamas, maybe to another Hamas person, to the Red Cross, to the IDF, and then hospital and then to community. It is going to be a long and slow recovery.

And I think the idea that you string this out and you hear these endless tales about, obviously, the anguish that the families are going through, they're just upping the pressure on Israel not to get back into active military hostilities.And I would say also the exuberance about all this aid coming into Know. When Herbert Hoover began the first American international relief effort in World War I, he had two basic principles. Number one, aid must not go to combatants, only to noncombatants, and the aid must be distributed or monitored by the donors. Have all those trucks been monitored independently? Do we know Hamas will not seize the aid once it gets into Gaza? You know, these are things you never hear anything about, but you need to worry that those trucks aren't really supplying Hamas. HILL: So, there have been specific discussions about the fuel in particular and how that will be monitored and where it will be going. I'm curious, as we look at everything that's happening in the region, we have news this morning, of course, that a US warship shot down multiple one-way attack drones that had been launched from Houthis- controlled areas of Yemen. It's just the latest example of rising tensions in the region.
