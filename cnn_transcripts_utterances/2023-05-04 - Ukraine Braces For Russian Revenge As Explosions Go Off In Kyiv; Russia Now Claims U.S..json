That's quite a scoop that Matthew got there, first of all, because Ilya is a very credible person. He's very much connected to what I call the resistance inside of Russia. And I have also spoken to Russians who were in exile, if you will, working for human rights organizations here in the U.S., and they have told me that we don't know in the West all the sabotage missions that have been executed on Russian soil, and what they meant when they told me that was they're not being covered by our media, and of course, many times, people don't know they should be attributed to Russian citizens, rather than Ukrainians.",

So, I do think that they're quite active. They're also -- there's also a lot of partisan or resistance activity in Belarus, so some of the railroad derailments and attacks on the infrastructure there are also orchestrated by Belarusians and perhaps Russians. And so I think this is important, an important point, because of course, the U.S. government has been very anxious not to have the Ukrainian government escalate the war and make it kind of a Russian people against Ukrainian people kind of war. I find what's interesting here is that Vladimir Putin didn't try to kind of hush, you know, paper over what happened. He went on television and said -- and told the Russian people that there was this attack on the Kremlin. So, it sounds like he's really trying to drum up nationalistic fervor, trying to get the Russian people to see this war as a war between the United States, you know, United States using Ukraine as a pawn against Russia. That, he thinks, might get the Russians to be more interested in the war. I doubt it highly, but that is probably part of his ploy in putting this on Russian television and putting it out there so publicly. Because otherwise, I think he would try to cover it up.

I do think there's a lot of information that they'll be able to connect to other efforts to overturn the election, pressure on Mike Pence, et cetera, but this is the key one, and we should recall that the January 6th Select Committee in the House made a criminal referral to the Justice Department, saying they had sufficient evidence that called for at least an investigation as to whether or not President Trump aided and abetted an insurrection. The fact that we have this verdict is important as a foundation to that kind of a claim.Once again, if there were an acquittal in the case, that would just go away. It would not really be on the table. It is on the table. So, the question is, in part, what you asked with roger stone. Is there enough connective tissue? Will they be able to connect dots if there are dots to be connected? Because Roger Stone is deeply involved with the Proud Boys. He even swore an oath to the Proud Boys, according to the January 6th Committee. There's an important communication between the two leaders of the seditionist conspiracies, the Stewart Rhodes of the Oath Keepers, and Enrique Tarrio, who was just convicted today for seditious conspiracy, on January 6th at 2:28 p.m., how did they communicate on an encrypted channel called Friends of Roger Stone, because Roger Stone set it up, and he's also in that network.

And this comes as \"ProPublica\" reports yet another undisclosed gift that Justice Clarence Thomas received from Texas billionaire Harlan Crow. This time, thousands of dollars in boarding school tuition for Thomas's grandnephew. The GOP mega donor giving \"ProPublica\" a statement about these tuition payments that says, in part, quote: Harlan Crow had long been passionate about the importance of quality education and giving back to those less fortunate, especially at-risk youth. This is just the latest in a long list of perks Thomas has accepted from Crow without disclosure, according to \"ProPublica\". Perks including luxury travel on Crow's super yacht, private yet flights, and an undisclosed real estate transaction involving three properties owned by Thomas and his relatives. OUTFRONT now, Josh Kaplan, one of the reporters who broke this story for \"ProPublica\". Wow, Josh, what a story this is. You obtained records of these payments by Harlan Crow. One shown here was $6,200 for one month at a Georgia boarding school. Your report said Crow paid for a full year at that school, and that came after he already paid for a year at another boarding school in Virginia. So, how much money in total are we talking here?",

And you know, experts said that Thomas could make the case that thesegifts were to the child and not to him, and so he didn't have to disclose them because technically, the child is not his son.

That kind of evidence could be very damning if there was actual tampering with the surveillance tape. It both goes to obstruction and it goes to the guilt of the underlying conduct of retaining classified documents. Why would anybody want to be tampering with the tapes, unless they're trying to hide the underlying crime? I think it's super important, thanks to the CNN reporting from last night that already pointed us in that direction, and if they have something like that that they're looking at, open question whether they find something, but that would be significant and hard for the Justice Department to turn away from indicting a case that would have anything like that kind of obstruction at the center of it.",
