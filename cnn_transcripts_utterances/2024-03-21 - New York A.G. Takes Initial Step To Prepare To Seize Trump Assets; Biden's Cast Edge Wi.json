Last week, the judge overseeing the trial issued a blistering rebuke of Willis, and you remember, and her lead prosecutor Nathan Wade's personal relationship, forcing one of them to resign from the case, which resulted then in Nathan Wade's resignation just last week. Back with me now, Seth Berenzweig and Ankush Khardori. I'm so glad you guys are back because this idea of a summer trial date, now, when she first came on the scene to announce this indictment, she first said, I want to have this trial in six months. Now, many people began to snicker and laugh, thinking there's no way that a co-defendant case of this magnitude would go that quickly, let alone one that involves the former president of the United States.
