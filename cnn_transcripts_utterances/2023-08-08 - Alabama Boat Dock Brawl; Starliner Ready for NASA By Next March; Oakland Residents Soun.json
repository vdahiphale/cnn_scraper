Last month the fed raised its interest rates by quarter point, lifting rates to the highest level in 22 years. This is the 11th increase since March of 2022. It came a month after the central bank paused rates. But where do they go now?CNN business correspondent Rahel Solomon is with us. Good morning.",

Good to be with you, guy.So, that is the big debate, where do they go now, and how -- we all thought -- many people thought that we were sort of at the end of the rate hiking cycle. Now there's a question of how close we are. So, the issue is that although we have come a long way, remember when Consumer Price Index was at 9 percent last year in the June - in June. We're closer to 3 percent. But when you look at core inflation, stripping away categories like food and energy, it is still much higher than the Fed would like. And so there was a question now of, even though we have come so far, do they still do more? As you said, Governor Bowman said that more rate hikes may be necessary. She has been saying that. But I think it raised some eyebrows when she made these comments yesterday because we had hoped that we were closer to the end, and we wouldn't have to necessarily see more rate hikes.",

And what happened was getting police off the street. I think that's what we saw in the NAACP letter. And the thing is, that's not what happened. Oakland has continuously increased their police budget. And so - and you can also - you can quibble with, it didn't match up with inflation. There's different arguments about whether or not they've increased it enough. But they increased it by 18 percent from 2019 to 2022. They increased it again this year. So, this isn't an issue of, we are taking police off the street. There were no layoffs in the police department in this year's budget.
