But let me just say,I'm not sure what Michael Mann is talking about with respect to India. India is building coal and has coal, and they've already built it. They've depended on it for their development. China has depended on coal for their development. They have too much coal in our judgment in China, and we're working with them to try to see how we could begin to turn that around. The fact is that even if the United States of America went to zero tomorrow, we'd still have to ask these other countries and work with these other countries to reduce emissions. So, we're all in this together, and what we know is we have to capture the emissions and obviously move away from any source of of power that is not able to provide clean energy. Coal, for instance, is the dirtiest fuel in the world, and we need to move away from it because we're not able, there's no such thing as clean coal, so we have to move in a different direction.

The question is, are you on a track to be able to meet those goals? President Biden has put us on a track to achieve a 50 to 52% reduction in our emissions by 2030.

How you're talking still about progress that is still perhaps too slow for the planet? How do you, in the face of approving more drilling in Alaska, convince China that it is time to let go of coal before 2026? Which is, you know, the line that they've put in the sand.",

China is currently -- And we can't make it if China doesn't move off that coal, that's one of the critical points we're making to them. We cannot solve this problem if we don't talk to China and work to try to move in a way that's cooperative. Not that we're, you know, dictating or ordering somebody to do something. We're working on this together in order to be able to find the ways in which we can both do a better job. But the truth is that China has been building coal, we have not. China is building more and more coal and the amount of coal that China has may eclipse some of the efforts that are being made with respect to renewables. China is simultaneously building a remarkable amount of renewables, way more than we are or other countries are.

Unfortunately, different issues have gotten in the way of our ability to be able to move forward. Hopefully, now we can renew our efforts and get somewhere, but I'm not sitting around waiting for a breakthrough. What I'm trying to do is see if we can all raise our ambition.

And that pollution of greenhouse gas pollution, of methane, and of CO2 and otherwise we know, goes into the atmosphere. We measure it, this is all scientific. And in my speech yesterday in Edinburgh, I talked about the battle 300 years ago, for science to be recognized and for decisions to be made according to that science. You know, it is science, and our willingness to commit to intelligent investment that helped us produce the vaccine for the pandemic. Now, we still have people that don't believe in that. I know my daughter is a physician, she told me about people who pleaded with them, pleaded with her to give her the vaccine when it was too late and they were on their deathbed in the hospital. So, I have to just say that we still are in a fight, that's what I said in the speech for the truth. And the truth is that the climate crisis is caused by unabated fossil fuel burning, the burning of fossil fuels. And the emissions go up and create a blanket over the planet and the atmosphere, and that contains the heat and it's getting hotter and hotter. This is measured all around the world.

So far, really what we've had officially beyond those words from Vladimir Putin on Thursday were from the aviation authority, the manifests that expl-- that showed that the 10 passengers on board, one of those flights included, the -- if Yevgeny Prigozhin himself. Now, the suggestion is that we need to wait till this investigation, which is being carried out at centers both in Moscow and St Petersburg needs to come back with a definitive proof that his DNA has been found and confirmed that he was on board. Still, the widespread belief is that he was indeed on board. Although, of course, remember if Yevgeny Prigozhin was a man, and we remember this from the raid on his home in St Petersburg with many passports. He'd been declared dead in the past. He was a master of disguise. He was someone who was used to looking after his own survival and making sure he was not in the wrong place at the wrong time. But given the circumstances, and again, we're speaking two months after the event of his, in the end, Turnaround March on Moscow. The understanding is the expectation was that at some point this would catch up with him. And this appears to be what has happened specifically when you consider the words of Vladimir Putin, only yesterday, speaking of his condolences to his family, the long time that they'd known each other for speaking of the presumably deceased Yevgeny Prigozhin is someone who had fine qualities, but also, these faults that he spoke of still. Now, that these key pieces of evidence have been extracted, we will get an official statement about whether or not the DNA conclusively shows that this was that of Yevgeny Prigozhin. I think more importantly now, we're watching and seeing the Russian State, now filling in the gaps that he's left behind. Already we're hearing, Paula, that a deputy, Russian Defense Minister has been to Libya this last week to speak with authorities there about filling in the breach and taking over Wagner operations.

Imagine a politician in any, if you're watching around the world, imagine a politician in your country who had four criminal indictments against them and had been processed four times just in recent months, would that person be the leading candidate of their political party for the next Prime Minister's race or the next presidential race? Imagine if it was a corporate CEO in any big company around the world, wouldn't that person at least be asked to step aside, take a leave of absence until they could go to court and prove their innocence? But for Donald Trump, Paula, you're right. At least for now, in the short term, it's important. We say in the short term, will this help him If he's the nominee against Joe Biden?

That's the stuff that gets promoted. That's the stuff that goes on the charts. And women don't fit into that formula.
