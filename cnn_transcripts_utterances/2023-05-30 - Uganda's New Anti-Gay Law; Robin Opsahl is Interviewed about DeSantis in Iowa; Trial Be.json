Already many people have been fleeing their homes, afraid of being handed over to the authorities because of this bill. And that's the other thing it asks for, is for people to hand over those who they believe are LGBT to the police and for them to face prosecution or very widely discredited conversion therapy.So, it is a very bad news bill for that community.

Robin, great to see you this morning. DeSantis' pitch here, I'm the guy who can win. How is that sitting with Iowa voters? ROBIN OPSAHL, POLITICS REPORTER, \"IOWA CAPITAL DISPATCH\":  Yes, I mean it's definitely something some voters are very interested in. After the 2020 election, some people are looking for an alternative to Donald Trump, who at least in the most recent Iowa polling remains at the top of the list. So many people who agree with some of the politics of DeSantis are looking at alternatives, and DeSantis as a front-runner as well.",
