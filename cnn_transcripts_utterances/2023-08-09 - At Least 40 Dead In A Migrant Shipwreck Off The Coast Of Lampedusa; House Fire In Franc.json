And a Summer day in eastern France after fire engulfed a vacation home killing 11 people. We have the very latest for you. And look at this video from Hawaii. Raging wildfires prompting evacuations on both Mount Maui and the Big Island. We start this evening with a harrowing tale of survival in the Mediterranean. A boat with 45 people on board set off from Tunisia last week carrying men, women and children seeking a better life in Europe, but their journey ended in disaster off Italy. All but four now feared dead. The latest casualties in a growing migrant crisis. This account comes from the Red Cross after it spoke with the four survivors. They say they had life jackets when their boat went down off Italy's Lampedusa Island, so you can see there on your map. And they crawled onto remains of a different wreck to stay alive. And they're not alone, authorities and NGOs report saving people from several wrecks over the past few days, dozens of others are said to be missing or dead. A story that we have told you here on the show many times before. Let's get the very latest, CNN's Ben Wedeman is live in Rome. And Ben, what more are you learning this hour about the victims of this shipwreck, and what are authorities telling you happened here?",

Now, within hours however, it was hit by a large wave and it appears to have gone down. As you've said, four people survived and they are the ones who are giving the account of what happened. Now, they were just lucky enough to be able to find an abandoned boat, they drifted for six days before they were picked up by a merchant, they got rescued by the crew of a merchant vessel and then handed over to the Italian coast guard and eventually reaching the Island of Lampedusa, which is where many of these refugees and migrants are ending up. Now, according to the international organization for migration, so far this year, more than 2,000 people have drowned at sea trying to reach Europe, and in fact, Italy seems to be seeing a spike in the number of people trying to reach its shores. Up to today, according to government statistics, nearly 94,000 people have reached Italy crossing the Mediterranean. That's more than twice the number who tried last year. Now, the European Union has spent hundreds of millions of dollars giving money to Libya and Tunisia for example, to try to prevent people from crossing, but clearly, the desire to escape from hopelessness and war in their home country is greater than the fear of drowning in the Mediterranean --",

This is the kind of thing thatreally touches a lot of French because they'd like to believe that they take very good care of the disabled. This is -- people were intellectually disabled, they were in this vacation residence, which is a tiny -- was a converted barn, renovated barn and they were spending a couple of weeks there out in the countryside in Alsace for what promised to be a kind of a relaxing vacation. But this fire broke out around 6:30 in the morning, and fire -- by the time fire officials got on the scene, it took them about 15 minutes from the closest town, it's a town of about 7,000, it's a very rural area. It took them about 15 minutes to get there, by that time, the building was fully engulfed in flames. They believe that perhaps the fire had been smoldering for a while, and maybe it was started on one of the upper floors, it was a half timber building, the kind of thing you see a lot in Alsace. And some of the timbers, of course, could be 100 of years old and could go up very quickly. It certainly did in this case and the fire officials weren't able to rescue anyone. In fact, the 17 people who came out alive were already there, were already on the ground before the fireman arrived, and the other 11, mostly from the second floor of the building were -- they had been finding their remains and the bodies and the ashes throughout the day. And then at the end of the day, they pronounced all 11 of them that -- so yes, I think there's an investigation going on, the local prosecutors are going to look into it. And I think they're going to look into it like not only for instance, how the fire started, but also, whether or not this building was up to specifications. Whether it was up to specs for housing, the disabled like it was being used for. Isa?",

And it's unexplained because the Russians have launched an investigation, but they said at one point that it was an explosion in the boiler room. That it was a pyrotechnics factory.

You're looking at an almost total collapse of the health and sanitation infrastructure there. This is why Save the Children is warning of a possible cholera outbreak in the capital, Khartoum. This is what it blames it on, a horrifying combination of rising number of corpses, severe water shortages, non-functioning hygiene and sanitation services, and a lack of water treatment options. I'm also hearing from people in Khartoum who talk about severe fuel shortages, some do not have electricity. So, a society that was once functioning four months ago has all but disappeared as people in residential neighborhoods sometimes have to dodge the fighting that's been going on for this whole time, as the Rapid Support Forces and the Sudanese army fight for control of the country. More than 4 million people now displaced, 70 percent of them just from the capital, Khartoum, and almost a million people have had to cross borders of Sudan into neighboring countries like Chad and Egypt, anything to try and get away from this conflict especially, because any attempt at mediation, any talks did not lead to any meaningful -- meaningfully-observed ceasefires. A couple of hours, maybe a couple of days, and then they were right back into it.

And the rector speaking with CNN earlier, described this as direct discrimination against the Palestinians of east Jerusalem who just want to improve their lives. He says that this program was simply improving integration, reducing crime and violence and improving understanding. And say that it is totally untrue that this was going to criminal organizations. The other aspect as you mentioned was destined for municipalities, the kind of leveling up policy that's well established in Israel, even after that, it was found that Arab municipalities still had quite the shortfall between them and wealthier municipalities. And so additional funding was designated towards them, that is also being frozen. And Smotrich, in a very lengthy statement, he first announced his plans on Facebook yesterday, today, he gave a very lengthy statement, again reiterating that he is the Finance Minister of all Israelis, irrespective of their gender, of their religious affiliation, of their ethnicity, and he simply trying to ensure that the funds go to the people, that the services go to the people and not to criminal organizations. But he also did reiterate that this funding in his view was also really just down to placate Mansour Abbas, who is the leader of the Islamist Ra'am Party and he was part of the previous government coalition. That's another reason he is using to justify the freezing of these funds. And he also says it's not fair that poor Arab municipalities are getting this money and poorer Jewish ones aren't.

Police are trying to determine whether the deaths were homicide. At the end of last month, two elderly couples went to lunch at the home of 48-year old Erin Patterson in a small township. She is the former daughter-in-law of one of the couples. Police say she is separated from her husband, who has now lost both his parents from the poisoning. Police say that evening, the guests began showing signs of food poisoning and were admitted to hospital. Days later, 70 -year old Gail Patterson and her sister, 66-year old Heather Wilkinson died. A day later, Gail's 70 -year old husband passed away. A fourth guest, Heather's 68-year-old husband, a reverend in the local community, remains in a critical condition. Police say that Erin Patterson is a suspect because she cooked the meal and is the only adult at lunch who did not fall ill. She is not being charged in the deaths. Her two children were also at lunch but did not get sick because they were served different meals. Let's take a listen to what Victoria police homicide detective, inspector Dean Thomas, had to say.
