And as the committee went through the work, it found 13 different items, locations, places, street names at the U.S. military academy, more commonly known as West Point, that commemorated the Confederacy. That's why is changing here. The superintendent of West Point writing an open letter, saying, \"This process will begin, a multi-phased prospect and it will take time.\" In terms of what's changing names? A lot of this commemorates Robert E. Lee. A portrait will come down. A stone bust of him in Reconciliation Plaza. The KKK hooded figure, that will be removed, too. This has been a process to get here. And this has been part of the naming commission's efforts. They've also changed names or recommended name changes for bases and ships as well -- Abby?",

While the CDC suggests a slowdown in cases nationwide, experts say we should see an uptick after the holiday travel and gatherings.CNN's medical correspondent, Elizabeth Cohen, is joining us now. So, Elizabeth, how bad is this flu outbreak right now? A lot of people just went home for the holidays, headed back to their homes. What's going to happen? DR. ELIZABETH COHEN, CNN SENIOR MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: Right. You're going to get people mixing it up a bit. The flu is really in a bad place. Let's look at a map of the United States, Abby. Every state in red, orange, purple, that means flu is at high or very high levels according to the CDC, and almost the entire map is red, orange or purple. Now, some possible good news is the numbers are coming down a bit. If we looks starting at the week of November 27th, you can see hospital admissions slowly falling by a bit. Here's the problem, Flu is still high, even though it's coming down. With the holidays, as we were saying, with people getting around, it's possible the numbers could go back up -- Abby?",

First of all, think about the most vulnerable. That's infants and the elderly. Dress infants more warmly than you would dress yourself. Check on elderly people who may be at home alone. Also avoid alcohol or caffeine. I know that's not popular, but it can inhibit your body's ability to keep warm. And remember that cold puts stress on the heart and problematic on people with asthmas or other lung diseases. Keep that in mind. We just have to put in a word for generator safety. People really, really get hurt by generators. Do use them in your home. If you use them, keep them away from your home. And always direct it in the opposite direction. Carbon monoxide kills easily, quickly. It's tasteless, odorless. You won't see it -- Abby?",
