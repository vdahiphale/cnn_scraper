It's going to be a crucial day of cross examination, once the defense finally gets its turn with Michael Cohen. Now right now, what's happening in the courtroom is Cohen is on the stand. And we're being told by our reporters that are inside, that he continues to be very measured and calculated in his words and answering the questions from the prosecution. And right now, they are literally going through all the checks that prosecutors argued were falsified, which is the center of this case. These are the charges that are against the former president, the falsification of these business records in order to make hush money payments to Stormy Daniels. And then they are going line by line by these checks. There's one exchange right here that says, were any of those checks in fact, for work during the month described in those check stubs? And Cohen replied, \"No, ma'am.\" Remember the accusation here is that they were billed as legal fees when, in fact, they were really reimbursements. So they're getting to really the heart of these charges and making sure jurors are aware of Cohen's participation in this. And they also have brought jurors into the White House. That is one of the conversations that were had about the reimbursement payments according to the prosecution, between Cohen and Trump after he was actually in the White House. Jurors have seen a picture Michael Cohen in the Briefing Room to show that he was there. This actually happened. Again, more evidence corroborating this story. So certainly they are already off to a quick start, getting to the heart of this case. And then again, we do anticipate the cross-examination to happen from defense attorneys and it could last longer than the questioning now we have seen from the prosecutor. So we will be waiting for that, Erica.",

Georgia, of course, has to fulfill certain criteria to move to the next stage of accession. And look, this is why we've seen these protests escalate in recent weeks. Georgia has a very young, very vibrant population, very strong civil society. They are at least 80 percent, according to recent polls, 80 percent in favor of E.U. integration. And that is why we've seen the protests escalate, the government statements come out against them. And this is how we got to this point. Take a look.

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (through translator): We're just going to keep going till there's a better outcome. SEBASTIAN (voice-over): Last year, protests worked. Scenes like this forcing the government to scrap the same so-called both foreign agent bill, seen here as a replica of a repressive Russian law. And a sign of Moscow's growing influence in this small post-Soviet state. Then in March, barely three months after gaining E.U. candidate status, the Georgian government revived the law. In a rare appearance in late April, the ruling party's honorary leader and most powerful driving force, lashing out the west. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (through translator): Despite the promises of the 2008 Bucharest summit, Georgia and Ukraine have not been accepted into NATO and have been left out to dry. All those decisions are made by the global party of war. SEBASTIAN (voice-over): As protesters grew more determined, the police response escalated. Violence widely condemned by the European Union. In this shocking attack on May 1st, opposition leader Levan Khabeishvili says he was deliberately targeted. His bruises are still visible. LEVAN KHABEISHVILI, GEORGIAN OPPOSITION LEADER (through translator): They did not get what they wanted from me. They were filming to upload the video afterwards and to show the opposition leader in a state that would discredit me. SEBASTIAN (voice-over): And violence not the only means of intimidation.

That's definitely a point that Volodymyr Zelenskyy wanted to make.And certainly as we saw, there wanted to make publicly as well, is that these Patriot air defense systems, the Ukrainians right now believe could give them a serious boost in the battlefield and certainly protect their troops on the front lines as well. And I think one of those areas is exactly the one that we're talking about, the ones that you mentioned, Lyptsi and Vovchansk, of course, on the border are very close to the border between Russia and Ukraine. And right now, the places that the Russians really are assaulting. And the reason why the Ukrainians specifically want these Patriot surface-to-air missile systems is that the Russians are absolutely pounding the Ukrainians in those areas with their air force. The Russians able to use that air force much more effectively than they have in the past, essentially, by inventing, as they put it, and mass- producing guidance and wing kits for Soviet-era bombs to make sure that they can employ those further away from the front lines. And the only system the Ukrainians say that can take those jets down or prevent them from flying near the front lines is the U.S.-made Patriots. So definitely the Ukrainians believe that it would save a lot of lives on the front line. Certainly make it easier for those troops to counter some of those offensive actions that the Russians are conducting right now. And on the other hand, of course, Erica, the other thing that the U.S. has been talking about, that the Ukrainians have been talking about, is artillery, ammunition that they say they need a lot of. Some of it now, coming to the front lines. But then also rocket artillery as well. So the Ukrainians say they need everything. But first and foremost, those longer range air defense systems, Erica.",

And the president directly to withhold further arms shipments if Israel moves forward with an all-out ground offensive. We have heard that the U.S. and Israel are planning to hold further consultations on Rafah. And as you just mentioned, we're reporting that, according to U.S. officials, that there are sufficient Israeli forces now amassed to carry out that all-out ground offensive. But we don't know if and when it will come. What we are witnessing, though, is an offensive in Rafah that is taking place. But it is taking place in stages and in a limited way. We have watched as initially Israeli tanks and troops moved in a little over a week ago, to eastern Rafah, the Rafah border crossing in particular. They then issued further evacuation notices slightly further west. And Israeli troops have been slowly moving in that same direction. But we don't know yet whether this Rafah offensive will simply continue in that manner or if there will be a day, where we suddenly see a massive, all-out offensive into the central part of the city. The most densely populated areas that are raising the biggest concerns among U.S. officials. In the meantime, though, what we are seeing is the mass displacement of Palestinian people who are living in Rafah. Many of them already displaced multiple times from other parts of the Gaza Strip. The U.N.'s main agency in Gaza now estimates that nearly 0.5 million people have fled Rafah for areas further north. We are seeing them arriving in areas like the al-Mawasi expanded humanitarian zone, which includes that kind of coastal sandy area of al- Mawasi as well as now western Khan Younis, which has been decimated by months of Israeli military operations. And bombing there, as well as fighting, of course, between Israeli forces and Hamas militants and parts of central Gaza. But the people who are displaced there are finding that the conditions simply aren't adequate for the number of people who are flooding in. There is a lack of sewage infrastructure, electricity, water. And humanitarian aid groups in particular are having trouble reaching those areas to provide the sufficient aid that is needed for what is becoming a mass movement of people in that area.",

That's up 25 percent in just the last 24 hours. It is at least a third of the population that had taken shelter there after Israel's military, of course, had diverted other parts of Gaza and urged people to evacuate south.

And cover up that payment to Stormy Daniels, $130,000 in the days leading up to the 2016 election.

That still remains to be seen that's on the table and we'll hear from a government spokesperson in just a moment. But I will tell you that on the surface these tariffs really appear to be more symbolic than full of substance. And here's the reason why. China definitely has a very strong EV market. It's trying to make a global footprint. But if you look at where EVs from China are being sold, the United States is really toward the bottom if not the bottom of the list. A majority of Chinese EVs are sold in Europe and then across Southeast Asia. Again, the U.S. is somewhere at the bottom. So it's not like it's going to hurt these EV makers here in China or prevent flooding of the market all that much. However, looking ahead, Chinese EV makers certainly do want to get into the United States. It's a very crowded market here in China. In fact, hard to believe there are more than 200 EV manufacturers. This year, about 100 more models will be added. It is getting very congested. So obviously these Chinese automakers want to increase their footprint and that means going to the United States. As far as though what China will do next, no surprise. We did hear some very firm language from China's ministry of foreign affairs. Let's take a quick listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) WANG WENBIN, CHINESE FOREIGN MINISTRY SPOKESPERSON (through translator): China opposes the unilateral imposition of tariffs, which violate WTO rules. And we'll take all necessary actions to protect its legitimate rights.\"",

Because it was just last month that we saw Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen here, putting a warning to Chinese officials that this over-capacity, the fact that they can make the Chinese government, that China can make products such as EVS, solar panels and other electronics batteries at such a fast and cheap rate, that was problematic to her. So perhaps that was setting the stage for this action, Erica, by the U.S. toward China.",

      "sentences": "Yes, of course, Erica, you can't deny the fact that it is an election year. And it comes as President Biden is tryingto show that he is ratcheting up the pressure on China and can have a tough approach toward China, especially when it comes to issues of trade. That is an area where former president Donald Trump and Republicans have also often sought to criticize President Biden. Now, it is worth noting that these actions that are being announced today, increasing tariffs and about $18 billion where the Chinese imports. It comes after a review of Trump era tariffs, back when Trump was in the White House, he had raised tariffs on about $300 billion of Chinese imports. That law that he assigned a required every four years that there would be a review done. And so that is what the administration has been aiming toward over the course of the past few months. As Marc noted, it's no surprise that the Biden administration did decide to increase some tariffs. Biden really has largely kept the Trump era tariffs in place, even as he had criticized them when he was a presidential candidate back in 2020. But what the Biden administration is trying to argue is that the president is trying to focus on domestic manufacturing and things like semiconductors and clean energy. And these new tariffs that they're imposing on China, Chinese imports, even as many of them are simply symbolic at this point, it's trying to show that the U.S. is focusing on those sectors which they think will bring jobs back to the United States. Now this is also coming as both Biden and Trump are trying to play for -- make a play for working class voters in some of those key blue wall states, think Michigan and Pennsylvania, where the manufacturing industry is key for so many jobs there. So with this announcement, the Biden administration is, one, trying to head off criticism that Biden's not tough enough on China but also trying to argue that he is focused on bringing back manufacturing jobs here to the U.S. as they are trying to appeal to some of those voters in states that will be critical to his reelection in November.",

Here are eight familiar faces slated to be there. Among them as you'll see, senator Marco Rubio, governor Kristi Noem, although she may have dropped a little bit in the last few weeks based on some of the reaction to that book. Also, senator Tim Scott, Vivek Ramaswamy as well, Byron Donalds. They're both with im in court. CNN reporter Steve Contorno joining me now from St. Petersburg, Florida. There's a lot of ring kissing happening here, coming to kiss the ring, as we wait to see how close the former president is to picking a running mate. I'm not sure if you have your crystal ball ready but I hope so because I'm hoping maybe you can tell us how close we may be.

Erica, all indications are that we won't get a formal announcement on who his V.P. selection is until we'recloser to the Republican National Convention, which isn't until mid July. So we can expect him to tease this along \"Apprentice\" style, as you said, over the next coming months. And even if he does narrow the list down, he's liable to change his mind. He didn't make his decision in 2016 until the final moments before the announcement. Chris Christie was still in the mix until Mike Pence officially got the call. So he's going to let this roll out over several months. And what we're seeing is sort of this audition of the potential running mates in New York and Manhattan, where they are showing up to support him outside of the courthouse. And as well as you mentioned, at this fundraiser tonight, where we will see many of the people on that list try to do their best job of standing behind the former president and making their pitch for him.",

But it's hard to know how much of that money is -- are donations that would have come to him anyway or is just a factor of the Republican donor base consolidating around him now that he is the nominee. But they are catching up to Joe Biden. They are trying to keep pace with the fundraising we have seen from Democrats. Of course, Donald Trump continues to use a lot of that money on his legal bills as well.
