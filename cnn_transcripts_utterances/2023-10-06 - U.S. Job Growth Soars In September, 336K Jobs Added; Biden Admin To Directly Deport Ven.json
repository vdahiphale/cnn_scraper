But here's why, despite this robust report, Americans may still feel pretty terrible about the economy. Because when you have a number like this, this may indicate to the Fed that they need to continue to raise interest rates. Americans are already paying higher prices on almost everything right now. So, they're feeling that pain.And that's what people feel every single day. They don't look at those numbers every day and say, hey, oh, there's 336,000 jobs. They say, how much am I paying for gas? How much am I paying for food? So, what this report could do is signal to the Fed that they need to increase interest rates, which then means people have to pay more money on their car loans, on mortgage rates. The good news here is that wages are still outpacing inflation. That's good news.",

So, all these folks are going back to work Saturday morning. Just to remind folks, they include some nurses, there are technicians, receptionists, these are frontline healthcare workers who really worked through the pandemic and that they currently do not feel valued they tell me because of the severe understaffing that they've experienced. They also talk in this recent statement about Kaiser outsourcing some of the jobs which they are not happy with. Of course, these three days of strike that were scheduled have resulted in some inconveniences for patients who are members of Kaiser across the United States. The most impact of course, here in California where the majority of people walked out, but here are some voices of patients who talk to us about their experience this week. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

The hope is this might curb the record influx of people crossing the U.S.-Mexico border.One figure shows that more than 7.7 million people have left Venezuela, fleeing a humanitarian crisis there. The majority of them do stay in Latin America or the Caribbean. But estimates do show that hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans have made it to the United States, many seeking asylum.

And that is that there is an increasing number of Venezuelans coming to the U.S.-Mexico border, and they make up a large share of those who are crossing the border.And up until this point, the options were really only to process them and release or detain them, or in some cases, send them back to Mexico. And those aren't many tools when you are looking at the numbers we're looking at, which is thousands of Venezuelans every month, who are also causing strain in cities in the United States, like New York, which has been publicly critical of the president and his border policies. So, this is a big moment for the administration. The question is, what does -- what change happens now? So, how many flights will there be? And will it really make a dent to drive down these numbers? And that's what one former DHS official told me. It all comes down to how many flights will they have that can at least start to send the message that the -- these people could be deported to Venezuela.",

And that's what sources tell me as well that they were up against the deadline. It was the end of fiscal year 2023. That these funds had to be used for the sole purpose. And that's why they decided to move forward and to focus it on an area where there is high traffic.But to be clear, and a pretty stern message the Homeland Security secretary, Alejandro Mayorkas, said that there is no change in the way that they view border wall so much as they had to move forward with this because of the law and because the funding was there and needed to be used. But again, as you point out, John, even as the message from President Biden has been they're not going to build an extra mile of the wall, their reality looks a little different right now, and that is that they're going to have to build up to 20 miles of it.",

But doing just fine now. I know this was -- this was, I think, a surprise to not only my family but some of our bosses who said you did what? I think one thing I really wanted to understand was why people came to this festival. Because it's part of the Festival of San Fermin. It's an incredibly cultural and religious holiday and deeply rooted in many traditions there in Spain, and particularly in the north, in Pamplona. But when you're there, you also want to get a sense of why it brings so many who are not Spanish. And I think oftentimes, when you think of the running of the bulls, at least this was kind of how I thought about it before. It's you think of one run that happens once a year. Well, really, it's a multi-day festival. There's eight days of running. And there's six bulls that run each day. Now, at the end of the day, and here's the really controversial part, those bulls end up being killed in a bullfight, which is really disturbing and tough to watch. And quite frankly, I think for a lot of folks, difficult to reconcile the two. But this portion of it, the running that you see and I think has probably gotten a lot of play on social media and over the you know regular media over the years is what most folks think about.
