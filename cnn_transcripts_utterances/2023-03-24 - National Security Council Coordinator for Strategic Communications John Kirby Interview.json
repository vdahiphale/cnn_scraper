There are more people on the move in the western hemisphere right now than there has been since World War II. It's staggering the numbers of people that are moving throughout the hemisphere.

So, pay attention to this because not just what's happening in New York and Washington and on the coast. Editorial writer for the Star Tribune in Minneapolis is Patricia Lopez, Axios reporter from Phoenix, Arizona, Jeremy Duda and political editor with the Tampa Bay Times in Florida, Emily Mahoney.Thank you all for joining us. Emily, I'm going to start with you, and good morning to you, by the way. I know it's quite early for Jeremy. So, I really appreciate Jeremy, joining us -- all of you, but especially Jeremy. Emily, I'm going to start with you in Florida. In Florida, where Governor Ron DeSantis poses the greatest potential threat to Trump's 2024 run. How are voters reacting to all of these investigations?",

      "sentences": "Right. So, even before, some of the latest news with these investigations, I've been talking to voters. You know, covering various events where Governor Ron DeSantis has sort of been ramping up this campaign or shadow campaign for president. And among DeSantis supporters, you know, who really overlap with people who voted for Donald Trump in 2016 and 2020. There has been a growing sense that Donald Trump, it could really be hindered both politically and in a potential administration by what they see as mounting sort of deep state resistance to him.And I think that the latest revelations with these investigations will really only add to that sense, that he faces so much resistance. That they're turning to Ron DeSantis as an alternative person who they see as being more likely to be successful politically. And also, would be able to have more control over his own administration. And I think that these, like I said, the latest news kind of will only add to that sentiment.",

      "sentences": "I think so. I mean, obviously, Florida is not exactly representative of the entire country, because DeSantis just won reelection here by more than 19 points. And so, he's very popular here but I do think that is the sentiment among Trump slash DeSantis supporters here in the state. On the other hand, I will also say, though, that Trump and DeSantis have both proven very adept at taking up a lot of oxygen in the news cycle. And in Florida, typically, we talk almost 24/7 About DeSantis.He's very good at producing headlines at a very steady pace, he does so intentionally. And with all of the Trump news recently, and with these investigations sort of looming over the country, it has very dramatically sort of reoriented the conversation in the news cycle. Even here in Florida, where DeSantis is now being asked about Trump having to form a position on these investigations. And so, I think if this continues, it will prove interesting because Trump is now sort of once again at the center of the Republican universe.",

Because during the 2022 midterms, several Trump beat candidates were defeated in their races Kari Lake for governor, Secretary of State candidate Mark Finchem.

Patricia, I want to turn to you Minneapolis was ground zero for social justice protests following George Floyd's murder.

Voters completely swept Democrats into power at the highest levels. There are no high-level Republicans to even fly the flag for Trump. Party leaders don't talk about him, I think the reaction has been muted at best. Our Governor Tim Walz said earlier that while he, you know, everyone has a right to protest. All of their officials were looking for signs of possible planned protests, civil disturbance, something that might be akin to what happened earlier. And they found no evidence of that.",
