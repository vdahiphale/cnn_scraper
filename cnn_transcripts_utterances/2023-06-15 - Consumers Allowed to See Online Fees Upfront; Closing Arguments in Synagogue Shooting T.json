Today, President Biden will announce that Live Nation and Ticketmaster will give consumers the ability to see all of those fees up front when purchasing tickets. The move hopes to try to minimize the often frustrating experience of watching additional fees add up late in the process when you're at the checkout. Yes, we all know the feeling.

That's just something that drives people crazy. So this is voluntarily, Live Nation and Ticketmaster, starting in September, there will be one, clear, upfront price. And the president, this afternoon, is going to sit around with some other companies that are already doing this. So, trying to make sure that you don't have all of these fees baked into things.And, again, it is voluntary. It is trying to push these companies to do the right thing. What you're seeing on the screen behind you is what the president has said Congress should pass, the Junk Fee Protection Act. And that would prevent these fees, excessive online fees, and also airline fees for families to sit together, drives families with young children crazy, and also early termination fees for TV or internet or cable or phone services. Those can be exorbitant. So, the president wants Congress to make those illegal. And also surprise resort and destination fees. So you think you're paying x for a resort trip and then all of a sudden, at the end, you find all these other fees embedded.

One of them was Boris Johnson's own birthday party. One of them had some 200 people who were invited to bring their own booze. And ultimately the committee determined that Boris Johnson did deliberately mislead parliament for giving unsustainable interpretations of the rules that he helped to write. For instance, he claimed at the time, and in some cases continues toclaim, that some of these gatherings were essential for work purposes. So, the committee found in its report, I'll read part of it, it said, we came to the view that some of Mr. Johnson's denials and explanations were so disingenuous that they were, by their very nature, deliberate attempts to mislead the committee and the house, while others demonstrated deliberation because of the frequency with which he closed his mind to the truth. Now, Boris Johnson released his own scathing response, writing in part, for the committee now to say that all such events, thank yous and birthdays were intrinsically illegal is ludicrous, contrary to the intentions of those who made the rules, including me, and contrary to the findings of the Met police. And above all I did not, for one moment, think that they were elicit at the time or when I spoke in the comments. So, ultimately, this report suggests that Boris Johnson ought to be suspended as an MP for 90 days, which would potentially open him up to a bi-election (ph) in his seat.
