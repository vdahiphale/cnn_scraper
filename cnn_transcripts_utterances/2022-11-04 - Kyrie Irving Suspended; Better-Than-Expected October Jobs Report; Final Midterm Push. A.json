That's about a quarter more than we saw in 2018 at the same time. But, Ana, I just saw a tweet right now from Gabriel Sterling with the secretary of state's office. He says that that number has gone up even more as of noon today. We're talking more than 2,335,000 votes that have already been cast. And we still have hours to go today. Now, polling tells us that the economy is the number one issue for most voters across the country. And that's true for a lot of the voters that I have talked to around Georgia over the past month as well. But when we talk to people at this particular polling place, which is in a heavily Democratic area, they had different ideas about what their main issue was going into the ballot box today, something that would likely excite Democratic candidates when they hear it.

We have only had early voting here in New York for a couple of years now. And we're starting to see not record-breaking numbers, but a substantial number of people are sort of reorganizing their political life around the idea that they're going to have a week or two to cast a ballot. The political organizations and the candidates are adapting as well. I think you're seeing that all over the country. And so, hopefully, there will be a overall higher turnout. But, more importantly, I think people's strategies of when and how they go to their base, when and how they try and bring out new voters, when and how they run their final ad campaigns, all of that is changing all over the country.

These are first-time voters. I'd like to go through the data when all of the dust settles to see if they're part of this early voting surge. If so, that's really interesting. There's some evidence, especially in Georgia, that some of these early voters are students who are on campus. That's in part because of the schedule. If that's the case, that too is interesting.

So, the White House was hoping for a Goldilocks report, a jobs market that's not too hot, not too cold. Where does this land? JEANNA SMIALEK, \"THE NEW YORK TIMES\":  It's not far off, I would say that this is still a pretty hot jobs market, but not really showing any signs of re-acceleration. So what we're seeing is very strong jobs growth, very strong wage growth, sort of sustained low unemployment rate.

And so, with an economy that is growing as quickly as the one we have right now, with job gains like we're seeing, with wage gains, in particular, like we're seeing, it's just going to take a while to get prices back down. So I think that the sort of overall takeaway here is that we still have some more room to go in that sort of battle against inflation. The Fed's probably going to continue raising interest rates. They have very much signaled that at their meeting this week, and, as they do that, we're going to see a slightly more painful situation in the economy. It's very likely the job market will slow in the next year.
