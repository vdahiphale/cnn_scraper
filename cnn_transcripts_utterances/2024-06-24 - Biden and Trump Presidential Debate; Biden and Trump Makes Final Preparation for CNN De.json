The rematch Americans say they have been dreading, we'll be fully joined later this week. When three days from now, President Biden and Former President Trump meet for the first presidential debate of 2024. When they take the stage in Atlanta, Thursday night, it will be the first time a president and a former president face off. Donald Trump and his allies have been painting Joe Biden as, to put it directly, senile. So incapacitated by age that he cannot possibly run the country. The challenge that that creates is setting the bar so low that it might not be that hard for Biden to clear it. Hence these comments from North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum, who's being vetted to be Trump's vice president. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV. DOUG BURGUM (R-ND):  You have to look, the guy's run for office more than a dozen times. He's run for president four times. He's been campaigning since President Nixon was in office. This guy has got the ability, and we've seen it -- we've seen him in debate four years ago. We've seen him in the State of the Union this year that when he needs to, he can step up.

If he comes in unhinged, like he is most of the time, or he sits there and is quiet, people are going to know that he's a twice impeached, convicted felon who's been found to have defamed somebody, sexually abused somebody, and gone bankrupt six times.

JOHN KING, CNN CHIEF NATIONAL CORRESPONDENTSo, the American people are going to be watching this. And there's the last three and a half years of their life in Joe Biden and there's the four years of their life before that in Donald Trump. So, I get the Biden campaign wanting to go after the Trump record, of course. Of course. But I would argue from my travels, they also better affirmatively look the American people in the eye and say, here's what I would do, not just what he would do, but here's what I would do on cost of living. Here's what I would do on other issues. He's the incumbent president and history tells us, people are essentially deciding, do I like what I have or do I want change? Now, that argument is a lot more complicated when the change is Donald Trump, and that's the argument Biden can make. But it's the incumbent, yes, I get it. They want to take on Trump. They want to say, you don't want that back. You don't want the chaos back. You don't want that character back. You don't want how he behaves back as president. I get that. But there's a whole slice of people out there who don't like both. That's the challenge. The people who would decide this election don't like Joe Biden or Donald Trump.

You have your to do list. You want to say why I've done a good job. Why I'm going to continue to-do a good job. Here's what I'm going to do for you. Here's why this guy is terrible. The problem is this guy has got a to-do list also.

You know, they want to see who's my president? Who do I trust? Who do I trust?So, the way I would look at this is both of these guys have considerable strengths. Both of them also have giant weaknesses. And so, in prep, what are you deciding? What's my number one priority, to expose his weaknesses or to try to fill in the cracks in my strength? Biden has -- the Democratic coalition is more complicated, and Biden has a lot of cracks in that coalition. So, how can you answer some of those questions? Can you deal with apathy in the African-American community on the debate stage? What can you say to try to tell people, hey, think about this. Really think about this. You don't want him because of this. One thing the Biden White House policy first, but also politically, they had hoped to have a ceasefire in Gaza, for example, because he has a giant hole with younger voters and with Muslim and Arab- Americans in places like Michigan, not going to be able to do that as a debate. So, you almost have to set that one over. We'll have to deal with that some other time, right? If you don't have a policy initiative or some progress, you can cite to say this, so, set that one over here. But if you're -- you know, if you're Trump, do you raise that? I don't think that there's a big enough policy difference there. But that's my question for these guys, especially, you're in there saying, what's priority number one?

Like Linda Rooney might be thinking, OK, I don't like his shenanigans, but I can live with it. He's not going to storm the Capitol again. He's not going to do this. The truth of the matter is, is that President Biden has to make clear that the sequel will be the real horror show. The real blood and guts will come when he is now completely untethered and empowered. And I don't think people process that. I don't think they think that it could get worse when, in fact, it sure as hell could get a lot worse.",

We still have flood warnings in effect from Mankato in Minnesota all the way to South Dakota, Sioux Falls, northwest Iowa and then down the Missouri River from Sioux City to Omaha because this area is so waterlogged, the rivers are still aggravated and could still rise and cause some flooding because we've got 10 to 15 inches or more of rain in just three days.You see that pocket there over parts of Northwest Iowa, just south there of Sioux Falls. Another pocket of some heavy rain around Mankato. But a huge swath, all those reds and oranges that you see are totals that are four, five, six, seven inches. I mean, we're talking about 17-inch totals in parts of South Dakota. Totals nearing a foot in Rock Rapids, Iowa, more than 6.5 inches in Sioux Falls, makes it the top two wettest Junes on record. We'll continue with the major and the moderate flooding as we go through the day today. So, hopefully finding these rivers trying to come down a little bit. Kasie.",
