People who CNN has also learned have already been talking in detail to investigators. They are now likely witnesses.

And the things that they noticed, we heard about a woodworker, for instance, someone who was installing crown molding in Trump's bedroom and that person noticed a stack of documents that looked rather suspicious, so suspicious to him that he thought they were movie props, looked like classified records of some sort. That person we were told doesn't actually know what he saw, but this is the sort of person who could be called to testify at this trial in Florida to provide the picture of what it was like around Mar-a-Lago where all of these images that we've seen in photographs exist of documents and boxes and there were real people there in these spaces moving about -- a maid, a plumber, a chauffeur as well, knowing that something was off and thinking about that, and then relaying that to investigators.",

The defense lawyers stand up in closing, and they say, folks, you're going to convict my client based on the word of a criminal, and then we, prosecutors stand up and say, to the jury, look, we'd love to call honest, hardworking people to come in here and tell you about a crime, but that type of person isn't on the inside of a crime.Here, they're literally on the inside of a crime.

Governor, good to see you. So CNN has reported that a plumber, a maid, a chauffeur and a woodworker are among Mar-a-Lago staffers and contract workers who federal prosecutors may call to testify against former President Trump and his two co-defendants at the declassified documents trial. Does that indicate anything to you about the depth of the prosecution's case? CHRIS CHRISTIE (R), 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: The breadth and the depth of the prosecution's case, Anderson, as you know, I did this for seven years as the US attorney in the fifth largest office in the country. We did over 130 political corruption cases without a defeat. What you want to see in a witness list is a broad and deep list witness list that could cover every potential contingency, every potential exit ramp that the defendant may have to try to justify his or her conduct that you believe, based upon your evidence is criminal. And so I think what you're seeing is just how thorough Jack Smith's investigation has been, and that there's no one who has seen or heard anything at Mar-a-Lago regarding these documents, who's going to be immune from testifying if they believe they have relevant information.",

So we know mistakes were made, but the reckoning will come later on. First and foremost is to protect the territorial integrity of Israel, protect the safety and security of its citizens and degrade Hamas and what I also hope the government does is keep your eye on the ball while they're doing this.

A senior military official says, the facility was likely housing weapons used against U.S. forces in the region.In Israel and Gaza, this is new video that just came to us, explosions over Northern Gaza more than a month after Hamas slaughtered more than 1,400 people, mostly civilians, and after a military response has claimed 35 Israeli soldiers, according to the IDF, and more than 10,000 Palestinians according to the Hamas-controlled health ministry. The White House said today that Israel has agreed to formalize brief four-hour pauses in fighting daily in areas of Northern Gaza. These windows are to allow for aid to enter and civilians to leave. In a moment, we'll be taken inside Gaza by our Oren Liebermann. We should first note that journalists embedded with the IDF in Gaza operate under the observation of Israeli commanders in the field. They're not permitted to move unaccompanied within the Gaza Strip as a condition to enter Gaza under IDF escort. Outlets have to submit all materials and footage to the Israeli military for review prior to publication. CNN has agreed to these terms in order to provide a limited window into Israel's operations in Gaza. Here is Oren's report. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) OREN LIEBERMANN, CNN PENTAGON CORRESPONDENT (voiceover):  Through the breach, we enter Northern Gaza at the Erez Border Crossing. The land here, once fertile farmland, is barren, and the trees that might have provided enemy cover, destroyed. In the distance, smoke from an Israeli airstrike is a stark reminder that this is day 34 of a war that may stretch much longer. On Thursday, the IDF chief of staff and the head of the country's internal security service entered Gaza and promised strength through cooperation. Everyone is doing everything, said General Herzi Halevi, just so you can be as strong as possible. Along our path in Northern Gaza, the signs of civilian life have given way to the constant hum of drones and the distant echoes of artillery. Our time with the IDF began at the coordination base for the border crossing, the first international media to visit the site. The terror attack on October 7th hit hard here. The scars of machine gun fire and RPGs still visible. The base was mostly empty on a holiday but not entirely. An IDF says, nine soldiers were killed here and three kidnapped. It took 12 hours for Israel to regain control of the base, now it's one of the main gates to Gaza. We stop at an overlook near the town of Jabalya.",

We're not trying to stop you. When we say pause, we mean pause. We mean several hours. We mean for humanitarian aid. We mean for safe passage. We don't want a ceasefire. And only after the Israelis got convinced, they started a serious effort to draft a plan to do it, and they actually started doing it today. It was the first day. They did it in two neighborhoods in Northern Gaza. They announced the pause of four hours that allowed people to get out of their houses, buy food, get water, get medicine, which is something that did not happen for a month. I'll tell you another interesting thing. If you ask the Israeli government about it, Prime Minister Netanyahu, Minister of Defense Gallant, they will tell you that nothing happened.
