You can see that there are a lot of volunteers and a lot of school teachers who are here hard at work cleaning up the glass chards and putting up plywood that's been donated by the administration here, the director of the school tells me. She says that she was knocked to the ground by the force of the blast this morning.Thankfully, mercifully, there were no children in this school when this explosion took place. The director says that the school has basically been closed for some six months now and that the children have all been evacuated to safer places.

And imposing enhanced background checks for gun buyers between the ages of 18 and 21. But many, including Biden himself, saw that law as just a tiny step. And since the beginning of this year there have been at least 110 mass shootings in the U.S. leaving more than 150 dead.

And VCU and UCLA -- they went from the First Four to the Final Four in a couple of years. So keep an eye on those teams like Pitt and Mississippi State. They were playing last night for an 11-seed. This game went back and forth pretty much all night with 21 lead changes. Pitt's Jamarius Burton -- he makes the go-ahead jumper with just 10 seconds left. Mississippi State -- great inbounds play to try to win the game, but Shakeel Moore's shot no good. The tip-in also doesn't go. So Pitt wins, hanging on to win 60-59.

Seema, Moody's Investors Service reviewing six U.S. banks for potential credit downgrades and actually putting the entire industry on watch here, essentially saying we should be prepared for more pressure in banking. What does that mean? SEEMA SHAH, CHIEF GLOBAL STRATEGIST, PRINCIPAL ASSET MANAGEMENT (via Skype):  Hi. Well, what we saw over the weekend with Silicon Valley Bank was really the impact from the very, very aggressive rate increases from the Federal Reserve. We came into 2023 I think knowing, typically, whenever there is an aggressive rate hiking cycle like the one we've just seen something always breaks. There's always going to be some type of financial strain. So some of this could have been anticipated but it's always very difficult to identify where and when exactly it's going to hit. Now, in light of what happened you are going to see a number of people -- analysts, credit agencies are starting to look at the banking sector with a close eye and trying to figure out where the additional weaknesses could be. I mean, yesterday, the settling in markets with banking -- some of the regional banking stocks at least recovering is really a sigh of relief. And hopefully -- it's still very early days but hopefully, it suggests that this isn't going to be spreading through the system and becoming something a little bit more systemic which, of course, would be very concerning.",

So I think we should expect there will be further strengths (PH).Next week, of course, we have the next meeting from the Federal Reserve. We're going to see what they do. If they were to continue with rate hikes fairly aggressively in light of the inflation data -- although it moderated it's still very high -- it does suggest that the Fed still has further to go. You know, this does suggest that we are going to get further economic slowdowns through the progress of this year and unfortunately, that does mean that a lot of banks or other sectors could be under some pressure this year.",
