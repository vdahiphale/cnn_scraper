The tanks will reportedly allow Ukraine to go on the offensive and to retake occupied territory. The Russian ambassador to Germany warns that Germany's approval is \"extremely dangerous, and brings the conflict to a new level of confrontation.\" With us now, CNN's Natasha Bertrand and Nick Paton Walsh. Natasha, we'll start with you. It was only last week that the Pentagon was saying they could not send these tanks, so what changed?NATASHA BERTRAND, CNN WHITE HOUSE REPORTER (on camera): Yes, Alisyn, it's been a really big 180 by the Biden administration. And we are told that really, this has been the product of discussions between U.S. and German officials about what would actually move the needle and make Germany willing to send their own tanks to Ukraine. Because if you'll recall, last week, we reported that there was this diplomatic standoff between Germany and the U.S. about how to get Germany to send those tanks. And one of the conditions was that the U.S. had to send its own Abrams tanks first. The Germans did not want to go at this alone and they wanted to form an international coalition. And now we're learning that the administration came to this kind of agreement with the Germans. President Biden, of course, denied that there was any kind of arm- twisting by Germany, but ultimately in calls with reporters earlier today, and in our sources tell us that there was an agreement that it was come to -- with the Germans to make this an international and collective effort. And what we're learning now, of course, is that it's going to take quite some time for those tanks to actually end up in Ukraine. They require a lot of training. But ultimately, the U.S. does not see this as something that could pose a significant escalation risk when it comes to crossing any red lines. And President Biden made that very clear in his remarks earlier today, emphasizing that this is not an offensive threat to Russia. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

CNN's chief congressional correspondent Manu Raju is on Capitol Hill. So, how is this new Pence twist factoring into the Republicans' work there in the House?MANU RAJU, CNN CHIEF CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT (on camera): Well, the Republicans had made what Joe Biden did, the mishandling of classified records, the ones that appeared at his home in Wilmington, Delaware, as well as his private office. They've made that the centerpiece of their new investigative agenda as they have now come to power here in the House issuing letter after letter. But the revelation that Mike Pence also had those records has upended that effort. But now, the discussion about trying to investigate what happened there and trying to get a handle on why so many officials and former officials, Donald Trump, Mike Pence, and Joe Biden have these classified records. It's all leading to concerns among members of Congress that perhaps they need to step in and do more. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. MICHAEL WALTZ, (R-FL): We need to understand from -- you know, what were the documents? What did they contain? Was there any damage? That's something we have to look at across the board. REP.

That's going to be part of his investigation going forward.Other members, including in the Senate side, say that there perhaps needs to be actual legislation to look at toughening up standards on how classified records are dealt with. That's one question that Dick Durbin, the Senate Judiciary Committee chairman told me he had going forward. But there is just as a big question about why this happened, what were in those documents. And just in a matter of moments, we do expect the Director of National Intelligence, Avril Haines, to be behind closed doors with the Senate Intelligence Committee. And the leaders of that committee, guys, telling me that they plan to ask her a lot of questions about this. We'll see if she has some answers, guys",

I don't think it'll surprise you too much. You'll see some partisanship at play here where 89 percent of Republicans say yes, this is a serious problem. But look at Democrats.

A slim majority of Americans, Victor, 52 percent say that Donald Trump has done something illegal. That's a majority of Americans that believe that. Only 37 percent say that of Biden.And again, when you look at it by party, I think it's instructive. Because look here, only 8 percent of Democrats think Biden's done something illegal, obviously 79 percent of them think Trump has. But when you go down to Republicans, a quarter of Republicans, 25 percent, they think Donald Trump has done something illegal here, a quarter of his fellow Republicans. So, he -- Trump is suffering more broadly here than his -- Biden when looks through the lens of how egregious something went on here.

And that happened last Friday.So when you take that into account that the DA is looking at pursuing charges pretty quickly, and they're already talking to the family, I think a lot of what you see here happening will mitigate violent protests. Quite naturally, when the film comes out, tensions will be high. I hear is quite disturbing. And so we'll have to navigate that when that occurs.
