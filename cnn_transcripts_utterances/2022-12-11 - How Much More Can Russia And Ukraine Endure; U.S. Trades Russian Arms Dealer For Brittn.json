The bizarre fact of the matter is that there is no sense whatsoever that you are in the capital of a country that is fighting the biggest war in the 21st century. Right up until September 21st, where I was there by coincidence, when Putin took everyone by surprise by announcing mobilization.Until that moment, the war was completely invisible. And I should deliberately say because in the first week of the war when I was also there, there was little bit of a wave of public patriotism. And that very quickly disappeared. And the state of the Russian people is essentially those who -- a small minority are in despair and for them the world has collapsed. They've run for the exits, about half a million based on estimates have actually gone to now, you know, to -- wherever they can get to basically. But for the vast majority, they're either too poor to leave or too rich to leave. They have too much to lose. And the predominant mood among the elite members, the sort of upper middle class and government connected bureaucratic people, is sort of quiet despair and denial and basically they just don't want to know. ZAKARIA: Luke, what do you think happens? You mentioned that the Ukrainians are now going to push forward. But they are going to start getting to those parts of the Donbas, which are really -- I don't want to say pro-Russian, but have mixed feelings. This is why Russia was able to take them in 2014 so easily, as with Crimea. These are largely Russian speaking. Many of those people thought the Ukrainian government discriminated against them by not allowing them to speak Russian and things like that. \"The New York Times\" had a good story on one of these towns where -- which has just been liberated where sort of half the people were glad they were liberated and half the people are apprehensive about it.",

Some have left, some have stayed. But I think, I would say, it's interesting, listening to Owen about the mood in Moscow, the mood in Kyiv now is pretty vehement. So many people have died. So much has been lost. You know, almost 500 kids have been killed. Cities like Mariupol have been pulverized by Russian aviation, by Russian bombs. And there is no mood for dealing, for negotiations with Putin. They're determined to liberate everything, so there including those areas we're talking about in the east. And it also includes Crimea. And I think it's going to be a really interesting point in this war where we sooner or later, let's say Ukraine comes close to Crimea, is that a point that Washington, whether it's the Biden administration or some other administration, phones up Zelenskyy and says, look, time to stop and settle? Or because the Ukrainians I think are determined to carry on. And it's a question actually for the West, how far does the West back Ukraine? Way up until the end or somewhere short of that?",

And I think the other sort of bad thing from a U.S. perspective is the sort of precedent that it sets. Because essentially Vladimir Putin believes that anything can be traded.Any deal can be made. That actually when the West talks about human rights, it's just kind of hypocritical, and it's all about real politic and power and money. And this confirms the sort of rather cynical Russian view that, you know, we have something, you have something, we trade. And of course, it sets a precedent for Ukraine. Because Putin would like nothing better than to sit down with Joe Biden, decide the future of Ukraine, decide the future of Eastern and Central Europe as if it's the 19th century, with a map where they kind of draw, with pelted pens, you have this, I have this.

Now the great irony of this war is that Putin has consolidated Ukraine as a state, as a nation, as a people, and those differences have largely melted away.And the other mistake he thought was that he thought the West would do not much like last time. And in fact what we've seen is an unprecedented anti-Kremlin coalition. And despite their calculation that we would flee, that we the West would flee, it's been pretty robust. And I think we've seen a restoration of American leadership under the Biden administration. We've seen the Germans do unthinkable things like abandon pacifism. We've seen NATO bolstered by the Swedes and Finns joining. The U.K. more friendly towards its European neighbors. I mean it's been a real kind of turning point in history.

Well, this week, they're among 25 arrested in connection to a plot to overthrow the German government and, get this, establish a monarchy with that aforementioned noble at the helm. They're suspected to be part of a movement known as the Reichsburger or citizens of the Reich. The group believes the German's state today is illegitimate. That it's actually a corporation setup by allied governments after the Second World War. The Reichsburger is believed to have more than 20,000 followers around the country. Is this a January 6th moment for Germany?Joining me now is Peter Neumann, professor of security studies at King's College, London, and an expert on global terror. Peter, let me ask you first to just explain to us who are these people and what do they believe? You know, when we see something like this in Germany, we imagine that this is, you know, the sort of neo-Nazis or the -- you know, this feels to me almost like \"Babylon Berlin,\" that wonderful series is about to -- at least in the English speaking world is about to have season four preview in a week. It feels like the preview began one week early. PETER NEUMANN, SECURITY STUDIES PROFESSOR, KING'S COLLEGE LONDON: Yes. I think the closest comparison in an American context is probably the sovereign citizens. They're basically espousing similar beliefs. They don't believe the state really exists or it is legitimate. They produce their own passports. They refuse to pay taxes. They produce their own driving licenses. And their narrative is that basically they want to go back to monarchy. Monarchy ceased to exist in Germany in 1918. They want to re-create that system, because they say that every German state that has come into existence, including, by the way, the third Reich, the Nazi government, was illegitimate. So, they are far-right because they are against democracy. They do want to create an authoritarian government. But they are not neatly fitting into the neo-Nazi category, because they want to create a different kind of authoritarian government.",

Are we governed by a global cabal, secretive cabal? And that's what the Reichsburger are playing into. And to some extent Germany has experienced that like a lot of other countries. The difference to America, I guess, is that the center right, the mainstream center right in Germany is not supporting this.

They are people who are hoarding arms in the basements of their houses. They are waiting for day X, just like the QAnon movement in America, and they've all been watching the storming of the Capitol. And that's what they were trying to re-create. They were essentially trying to do the same thing. Now, I don't believe for one second they would have succeeded.
