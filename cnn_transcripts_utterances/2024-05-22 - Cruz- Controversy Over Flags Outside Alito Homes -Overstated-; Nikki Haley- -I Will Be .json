Also, another flag with links to January 6th, another house, but it's the same Supreme Court Justice that's under fire tonight. New reporting, on what was seen, at Justice Alito's home that has critics calling for him to recuse himself.

Nikki Haley has not spoken publicly, since she suspended her race, for the White House, more than two months ago. But tonight, in her first remarks since that, she made clear who shall be voting for in November, given it won't be her name on the ballot.

The statistics are amazing. 2 percent of all births in America come from IVF. There are over 8 million babies that have been born through IVF. And you look at the state of things, right now. I think there are a lot of people, who are confused and scared that they feel that IVF is in jeopardy. And following the Alabama Supreme Court decision, a lot of people were very worried about that. In the Senate, to the best of my knowledge, all 100 senators support IVF. I'm not aware of a single senator who doesn't. And so, what happened, I approached Kate -- Katie Britt, Senator from Alabama. And I said, look, let's team up, and let's draft a very simple bill that creates strong federal protections that makes clear, no state can ban IVF. And that's what we did. We made it as a condition of Medicaid funding. That's a frequent method of imposing a federal restriction on the states. It's long upheld in the courts.",

For example, it's how Congress used -- Congress used Highway funds, to get states to raise the drinking age to 21. And it was the same thing. It was a condition, you don't get your Highway funds unless you raise the age. And they did so. It's how Congress, you go back in the 70s, used Highway funds, also, to lower the speed limit to 55. They ended up allowing it to raise again. But if you look at congressional authority, the Spending Clause is a component of the Constitution that Congress has unquestioned authority, to attach conditions to federal spending. And so, we attached it to Medicaid. There is no state in the union, that's going to turn down the massive amount of money for Medicaid.

But it was when I went back to look at pictures and videos from January 6th that you see this flag everywhere. It's known as the Pine Tree Flag. It does date back to the Revolutionary War. But look, there were a lot of symbols at January 6, right? There was a lot of people holding the Christian flag. There was a lot of people holding crosses. It doesn't necessarily mean that all of those -- that all of that imagery, in some way, condones what happened, and that there is a symbol of what happened on that day. But specifically, this flag, the Pine Tree Flag, from what I've been able to understand in the past few hours, even speaking to some pastors, across the country, is this flag has kind of come back into circulation, very clearly, over the past decade or so, less almost about January 6th, but more a representation of Christian nationalism, of this idea, which is very popular, among a lot of people, who stormed the Capitol on January 6th, that Christianity should take precedence over all other religions in this country.",
