But I would say it is a little bit troubling, that literally a day before this bank collapsed, they were busy giving out bonuses, and that some of the leadership in that bank sold a lot of shares in the recent past. So that's something for the FBI and the Justice Department to take a look at.The other point that I would make is, back in 2018, the banking industry wanted a major reform in the Dodd-Frank bill, which came about after the 2008 crash. And what they wanted was to remove many, many banks, who were being under strong supervision, because the level at that point was $50 billion. Any bank over $50 billion would be under stress tests and strong supervision to make sure that we didn't have another crisis, and what the banking folks came in, and they said, no, no, no, that's too onerous. It's costing us too much money to have to go through all of these regulatory processes. Let's raise that level to $250 billion, meaning only the very, very largest banks. And the irony of this whole thing is that Silicon Valley Bank, the leader that, Mr. Becker came here to Washington to lobby to remove himself, his bank, from this kind of supervision. So, you have the absurdity of them wanting to get out of supervision and then a number of years later, they come up before Congress asking to get bailed out.",

You know, you may remember, Anderson, that when I was running for President in the 2020 campaign, I'd made a trip from Detroit, Michigan with a busload of folks in the Midwest to Windsor, Ontario, in order to buy insulin. These were diabetics.And it was unbelievable. In Windsor, Ontario, they paid one-tenth of the price that they were paying in the United States for the same exact product. And I think over the years, more and more of us, the American people, some of us in Congress have been saying to the pharmaceutical industry in general, and to the manufacturers of insulin, stop ripping off the American people. One out of five people, diabetics in this country who use insulin are rationing insulin, because they can't afford the price. Now, the very good news is that within the last couple of weeks, Eli Lilly has announced a 70 percent reduction in their price. Novo Nordisk, another major manufacturer also announced a major reduction in their prices. And the third company, Sanofi, I think -- I think will also announce some reduction. This is a great victory to the American people. We're going to be hearing on this issue and what we're going to say to these guys, you tell us, you tell us how we are going to make sure that every person in this country who needs insulin is going to get it at a cost that they can afford.   But it's not just insulin. We're going to start looking at these are companies that are manufacturing cancer drugs, which in some cases cost hundreds of thousands of dollars, all of these companies make huge profits.

However, they understand that when anxiety is high, as you've lookacross the market right now, nobody thinks Bank of America is in big trouble. Nobody thinks JPMorgan is in big trouble right now. All of their stocks got lit up today as well. That is a problem and has the potential to become a bigger problem even if Credit Suisse doesn't have -- US banks don't have major exposure to Credit Suisse. And so what I think officials are watching very closely is the emergency actions that they took on Sunday night in response to what was happening in the US are those still taking hold like they appear to be doing over the 48 hours immediately afterwards? They feel like yes, there is some stability there at this point in time and then trying to ensure that they continue to get the message out that A., Credit Suisse is not an us problem to some degree.

I think most people I talk to think the Fed is going to be cautious when it next meets. I don't think anyone thinks there will be a 50-basis-point interest rate hike next week on March 22nd. But at the same time, we still have inflation that is too hot, you know, consumer inflation is running triple what the Fed would like to see. So it still does need to tamp down in inflation. One interesting part of this is the tightening of the banking sector stress and the banking sector may actually act a little bit as tightening in the economy.

First, this drone was operating dozens of miles away from the nearest land. And so when it was forced to go down, it went down in a part of the Black Sea that probably is four or five thousand feet at depth. That is going to make it difficult, perhaps exceedingly difficult for anyone to recover this drone. Second, it probably didn't crash and hit the water in a single piece. There may be a wide debris field. It may span several miles, again at those extreme depths.

Look, we don't want to see one of these incidents escalate. It is our goal to see to it that everyone is operating responsibly.

And it seems to me, reading between the lines, that they believe there were very, very serious offenses committed there. So the question politically is, is it wise to bring this case first?

Now, there's nuance there because the plaintiffs are asking this judge practically to yank this medication off the shelves. But the nuance is that in the questions that the judge asked the plaintiffs, it was clear that the judge really is not ready. He was skeptical about doing this in an aggressive one swoop. Now, Anderson, the other very interesting thing is that one of the questions that this judge asked the plaintiffs, he asked them, \"Okay, so point to one case in which a judge has done exactly what you're asking me to do.\" And Anderson, they didn't have an answer.
