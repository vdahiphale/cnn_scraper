      "sentences": "It's 2 pm here in London. I'm Max Foster. This is \"Connect the World\". A starvation disease and the wintercold is threatening the survival of some 2 million displaced civilians in Gaza. This as the death toll reaches approximately 20,000. Israel wants to broker another deal to release these hostages from Gaza. But Hamas says no negotiations will go ahead without a \"Full cessation of aggression\". The U.S. Supreme Court could decide the fate of Donald Trump in the 2024 election. But the Former President is asking it to stay out of the dispute over whether he's immune from prosecution. A toxic mix of disease and hunger, that's how the World Health Organization's Director General is describing conditions in Gaza two and a half months into Israel's war with Hamas. He's warning that Gaza is experiencing soaring rates of infectious disease outbreaks that could be lethal for malnourished children. Making matters even worse, the lack of medical care for the sick and the wounded, W.H.O. official says a team that recently toured Northern Gaza saw no functioning hospitals left there. The W.H.O. worker who led the team described what he calls unbearable scenes of seriously injured children or people rather, in a church crying out in pain and pleading for water. The humanitarian catastrophe is happening as the Palestinian Health Ministry in Ramallah says approximately 20,000 people have been killed in the war in Gaza. A number the U.N. Relief Coordinator caused a tragic and shameful master. The World Food Program says half of Gaza's population is now starving, and the aid coming in isn't coming fast enough. CNN's Jomana Karadsheh reports. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JOMANA KARADSHEH, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): For weeks this is what we've seen of the war on Gaza. Israel's brutal military might pound neighborhoods into dust. In Central Gaza and Nuseirat whole blocks reduced to rubble, seemingly deserted unlivable. But there's also this, the near surreal scenes this week in Nuseirat, the hustle and bustle of the street market. It's the story of every war where life doesn't stop. It goes on for those trying to survive. But Gaza is like no other place. It's where more than 2 million are crammed into this tiny strip of land that now looks like it's been bombed back into ages past where those who've lost everything have nowhere left but the streets. That's where Minus (ph) is building a clay oven, hoping people would pay him a shekel or two to use it, he says maybe then he'll have enough to buy his children cheese or tomatoes. Our lives are a million years behind, we live in sewage, minus says, every time it rains, the sewage overflows. It's cold, there's no food, no water, no warm clothes. Most here have escaped the bombs only to be trapped in this misery. Disease and starvation the U.N.s warned may soon kill more than those bombs. Half the population it says are now starving, people going entire days without eating. Um Ahmed (ph) says she collects a bit of flour from here and there to bake bread for her children. We're all thrown into the streets she says, they said go to the south. We came to the south to die slowly. Human Rights Watch says Israel is using starvation as a weapon of war. It's a war crime Israel denies and calls it a lie. It accuses Hamas of stealing aid. In the wake of October 7th Israel's Defense Minister announced a siege of Gaza, \"No electricity, no fuel, everything closed until all hostages were returned\". Some aid and water delivery resumed but nowhere near enough. Much of the blockade remains in place, what Rights Groups call collective punishment. Sometimes the lucky ones find more than lentils and bread for the hungry mouth they have to feed. This mother uses a pair of jeans for her fire to boil some chicken wings and bones. I'm using clothes and cardboard to make fire and cook, she says, the situation is disastrous. But I need to find a way for my children were in the street because we have nowhere to shelter fleeing the bombs, scrounging for food. Now the people of Gaza desperately wait for the moment they can try once again to live. Jomana Karadsheh, CNN, London. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

      "sentences": "Yeah, especially when you consider the fact that over the last few days Max, we have been watching aflurry of activity not only the Israelis very much are engaging with a lot of seriousness and putting proposals on the table for Hamas to consider regarding the release of hostages and a pause in the fighting, the entry of aid, the release of Palestinian prisoners. But also yesterday, we had seen Ismail Haniyeh, the Head of Hamas traveled to Egypt to meet with Egyptian officials there who have been key mediators as well in these negotiations. And yet, this morning, Hamas effectively reaffirming the position that they have held for several weeks now, which is that they will not even engage in these negotiations until there is a pause in the fighting until Israel in their words, stops its aggression of the Gaza Strip. And so it appears that we are back to square one or perhaps even lower than that, because Hamas seems unwilling to engage in these talks. Israel had put on the table, a potential proposal that would have seen a week long pause in the fighting, the release of some 40 hostages in exchange for humanitarian aid to go in and the release of more heavy duty Palestinian prisoners than those who had been released in the previous rounds. And amid all of this, of course, we know that the United Nations is preparing to potentially vote on a resolution that could call for a suspension or a cessation of the hostilities in Gaza and also trying to establish perhaps a monitoring mechanism. There has been significant wrangling over the language of that resolution over the last few days. With the United States very much trying to get to a place where it can support this resolution, rather than abstaining or vetoing it in the way that they did just a few weeks ago, when they vetoed a resolution calling for an all-out ceasefire in Gaza. Amid all of this, of course, those who are suffering the most from all of this political wrangling and the lack of movement on these negotiations are Palestinian civilians. We just crossed the 20,000 mark of numbers of Palestinians who have been killed in Gaza. That's combatants and non-combatants. But if you're trying to get a sense of the scale of the civilian casualties in Gaza, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health 70 percent of those 20,000, or 70 of those 20,000 are women and children, just a staggering civilian death toll in Gaza.",

But in oftentimes, when they apply to certaincountry, those countries tend to ignore that resolution, if it's something that they don't agree with. So there's not a whole lot of enforcement power on these. Israel, of course, has a track record of dismissing actions taken by the United Nations, of course. So far, they haven't said exactly how they will react to this resolution. But it will be interesting to see and regardless, frankly, of whether or not Israel abides by the terms of this resolution. This will be a watermark a significant moments in this 70 plus day war, during which we have watched as international pressure has been slowly mounting and particularly in the last couple of weeks, as pressure from the United States has also been growing. And so I think the most significant aspect of this would be if the United States voted for a resolution that called for a suspension or a stop in the fighting that would certainly be a significant mile marker in the pressure that they have been bringing to bear on the Government of Israel.",

So while things have gotten a little bit more muted, certainly the danger is not over.
