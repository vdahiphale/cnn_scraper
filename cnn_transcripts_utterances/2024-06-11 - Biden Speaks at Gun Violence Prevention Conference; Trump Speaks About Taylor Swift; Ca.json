It's something that I've heard in conversations with Chinese folks. It's something that is on social media.But yet, at the same time, we are hearing these overtures from the Chinese government, from President Xi Jinping, to increase these educational exchanges between universities and colleges in the United States, like that one in Iowa, with China. In fact, Xi Jinping set a goal of 50,000 American students to come study here. So, at this point we'll have to see if what happened here today, this single incident, perhaps dampers that enthusiasm. Finally, Kate, as you mentioned, a lot of these images have been scrubbed from social media. In fact, we just saw a group of people here tonight in this park gathered around a phone who were learning about what happened for the first time, about 24 hours after it happened. It's been away from the headlines, censored from the headlines, until very recently, Kate.",

CNN is reporting also that Biden plans to draw a contrast with Donald Trump here, and he's expected to announce a new round of charges from the Justice Department following passage of the new federal gun law he signed in 2022.CNN's Arlette Saenz is at the White House. She's got much more on this. Arlette, this is another contrast, very clearly that Joe Biden wants to draw with Donald Trump. Why does the Biden campaign think this is going to resonate?",

      "sentences": "Well, Kate, the Biden campaign believes that tackling gun violence is an issue of importance to young voters, but also to voters in black and Latino communities. And so part of President Biden's goal today is trying to promote what his administration has done to try to tackle gun violence, including touting the bipartisan gun safety bill that he signed into law just two years ago.Biden, today, specifically will announce that the Justice Department has charged more than 500 defendants with violating gun trafficking and illegal straw purchasing provisions that were part of that gun safety legislation. He will be speaking to survivors of gun violence, as well as volunteers and activists at Everytown for Gun Safety's conference here in Washington, D.C. This is one of those groups that's really risen in prominence in the wake of mass shootings in this country. The president also is expected to tout the drop in violent crime. The FBI, yesterday, released some preliminary data that showed that violent crime in the first three months of the year is actually down 15 percent. If you take a look at the number of murders in the country in those three months, that's down by 26 percent. President Biden has praised this, saying its good news for American families, and also arguing that this isn't happening by accident, promoting his own legislative and executive actions relating to this. He said, quote, \"my administration is putting more cops on the beat, holding violent criminals accountable, and getting illegal guns off the street. And we are doing it in partnership with communities.\" He added, \"as a result, Americans are safer today than when I took office.\" So, part of what the Biden campaign and the White House are hoping the president can do today is really try to lay out the steps that he has taken to try to address issues relating to crime and also gun violence. It comes as he's not just looking to rally his own base on this, but you also have former President Donald Trump who has sought to rally Republicans around gun initiatives. He has vowed to undo many of the efforts that Biden has put into place while he's in office, while the Biden campaign argues that Trump would simply be beholden to the gun lobbies. So, both men, in their own ways, really trying to use gun issues as a way to rally their bases heading into November's election.",

So, asked about Taylor Swift for an upcoming book, Trump says, quote, \"I think she's very beautiful, actually, unusually beautiful.\" That's according to a forthcoming book from \"Variety\" co-editor in chief From Instituta. With us now, CNN political commentator and Democratic strategist Paul Begala, and CNN political commentator and Republican strategist Shermichael Singleton. And, Paul, there are people who look at that comment and note it's, you know, a little strange from a guy who's going to turn 78 later in the week, that maybe those are the types of things that he shouldn't be observing right there. But another way of looking at it is, for a guy who will say mean things about anybody, he seems to be really careful when it comes to Taylor Swift.",

And I was thinking, you know, maybe Oprah when Oprah went behind Barack Obama in 2007, 2008, everyone, Hillary Clinton's campaign had to be really careful, then John McCain's campaign had to be really careful. I can't really think of everyone else -- anyone else that would make a politician so nervous.",

And if you're a politician right now trying to win the election, which we know will be very close and you want to galvanize young people, you certainly don't want to anger them by attacking some of the individuals they look up to. And I think this is the case with Taylor Swift, who is an incredible songwriter. So, here's someone who galvanizes not only young liberals, John, but she also galvanizes young conservatives being a former country star who's now into pop music. So, there's an interesting dichotomy here that I think the former president is trying to thread the needle on.",

They are waiting for that to happen.I was looking at the calendar, Paul. I still can't wrap my arms around the fact that there is a general election presidential debate in like two weeks. And, yes, it is right here on CNN. And I'm not doing this to promote the debate, which is, I should note, right here on CNN. But it just shatters everything I know about presidential campaigns. And it strikes -- I covered George Bush in 2000, and he disappeared for days before the first debate for debate prep. And we learned later that he'd been preparing like a ton for months before. Should these candidates be deep into debate prep for what could be the most important presidential debate any of us have ever seen?",

If my old pal Ron Klain, the president's former chief of staff, is on that trip, that means they're doing debate prep on the plane. No one -- I've done this all my adult life. No one is better at debate prep than the president's former chief of staff, Ron Klain. But they do need to do some. And, by the way, so does Mr. Trump. And I know he doesn't like it. I shouldn't say this because debates are about expectations. Joe Biden is going to clock Donald Trump in that debate. Incumbents presidents rarely, rarely win the first debate because they're used to having their rings kissed, shall we say. But Mr. Trump has talent. He does. And he's great at these rallies. But he's never won a national presidential general election debate. He had two -- three against Hillary, two against Biden. In the polling, in a one or two point race, he consistently loses those debates by nine to 12 points. So, honest, earnest, free advice to Mr. Trump, you need to hunker down and prepare for this, Mr. Trump. And I promise you Joe Biden is.",

Its stitches together the base. where Joe Biden frankly needs a lot of help, and these suburban college-educated swing voters, where Biden is surprisingly strong. Once a Republican stronghold. Biden is really strong with those suburban, college- educated voters. So, it's a great issue for Biden to be touting. And Mr. Trump, by the way, who can no longer even own a gun because he's a felon, he went to the NRA and he said, I will be your loyal friend and fearless champion.

They've all been farm workers. The first two people mainly had eye symptoms, you know, conjunctivitis, pink eye, those types of symptoms. This third person, which is getting -- getting a lot of attention is a farm worker in Michigan who had symptoms that were more respiratory. So, the big question I think for a lot of people was, is this related -- is this sort of more severe in some ways or is it -- is it not? Is it something else? And what they think at this point is that it's -- doesn't necessarily appear to be more severe. It may be that they -- that the third person got infected in a different way. The first two people may have touched a surface, then touched their eyes, which is what often happens. This -- the third person, who's a farm worker in Michigan, may have actually inhaled some of the virus. So, that's worth paying attention to. What they have not seen, Kate, and this is a big thing that they look out for, is there evidence then that it spreads as a result of those respiratory symptoms to another human. Human to human spread. And so far at this point they have not seen that, but that's what they're looking for.",

But are there other ones as well? Because each time you get new mammals that are infected, especially ones that are closer and closer to humans, you may -- the virus may mutate into something that can more easily infect humans and they -- and could potentially spread among humans.But one of the big ways to figure this out is testing. And, Kate, we talked about this a lot during the pandemic, are we doing enough testing? And the answer right now with H5N1 is that we're not. If you test a lot of people, and you say, hey, there's a lot of people that are carrying the virus but they're not getting sick, that's an important message. It may mean that this is not as, you know, deadly or is making people as sick as we thought. Testing is the key to sort of get an idea of just how widespread this is.
