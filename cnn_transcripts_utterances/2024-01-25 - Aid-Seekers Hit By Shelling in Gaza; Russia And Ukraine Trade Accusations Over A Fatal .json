Tonight, horrific reports of casualties in Gazawhere shelling and gunfire struck people waiting for desperately-needed aid. We have the very latest for you. Russia and Ukraine trade accusations over a fatal military plane crash. We'll have more details on the two very different accounts of what has happened. Then gangs, gunmen and drug cartels, as terror grips the streets of Ecuador, even the Armed Forces live in fear. CNN's report inside Guayaquil coming up. But first this evening, Gaza's civil defense authorities are reporting catastrophic scenes in Gaza city, where they say civilians waiting for aid came under attack. They claim Israeli forces targeted people who had gathered to pick up bags of flour. The Hamas-run Health Ministry calls it a massacre, saying 20 people were killed, 150 others wounded. CNN has reached out to the IDF, and we are still waiting for a response. And this comes -- context imported here, comes a day after a video from the same location showed hundreds of people running in paddocks, some carrying boxes of aid, amid as you can see gunfire there. Well, the death toll is rising in southern Gaza as well. A U.N. agency is reporting persistent attacks on civilian sites in Khan Yunis. It says fighting is intensifying around hospitals and shelters for the displaced, with one of its own shelters coming under fire yesterday. We had the head of UNRWA, the representative of UNRWA yesterday on the show, you heard from him directly where we saw at least killing of 13 people -- 30 people -- 13 people dying there. Well, Israel says it is currently ruling out an Israeli aerial or artillery strike on the shelter. Well, as more families heads south to flee the fighting, Rafah is becoming dangerously overcrowded. The U.N. says the city is now housing more than 50 percent, 50 percent of Gaza's population. That's more than 1 million people, many living in tents, others sleeping on the streets. Our Ben Wedeman is following the developments tonight for us from Beirut. And Ben, let's start off on that attack in Gaza city. What are you hearing? What is the very latest?",

We don't know about any casualties yesterday, but certainly, today, what we saw were scenes of pandemonium in Al-Shifa Hospital where many of these people were taken today who had gone to the very same spot in the hopes of receiving aid. Now officials at the hospital that -- Shifa Hospital is also one place they went -- and also went to Al-Ahli Hospital. Doctors there are saying that they -- perhaps, the death toll will rise even further. But as you said, the Israeli military has yet to actually comment, CNN has reached out, but they are not saying anything about whether they were involved in this incident.

This notion that if there were a prisoner -- if the hostages were released, there would probably be a period on the extended period of ceasefire which could mean an end to the war, which could very much potentially bring down the war cabinet and Prime Minister Netanyahu as prime minister. We heard something from the families, those families of the hostages who were in the room when the Prime Minister -- when these comments were made. And they said, look, when we went into that room, we had to hand over our phones, and officials told us there will be a recording of the conversation made.

And, of course, today the investigative committee came out and that their preliminary findings also showed that the aircraft was taken down by a surface-to-air missile. Now, that's where the claims and counterclaims sort of set in. The Ukrainians have been blasting the Russians for various reasons. On the one hand saying, look, there's absolutely no evidence right now that the Russians have put forward that POWs were actually on that plane. In fact, the security service of this country, the SBU, they came forward and said their preliminary information, their intelligence shows that only five bodies were recovered from that plane. So unclear whether or not POWs were on that plane. But, of course, the Ukrainians do acknowledge that a swap of POWs was supposed to take place yesterday and that it was then subsequently canceled. Now, the Ukrainians also laying into the Russians for other reasons saying, look, the Russians taking those POWs that they have to in exchange means that they are responsible for the security and the safety of these POWs and the Russians should have notified the Ukrainians if they were going to take these POWs to Belgorod on an aircraft to make sure that the Ukrainians then obviously would shut off their air defense systems and ensure that the skies there are safe. The Ukrainians are saying that the Russians did not do that. And another element to that also is the fact or is a statement by the intelligence service of Ukraine saying that that specific plane that was taken down, the plane with that tail number was in the past used to ferry missiles to Belgorod, which were then used to shell a Ukrainian town specifically, Kharkiv. And so that they say that, in general, that plane was a legitimate target, Isa.",

In fact, we're still waiting for them to come clean on the crash of MH17 -- 17 10 years ago. So if for example, they wanted some scrutiny of that very crucial evidence, they could send it to an independent body, for example, France has very good expertise and we can learn more. The other thing a lot doesn't add up here, as Fred indicated. The other thing that happened yesterday, soon after the crash, was Margarita Simonyan, the former head of Russia Today, and a well-known Putin mouthpiece, she issued the names purportedly of these 65 POWs. Well, the problem there was that some of those names, in fact, many had been traded previously. And one more thing a little bit, I guess on the grizzlier side of the equation is when you look at the video of that crash site and photographs, there are very few human remains visible. I remember working the crash site of MH17. Of course, that was a far bigger number, 298. But there was a lot of human remains visible right afterwards. So again, a lot of things that don't add up right now.",

Oleksiy Goncharenko, who's the MP from here in Odessa, really came down on Zelenskyy hard, which is very unusual this time, saying that they have to provide more information. But to answer your question, yes, it's going to have a huge blow, especially on those families. That is a big number if there were 65 on board.

And then later, also admonished him again, you're interrupting your attorney while she's trying to speak to me. You know, but when Trump went up on the witness stand, he answered these questions briefly.

Girkin played a major role in Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014. He was also linked to the downing of Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 in July of that same year.

Daria Trepova was arrested following an explosion at a cafe in St. Petersburg that killed the blogger last April. Trepova's husband told independent Russian media that he's convinced she was set up.
