One that would free dozens of hostages in exchange for a week-long pause in the fighting. Donald Trump could be kicked off Colorado's ballot after that state supreme court rules the former president violated the U.S. Constitution's insurrectionist ban. Attacks against cargo ships in the Red Sea are forcing companies to find another route, potentially leading to long delays and higher prices.We begin this hour with new developments out of Israel, where we have learned officials are proposing a new deal to pause the fighting in Gaza in exchange for the release of 40 hostages held by Hamas. CNN political and foreign policy analyst Barack Ravid broke that news just hours ago, saying Israel has proposed a one-week ceasefire for the release of 40 hostages, including women, the elderly, and those in need of urgent care. Ravid says Qatari mediators are now taking that proposal to Hamas for its response. This news comes after Israel's president suggested his would be willing to agree to a new temporary truce with Hamas in exchange for more hostages. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

They even acknowledge right in the top of their opinion the magnitude and the weight of the questions that they are analyzing here. And here this court found that former President Trump should be disqualified from being on the ballot in that state because they say not only did he engage in an insurrection, but they believe that the 14th Amendment, which bars certain officials from holding office, if they engage in an insurrection, applies even to presidents.Now, a lower court oversaw a trial in this case. The lower court found that Trump engaged in an insurrection, but they said presidents are not specifically mentioned in that Section 3 of the 14th Amendment, so they said it didn't apply. But here the Supreme Court looking instead at the intent behind this amendment, looking at the overall objective of what they were trying to do when they were working on the language of this specific section. Now, the issue there is that the Trump campaign, the Trump team, they've made it clear. They're going to appeal this to the Supreme Court. This decision will likely be on pause until the Supreme Court weighs in one way or another. But this decision, which is largely based on intent and a larger objective, is likely headed to a Supreme Court that is dominated right now by originalists, textualists, judges who pride themselves on looking at the specific literal words in the Constitution. So, it may not be the most favorable environment for this Supreme Court of Colorado decision. But again, it's unclear if the Supreme Court will take this up. They likely will want to resolve this issue because otherwise you're going to have this hanging over all 50 states and undecided. And if the Supreme Court weighs in, that decision would be binding across the country. But the Trump team says they're going to appeal swiftly. And as soon as they do, this decision is on hold until the Supreme Court rules one way or another. Paula Reid, CNN. Washington. (END VIDEOCLIP)",

Many companies have said that they are actually pausing their operations in the Red Sea because of the threat of coming under fire by these Houthi militants.So, the U.S. and its allies now trying to find a way to respond that does not involve striking the Houthis directly, in Yemen, something that the U.S. has been trying to avoid over the last several weeks. And as a response to the attacks to date, the U.S. now says that they are going to be setting up an international coalition of maritime forces that will essentially be in the region and in the Red Sea, available to respond and help commercial vessels if they need it. Some of the vessels, or some of the ships, I should say, they will be escorting these commercial vessels if the situation warrants it. And, of course, we have also seen the U.S. shoot missiles and missiles into the Houthi region, down a number of the missiles and drones that the Houthis have launched targeting these commercial ships in recent weeks. But it remains unclear whether the Houthis are going to be deterred by this new maritime coalition. They have said that they are going to continue their attacks on these commercial vessels in solidarity, they say, with the Palestinians and in opposition to the Israelis. However, it's important to note that many of these ships that they have attacked, if not most of them, actually have no ties to Israel at all. And the U.S. says, that the Houthis have just been attacking these ships opportunistically, and they have been taking advantage, of course, of the U.S. and allied presence in the area. They want to try to bolster their international reputation and presence there, and they think they will be able to get attention by continuing to target these vessels. So, the U.S. facing a very big problem here, growing calls for them to strike the Houthis directly. But at this point, this maritime coalition, according to the Secretary of Defense, they say, is going to hopefully help ease the problem. Natasha Bertrand, CNN, at the Pentagon. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

What we've seen so far is that, especially on the container side, the owners and operators have been very vocal to redirect their volume outside of Suez Canal and south of the Cape of Africa. The main effect this has on shipping is, of course, adding the sailing distance of that extra voyage. And depending a bit on where the cargoes come from and where they're headed to, you can say the average distance added from that voyage could be between 30 to maybe 50, 60, or even up towards 100% added distance. So, of course, that takes a long time.The main cost component when it comes to moving this cargo the further way around Africa is, naturally, fuel costs in the first point. And if you start to account for that for a typical container headed from the Far East into Europe, for instance, you quickly get to around maybe five, six, to eight, nice percent of added cost, just purely from the fuel. So, that's a very, very big cost component. And then you get the secondary effects here, which ties up a lot of capacity in the shipping fleet and therefore tightens the shipping markets.

And until someone can guarantee the safety of the seafarers on board these vessels, I think they will be looking to reroute this around Africa instead. So that's the big question here.

But for a typical container, which perhaps is the most interesting to look at in terms of costs for the end consumer, we're seeing somewhere between probably six percent and eight percent direct costs on fuel. And then because of the insecurity of how this will happen and how available freight will be, we've already started to see the freight rates and box rates for this type of transit to increase quite a bit. Over the weekend, we had the Far East and Mediterranean rates up roughly 20 percent. And that is set to continue as long as there is risk to disruption here, which I think is the main driver from the logistics provider side now.That's on the container side. I think it's also very interesting to mention that, of course, there are other types of cargo that pass through the canal. For the time being, it has been the containers that have been leading the move outside of Suez. But you've also had some of the main tanker companies and also the energy companies saying that they want to redirect their ships outside of the Suez Canal. And that, of course, has a direct impact on the cost of oil or oil products and the security of such into, for instance, Europe. And that in itself could also add additional costs to this. And just comparing to the average cost of crude oil today, we see that the direct implications on the current freight markets would maybe be $2 to $3 added cost, talking about landed cost into Europe.",

But the casualty figures, as you mentioned, have been revised only slightly upwards since we last spoke.And this relatively small death toll may be a reflection of the remoteness of the quake zone as well. As we've been saying, it's mostly rural, sometimes mountainous and sparsely populated, despite the epicenter being only 100 kilometres or so from the provincial capital city of Gansu. The authorities say their focus is now shifting to post-disaster relief, including treating the injured. Remember, nearly 1,000 people did get injured in this quake, but also resettling the tens of thousands of people displaced in this quake as their homes and farms have been destroyed or severely damaged. Now, this process is no easy task, doing the best of time. But given the harsh winter condition, with overnight temperatures reaching as low as minus 20 degrees Celsius, it's obviously having an impact on this as well. And it may also take some convincing for many of them to leave their homes and farms, because most of them are farmers, and some of them have told state media they're concerned not just about their own safety and health, but also the fate of their crops and livestock.

That means an eruption along a crack that can be several miles long, rather than on a volcanic cone.Now, one of the good things about these eruptions is that actually, usually they don't spew ash into the atmosphere very high, which can, and has, in the past, disrupted air travel internationally. Of course, in a place like Iceland that can have massive effect. PLEITGEN (voice-over): Previous eruptions in Iceland had last weeks or even months. In the town of Grindavik, the earthquake damage is clear. The lava may follow.",
