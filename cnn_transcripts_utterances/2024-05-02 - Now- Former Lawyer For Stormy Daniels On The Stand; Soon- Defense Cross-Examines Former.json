But the defense is going to get their chance to cross-examine him soon, which I was told could take up most of the day. And Davidson is saying he was kind of exasperated as Stormy Daniels was appearing on Jimmy Kimmel because he was learning about it all from Michael Cohen and text messages who was in pants on fire mode, as he described it, as all this was coming out.They were continuing to text until early in the morning on January 31. Was the prosecution trying to get out with Michael Cohen's kind of state of chaos, and whatever you'd call the pants on fire description, as all of this information is coming out publicly?",

You know, so as people have said, one of the things the prosecution needs to do is to bring out some of the negative aspects of their witnesses. Michael Cohen has got a lot of baggage. This is all going to come out eventually.And as the prosecutor, you want to bring that out first. You don't want the jury to have the sense that you're trying to hide it, that you're, you know, covering up for this witness who you are calling to the witness stand. So, you want to bring all of this out in advance to take the sting out of it. And the other thing is -- I'm just listening to this, and it almost feels like the direct could be the cross. But the pants on fire, the panic, this is all just more eventually will be used as part of the paring down Michael Cohen's credibility as a witness.",

And, Paula Reid, what -- you know, we both covered the Trump White House.This is January 2018. Donald Trump has been president for a year at this point. He's delivering his first State of the Union address. It just shows that all of this was going on well into when Donald Trump was in the White House when David Pecker was showing up to the White House.

And you don't always have the most adept actors executing things for then-president, now former president.And what we know here is they're about to completely lose control of Stormy Daniels in about a month from this, this time. She's going to do an interview with Anderson Cooper and admit that yes, all these denials were complete lies. But this chaos has often been a defense against conspiracy, right, that it was so chaotic, that there was no -- there was no way that these people could execute right, design, and execute some sort of vast conspiracy among themselves. So, I think you're going to see the defense attorneys when they have a crack at Davidson, really seize on that, and also the apparent absence of their client in any of these conversations.",

Those are the words that Michael Cohen said to Davidson, according to Davidson, when Cohen was in Davidson's view, and all -- in an all-out frenzy to try to keep the Stormy Daniels' story quiet. The prosecution has finished its direct examination of this attorney, Keith Davidson, and Trump's team is going to begin their cross-examination after this brief -- break that they're in right now.

The second thing I think they're going to try to get a cross is this is all just a bunch of lying. Liars lying to each other about sex.

Josh Steinglass was smart to try to get this out at the end of direct to, you know, maybe take the edge off the cross a little bit. These are the types of lawyer witnesses that personify why the general public has a bad taste in his mouth for lawyers. I mean for this man to get on there and play linguistic gymnastics, saying, well, it really wasn't hush money, it was a consideration, that's like calling a robbery and involuntary loan. I mean, it's all going to come down to believability and credibility. Put yourself in the -- in the place of one of those jurors. And at the end of this, Mr. Blanche is going to get up and he's going to say, look, you know, it comes down to who do you believe of what has the ring of truth? And let's say you took your 5-year-old daughter down to the skating park and there's little island in the middle. And there's a big sign that says no skating today, thin ice. But Michael Cohen's on the island, and Davidson's on the island and they're saying, come on over, the ice is fine. Would you put your daughter on that thin ice on the good word of Michael Cohen? And that's the problem here. There's these -- Cohen particularly is a polluted source. And so far, I heard somebody say all roads lead to Donald Trump. No, all roads lead to Cohen. Cohen is unhinged. He's erratic. He's calling and crying on Davidson's shoulder one day about not getting a job in D.C. and then telling him you don't know who you're effing with.
