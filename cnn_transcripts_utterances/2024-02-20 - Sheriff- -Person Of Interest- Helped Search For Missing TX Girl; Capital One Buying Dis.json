The local sheriff says a man who originally helped search for her is now a \"person of interest\" in her disappearance.Audrii Cunningham vanished on her way to the school bus stop on Thursday. Authorities say a 42-year-old family friend took Audrii to the bus stop -- or was supposed to take her to the bus stop that day, and that was the last time that anyone saw her.

And that Cunningham actually, at the home where she lives, that McDougal lives in a trailer behind the home. And so he says that McDougal is the last person to have seen Cunningham. Now, we should make clear that McDougal has not been charged in connection with her disappearance. He is in custody on an unrelated aggravated assault with a deadly weapons charge. And we've been trying to find an attorney that represents him or family to seek comments, and we have not been successful -- Brianna?",

Capitol One says the deal could close as early as this year.Let's bring in CNN's business correspondent, Vanessa Yurkevich. So, Vanessa, will cardholders feel anything different because of this merger? VANESSA YURKEVICH, CNN BUSINESS &amp; POLITICS CORRESPONDENT: Not just yet. But we heard from Capital One and Discover this morning in a conference call and they said that they were making this deal for three key reasons. Capital One is about to acquire 300 million more customers and an international foothold. Discover card is widely accepted internationally because some of the lower merchant fees that they offer. Also merchant fees are key here because Capital One only provides the credit card. They don't do the processing. Discover does do the processing. And they get all of those merchant fees. So Capital One, with this buying of Discover, is going to get a lot more revenue. And third, it's important to note that the credit card field is not that diverse right now. And now that you have two big juggernauts coming together, it's going to be a lot more competition. They believe that this is ultimately good for shareholders. But, Boris, ultimately, the FTC, they have to approve this deal and that could take some time. Capital One optimistic that this deal will close at the end of this year, maybe early next year. But government regulation, they're going to be the ones to really indicate whether or not this deal goes through -- Boris?",

And that's something we've been talking about is adding a lot of material to the stratosphere that was never there before.All of the sort of the mass of material that we put into space doesn't all just stay there. And when it is de-orbited, it basically acts and same way that a meteoroid does. WEIR (voice-over): With special high-flying jets, a team from NOAA recently discovered that 10 percent of the particles in the stratosphere contain bits of rocket and satellite metal. And in the next few decades, it could be 50 percent, matching the amount created naturally by meteorites. Scientists worry that this could eventually alter earth's climate. So this summer, Japan and NASA aim to launch the world's first biodegradable satellite, made mostly from wood. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

And they have asked other countries now, authorities in other countries to provide information that might be pertinent to the case.Now what we know is that Ana Maria was renting an apartment on the street behind me since early January. And she recently tried to extend that another month until March. Around the time that she went missing was when that someone spraypainted black over the security cameras at the door, the front door just down the street and inside near the elevators, according to the building superintendent talking to CNN. Her brother told CNN that Ana was going to take a train trip to Barcelona with a friend on February 5th, but she never showed up at the Madrid station. So a missing persons report was filed later that day. And the police report has information about her, that she stands four feet, eight inches tall. She's thin and she requires medication. Those posters have been going up around the city. Her Swedish friend said that around the time that Ana went missing, she sent a text message that you just mentioned, Boris. And it says that Ana says she had met someone wonderful and that she was going to his country home near Madrid a few hours later and was going to spend a weekend, would call when she came back. She said she had met the man the day before when he approached her when she was out walking on the streets. She said it was an amazing connection. Now, the brother and the Swedish friend both told CNN independently they reached out to her husband. The couple are from south Florida and they have a computer services business there. But they said the husband said he was in Serbia. Now police searched the apartment early last week under a court order, according to three sources to CNN. But, Boris, there are a lot more questions in this case right now than there are answers.",
