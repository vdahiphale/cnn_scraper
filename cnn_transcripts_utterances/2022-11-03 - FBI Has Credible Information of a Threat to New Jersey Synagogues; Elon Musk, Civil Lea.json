We've actually can put it up for our viewers.This was tweeted actually just in the last 30 minutes or so by FBI saying that the agency has received credible information of a broad threat to synagogues in New Jersey. The FBI then goes on to ask at this time that people take all security precautions to protect their community, also facilities. And then the FBI wraps up by writing: We will share more information as soon as we can. Stay alert in case of emergency. Call police. But the FBI not elaborating on what exactly is behind this threat. As you can imagine, the FBI and its intelligence analysts certainly receive just countless sort of threats that they have to go through. So certainly, this would lead us to conclude that they at least have some solid information here to issue this really broad alert right now for people to remain alert. Again, we are trying to find out exactly what's behind this alert that was issued by FBI agents in New Jersey -- Bianna, Victor.",

Elon through a colleague of his, who is a friend of his, reached out. And so, it really did come from the Twitter side.And it moved very quickly within 24 hours. We were all on a Zoom conversation. We ended up sort of engaging in a conversation. Many of our groups, mine included, had already began conversations with advertisers or been engaging and pushing advertisers to both hold Twitter to a set of principles that they were going to continue to advertise, and to continue to maybe build energy around a potential boycott if some of the changes that we've been hearing about and some of the stories that were bubbling up from inside of Twitter headquarters were actually true.",

Actually, it was Elon Musk who, you know, very early yesterday morning tweeted out that he had had this meeting, tweeted out what was agreed by the groups and him.And now that this is out there, in his own words, time will tell. Word are one thing, actions are another. What I will be clear about is what we addressed on that call is just the tip of the iceberg in terms of the issues at Twitter, in terms of the challenges. And holding off to big changes until the election is very much about harm reduction. It's about making sure that there are not these swift issues inside of a platform that has problems even if they don't make any changes. And so, what we are sort of very clear about is that there are a lot of issues to deal with, with this platform. This kind of singular leader who shoots from the hip and talks about changes that he's going to make without oftentimes the kind of transparency around those decisions. And sometimes not really sharing thoughtfulness about how it's going to impact a whole range of people, as well as a whole set of systems that are impacted by Twitter. So, we are paying close attention, and we are continuing to be in conversation with advertisers about the path forward.",

You had the Russian governor -- Russian-imposed governor of Kherson speaking to a propagandist there -- Russian TV propagandist -- saying that there was the likelihood, very likelihood that the Russian forces were going to move east across the river, out of the city, essentially.Residents of the city saw today that the Russian flag had gone down from the main administrative building. They saw as well that all the Russian checkpoints in the city had gone. CNN spoke with a resident in the city who said, no, it's different, there are changes here. The checkpoints are gone. But what Ukrainian officials are saying is, hold on. We're seeing Russian -- the Russians fortify positions but also the Ukrainians are saying that we think there are Russian soldiers inside the city dressed in civilian clothes. And it wouldn't be the first time in this war, if one side duped the other about what was happening. Ukraine's lightning offensive in the north here, just a few months ago, came about essentially because they spun a story that they were going to attack in the south and then attacked in the north, instead. So, I think everyone's wary of being sucked into a trap here and residents also saying that they are seeing Russian forces dug in on the outskirts of the city, as well. So, a lot of caution, a lot of skepticism and no one really knows what Putin has in mind. I think what is generalcy is they're losing ground there. It's not a question of if they're going to lose it, it seems, but how they're going to manage or stage manage the fight as they pull out, not to seem like a loss, but maybe to score some kind of victory through trickery, essentially.",
