So, John Kelly was Donald Trump's longest serving chief of staff. The retired marine general has spoken out about his old boss before, frankly, several times.

He was praising Xi Jinping, the dictator in China. And I think it's very consistent with his praise of Vladimir Putin, of Xi. And you know, no matter how many times Trump has been told you cannot say these things. Remember, that's what John Kelly told Donald Trump when he was his top advisor. He said, sir, you cannot praise Hitler. You are the leader of the United States. What did Trump do? He continued to do that. And I think that we, you know, when somebody tells you who they are in this fashion, I think it's very important.

I voted for George Bush Sr. It's something, and then I have voted on the other side as well, but I regard myself down the middle. It is extremely challenging. And quite frankly, it is the time for all of us in the military to speak up about the danger that Trump is unfit to be the commander-in- chief and that he is an absolute danger to our country.

If only because politically it would seem to be a terrible idea.To your point about the generals, I would just like to underscore that in my reporting for \"The Divider,\" it's not just the former chairman, Mark Milley, and John Kelly who believe these things. In my reporting, I interviewed many very senior, very senior current and former military officials who had this direct personal experience with Donald Trump and had many of the same views that both General Kelly and General Milley have been reported to have. I think that's very important to point out. These were apolitical career national security people who dedicated their lives to serving the American public. It was some of the most shocking reporting I've ever done, Laura, to hear people talk like this at their own shock at the commander in chief. There's one revealing anecdote that is in the Atlantic piece that was also in our book from the former vice chair of the joint chiefs during Trump's tenure, in which he's trying to explain to Trump why we don't want to have a military parade in Washington the kind that Trump wanted to have. And he says, I grew up in Portugal when it was a military dictatorship. And I'm trying -- he's trying to get across to Donald Trump, this isn't what democracies do. This is what dictators do. And again, it's just not just words of John Kelly. It's a lot - - it's the experience of the most senior national security officials who served when Trump was president.",

Her name, Vanessa Guillen who was killed by a fellow soldier at Fort Hood in Texas back in 2020.Now you remember this case. Unbelievably tragic. And of course, this was all before attempting to go back on the promise that he found when he found out about the funeral's cost. I mean, Trump was overheard saying apparently, it doesn't cost 60,000 bucks to bury an effing Mexican, unquote. I mean, just hearing and reading those words. It's unimaginable that we're talking about a former president of the United States and a member of the military. Trump turned a parent to his chief of staff, Mark Meadows, and he issued an order. Don't pay it. Now the Trump campaign, again, calling that story an outrageous lie. Well, it is indeed an outrageous allegation. But top aides, Mark Meadows and Kash Patel, well, they also denied this story.

I want America to know he was elected to the office and then the hell broke loose as we know Hitler now.So it was the process of election that Hitler was elected. I am one additional comment I heard your previous guest that and of General Kelly. I pay tribute to him and him being a Gold Star father is an amazing, amazing sacrifice and honor that General Kelly and his family has offered not only by serving but by that sacrifice. Is this, that all flag officers take the oath to defend the Constitution and United States, our nation, and our democracy. And that oath does not exhaust when they become not active duty, when they retire the uniform. They still remain faithful to that oath to defend the United States. So General Kelly is performing that obligation. And I hope that other flag officers of this country are listening to General Kelly and will step forward in condemning Donald Trump and his plan to derail our democracy, turn it into a dictatorship on March 17th. This year, 2024, in Dayton, Ohio, he publicly announced that I will be a dictator on day one. There will be, if I am not elected, that will be end of democracy. I hope all America's flag officers are listening today and have listened to him by saying that that will be the end of democracy in the United States. The authoritarian playbook is on display and we need to, we still have two weeks to do something about it. I have continued to speak. I will continue to speak so that we can continue to make our men and women serving in uniform, their families, our veterans, and their families so that we make them proud, appreciate and admire their service.

You nailed it. You know, Trump usually goes to Michigan and pulls out, you know, Kid Rock. But those of us who were born and raised in the area, we all know that Kid Rock is just doing cosplay. And that Eminem is actually a real product of the area and of the city of which he speaks and or he represents. And he also doesn't use his platform very often in the political spectrum. So, when he does speak like this, it does have impact in Michigan specifically, but also nationally. Remember, he's still a very popular figure.

And they aren't really of the city and of the element of the working-class people that you think of when you think of the area. That's not Eminem. That's not who he represents. That's not where he's come from. And so, we know that in the area and he's drawn attention to a part of the conversation that I think missing with a lot of people is that it's the artist's impact on what a Trump presidency could see -- could be. You know, that's what I thought in terms of how he was endorsing the vice president and speaking specifically about retribution for how you speak. You're talking about him using his rap platform to attack President Trump. Well, he's talking as an artist. Artists should not be afraid to speak out particularly against elected officials.
