Now, to be clear, they very much believe that this is going to be a really close race that likely will come down to the margins in just a number of states that are so critical in these battleground areas. That is why we are seeing the vice president come back to campaign in Wisconsin, even though she was last here on Wednesday night.But what's been interesting, Laura, is hearing the Harris campaign talk a little bullishly about what they have been seeing in the early voting data and particularly the people they say only made up their minds on who to vote for in about the last week or so. And one of the things that they are pointing to again is the range of offensive and incendiary rhetoric that we've heard in recent days from the former president and some of his surrogates. Now, at this rally, I got the chance to talk to a number of the voters here. of course, yes, this was a Kamala Harris rally, so it's no surprise that you would expect most of the people here to be at least interested in her, if not, have already voted for her. But a number of them, I noticed, actually pointed specifically to things that they read in the news and saw in the news coming from that Madison Square Garden rally that you referenced, including that comedian's comments about people in Puerto Rico. And I just thought I'd leave you, Laura, with this one anecdote. I spoke with one man, a 44-year-old man named Eric, who says he has a big Irish Catholic family. He himself is a lifelong Democrat. And he said, look, I have a number of uncles who are Donald Trump supporters, but a number of them have actually told him that this time around, they simply can't support Donald Trump. He says he doesn't know exactly the reason why. He assumes that a part of the reason has to do with some of this divisive rhetoric that we're hearing from the Donald Trump campaign. The thing about next week is we're going to see whether this is just the story of one family or whether there are going to be many other families that actually are encountering this kind of a shift and who they actually want to support because of some of these headlines coming out of the Donald Trump campaign.",

But I'm really glad you played that montage earlier, but it has been quite a week, and I think for most voters at this juncture of a campaign, it is what they consider to be the silly season where both campaigns, and I think you summed it up very well, latching on to what something else that the other campaign has said or done. And really at this moment, if you're undecided, and I think there are a few, maybe three to 5% of people out there, if you're undecided in this race, you're really -- it's really a gut check time for them. And to me, it's more about what is the future, what does the future look like for my family, do I like what has been going on the last four years. And I think that's the overriding problem for the Harris campaign that consistently, in polling, it shows that 70% of the country thinks we're on the wrong track, and then the two top issues, the economy and cost of living along with immigration, Donald Trump leads typically by double digits in those polling.",

And another Republican who has endorsed Harris, Joe Walsh, he thinks that Trump's comments have been taken out of context, that he was actually making a point about Cheney's war stance.Walsh said on X, and I'm quoting here about Trump's quote, saying, \"The stuff he says is bad enough that we don't have to lie about it.\" What are your thoughts on that?",

You don't have to go to the extent of saying you're going to point nine barrels at someone and shoot at them.And I think, to me, when you say things like that, I think, one, it's un-presidential, two, I want to be very clear about this, Donald Trump has sat in the Oval Office where he has had national security people tell him that his words matter and that when he says things, they're -- they actually sometimes incite violence and that actually leads to real-world consequences in our communities. So, I don't take Donald Trump's statements lightly at any point because he knows that what he's doing will eventually lead to putting targets on the people's backs that he calls enemies. And look, he has been calling for military tribunals on to Liz Cheney. So, none of this, to me, is hyperbole, and I think we need to take this very seriously.",

He knows you pull those people out of the country, you're going to crush the economy, you're going to reduce our tax revenues, and you're going to increase the burden on social security.

He wins all seven battleground states, and he exceeds 300 electoral votes.Now, a lot of my friends say, well, you know, the polls have underestimated Donald Trump twice.

And so, if the polls are off like they were in 2022, what happens here? Well, then Kamala Harris sweeps all of the important battleground states.

So, that was a long time after the election. That was four days after the election. But in 2022, in the Senate race in Pennsylvania, the race was actually projected on Wednesday, early morning, at 12 a.m. Now, what was the difference between the two of those years? Well, first off, the race for president in 2020 was considerably closer than the race for Senate. The margin was one point in 2020 for president for Senate in 2022. It was five points. But more than that, what took so long? It was the great amount of mail ballots and Pennsylvania wasn't used to counting all those mail ballots. The number of mail ballots will be lower this time around, most likely. And Pennsylvania has become a little bit better.
