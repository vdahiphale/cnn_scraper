Tonight on LAURA COATES LIVE.Okay, so if we're being honest, we knew this day was coming, right? I mean, either the Supreme Court did not want this day to come. They're probably still recovering a little bit from Bush v. Gore, and this seems to be the worst kind of deja vu. Maybe that's why after several hours behind closed doors talking today -- drum roll, please -- the Supreme Court said \"yes\" to the dress. They will decide whether Donald Trump, a former President of the United States, one who is trying to become the president yet again, can even actually be on a ballot after his role on January 6th. Well, which ballot? Well, this one concerns Colorado. But the Supreme Court knows that the floodgates, they're about to open. It has already been, and I can't believe it either, three years as of tomorrow, since this attack you're seeing right here on the screen. And while prosecutors have been dragged for taking so long to get the prosecutorial ball rolling, well, the court not at all known for lightning speed, well, now, they're wasting no time. Their oral arguments are set for February 8th. Donald Trump saying just a little while ago that he hopes the justices that he appointed will be -- I'll use his word -- fair. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

We've already seen that the justices, they may not be dancing in white suits in a trio, there are nine of them, but they have not always ruled the way that Trump wanted them to. You know this.The Supreme Court in 2022, remember they cleared the way for the IRS to release Trump's tax returns to a democratic-led House committee? The court also rejected a request from the former president to allow a special master to review about 100 documents marked \"classified\" that had been seized from Mar-a-Lago. Coming back to you now, and let's not forget, in December of 2020, the court threw out the Texas lawsuit contesting the 2020 election results in four battleground states. So, nothing is a foregone conclusion, not even keeping him off the Colorado ballot. Let's start now with Colorado Secretary of State Jena Griswold, who joins us now. Secretary, I'm so glad that you have joined us. We've been following this story for a very long time as, of course, you have. But now, the Supreme Court is wasting no time taking up this case. It actually could lead to some clarity, not just for your state, but for others around the country.

But to take a step back, I certified Trump to the ballot today because that's what the Colorado Supreme Court ordered in their decision.The Colorado Supreme Court stated Trump did engage in insurrection. He is responsible for many of the actions on January 6th. And because of his engagement in insurrection, he is disqualified from the Colorado ballot. But the court added on a caveat that if an appeal was filed, I was to place him on the ballot. You know, Donald Trump, his name is very likely to be printed on the ballots, just given the timeline. If the court were to order that he is not a qualified candidate, well, we have scenarios under Colorado law similar to that that have played out in the past, and we would not count the votes for him if he was a disqualified candidate.",

We send a mail ballot to every registered voter and then have weeks of early voting, unprecedented in-person voting access. We want to make sure eligible people can have their voice heard.And during the last presidential primary on the democratic side, two candidates actually dropped out during early voting, and we were not able to count the votes cast for those candidates because they are no longer eligible. They dropped out. They weren't candidates anymore. So, I think no matter what happens, uh, this will be a great election in Colorado, definitely a unique one, because it's not normal to have candidates for president who engage in insurrection and try to run for office again. COATES:  I mean, I think the words \"normal\" and \"unique\" are perhaps the most appropriate and yet misnomers of all. We're thinking about what's going on. We are going to be following this closely because this is so important. I think just having that flow chart and thinking about the if then and what the court may ultimately decide, this is a matter of extreme consequence. Secretary of State Griswold, thank you so much.",

It is a truncated process. It doesn't have the sort of discovery and ability to call witnesses and other stuff that you know -- that you normally think of in a trial. And, you know, I think it would be perfectly appropriate for the Supreme Court to say this process isn't enough for such a monumental decision, a new constitutional issue, one that requires a great deal of fact-finding.

An Alaska Airlines flight made an emergency landing tonight. A passenger telling CNN, get this, a window blew out in flight, an actual window. The plane was headed from Portland, Oregon to Ontario, California. Let's bring in CNN's Pete Muntean on the phone. Pete, we are looking at an image right now of a window gone from an airplane. What is happening? PETE MUNTEAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT (via telephone):  All you can say is wow, Laura. I mean, this is actually more than a window. This is part of a fuselage in the 26th row there. A, B, and C are the seats there, 26 A, B, and C on this 737 MAX 9. Incredible but no one was seated in the window seat there. That is typically a spot on the 737 MAX 9 that could have an emergency exit if the plane is configured for a certain seating capacity. In this case, it did not. It had a plug there. And what is apparent, at least from FlightAware and also from passengers, is that this flight got up to about 16,000 feet, so only about halfway up to its final cruising altitude of 33,000 feet. About a few minutes into the flight, only seven minutes into the flight, this issue apparently happened. And the crew, after leaving Portland, Oregon, they were bound for Ontario in Southern California, made an immediate emergency return back to Portland, an emergency dissent, got the airplane under control, and made a successful emergency landing, although you have to put yourself in the perspective of the passengers who are going to this terrifying moment. The oxygen masks came down. It sounds like there was even some close point pulled off of passengers. At least that's a conjecture that we're seeing online although that's still a bit unconfirmed. So, this was a really harrowing, an incredible scene. After we've seen all of these issues with the 737 MAX, not to mention the (INAUDIBLE) crashes in 2018 and 2019, issues abroad, there have been manufacturer defects with the MAX, real fits and starts here. So, you have to think what is going through the minds of Boeing executives right now with this breaking story. The good news is the flight crew did everything they were trained to do and got this plane on the ground without any issue. Nobody hurt on board, 171 passengers and six members of the crew, Laura.",

In that book, he says that Harvey Weinstein and Epstein were friends and that they had a falling out after Weinstein became too aggressive with one of Epstein's favorites. You know, Weinstein, of course, was not -- he was not charged with anything in this case, but he did -- he was convicted in both New York and L.A. for unrelated sex crimes. He's serving a prison sentence for that. I mean, another name that came up in this was David Copperfield. He allegedly attended a dinner at Epstein's house, and a woman who had worked for Epstein had given a sworn testimony where she said she was talking to Copperfield. She said, he questioned me if I was aware that girls were getting paid to find other girls. One of Giuffre's lawyers had asked another woman who had worked for Epstein, a separate woman, had asked her if she was aware of Copperfield getting tickets for Epstein to bring young girls to the show and to meet him backstage, but that woman had asserted her Fifth Amendment and refused to answer any questions.
