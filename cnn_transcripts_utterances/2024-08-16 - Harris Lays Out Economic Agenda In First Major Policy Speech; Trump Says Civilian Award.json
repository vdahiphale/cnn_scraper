The contrast with Donald Trump, as both are preparing privately for the debate stage. The former President says the nation's highest civilian honor is much better than the nation's highest military honor. A Gold Star father is my source, tonight, to respond. And Georgia's Secretary of State, who refused to find Trump those 11,000 votes, in 2020, is now being sued by a fellow Republican, who will only settle if he endorses a false conspiracy theory. I'm Kaitlan Collins. And this is THE SOURCE. Voters keep telling anyone and everyone who will listen, it is the number one issue. It's what they care about the most. It's what they want to hear about the most. And that is why we heard two back-to-back speeches, on the economy, this week, from the candidates who want to run this country.

BIDEN, FORMER SR. COMMUNICATIONS AIDE, BIDEN WHITE HOUSE: Yes, first, I couldn't stop laughing, when you were talking about President Trump doing another economy speech. It's like it's infrastructure week, again, and we're just going to -- maybe this time, we'll actually talk about the economy. Look, I think what was important about what the Vice President did today was a couple things. First of all, she's somebody, who really lives this, right, unlike maybe President Biden, who is a great person. But she has family, and she has friends, who are going through this, right now. People who have kids, who are in school, her -- and she has family members, who are in elementary school. And she's got people who are trying to start their businesses, and buy their first homes.

She talked about the middle-class, which is not something, frankly, having worked for, for a while, that she talked about a lot, talking about the middle-class. She named -- this is Republicans talking about this. She named the prices. She talked about the price of beef in the grocery store, right? That's something I think people were looking for President Biden to do, to hear him talk about the problems they were facing. And sometimes, people just want to feel acknowledged. And it's one of the things, frankly, Donald Trump was able to do pretty well, for the last few cycles, is he talked about the pain people were feeling, and acknowledged that.

I saw Cheerios for breakfast yesterday. I bought them, this morning. I bought them, yesterday. And when I was at that grocery store, three or four times, I said, we're paying that much now for this product? That's what every American is going through, every day, whether it's a grocery store, a movie theater that they go, or don't go to, a restaurant they go or don't go to. And this is an opportunity, for Trump, if he can stay on message and say, This is the Biden-Harris agenda. This is the result of their administration. They're still an administration together. But he has to be focused on it. And the challenge that the Trump campaign has, right now, is you have the faction that, I think, very smartly, Susie Wiles and Chris LaCivita, especially want Trump to stay focused on message.

It will be one of the biggest moments, if not the biggest moment of Vice President Harris' political career, accepting the nomination of her party, formally.This will happen at the United Center, where most of the primetime events are going to be here, as you're seeing on this map. Preparations have been underway, for months. And they are essentially inside and out, when it comes to security. Officials have put up protective fencing, closed off streets, not just as they normally would, but also in anticipation of protest over the war in Gaza. My source, tonight, is Democratic congressman, Dan Goldman, of New York. Congressman, it's great to have you. Because obviously, as we're looking big picture, at this convention, Cook County, Illinois, which is where Chicago is, it's home to the largest Palestinian population, in the United States. And I wonder, are you worried that protest over the unhappiness about how the Biden-Harris administration has handled this war in Gaza, its position on Israel, that that could disrupt the convention next week. REP. DAN GOLDMAN (D-NY): I don't think it will. I certainly hope it won't. I think that there are some folks, on the extreme left, who would like for us to abandon our ally, Israel. And while we all recognize that what is happening in Gaza is just devastating and awful to see, we have to stand by our democratic ally, Israel. And make sure that Israel has a right to exist, and that the Palestinians can have self-determination for themselves. And that's not with a terrorist organization, who is leading them. And I think that's the message that the party will be promoting, next week, on what is a hot-button issue, to be sure, but hopefully not one that disrupts the convention.",

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JACKI PICK, PLAINTIFF, SUED GEORGIA'S SECRETARY OF STATE, BRAD RAFFENSPERGER: So, I'm Jacki Pick, and I'm here as a volunteer.

He wrote later, in his book, that the video was deceptively sliced and edited.Now, he did not name her in that book. But she now says that she was defamed by him, because of that. CNN's Legal Analyst, Joey Jackson, is here to talk about this. Most fascinating part of this story is that The New York Times says that Miss Pick's attorneys let it be known that if he wanted to settle the case, he would first have to say publicly that her presentation of the video was not deceptive.

Defamation is a false statement which is injurious, injures your reputation, and causes you damage. And so, lot of problems with the lawsuit. First of all, we know that it was filed in Texas, and it was dismissed. Was refiled in Georgia, of course. But that was a jurisdictional issue. I'm talking about on the merits, right? Because you can make the argument that this was a claim of opinion. An opinion, of course, is protected. The other thing is that she's not even named, with regard to the book. Her name is not even noted. Now, technically, legally, right? You have this doctrine called, of and concerning. So if I say something like, you know, I was on TV the other night, and it was 9 o'clock, and it was CNN. We know who we're speaking about. But I think that she's got to prove a lot of things, since she wasn't specifically depicted. How were you impugned? How, you know, what ended up happening to you?
