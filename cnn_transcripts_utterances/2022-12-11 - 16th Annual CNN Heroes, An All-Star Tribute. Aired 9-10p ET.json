So, in 2022, which is the year we are in, it takes a courageous kind of parent to advise their kid, or kids, to watch the news so they know what's going on in the world. And at the heart of that guidance is to encourage curiosity. So, when he was 10 Sri Nihal Tammana turned on the TV and he saw a story about a waste disposal plant on fire. He wanted to know why.Well, a lithium ion battery that had been thrown out instead of recycled exploded. So Nihal began asking questions and learned that billions and billions of batteries are thrown away each year, hurting the environment and people. So he started collecting batteries in his New Jersey community, got other young volunteers involved, and his non-profit, Recycle My Battery, was born, and it has not stopped growing. Now all this work was possible because this now 13-year-old was curious. When we asked questions, when we seek answers, we can make our one and only blue planet a better place. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Three billion batteries are being thrown away each year in the United States and 15 billion batteries are being thrown away worldwide. Batteries contain many toxic chemicals. These chemical can leak out of the battery and they can cause contamination of the water and soil.Recycle My Battery is a non-profit organization to provide free battery bins to people and educate everybody about the importance of recycling used batteries. People call me Battery Boy. Whoa, a 40-volt battery? We have placed more than 400-plus battery recycling bins all around the nation. We place the bins in schools, libraries, offices, places like the YMCA, et cetera. There are so many cell phones in here. If the battery bin is full, we do the inspection so they don't catch fire. A lot of batteries today. At the recycling facility, chemicals are then extracted from the battery safely, and then they use new batteries or other items. So today I'm going to be talking to you guys about why it's important to recycle batteries properly. Education is the key. Kids are our future. We go to schools and talk to them. I want all you guys to start your own initiatives and do something to help make a change. We have kids from all around the country and all around the world helping us out. Thank you so much for your kind donation, yes. This year's Diwali event, we basically set up our own booth, and we were able to educate lots of people. Make sure to bring it and recycle it properly for a better tomorrow. Our organization has recycled over 200,000 plus batteries in the last three years. I want to protect the environment. I want to educate everybody on earth and make sure that zero batteries end up in landfills. Hope to see you in Recycle My Battery. I want to continue working so we can make an even bigger impact.

And she encountered every kind of anti-discrimination you can possibly imagine.But that proverb pushed her toward a life of generosity. She and her mother co-founded the Tiyya Foundation, which connects refugees, immigrants, and asylum seekers to critical services and a supportive community. When visiting new families, they often fed Meymuna with pride filled dishes from their homelands. This gave her a creative idea to support her foundation by opening a restaurant with the displaced could come out of the shadows, showcase their favorite dishes from home, and be celebrated. Flavors From Afar has been named one of Los Angeles' 100 best. I know I've already got my reservation. Through all her work, Meymuna shows us something beautiful, simple, and true, that we need one another in order to thrive.

It really instills a sense of rootedness, feeling connected to your cultural upbringing. It's beautiful. My family were refugees from Ethiopia. When we came to the U.S., I was three and a half. There was a lot of beauty, but at the same time, there were shadows. Antiblackness, anti-immigrant, anti-Muslim. From a very young age, I was aware that I'm different. Oh, this is your first event.

On the plane, a woman, a total stranger, seated next to them, handed the sisters an envelope, making them promise not to open it until they were off the plane. A note on the envelope read, \"To the girls of Yugoslavia, I'm so sorry that the bombing of your country has caused your family any problems. I hope your stay in America will be a safe and happy one for you. Welcome to America. Please use this to help you here. A friend from the plane, Tracy.\" Inside the envelope they were surprised to find a pair of dangly earrings and $100 in cash. That money helped feed the sisters for an entire summer while they scrape by, staying with their brother. And Tracy's message of welcome meant so much to them as they built their new lives.

After struggling with a long illness, an elderly woman named Alice needed help walking her beloved dog, Savanna. Carie Broecker did that for years until Alice was given two weeks left to live. Alice worried about what would happen to the dog who had brought her so much purpose, joy and companionship. Carie leaned into her and told her that she would find Savanna a good home. That promise gave Alice peace of mind in her final days and it gave Carie her life's work. Realizing the desperate need of elderly dog owners, Carie cofounded Peace of Mind Rescue. Since 2009, they've helped nearly 2,000 senior citizens continue to care for their Savannas, their Sports, and their Daisies, and rescued more than 3,000 senior dogs from shelters. For all creatures great and small, to reach that powerful point in life when there's more gray hairs, wrinkles, and achy joints is a true gift. To promise others that this experience with dignity and grace take profound love. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
