This assertion is not only misleading, they're just plain wrong. On Page 215, if you had a chance, I know it's long -- it's a thick document -- on Page 215 in the report of the special counsel, found the exact opposite. Here's what he wrote: There is in fact a shortage of evidence that I willfully retained classified materials related to Afghanistan. On Page 12, the special counsel also wrote for another document, the decision to decline criminal charges was straightforward. The evidence suggests that Mr. Biden did not willfully retain these documents, the evidence also said, I did not willfully retain these documents. In addition, I know there's some attention paid to some language and report about my recollection of events. There's even reference that I don't remember when my son died. How the hell dare he raise that. Frankly, when I was asked the question, I thought to myself, it wasn't any of their damn business. Let me tell you something. Some of you have commented, I wear since the day he died, every single day, the rosary he got from Our Lady of -- Every Memorial Day, we hold a service remembering him, attended by friends and family and the people who loved him. I don't need anyone. I don't need anyone to remind me when he passed away, when he passed away. The simple truth is, I sat for five -- over two days of events, going back 40 years, at the same time I was managing a national crisis. Their task was to make a decision about whether to move forward with charges in this case, that's their decision to make, that's the counsel's decision to make, that's his job, and they decided not to move forward. For any extraneous commentary, they don't know what they're talking about. It has no place in this report. The bottom line is, the matter is now closed. I'm going to continue what I've always focused on, my job of being president of the United States of America. Thank you and I'll take some questions.",

He did contradict elements of the special counsel's report, and that undoubtedly will go on. And then he was quite angry, not just that the release or the characterizations of the special counsel, but of what some of the reporters were asking him. It is a fact that this is a problem for the president. Anderson, the most damaging things that can happen in politics are things that reinforce a meme that's out there that is hurting you. And the central meme that is hurting the president is this issue of age, it's a big barrier. People don't give him credit for what he's done. They blame him for everything that happens, and a lot of it has to do with their feelings about his age. So it's not wise to say to a reporter, that's your interpretation. It's not.

So, you know, he took on directly one of the -- kind of pieces, the editorializing that Hur did that was getting traction, the suggestion that he didn't remember the year that his son died. I thought he took that on really effectively. He showed a lot of very genuine emotion. I worked for him for a very long time. There is no doubt that everything about what he was saying there and feeling there is very real. And so he -- I thought he took that on directly, which was effective.

So, you know, the more he's out showcasing what he's fighting for, what he's achieved. And again, that contrast with Donald Trump. I mean, we sort of in this conversation, we've sort of lost a little bit some of the biggest news from this report today, which was you know, the special counsel talking about the very clear differences between the way Donald Trump essentially obstructed the investigation into his own handling of classified documents, and, you know, willfully mishandled them versus what Biden did, what he said was much more about, essentially unintentional moving of these documents.

This comes with a lot of backdrop and a lot of concerns. And it's not just one moment in the report either; also in the last week, he has referenced dead European leaders who haven't been alive since the 90s, confusing them with current or almost current leaders.

Well, you can't just hide because that's -- we're not in a normal political media atmosphere. You have -- voters want a fight. Voters want to say, you come at me and you talk about my son. I mean, I remember when my son died, I'm going to tell you something. And so will it be the thing that folks decide in November, whether or not Donald Trump and Joe Biden on age? Probably not because their age actually cancels them out. It's who was going to stand up for me? Who is going to fight? There were moments that when he mixed up Mexico and the president of Egypt, but I will argue in his remarks, that young voters, the thing that they were listening to was what he said about Gaza, and that he was -- he went as far as I have ever heard him say, to without saying the word ceasefire, he said, I want an extended pause on hostages. That's what young people are actually looking at, not whether or not he mixed up the name of the president. They want to know, what are your actual policies, and I'd be curious to see what the polling shows if they get out there with this message, if it gets more traction. His age isn't going to change, so he has to take it on straight ahead. You can do it with little comedy the way he did it with the Fox reporter, talking about, you know, my biggest memory loss was that I even let you speak because we know that antagonistic behavior. It might not work for all voters, but he can't hide on this. COLLINS: Doug, is that the case?

Well, I heard was he mentioned the rosary from Our Lady of -- and then he didn't name the church because he got stuck in a moment there. It reminds me very much of, in 1994, in the fall going to see Frank Sinatra in concert at Merriweather Post, not far from here and one minute \"Come Fly With Me\" was amazing. A few minutes later, he could barely remember the words from \"My Way.\" And what did we remember? That he couldn't remember the words to \"My Way.\" This is going to be a recurring problem for Biden. And ultimately, the Biden White House right now is saying three things.

Where have they been all this time? When they studied constitutional law, there was something they learned about the Electoral College. I doubt that they've forgotten about it. But to listen to the argument, you'd think they have. The fact is that the court is engaged in sort of selective remembering and selective forgetting. They seem to have forgotten that the way our Constitution is structured under Article II, it is the states that basically run even the election for president. And it is true, as the chief justice pointed out, that the thrust of the 14th Amendment was to give the federal government more power and the states less. But it didn't change the basic structure of who decides who gets on the ballot. Now, if I just take a step back, let me just say, what Judge Luttig and I wrote back in August of last year was that Donald Trump is constitutionally disqualified by the most democracy protecting provision of the Constitution. It's there to prevent someone who swears to support the Constitution and then mounts an insurrection against it to prevent that person from coming back into power. We said that under that provision, Donald Trump is disqualified. Nothing the Supreme Court decides in this case is likely to contradict that. They're likely to say that the way Colorado did it at this stage, when they are simply deciding who runs for the primary election, that is not permissible. But they're simply kicking the can down the road, because when people argue that he is disqualified by the Constitution, either at the stage of the general election, or when Congress meets in January of 2025 to count the electoral votes, this problem will rise again and the court will not have avoided chaos. It will simply have postponed it.",

I mean, if you really -- if you want to get to the heart of what I think strikes a lot of people as wrong with that proceeding, it's not that they're all well versed about Article 3, you know, Section 3 of the 14th Amendment. It's this idea of having a mini trial, of having a political report serve as evidence with no real rules of evidence. Having a sociologist come in and say, I know what Trump really meant. I mean, those are things that are kind of bizarre due process challenges.But if the Supreme Court goes on that, if they say, we don't like the trial, then they keep the door open for every state to have its own trial and to get an assessment by the Supreme Court eventually. I think they're looking -- or Roberts, I think, is looking for a kind of a foundational procedural thing that can shut all of this litigation down. And what was interesting to me, the one that had a lot of traction, is the idea of whether or not this part of the 14th Amendment even applies to the president. And remember, the Colorado lower court said, I think he's an insurrectionist, but it doesn't apply to him. And that takes us --",
