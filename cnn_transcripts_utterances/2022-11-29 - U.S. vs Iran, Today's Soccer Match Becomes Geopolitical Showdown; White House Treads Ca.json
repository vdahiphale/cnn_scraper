I mean, just a few weeks ago we heard from an opposition T.V. news channel based in London saying that three of its journalists had been informed by London's metropolitan police that there was a serious, credible threat and an imminent threat against them and their families by Iranian agents in the U.K. So, there's a lot of concern, Don, in the past week.

And so now, the White House is very invested in making sure that things don't fall apart at the last minute.

If the two sides cannot reach agreement soon, industry officials have estimated that a strike could cost the economy more than $2 billion per day. Freight rail makes up a huge chunk of the American supply chain.A strike means food prices could skyrocket because rail is absolutely crucial in getting those products to consumers. Even gas prices could increase, given 300,000 barrels are moved daily by rail. And about 75 percent of all cars and trucks built in the U.S. are imported, or imported, I should say, here are moved by rail. That could mean a big shortage and massive price hikes. And if you're a commuter, you may be in trouble, too, as nearly 97 percent of rail, passenger rail used by Amtrak usually runs on freight lines. And on top of all of that, the holidays are right around the corner, meaning this strike could come during peak buying season.",

We've already built one in the industry, the ability to send money anywhere in the banking system.

We believe that we need renewables companies to make it. But, really -- and these -- all the operating companies of the world to figure how they're going to change how they buy power, what they use in their production capability. And our job is to educate people and do it. And that is amazing thing you see as a private sector is driving this. We did $200 billion of financing in 2021.

They followed them seven years. And at the end of each year gave a diet or food questionnaire to fill out and they did a cognitive test. And they found that those individuals that ate the most flavonoids, which was about 15 milligrams a day, one cup essentially of dark, leafy green vegetables versus 5 milligrams a day had a 32 percent slower rate of cognitive decline.
