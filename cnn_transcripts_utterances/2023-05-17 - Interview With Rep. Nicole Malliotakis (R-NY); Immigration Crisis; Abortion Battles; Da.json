They weren't concerned about the principals in the car, as they called them, Harry and Meghan, but also Doria Ragland there. They were more concerned about the public. But it was very traumatizing, obviously, for Meghan and Harry and Doria as all of this unfolded, particularly with Harry's background, where his mother died in almost exactly similar circumstances. But I spoke to Chris Sanchez on the phone. He was part of the security detail. He used to be with a Secret Service. He told me: \"I have never seen, experienced anything like this.

The chamber worked until 2:00 in the morning. They still have some 800 amendments to go through. In neighboring South -- North Carolina, rather, Republican lawmakers there voted to override the Democratic governor's veto of an abortion bill. This means, in North Carolina, most abortions after 12 weeks will now be illegal in that state. And on the national level, access to the widely used abortion pill mifepristone is once again on the line. A federal appeals court is hearing arguments over a nationwide ban on the medication, which, we should note, has been on the market for more than two decades and has been deemed safe and effective by the medical community.

Negotiations happened last night. McCarthy told me that he attended those meetings. He's expected to attend some of these meetings today. He has dispatched Congressman Garret Graves as his top negotiator on this issue. The White House has three top aides as well. Can they get to an agreement? The push is to try to get one by the -- by this weekend to have something in principle before they can actually draft legislative text.

Migrants along the border are telling our reporters there that they have, in effect, heard that message from agents, from the Biden administration that, if they enter illegally, they face penalties, including the possibility of being banned for five years.

Whether they are not specifically being encountered by CBP or they're going through other areas of the border undetected, we don't know the answer to that right now. But what I would say is, it's a combination of making sure that we give our Customs and Border Patrol agents the tools that they have asked for, certainly making sure that we are reinstating the message that the Biden administration has now said, that they are going to have to apply from their next country that is safe for them to apply for asylum, not skip six, seven countries to come to the U.S. border.",
