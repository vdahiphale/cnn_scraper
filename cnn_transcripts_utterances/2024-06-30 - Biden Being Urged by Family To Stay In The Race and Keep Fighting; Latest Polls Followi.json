I'm Alisyn Camerota in New York.And tonight we do have breaking news because we have new reporting that President Biden's family is encouraging the president to stay in the 2024 race, defying calls for him to step aside following his alarming performance on Thursday's -- in Thursday's debate. The family is meeting at Camp David tonight. This is part of a planned gathering. It was scheduled before the debate we're told and the message out of that meeting, at least for now, appears to support -- to be support for the president to continue pursuing a second presidential term. CNN's Priscilla Alvarez joins us now in Washington. Priscilla, what's your latest reporting at this hour?",

Of course, all of this, all of these conversations follow what has transpired since Thursday night's debate as there has been calls for the president to withdraw from the race, including editorial boards, as well as all corners of the Democratic Party. Now, the president himself has also been collecting data anecdotally and through public polling as he too tries to assess what folks are feeling across the party and that has been a deep concern. Panic has certainly set in, donors have been wracked with anxiety over the president's poor performance on Thursday night. Now the president, of course, did participate in a fundraising blitz over the weekend where he too conceded that Thursday night was not his best debate performance, but said that he would continue to fight and that he wanted to stay in the race, but the president and his campaign are certainly, Alisyn, under great scrutiny tonight. And what we know so far from the huddle that he had with his family at Camp David today is that he has the support of his family and their encouragement. Of course, that is no small thing. These are key players in President Biden's orbit and have been crucial in a lot of his decision-making when it comes to running for president.",

How about that he should be running for president, it was 37 percent pre-debate. It's now 28 percent. I have never seen numbers this bad for an incumbent president during my lifetime. I mean, that mental health to be president at just 27 percent, you might say, OK, you know, that's low, but a lot of people thought Biden was too old back in 2020.

That's not much different than what Joe Biden's margin was over Donald Trump four years ago. It's actually larger than the Hillary Clinton margin that she had over Donald Trump.But you may remember that first debate back in 2012 where Barack Obama just did horribly. Mitt Romney won that debate in the voters' minds by 42 points. But of course he didn't become president. Barack Obama was reelected. So I guess if you want to take a look on the one bright note is there is a history of someone losing the first debate as an incumbent and going on to win the presidency. And that was 12 years ago.",

Well, how about Jimmy Carter lost that one debate he took on Ronald Reagan at '80? George H.W. Bush lost that first debate to both Ross Perot and Bill Clinton.And in 2020, Donald Trump lost that first debate to Joe Biden. Well, guess what else? And they all lost. They all lost. So the question is for Joe Biden, can he defy history, create new history and being incumbent to trail going into that first debate and then won?

He has to show people he's up to doing what he did during the past four years and by the way, he's done a damn good job as president and he brought this country together. He didn't pick people against each other. He's fought for a lot of things and I don't want another Supreme Court that's going to do some of the horrific things that they've done. That's where we are.

It's probably going to allow at least some aspect of the January 6th prosecution against former president Trump to go forward.You know, beyond that, I think that's the real question and it's why I think it's taken the justices the better part of two months to get from the oral argument in April to tomorrow's decision day.",

The first question is, are there any circumstances in which a former president can claim categorical immunity from criminal prosecution. Of course, if the answer is no, then there's nothing else to say. But the way the oral argument went in April certainly sounded like there was a majority of justices who thought there were at least some contexts in which former presidents shouldn't be liable to criminal prosecution.So that gets us, Alisyn, to the second question which is, what are those contexts? And if the court is going to articulate a line, if the court is going to say the test is X, are they going to then apply it to the four different charges that Special Counsel Jack Smith has leveled against Trump in the January 6th indictment? You know, one of the most telling exchanges at the oral argument back in April was when Justice Amy Coney Barrett got Trump's lawyer to concede that at least three of the four charges probably don't implicate official acts. They were all private acts by candidate Trump. Is the court going to seize on that? So I'm looking for how the court tackles both of those questions. Is there any immunity? And if so, does it apply to any of the charges against Trump?",

Certainly not the New York state case because that has nothing to do with acts he took while president. And, you know, even the Florida case, Alisyn, involves for the most part acts President Trump took after leaving office. And no one seriously argues that former presidents are immune from stuff they do when they're no longer president.So really this is about the January 6th prosecution, first and foremost. And I think one of the other things we'll be looking for tomorrow is, does the court's decision open up the possibility that the trial can continue, that the trial can actually happen before election day? You know, the presiding judge in D.C., Judge Tanya Chutkan, has suggested she's going to need probably eight to 10 weeks from whenever the Supreme Court's decision comes down to getting ready for trial. Is that going to be longer if there's actually now a new test that she has to apply in the first instance to each of the charges in the indictment? So, you know, there's really a lot of different things swimming around this massively important decision that we expect sometime after 10:00 Eastern tomorrow.",

He is also of course a former CNN senior political analyst. John, always great to see you. Congrats on your recent win. And we will get to that in just a moment.

But President Biden has got a great record to run on and I think that is getting a little bit lost. People shouldn't be asked to deny what they saw. They should be asked to put it into context in the total record that's been put forward, and I think that's important. I think whatever happens, Democrats are going to be united, but it is more important that they are reaching out also in winning over Independents and even some Republicans. And for all the talk about President Biden's performance, there hasn't been nearly enough attention, I think on the over 30 lies Donald Trump told on the stakes of the race, on the stakes the race not only about democracy, but Trump's record on abortion rights and encroachments into basic reproductive freedom, on the affordability crisis, on the fact that he is praising dictators around the world.

These animals are dinosaurs.They've been on this Earth longer than there have been rings around Saturn. They are ancient and as I said, massive and they have the deepest blackest eyes. And when one of them gets up close to you, there is a moment of recognition. You're looking at it, it is looking at you, it sort of sizes you up and then it moves along. And it seems like it doesn't really care that you're there and its sharing the ocean with you. And for me, as my friend, Jason Washington said, it is a meditative experience. There is a deep presence, so it is something that I've been doing for a long time and I am really fortunate that I got this chance to talk about the plight that sharks are facing, and also the issue that some fishermen are facing when it comes to having to compete with sharks in order to make a living.",

It is almost like exposure therapy and its meditative because as these things are around you, your inclination is to be scared, for your heart rate to go up, you get anxious, but you have to sort of control your breathing and control what your body is doing.So it sort of teaches you specifically when you're free diving with sharks to be really calm under pressure and especially knowing that if you show any fear, these animals might have interest in you and you're supposed to control any sign of panic, that's an additional incentive to really enjoy the experience and take it in as it is happening.",
