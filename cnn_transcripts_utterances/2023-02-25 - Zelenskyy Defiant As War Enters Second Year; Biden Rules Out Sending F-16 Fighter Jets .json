Now, Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy was also a part of that G-7 meeting that was virtual where President Biden pledged his enduring support for Ukraine for as long as it takes and also announced that massive $2 billion security assistance package. Now, that package, Fred, contains a lot of things that Ukraine has already asked for especially when you talk about munition. Now it contains HIMARS rocket launchers as well as additional artillery shells, drones and counter drone activity. But one thing, of course, that wasn't on there was those fighter jets that we know President Zelenskyy has personally lobbied President Biden for including on Monday when Biden made that historic unprecedented trip to Ukraine.

I mean, really, I think most commonsensical, straight thinking people in the world, if you look it say ok, nations are built with this idea of sovereignty, other people don't get to come in and invade you. And that's precisely what Russia did unprovoked into Ukraine. So that much -- that basis for all of this is certainly true.As to whether or not Putin will run out of something -- will power, you know, ammunition, men that it wants to send into the meat grinder -- I would be surprised if Putin found a way just to say ok, no, this is a big mistake or I've gone too far or we don't have enough resources. This is one of the significant problems with this is where does Putin go from here. I mean if he somehow gives up and surrenders, that's going to have negative implications for him back in Russia. But he doesn't win, that will too. And it looks like he's not going to win certainly not in the short and the midterm.

They want to be, you know, the primary super power economically, militarily, you know, in the next 50 years in the future.But by the same token, they share a certain ideology with Russia and that is democracies worldwide are a threat to them because China is an authoritarian nation. So how is China going to play some sort of neutral moderating position in this when it's pretty clear they're coming down on Russia side? So clearly that helps Russia but China has already been warned by the United States and by the west, you shouldn't be giving them weapons or that's going to be a bad thing.

It's trying to use its growing economic influence to, you know, reach out to nations that are not in as good a situation economically and try to help them. It can benefit from a relationship with Ukraine but I think more importantly, Fred, geopolitically China -- if it's going to have the future it wants to have it has to have really good economic relations with the west, with the E.U., with the United States and other developed countries.A relationship with Russia at this point, those are mutually exclusive. You can't have both of those things.

But it absolutely does has potential to widen the controversy that we've seen in light of that February 3rd derailment.Let's start in Texas in Harris County, the most populated state -- rather county in the state, county seat of course being Houston. Lina Hidalgo (ph), the chief executive there says that she first learned that 2 million gallons of contaminated firefighting water were as being shipped to her state on the news last week. She added that she later learned that the shipments had in fact arrived the week before. So she's concerned there obviously, nothing at this point indicating that the material is not being disposed of properly, according to officials there on the ground, or that there is any sort of nefarious reason why it's being selected but. But to her it just doesn't seem right. Again, this coming from Lina Hidalgo. Officials in Wayne County, Michigan -- Detroit there being the county seat -- insisting they were not notified about this contaminated soil that was shipped to a licensed facility in their community. We have heard as recently as yesterday from Ohio officials that some 4,800 cubic yards of contaminated soil have been removed there from East Palestine, Ohio. The Congresswoman Debbie Dingell saying that she was not notified or given the heads up that this was being disposed of in the state of Michigan. And like Texas, county officials there in Wayne County saying that they have no reason to believe that this was done improperly but they say that it highlights disconnects. We have heard time and time again about the lack of information, not just among members of the community there but now folks in Michigan and folks in Texas concerned that they are not being told about how the disposal process is going on when it comes to some of this hazardous material. We are currently reaching to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to see what next actions could potentially come when it comes to the shipment of some of the hazardous materials that have been removed from the site, already over three weeks ago, Fred.",

I say it's a surprise because you kind of forget where we are in the calendar. But this makes a whole lot of sense. We're talking about the 2024 presidential race.

At that point, people were unsure whether Donald Trump was a serious candidate or just kind of a, you know, amusing distraction. And he had a very pugnacious, belligerent performance including a very memorable kind of take down of Megyn Kelly when she recited all of his misogynistic comments over the years and that was part of what allowed him to take off in that race. So this could be another important moment in the Republican field. Look, Ron DeSantis has the same excuse George W. Bush did in 1999. He can delay his announcement until after he finishes his legislative session. And I don't think many of the other potential candidates are looking to spend one more day in the cross hairs of Donald Trump as an official candidate than they have to.

You know, we don't know how big the field is going to be but we already see in polling a reprise of the core dynamic that drove the 2016 race. I mean whether you're looking at national polling. The Republican pollster Chris Wilson put out a national poll this week. State polling in states like New Hampshire and California that have come out recently. We see very consistently, Fred, that Donald Trump as in 2016 is much stronger among Republican voters without a college degree than he is among Republican voters with a college degree. And that was the pattern in 2016, even in a very crowded field of 11 or more candidates, he won about half of all the voters in the primary without a college degree. He only won about a third of the college educated Republicans in 2016 but the rest of them never could coalesce around a single alternative. The polling this time is already showing a somewhat -- a very similar pattern and the question I think will be whether anyone particularly Ron DeSantis who looks like the strongest challenger has the capacity to unify that big block of white collar Republicans who are dubious of Trump more effectively than anybody did in 2016.",

You know, I don't know that it matters that much exactly when he announces. I think there is a little nervousness among Democrats about -- we saw that piece in Politico, for example, about whether -- some people are sort of wondering whether he's starting to have second thoughts. But when you're the incumbent president, Fred, I mean you are really riding on big, big currents. I mean his fate is likely to be determined by whether voters are more satisfied with the economy than they were -- than they have been now; what they think of the Republican alternative and whether they think he's physically capable of another four years. One thing we saw in 2022 was that to a remarkable and even unprecedented degree, voters who were dissatisfied with Biden's performance, a larger number of them voted for Democrats anyway because they thought the Republican alternative was too extreme. And that's a dynamic that could benefit him again in '24 even if his approval rating doesn't recover to 50 percent, which is usually considered the make or break line for a sitting president.",
