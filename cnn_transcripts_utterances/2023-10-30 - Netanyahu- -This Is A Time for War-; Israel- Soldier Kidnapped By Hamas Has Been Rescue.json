Despite the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, and the thousands of casualties, including an untold number of civilians and children, Netanyahu dismissed calls by some countries for a cease-fire. Although the United States is not among them, saying Israel simply cannot stop its mission to target and destroy Hamas, the government that sent invaders into Israel to cruelly slaughter some 1,400 Israelis.

Israel claims it has killed dozens of terrorists over the last day, but the IDF also were able to rescue one of its own soldiers, they say. The IDF says private Ori Megidish was released earlier today, after being kidnapped by Hamas on October 7th. This photo was released by the Israeli government after Private Megidish was medically cleared and reunited with her family. Today, Hamas released a short video with three other women who arebelieved to be hostages. One of the women pleaded with the Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu to free them. CNN is not going to show the Hamas video, but the prime minister's office did confirm the identities of the three women -- Yelena Trupanob, and Danielle Aloni and Rimon Kirsht. We learned a heartbreaking update earlier today about another victim of Hamas that we told you about. The Israeli government says Shani Louk, a German Israeli woman who was kidnapped by Hamas on October 7th from the Nova Music Festival, Shani has been confirmed killed. Shani was at the Nova Music Festival in southern Israel, where young people around the world had gathered to celebrate music and peace when Hamas attacked. Her body was seen on video, Hamas video, after the attack. She was seemingly unconscious in the back of a Hamas truck, being driven into Gaza. We're going to show you the video at her family's request, and we want to video, the video is graphic. Her mother specifically gave CNN permission to air the video. She wants to show the world the brutality of Hamas. We are blurring the image of her seemingly unconscious, naked body. A source familiar with the identification of Shani's remains told me that the discovery of a fragment of a bone from the base of a squall, specifically the -- bone, was recently located, and it was a DNA match. For Shani's family, that fact, combined with the horrific video we just showed you, and the circumstances of Shani being kidnapped by Hamas on October 7th, lead a team of experts to conclude that Shani had been killed by Hamas. CNN's Jeremy Diamond is an Ashkelon, Israel, for us right now, just north of Gaza. Jeremy, let's start with the IDF soldiers rescued today. What do we know about how all this went down?",

Our photojournalist, Matthias Sam (ph), was also able to get images of some of the destruction in Beit Hanoun, which is the northernmost city in the Gaza Strip, where we know that Israeli forces have rolled in with tanks. You can see some of the buildings there, really shells of themselves, only the foundation still remaining. But these operations are still continuing, Jake. The IDF says it is carried out strikes on more than 600 targets over the last several days, and they are vowing to continue to expand this, as we heard the Israeli prime minister today saying there is a time for peace, and there's a time for war.

It appears at this point at least several miles into Gaza, and it appears approaching from more than one direction, from the north, but also from the east, moving towards Gaza city, where one could expect that they will face greater resistance. This is the area, and more urban area, and this is an area where it's expected Israeli forces will face the most severe resistance, and the kind of resistance that U.S. advisers, military advisers, have been warning Israeli military commanders about based on the U.S. military's own experience and similar battles in places such as Iraq, in Fallujah, and Mosul.

There is no safe place. Not in the south, not in the whole of Gaza. Near constant airstrikes now pound the enclave, while Israeli troops expand their ground operations. The IDF insists it is eradicating Hamas. But on the ground, in this densely populated territory, utter devastation is the consequence. There are 2 million people, half of them children, trapped here under bombardment and under siege. This is revenge, a cowardly, racist campaign, he says. In this area, we are one family, we are kind people. Instead of waking up to the call to prayer, we woke up to an airstrike. The anguish and horror inside of Gaza, sparking mass demonstrations, from New York City, to London, to Rome, and calls for a cease-fire are growing louder. U.N. members overwhelmingly voted for an immediate and sustained truce last week.

CNN has learned that the U.S. Army asked local police for a welfare check on the shooter after a worried soldier warned he would, quote, snap, and commit a mass shooting. Local authorities went to the shooter's home, but failed to contact him, that was September 16th. That was less than six weeks before he carried out the deadly mass shooting.

They never tried to retrieve his weapons. They never took him in for any kind of evaluation. So today, Maine's governor had a press availability. And we came here to ask her, what does she know? What is her reaction to all of this? She said everything is under investigation and that she refused to simply answer any questions about what contact the gunman may have had to police. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV. JANET MILLS (D), MAINE: I think determining and understanding all of the facts surrounding this event is crucial, all of the facts. The Maine state police is as I said undergoing a thorough investigation of every aspect of the case, facts are important and it's important question that you ask. There are many other important questions that will be determined in the coming weeks and months. (END VIDEO CLIP)",
