Welcome to the program, everyone. I'm Christiane Amanpour in London. And we begin tonight with a Climate Change Catch-22. How can the most vulnerable countries protect against climate change if they're drowning in debt? A major international aid agency revealed this week that 93 percent of the world's worst affected countries can't even afford to safeguard against natural disasters. Some are being forced to slash public spending or invest in fossil fuel industries just to pay back their debts to central banks. ActionAid International says it is high time for a radical overhaul of the way debt is managed to stop the climate crisis spiraling, pointing to the IMF and World Bank meetings this week in Washington. The COP 27 Climate Summit in November made historic progress on creating a fund for countries most at risk. The impact of our changing climate is all around us all the time. Like the two apartment buildings that collapsed in a landslide in Mexico this week. Landslides affect people all over the world. And scientists say that climate change is only making them worse.

So, in the United States alone, since 1860, we've lost about 60 billion metric tons of topsoil. So, that means that there are all these cascading effects that make it harder for trees to catch on harder for roots to take, because we exploit the environment around us. And I think that's something that people in the past, in the very distant past were extremely aware of, that if you over exploit your natural environment. There are ecological consequences that can like make life precarious, as in the case of landslides threats to life. But it could also damage our ability to grow things to make the land work in the way in which we want to need it to.",

      "sentences": "Well, I guess it's three things. First, when we go back to the beginning of recorded history, human history where people start to writethings down, all the people in the past were worried about ecological collapse. The story of the creation, which is sacred to Jews, and Christians, and Muslims, is all about God creating an environment that is perfect. And if you transgress and disobey God, you're punished with Adam and Eve being expelled from the Garden of Eden and finding it difficult to make things grow and the displeasure of God through the floods of Noah or through Chinese belief systems or Indian belief systems, to show that if you get things wrong, there are consequences. I think that's important. Second, as a historian, the spread of human history is all about rises and falls. And some of those great cities in the past aren't here anymore today. Places like to Tikal or Chichen Itza or --",

      "sentences": "-- in Central America and Guatemala -- or in Mexico and Guatemala or places like Nineveh or Nippur in places like Iraq. These weregreat cities that people don't really know of any more, the name, let alone being thriving civilizations. And that's because if you fail to adapt to change, if you fail to adapt to rising populations, to water shortages, to the ability to exploit and grow things, then there are consequences. So, there's a bit of a warning, I think, around that. But third is around about the ecological world we live in today, which is clearly at a series of tipping points where we need to be very conscious of what happens when there are vulnerabilities of a warming world. So, for example, there are about 300 cities in today's world where the average temperature is above 35 degrees centigrade. We reckon by 2050, there'll be more like 600 cities, and that's nearly 2 billion people who are obviously going to be living in conditions that you can defeat through sciences, you can invest in air conditioning, but life becomes much more difficult and dangerous. And I think that one of the things I'm very aware of in the world today is we don't connect with the world around us particularly well, you know. We are aware that fossil fuels create carbon dioxide and these emissions that make the world warmer, but we don't think too much about where things come from, how they're grown, how many -- there are 20,000 plastic bottles sold every second or, you know, a couple of years ago, when there were big Russian forest fires, 10 football pitches per minute are lost from forest.",

And when you createinequalities, you can have situations that lead to social unrest. For example, in the 1780s in France, very severe winters and wet springs reduced the amount of wheat that was grown, that forced prices up, cost of living went up, inflation. And then the king tried to say, well, look, listen, anybody who's got a grievance, please send it in writing. And 25,000 people submitted documents -- 25,000 documents were submitted. And that then spilled over into calls for more dramatic action that led to the French Revolution, and the king's head in a basket a couple of years later. So, those kinds of things can happen when there's when there's sudden shocks. You can produce volatilities. And, you know, going back, Christiane, what you're asking about now, I think that the problem is, is that we're in the middle of such a big crisis here in Europe because of the war in Ukraine, because of Russia, because of energy. That it's concentrated lots of our minds. So, funny enough, one of the byproducts of Putin's invasion of Ukraine has been to accelerate a green transition.",

And that's metalswhich, lo and behold, lots come from Russia. And then lots of the rare earths we need for the super magnets and for the other materials are from China, where we also have a very fractured relationship and difficult relationship for many good reasons at the moment. So, those transitions aren't as simple as saying, let's just put turbines up everywhere, it's, how do you make those, where do you find them, how we got the metals and materials, what happens when suddenly everybody tries to act the same way. The price spikes work in different ways too. So, those renewable transitions can't be managed if you're not going through other kinds of threats at the same time.",

But here we are in 2023, and although there's chronic poverty in most developed countries, as well as around the world, you know, we managed to do just about OK, you know. Actually, famines are relatively rare. When they do happen, the industrial communities tend to respond reasonably well. And I'm quite hopeful about that. It could be the demographics that are falling in most developed countries will start to alter the number of people, but people on their own are not the problem. It's how do you -- how do you spend what you've got. And I don't just mean financially, also, ecologically. I mean, every single pair of jeans requires 7,500 liters of water.

I mean, I suppose when we think about extinctions, the first sort of stop in yourtrack's moment is that every single life form on Earth today is survivor or it descends from the survivors of those five great mass extinctions of the past. So, every life form, every plant, every animal is a beneficiary of these massive changes from hundreds of millions of years ago. So, I think that will tell us that we should remember that we are one animal amongst very many. And if the environment changes against us, if you believe in evolution, which most people do, then there's no reason why we get to beat the system all the time, because the natural history tells you that that's not what happens, hence, no more dinosaurs, who I'd imagined would have given us a good run for our money. So, I think that those -- that staying sober about what happens if things go wrong is important.

But it also means that we bring other things when we travel and when we move and when we cough. And the emerging infectious disease in a warming world is something we should be paying quite a lot of attention to. So, if you start with the lessons of history, thinking about what the pandemic could and should have taught us from two or three years ago around, not just any new pandemic, but around diseases that respond to warming environments.

So, if you took those out of commission, if you bought them and close them down, if you clean them up, there's -- you know, there's a lot that you can do to improve things. We waste about 930 million tons of food per year globally, that's about 8 percent to 10 percent of global emissions are people growing stuff, taking it to the store, putting it in the freezer or the fridge, or not eating it, throwing it away.

So, if we think about sort of some of the really big solar storms that we see, that cause really big space weather events hereat Earth, and we've been trying to find if there are sort of any precursor, anything in there that might tell us that this event is going to be bigger. One of the challenges we had is we haven't had a really, really, really big space weather event for a number of years. And so, are we actually went back and used data that isn't even from scientific spacecraft, it's some of our Air Force partners, and we took some of their engineering data. And working with Amazon Web Services, we sort of actually got that data set ready to be ingested and to be ready for A.I. M.L. And then, we were able to find signatures that were associated with some of the larger events back over the last 50 years, and actually find some signatures that, going forward, we know we should look for these signatures in future large space weather events. And since we've just had such an active sun with lots of great Aurora being visible, we've certainly got some great candidates for new science datasets that we can apply these A.I. M.L. techniques to.",

Andwe are learning all about the atmosphere of a star. So, you know, for decades and decades, we've studied the sun, we've studied it. We've looked at it in all different wavelengths. We've been in at that time, as far as the planet Mercury. And so, we've been able to study the extended atmosphere of the sun. But we really didn't know -- you know, know -- you know that things are happening in certain regions, you know that there's suddenly an increase in heat, and there's a big increase in energy, and it causes that, that corona, to accelerate away very fast, but you don't know what the processes are because you haven't been -- you haven't flown through them, you haven't actually flown and found out what is happening in that region. And so, with Parker Solar Probe, we've been able to do that. We've certainly found that things that -- the sort of the processes that we thought could be causing heat, things like magnetic field lines, sort of kinking on themselves, and then snapping back straight, which actually can release a lot of heat and energy, that is happening further away from the sun than we originally thought on our very first perihelion path or our closest approach, the very first one, where we thought, oh, you know, that'll be nice, we'll see some interesting stuff. And we actually started seeing these little features, these little switchbacks. They're like sort of S-shaped features in magnetic field lines, where it kind of kinking back on themselves. We saw those in the -- you know, the very first orbit. As we get closer, we've seen them getting larger and getting more frequent. And so, you know, finding out these sorts of reasons that the sun is such an interesting star. And what we learn about our sun, we can apply to other stars in other stellar systems where we also see space weather. We see, you know, these big flares and big events that we see on our sun. We see them on other stars as well. So, as you're looking for habitable planets, in other stellar systems, you know, what you learn about our sun is directly applicable.",

You know, we are really focusing with the James WebbTelescope finding so many exoplanets, finding -- you know, even -- and even now, managing to take measurements of the atmospheres around exoplanets. You know, what are the building blocks? What are the things that actually would sustain life? You know, we're excited in September of this year, we have OSIRIS-REx returning to Earth, bringing samples from an asteroid, Bennu. And that asteroid has been around a long, long time. It was back. You know, we think it was there sort of at the time that our planets were forming. So, it's got those kind of molecular building blocks inside the asteroid, may be able to tell us about planet formation, about what caused us to be able to sustain water here, and therefore, sustain life on our planet. And then, it tells us what -- you know, what kind of things, what signatures we might want to look for when we're looking in other stellar systems. The next big astrophysics mission that we will start will be the Habitable Worlds Observatory. And that really is a mission focusing on not just looking for, you know, exoplanets or looking for planets that happened to be orbiting stars, but what is it that we would look for to find signatures of life. Also, sending Europa Clipper to fly sort of through the methane plumes at Europa, and see if there's any signatures of life there. We have a Dragonfly Mission that's going to go to Titan, that's a sort of a -- it kind of hops around, it's like a quadcopter. And they're going to be looking for signatures of life in Titan. So, they're the kind of questions that it's just -- I mean, not necessarily finding another planet like ours, but just finding life elsewhere. I think that's the big question that I'm really excited about.",

And now, we've got -- we've sent our own spacecraft that have left even our protective bubble, our heliosphere, the two voyages that we have, you know, gone past every planet, and then now out in interstellar space, you know, looking at next generation missions that might go very fast out of our heliosphere and actually explore interstellar space, thinking about what it would take to get to the next nearest star, and how do we just -- how do we expand what we know.
