You can't check everyone's backpack or bags that are brought to the space. Think about the coolers that were used to deploy the IEDs in this attack. That's the sort of thing that never would have made its way into a controlled space event. So that's what you have in the French Quarter. It's a, what, one, maybe 1 1/2-mile-square area.
