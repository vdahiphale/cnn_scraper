Jean Carroll has been on the stand for about an hour.There was a slight delay because of jury transportation issues, but she kind of started out of the gate laying down what this case is about, and that is the potential harm that she received when Donald Trump denied her allegations of rape and then said that she wasn't his type and that she made it up to sell a book. So what she testified to right at the start was, she said: \"I'm here because I was assaulted by Donald Trump. And when I wrote about it, he said it never happened. He lied and he shattered my reputation.\" So, right as E. Jean Carroll said that, Donald Trump, who is facing her sitting at least three tables back from her, he was shaking his head side to side in a sign that it never happened. And this is, of course, the issue in this case. So she has mostly been giving background about her growing up, how she made it as an advice columnist, and they have just now gotten to the part of the story of what happened after she published her book with the rape allegation and Donald Trump began making his statements, so beginning to show the statements that a previous jury has already found to be defamatory. The next phase will be getting into what happened after that. So, we have led up to this point so far. I mean, there's been a lot of objections so far during the trial, but Donald Trump otherwise is sitting straight ahead. He's passed a few notes to his attorneys, leaned over to his lead attorney, Alina Habba, whispering to her a few times, but no other grand reaction. It was just that first statement with Carroll saying what happened, Trump shaking his head side to side that it didn't. The jury has been paying attention. They have been watching Carroll, watching her attorney ask the questions. And this is now just really getting into what the heart of this case is. That is what happened to E. Jean Carroll after Trump made these statements that the jury had found to be defamatory. And then his attorney will have an opportunity to cross-examine her after that -- Kate.",

But she testified in the spring. Trump, though, did not participate in that trial at all. So what makes this testimony unique, as you said, is, he's in the room. He's just a few feet away. Yesterday was the first time in decades that Trump and E. Jean Carroll had been in the same room. And she's going to talk about the impact that his statements had on her life, incredibly personal, a very difficult thing to go through when someone as powerful and in some sectors popular as Trump turns his ire on you. Your voice-mail box, your e-mail box, your family, they are flooded with threats, with messages. It is a very difficult thing to go through. And underlying these statements, of course, are these allegations of sexual abuse. And I have seen this in cases that have covered over the years. It can be incredibly difficult for survivors of sexual abuse to testify in any courtroom, but particularly when the perpetrator is just feet away. So we will be watching to see how she handles this. So far, this has been a lot of rehash just about her career, but we're going to get into some deeper stuff soon. BERMAN:  How did she handle the cross-examination in the first trial? And what does that tell us about what she might be anticipating this time around?",

And he actually -- he did quite a good job. Joe is a very brash New Yorker, very experienced lawyer. People had a lot of questions about how he was going to approach this. And he did it very delicately. Alina Habba here has, again, this delicate task of cross-examining E. Jean Carroll here. So far, Habba's decorum in the courtroom has antagonized the judge a little bit. She has been a pretty aggressive advocate for her client, trying to relitigate issues, which has antagonized the judge. I know I have interviewed Alina on shows about her clients. She can be pretty aggressive. Let's see how she handles this test. This is not easy. And, again, there's the jury, but there's also her client.",

And he's also -- a source also saying to me that he was keen to share the details of his diagnosis to encourage other men who may be experiencing symptoms to get checked in line with public health advice. But, as you say, it does also come on the back of this news as well about the princess of Wales, who's in hospital. She's had a planned abdominal surgery. As you say, she could be there for two weeks, but then also have to recuperate for three months after at home, so two very senior royals out of action for now.

Over Christmas, she held -- hosted a carol service at Westminster Abbey, and she's been to a few events since when she can fit them in, effectively. She looks really well. She's very fit and healthy. She does a lot of sports. So, if anyone can recover from this quickly, it would be her, although a lot of people pointing out that this is a long period of recovery. The palace don't like releasing any sort of medical details about any of the royals, but when they're in hospital, they almost have a public service to do that. As far as the king's concerned, they do see that as quite a routine procedure really for men of his age. But he wants to highlight the fact that people should be getting themselves checked. But it did all come in one day, so quite a shock for British people, I think, and two senior royals out of action. We won't see them, the duchess -- the princess particularly very, very popular right now.

And that has been where she has not been able to do that. DeSantis has really been able to do that, until like a week ago. And so New Hampshire, I think, is a little bit different, because that's where Nikki Haley has made sort of her last stand, where she is making the case to her voters that she is the one that can go up against Donald Trump. But it doesn't seem like there's a path after New Hampshire. Even if she comes within single digits of Donald Trump, she will call that a win, but, if Donald Trump wins, he will have come off of a massive win in Iowa. And as you move forward in the Republican calendar, a lot of the contests become, in terms of delegates, winner-take-all, which is why this is going to be so tough for anyone else to really catch up to Donald Trump at this point.",

In our entrance polls the other day, we saw 61 percent of Republican voters say they would still see Trump as a fit president if he were to be convicted. That means 32 percent of them say that he would not be fit if he were to be convicted. If I were looking at one of these campaigns, I would say that means 32 percent of Republican base voters, not to mention the general election candidates, do not think Trump would be fit if he were to be convicted. That's a compelling argument to make on the electability issue. DeSantis has made the electability issue, being the governor in the state of Florida, and he is a winner, and he has pointed out Trump is a loser.
