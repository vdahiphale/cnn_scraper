Standby for new details on both of those cases.Also tonight, members of Congress doubling down on their threat to ban the hugely popular social media app, TikTok, after grilling the company's CEO about ties to China and national security concerns. And in Ukraine, defenders of the battered city of Bakhmut claiming momentum is shifting in their favor as Russians suffer heavy losses there and elsewhere all along the frontlines. Welcome to our viewers here in the United States and all around the world. Wolf Blitzer is on assignment. I'm Alex Marquardt, and you're in THE SITUATION ROOM. We begin with the historic level of legal pressure on former President Donald Trump. A New York grand jury is set to reconvene on Monday with a decision looming on whether to indict the former president for his alleged role in a hush money scheme. And in the classified documents probe, a federal grand jury is just hours away from hearing potentially significant testimony from Trump's own lawyer. Our correspondents are digging for new information on both cases. First, we go to Kara Scannell in New York. Kara, where does this grand jury investigation in New York stand tonight after the former president wrongly predicted that he would be arrested two days ago?",

And, you know, today the special grand jury was sitting but they weren't hearing any testimony related to the hush money investigation and Trump's alleged role in it. They will be back focusing on that case on Monday. And sources tell us that prosecutors are weighing, bringing in at least one more witness to testify. Another source tells us that they are also discussing whether or not to bring Michael Cohen back. Cohen has already testified twice before the grand jury. He's a key player. And on Monday, his former attorney testified at the behalf of the Trump legal team. So, prosecutors weighing whether they need a rebuttal on that.Now, this is all coming as Trump is throwing out insults again to Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, but this investigation is taking place behind the scenes and Bragg is still weighing whether to make this decision, a historic decision, to charge a former president.

The letter only came after Donald Trump created a false expectation that he would be arrested the next day and his lawyers reportedly urged you to intervene. Neither fact is a legitimate basis for Congressional inquiries. So Bragg's office sending the message they want Congress to back off. Let them continue with their private investigation and Bragg saying that he will make an announcement either way if whether he's going to bring an indictment or closed the case without any charges.

There are issues that pop up that you have to resolve before you put the case in the grand jury's hands to vote on an indictment, and I think the prosecutors are just doing that, closing up those issues as they go along.

It doesn't mean that Republicans, certainly those who are firmly entrenched in Trump's camp, won't try to politicize the other cases, but as you alluded to in your question, it's a lot harder when we're talking about Georgia, which is about the then-president picking up the phone and calling the secretary of state of the state of Georgia and asking to find more votes.And then, of course, on the federal level, the other investigation going on, on multiple all fronts, but, first and foremost, the insurrection and whether he had any involvement in that, but also what we've seen at Mar-a-Lago and maybe even beyond. So, that is much, much more complicated and much more fundamental to the constitutionality and fundamental to democracy. What's going on in New York is a lot easier for Republicans to politicize because it's a Democratic -- a Democrat who was elected as the D.A., and also a lot of people, even some Democrats, frankly, think it's small ball, especially compared to everything else that is before the former president when it comes to his legal troubles.",

I mean, if it's something about what Cohen told him in 2018 about -- or communications that they had, then maybe Cohen might be the one person that can counter that.I mean, we do know from this investigation that they've brought in a number of witnesses. This was all activity that took place right before the 2016 elections. So, members of Trump's campaign have gone in, as well as members of the Trump Organization because the investigation is looking at not just the hush money payments, but the potential falsification of business records as well as how Michael Cohen was reimbursed. So, you can see there's a finite number of people there but there's also an addition of people documents. So, it's possible they have someone that they need to come in to present additional documents in this case. We just don't know because all of the proceedings at the grand jury or secret. We only know what Costello told us, he said. So, the prosecutors must be weighing this and seeing if there is anything they need to button up, and perhaps maybe they won't bring in Michael Cohen again, we just don't know yet.",

I think the chances of that are low for a number of reasons. This thing is -- you know, whenever the arraignment takes place, which would be the flashpoint, there won't be the same sort of lead up to it that people will be able to spend that time planning and organizing traveling here or traveling to New York, that sort of thing. And I think that there is a bit of fatigue in that community as a result of the prosecutions of all those January 6th defendants.

We're also joined by the executive director of the McCain Institute, Evelyn Farkas. Thank you both for joining me this evening. General Clark, to you first. Is Ukraine in a position now to push the Russians back from Bakhmut? And considering how grinding this battle has been for months, would it be worth it if Ukraine manages to take back this city? GEN. WESLEY CLARK (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST:  Well, Alex, it's really impossible for us on the outside to understand the combat potential that the Ukrainians have. I mean, they're just not releasing it. When the commander says it, you can take it at face value, but it could also be a distraction, a propaganda move, again, an information move against the Russians. So -- but if they have that potential, absolutely, it would be worthwhile. They got two choices, make that penetration at Bakhmut, use the penetration to draw Russian reserves in, set up a killing zone, or make the penetration at Bakhmut and then spread out and take the flanks, roll up the Russians in the east. But I would flag this also, Alex, the decisive terrain, we believe, is Crimea. And so whatever happens up north, it's good. If it destroys or pins down Russian forces, that's good. But if we want to bring Putin at the negotiating table, we've got to go to Crimea.",

He did renew his call for western jets. Ukraine has said that their pilots can be retrained on modern jets, switching from Soviet jets, in less than six months. How much do these new MiG-29s that are being given to Ukraine? How much does that crack open the door to the possibility of western, more modern jets, to soon follow.",

So, any new old aircraft they get is also something.But, clearly, if they can get the modern, more capable F-16s into the battlefield, you know, even a few of those would go a long way, and they actually could do it faster than most people think. Because it's not as if they're going to have to go and get them off the assembly line, a lot of countries have F-16 that they can transfer to the Ukrainians. The Ukrainians have been training with them. I'm told from military sources that they actually are quite adept at the training and they're learning faster than we expected that. That shouldn't surprise us because we've heard this over and over again. You know, when you're fighting a war, you're pretty motivated. And you learn faster than troops, you know, or pilots during peacetime. So, I think that it is significant because it does break a taboo, if you will, and then we can provide better aircraft moving forward.",

I'm sure the Bradleys are either in there or about to be in there, the ones that we've given. So, this is good. But as President Zelenskyy said, what he really needs is long range fires. Because what you want to be able to do is attack the enemy deep when you're moving against the enemy's front so that you can't reposition reserve, so you can take out command centers, so you can take out supply points and attack chokepoints.And so HIMARS is good but it's limited. The glide bombs that we can throw in there, they're good but they're not much more like HIMARS. So, we really need those ATACMS in there.",

These have been in the past six days or so spontaneous demonstrations, some of which have got violent, but this has been organized by the unions, who would desperate, they had said they told CNN the day before that they were desperate to avoid violence.

A lot of burning of the garbage that has been choking the streets 10,000 tons of probably more now built up on the streets, and that's because, of course, the garbage collectors, most of them in Paris, are on strike.

That would mean that the pensionable rage age was raised from 62 to 64. Now, that was forced through the national assembly last Thursday, using a presidential prerogative rather than allow it to go to a vote of people in the French parliament.
