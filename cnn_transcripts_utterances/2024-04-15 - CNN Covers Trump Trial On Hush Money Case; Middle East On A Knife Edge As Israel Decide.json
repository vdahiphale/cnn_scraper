The Israeli war cabinet met again earlier today, with sources telling CNN that members are determined to act, but the timing and scope of any response remains unclear. Over the weekend, in an unprecedented move, Iran launched some 300 drones and missiles at Israel in retaliation for the bombing of Tehran's consulate in Syria two weeks ago. Israel is vowing to, quote, \"exact a price from Iran when the timing is right.\" But governments and diplomats around the world are urging restraint and de-escalation.

So, really, two takeaways from the weekend, ultimately a success in coordinating among allies there in the region and in Israel itself in its missile defense programs there to defend against an onslaught, the unprecedented launching of some 300 drones and missiles from directly from Iranian soil towards Israel. But the other argument is that this is really at a crossroads in terms of things escalating in the region. We've been hoping the president and this administration had been hoping to avoid just that over the course of these past six months. And yet here we are.

      "sentences": "Right. And I think they're feeling at the White House today is very much on a razor's edge as theywatch to see what Israel chooses to do next. And you saw that play out in the President's very late night phone call with Prime Minister Netanyahu on Saturday, really trying to emphasize that this operation by Israel to shoot down these Iranian drones and missiles was a success and really trying to underscore Israel's military superiority against Iran, but also its diplomatic superiority, emphasizing that it did have friends in the region, the United States, but also some of the Arab countries that it could rely on to help defend itself. And I think the suggestion in that from President Biden was that Israel might not necessarily need to take any more retaliatory action going forward. So, the President really trying to head off a wider Middle East crisis. Now, whether Netanyahu takes that advice is the question that officials at the White House are watching very closely today. There is ample precedent over the last several months of Netanyahu not taking President Biden's advice, particularly when it comes to the war in Gaza. This is a moment of deep tension between those two men. And certainly there are some officials in the United States who really don't think that Israel is thinking through very clearly its military strategy, both in Gaza and elsewhere. And the view among these officials is that Israel could be trying to drag the U.S. closer into conflict with Iran. Now, President Biden, right now, is meeting with the Prime Minister of Iraq. That is a country that is literally in between these two these tensions in the region, but politically, as well. President Biden will want to discuss with him sort of the viability of the continued American troop presence in that country, which the U.S. views as essential. And we should note that a U.S. Patriot missile battery based near Erbil did help shoot down some of these Iranian drones over the weekend. So, this is an important meeting. I just saw him drive into the White House and we will hear from President Biden. And I think it's almost certain that he will address these events for the first time publicly when he's meeting with the Prime Minister right now.",

What we're seeing now is that there were, for instance, today there was an incident where apparently Israeli soldiers entered in Lebanese territory, and some sort of explosive device, perhaps an IED, as was claimed by Hezbollah, went off injuring four Israeli soldiers, including one severely. Now, we've seen the usual round of Israeli airstrikes on the south. Now, tensions are going a little bit higher because the Israeli military has just announced it's going to be holding maneuvers in the upper Galilee, which basically means near the border with Lebanon, from the morning until noon, and there will be aircraft, armored vehicles, and other military assets on the move in the area, which clearly is going to raise tensions further. Now, we heard and we've reported before that prior to the Iranian strike over the weekend, Hezbollah made it clear that it would not be involved in any Iranian response to the Israeli strike on the consulate in Damascus. However, if the situation escalated, we were told by sources close to Hezbollah, Hezbollah would reconsider its role, and probably the other proxies and allied militias of Iran in the region would also reconsider, perhaps escalating. And so, we're basically waiting now to see what comes out of the Israeli war cabinet. They've met twice in the last 24 hours without, it appears, making a decision as to what to do. But certainly, the hints, the suggestions are that they are going to respond in some way, and that could certainly set things off even more than they are in terms of tensions and possible escalation. Bianna. Sirens have been sounding in northern Israel just within the last hour there. Ben, if I could turn the conversation to the war in Gaza itself, because as I noted in the introduction to you that there are Israeli officials that say this could put on hold. Any incursion into Rafah, Prime Minister Netanyahu had declared that a date for that incursion had been set, but according to the IDF and a lot of reports and sourcing suggests that there hadn't been a date given and that an incursion was not in fact imminent.

Later, former Trump attorney Michael Cohen testified that Trump directed him to make payments to Daniels, quote, \"For the principal purpose of influencing the election,\" and that Trump later reimbursed him. Cohen served jail time for campaign finance violations related to the hush money payments and gave jarring testimony to Congress.

For a closer look at the potential political ramifications of a candidate being tried on criminalcharges, we're joined by Patrick Healy, who's deputy opinion editor at \"The New York Times\". Patrick, good to have you with us. It's fascinating. So much of the polling shows that whether it's chargers or even a potential finding that he's guilty doesn't seem to move the needle all that much. Do you think that will hold up moving forward? PATRICK HEALY, DEPUTY OPINION EDITOR, \"NEW YORK TIMES\": I don't think it will. I think it will move the needle with some swing voters who just see the possibility of a conviction. And that's not where we are yet. But if we got to a place where former President Trump was convicted on these charges, the idea of voting for a convicted criminal for president just may be a bridge too far for some of these voters, even voters who are inclined toward President Trump. As we know, polling is just a snapshot of the moment right now. These are charges that have been brought against the former president. He is owed the presumption of innocence. But if a jury of regular people find him guilty, there are going to be voters, especially swing voters who care a great deal about what the President of the United States stands for, who I think are going to have some problem voting for him.",

I think a lot of people have pretty strong opinions for or against DonaldTrump in this city, so I think there is a lot of curiosity around it. What's really different in this case compared to a lot of other high- profile legal trials that have unfolded, of course, is that this won't be televised, that there won't be moments in the courtroom, dramatic moments, a kind of a narrative arc that people can watch and follow and get caught up in. And in a lot of ways this plays to Trump's favor. Trump will be able to come out of the courthouse, go onto the sidewalk, hold impromptu news conferences, try to sort of shape the conversation, so to speak, that's going on around the trial. And it's going to be a little harder for others, including the Biden campaign, to kind of fact-check those moments because they won't have tape, for instance, that's able to kind of rebut the former president what he's saying.",

And, look, Donald Trump is running kind of on a platform of victimization, that people are out to get him, that he and,by extension, all of his supporters aren't able to get kind of a fair shake from the system. So, the degree to which he's able to sort of go out and get people really focused on that is important. I think a lot of people, no matter what party they're in, are going to be curious about whether Donald Trump can get a fair shake from a jury and a judge in New York City. I think they're going to be looking at rulings that the judge makes along the way, at some of the testimony, and wonder, look, are they able to give Donald Trump, no matter how I feel about him, kind of a fair shake? I think that's very important for how this trial plays out. And to your earlier question, how voters ultimately sort of see Trump, whether he was, if he is convicted, whether he was fairly convicted, or if he is acquitted, whether that process was fair, as well.",

Jean Carroll case found Carroll to be a persuasive witness. So, whether ultimately, the prosecution can draw testimony from both Cohen and if they decide to put Daniels on the stand, her as well, whether those witnesses can be persuasive with this jury and get them to understand the seriousness of these allegations, that this isn't just some kind of hush money case involving an erotic adult film star, but that this really goes toward criminality and cover-up, whether that will be persuasive, that's probably what I'm watching for most.",

And as the President has said, we will always stand in ironclad support for Israel's defense. And that's exactly what you saw this weekend with our air power and our destroyers in the eastern Med shooting down a range of ballistic missiles and drones shot from Iran in an unprecedented attack, which was met with an unprecedented response.

On the one hand, sees that many of itsallies have come to its side in its aid over the weekend in striking down an unprecedented number, over 300 missiles and drones sent from Iran and Iranian soil. The first time that has happened between the two countries. But Israel has made it clear, and as we heard now, we talked about Lloyd Austin. He's speaking with his counterpart. Gallant had made it clear to Lloyd Austin that Israel had no choice but to respond. So, from what you're hearing in your sources, Oren, what could a calibrated response look like in terms of a firm message Israel has sent without setting off a regional war?",

      "sentences": "There are a lot of options here. And that's what the U.S. and the Biden administration are looking at to see howIsrael does decide to respond and how it calibrates that response. It's also worth noting that over the weekend, Israel got a major diplomatic victory with many countries, including in the West and Europe and around the world, essentially condemning Iran and standing by Israel. It's a major diplomatic victory for Israel, arguably when it needs it most because of what had been the condemnation of Israel's operations in Gaza. So, what now does Israel do? And there's a spectrum of options here. Of course, Israel has effectively promised to respond. But what exactly that means, that's what the war cabinet needs to figure out. Could it be striking Iranian targets in Syria? We have seen Israel in the past do that repeatedly. And even if it's on a much larger scale, it doesn't risk, arguably, the same sort of regional conflict and regional escalation that striking Iran directly does. In addition to that, if Israel were to try to strike Iran directly, it, of course, involves going through somebody else's airspace, be it Jordan, Iraq, Saudi. And that, again, Israel has essentially a bit of a diplomatic victory here and many of these countries condemning Iran. So, it would risk not only a military operation, but also effectively it could create problems diplomatically if Israel decides to go that direction. So, there are a number of options here. We have, of course, seen Israel carry out covert operations in Iran, whether it's the assassination of Iranian nuclear scientists or the stealing of the Iranian nuclear archives. Something like that could be an option, but operations like that obviously take months to plan and it would be difficult to carry out, especially when Iran is looking for that response. So, how Israel calibrates its response, that's something the U.S. very much wants to see. As you pointed out, Bianna, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, according to a U.S. official, asked his Israeli counterpart to be notified and updated if and when Israel chooses to carry out that response.",
