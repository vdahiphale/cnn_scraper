Legal challenges in those states succeeded at using the 14th Amendment's insurrectionist ban to remove Trump from ballots, though those decisions have been paused pending potential appeals. Challenges in several other states were rejected, and now Oregon'sSupreme Court will decide whether to ban the former U.S. president from the ballot there over his alleged role in the January 6th insurrection.

We're told Lee Jae-myung is conscious and we're about to show images of the attack that, of course, you might find disturbing.Lee was assaulted in Busan, South Korea's second largest city, but has since been transferred to the Seoul National University Hospital.

Once doctors have completed surgery, they say that they will give us an update. It is important for me to stress just how prominent of a figure Mr. Lee is here in South Korea. He has a household name. He is the leader of the opposition party, which is the Democratic-Liberal Party. He was on a campaign stop helping other candidates in anticipation of the general election later on this spring. You mentioned this idea about security. These campaign events by nature are very open. It's a chance for members of the public to come face to face with politicians. In this particular case, a man in his 60s went up to Mr. Lee, asked for an autograph and then attacked him with a knife. One of the images we saw after was Mr. Lee on the ground with someone taking a handkerchief, applying it to his neck, perhaps in an effort to quell some of the bleeding. As far as a motive, as far as more about this man in his 60s, we just do not know. But what is clear is that this is a very politically sensitive time in South Korea. If you look at the political landscape, there is pretty much a 50-50 split between the conservative movement of things and the liberal movement of the political landscape. And for that reason, after this attack, we have heard condemnations from South Korea's president as well as from Lee and his officials. No one wanting to pass any judgment. It is that sensitive that no one wants to take any stance to make this a political moment. Bianca, as startling as this is, we have seen knife attacks like this before. There was a case involving the former U.S. ambassador to South Korea as well as former President Park. When she was on the campaign trail, there was also a knife attack where she was the target. Marc Stewart in Seoul, thank you so much for bringing us that story. Of course, we will be checking in with you as you hear about more developments. Thank you. Ukraine's interior minister says at least three people have been killed in Russian attacks across the country. Ukrainian air forces say Russia launched waves of ballistic missiles throughout the morning. Two people were reportedly killed in a fire in a residential building in the capital, Kyiv, and one person was killed in Kharkiv. The attacks come after Russian President Vladimir Putin vowed to intensify strikes on Ukraine in the new year. Clare Sebastian joins me now. Clare, tell us more about what Putin said. He mentioned this being in retaliation for attacks on Russian border territory. But does this really mark a departure from the sort of attacks that we have seen previously?",

Despite the fact that I now have taken to wearing earplugs, my building was shaking from the shockwave of one of the hypersonic missiles being shot over our skies. This was quite something. I was actually, you know, afraid that the building might crumble. So waking up this morning, the entire city is in flames in various parts of the city. Water lines are down in some parts of the city, and also some power infrastructures seem to have been struck, which, once again, reminds us of Putin's terror campaign last year. It may be the start of 2024, is the start of a renewed campaign to try to knock out our power facilities and our water supplies.",

We know historically Russia has always had numerical superiority. That's been a benefit in most of its military campaigns.

You know, as one of my colleagues, a member of Ukrainian parliament, a good friend of mine, recently posted on Facebook, he said that taking stock of the past year in the U.S. and the West, do not seem to have been learning the lessons of 2022 and 2023 as quick as the Russians are. Their industrial capacity is nowhere near where it's needed to allow Ukraine to put up a successful, you know, resistance to the Russians. And so, when you talk about numerical superiority, I think it's also important to mention that Ukraine must be very wary of keeping at least its moral superiority to the Russians.Putin is now claiming that all of this is in sort of a payback for the attack on Belgorod back last Saturday, which resulted in the deaths of 30 Russians. First of all, when did he ever need a pretext to bomb us? But be it as it may, I would really caution our government, and I want to believe our government, that says that it was poor work by Russian air defenses that caused these fatalities. But once again, our Western allies expect a different sort of behavior from the Ukrainians. As sweet as this revenge is, this justice, as karmic as it seems to us here in Ukraine, it will not help us. And I would, once again, caution Ukraine to proceed very careful and concentrate strictly on military goals.",

The region was the epicenter of the 7.5 magnitude quake, which hit near the Noto Peninsula Monday afternoon. Japan's prime minister says access to the northern part of the peninsula is extremely difficult because the main road into the area is destroyed. A top Japanese official says more than 100 people are still waiting to be rescued. The U.S. Geological Survey has recorded more than 35 aftershocks and warns that they could continue potentially for days or even months. Public broadcaster NHK reports more than 100 homes and shops have burned down after a large fire broke out in the city of Wajima. Tens of thousands of people are still without power, while thousands are sheltering in evacuation centers. Journalist Manisha Tank is tracking this live for us from Singapore. Manisha, thanks so much for joining us on the program.

And they're up against very challenging circumstances, Bianca.For example, those roads that you mentioned that have been very badly destroyed. And even though we don't often see earthquakes of this nature hit this part of Japan, they tend to hit the western side more than the eastern side. We know that local authorities are struggling to keep up. So this happened late in the afternoon on Monday. Through the night, it was very difficult to get to all of the incidents that were reported. And as the day has gone on today, and we're now coming into the evening again this Tuesday for Japan, the authorities are catching up in a really big way. Now, what the prime minister has said in an emergency disaster meeting after that meeting was that they would have to secure the routes in any way possible, but use any type of transport that they could. So that includes aerial transport and marine transport to reach those that might be in need. Speaking of which, there are those that could be trapped under collapsed buildings. And this has been the big concern. This is one of the reasons we have seen the death toll going up over the last few hours. It started off overnight at six, and now we're up to 48, as you just reported. Along with that, there are those who are concerned about their safety, the fact that they're dealing with the cold. And so they have fled to evacuation centers. And we know there are about 27,000 people or so in Ishikawa Prefecture who are in those secure spaces -- Bianca.",

He had no heat source in that tent, limited supplies of food and water, and they described him as very cold and scared.Now, apparently he had been kidnapped, but not in the traditional sense that we know it, cyber kidnapped. So he never actually came face to face with his kidnappers. That he was just coerced over his phone and over the Internet. So what appears to have happened is that he was contacted by these kidnappers and told that unless he did exactly what he was told, his family back home in China would be in danger. They asked him for a photograph, which they then sent to his family in China with a ransom demand, and they told 17-year-old Kai Zhuang to isolate himself. That's why he was in this tent in the middle of nowhere. The family, they say that they paid around $80,000 into Chinese bank accounts. They also contacted the high school in Utah. The high school contacted the police, and the police, by looking at this 17-year-old's spending patterns, what he bought, they worked out that he was camping. So search parties were sent out, and eventually he was found in this tent. Apparently this cyber kidnapping is an increasingly common occurrence, targeting foreign exchange students, particularly Chinese foreign exchange students. Now, this story ended well in that the student was found alive and well. He asked to speak to his family. He asked for a warm cheeseburger. He is safe. But as I say, this is apparently an increasingly common trend seen in this country of cyber kidnappers targeting these young, vulnerable kids far from home. They never come face-to-face, all done online. Nick Watt, CNN, Los Angeles. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
