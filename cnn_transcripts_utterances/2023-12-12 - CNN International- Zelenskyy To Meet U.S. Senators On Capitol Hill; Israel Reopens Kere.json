Israeli warplanes and tanks are also pounding southern Gaza, where the U.N. says the fighting has grown so intense that the distribution of aid to desperate civilians is being curtailed.But the flow of aid into Gaza could increase in the coming hours. Israel says it has begun inspecting aid trucks waiting the Kerem border -- at Kerem Shalom border crossing there.

What this essentially does, according to the Israelis, is doubles the capacity for the inspections that they have been so rigid about, having to approve everything that goes into Gaza.So what you see back there are some of the trucks that have come through here today from Egypt. They are inspected there. We've seen them opened up. We've seen cargo from the World Food Program. And then over here, there's a long line of more trucks coming in from the Egyptian side of the border. So once they are told to keep coming, they will then go around this corner and get inspected. Now, what this effectively does is it does double the number of trucks that Israel can inspect. Until now, there was only one inspection point much farther south, way out of the way. This is much more convenient. So these trucks come in from Egypt, they get looked at, but then they've got to go back into Egypt and up to the Rafah border crossing where all of the aid has been going into Gaza. That is where, Max, there has been a real bottleneck. Rafah was not built for hundreds and hundreds of trucks every single day. And then because of the utter chaos on the other side of the border with hundreds of thousands of people displaced who are swarming those aid trucks because of the heavy fighting, there's so much difficulty in distributing that aid. The aid officials, the humanitarian officials cannot get all the trucks in that they need. There's a major question, Max, about when this crossing, Kerem Shalom, will actually open for aid distribution to allow these trucks straight into the Gaza Strip. For now, we're told by the IDF that is not on the table. That is not a decision that the Netanyahu government has made yet. Max?",

Despite the fact that these conversations have been ongoing, despite the fact that they continued those talks over the weekend, both the Republican and Democratic negotiator told me yesterday that they believe that they may not reach an agreement by the end of this week.

So that gives you a sense of both the desperation but also the reality for Zelenskyy as he comes to Capitol Hill today. This is not the scene that he found himself in about a year ago when he gave a joint address to Congress, when he was given an American flag, when he was greeted with a standing ovation. Instead, the moment he finds himself in is an intractable one really when it comes to domestic policy that, again, he cannot and does not have control over here in the U.S.",

Then the question is, in what context would it be phase out or phase down?We've got to remember during COP27, phase out of coal and phase down of coal was the big point of contention. They eventually agreed on phasing down of coal. That takes now again in the draft as well. And then fossil fuels also bought into the draft in terms of what we've been seeing, but we're running out of time. In 45 minutes, it would be officially into overtime. Now, what's interesting is there's a mention of how countries could bring down their greenhouse gas emissions. And it's basically like a menu or a laundry list, which includes the reduction of consumption of fossil fuels and also production. But it doesn't say that it's legally binding. So it's almost like a menu or a shopping list of what people could be using, Max. And that is what the point of contention is right now. We know that talks went overtime yesterday. They were discussing, you know, overnight in the early hours of the morning. Now we're going to be heading into a huge delay. And so many people are in the room that are pushing against this because they're very concerned about what the ramifications are.
