The fire has already burnedmore than one Northern acres making it the largest fire in the state`s history. And as of this recording, crews have only been able to contain 3% of it. There are four additional wildfires scorching across the Texas Panhandle damaging scores of homes, farm lands, and public utilities like power and water. Officials are battling for solutions to stop this historic fire. But they`re also tasked with figuring out how exactly this fire may have started, why it spread so quickly and why more wildfires seem to be spreading larger and faster than ever. To that last question, CNN recently spoke to a professor of Fire Sciences at the Imperial College of London to explain how climate change might be adding fuel to these wildfires. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "In order to have a wildfire, you need the three sides of a triangle, theoxygen, the fuel, and the ignition source. Climate change has a very strong effect in one of the sides of this triangle, the fuel. Heat waves are drying vegetation. We know that drier vegetation is much more flammable. Once it ignites, the flames are taller. And when it moves, it moves faster. Broadly speaking, there are two types of fires -- flaming wildfires. These are the ones that spread faster and are more concerning in terms of damage to people, and to property and to ecosystem. And the other one is smoldering. They propagate slowly, but they produce very toxic smoke. What is happening in Europe, what is happening in Australia and United States, there are so many changes that is very difficult to quantify. What is the climate? What is not. The top of the boreal and the Arctic, that`s Alaska, that`s Canada, that`s Siberia, we are seeing an increase of bad wildfires. That is for us, a clear sign of climate change. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Apparently, the bulky bear turned that house into a winter home. Now, springing up as spring arrives, squeezing its way into the open air. Clearly a tight fit for the trespasser, as it`s taking some extra effort to wiggle free. The commission says the video is a reminder to stay vigilant. As warmer weather arrives, be wary of bear dens and do your best to not disturb their slumber. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
