      "sentences": "Well, a jury has been seated. They will remain anonymous throughout this process because as we've seen in other Trump-related cases, when they're not anonymous, some of these jurors have faced pretty serious threats. Now, in a short time, we expect that they will get underway with opening statements. And the judge, apparently keen to move this along, wants to wrap those up today. But as you noted, Trump is clearly bringing the campaign to New York again today instead of spending the whole day in New Hampshire or another key state.And as you said, this is a choice. He does not have to be in court today. He did not have to attend any of the court proceedings that he has sat in on in the last 10 days. But he and his legal team, they appear to be making this choice as part of a way to amplify this larger narrative that he is somehow the victim of an unfair system. And at the beginning of today, we saw Trump's lawyer, Alina Habba, who is also his spokeswoman, spar with the judge over trying to, not have court on Thursday, because on Thursday, -- Trump's mother-in-law, they're holding a funeral for his mother-in-law. Now, the judge had already considered a request to move the whole trial back because of this funeral, denied that. The judge seemed a little irritated they were bringing it up today, but Habba did narrow her request to just Thursday. Now, that was denied. But even something small like that, administrative, where the judge is like, look, he doesn't have to be here. He has no role. And I already told you, we're not going to move these proceedings because of this funeral.  Something like that can help feed into this larger victimhood narrative. Now, these jurors, now that they have been selected, they were whittled down, actually, from a group of dozens. And it was interesting that in the course of selecting the jury, we learned that there were some Trump supporters, folks who had donated to him, his political opponents. A few even thought the election had been stolen. But again, they are anonymous. So, we're not going to reveal details about exactly who was selected. But now, they need to decide how much interest, damages Trump will pay to E. Jean Carroll. I will note that last spring, a jury found him liable for sexual abuse against E. Jean Carroll and that he defamed her. They awarded her $5 million. Now, she's asking for $10 million. This should only take a few days. But I will note, at that last trial that I covered, along with our colleagues, Trump did not attend even a minute of that case.",

And having covered many trials that relate to survivors of sexual abuse or sexual assault, this is likely going to be a very emotional time for her. It's unclear how many days he will show up. It's unclear if he's going to cooperate with the parameters that the judge has laid out in terms of putting limits on his participation. But I think we should remember, even when we're talking about the campaign or the potential damages, we also have to remember that there's a survivor in the courtroom there, someone that a jury has found was sexually abused. And it's a lot for her as well.",

But then he's allegedly going to be back in court tomorrow before another event in New Hampshire. Now, he did ramp up his schedule in New Hampshire after we saw that rise in polling from Nikki Haley. We know that his team is very concerned about what they have seen with Nikki Haley in this state. We have seen him sharpening his attacks. We have seen the campaign putting out a series of ads hitting her on immigration as well as Social Security and Medicare.These are the issues that they believe are critical to New Hampshire voters. Now, they do feel good coming off of Iowa. They weren't sure what that margin was going to look like. They had been tempering expectations, saying they thought that anything over 12 points would be historic and would be worth celebrating. Obviously, it was well above 12 points. The point of them wanting such a large margin was to set the momentum going into New Hampshire. They are looking at all the data today. I am told that they are going through their strategy, how exactly to hit Nikki Haley. They do not believe Florida Governor Ron DeSantis is a player in this state, but they do believe that Nikki Haley has been on the rise. The other thing I want to point out, I talked to one advisor this afternoon who said that they believe that Vivek Ramaswamy dropping out of the race here in New Hampshire  will help Donald Trump. They don't know how much he had in polling, but right now they are at a point where they believe every single vote counts, and they believe 98% of people who support Vivek Ramaswamy would turn to Donald Trump next after he dropped out.",

Independence can vote in the primary, and you have independents that go through a wide variety lot of self-identification when it comes to politics. You have independents who identify as conservatives, liberals, moderates. When they saw the polling from CNN, which showed that Nikki Haley had trimmed down Trump's lead to single digits, they saw the same thing that we saw, which was that 55% or Haley won 55% of moderates, while Donald Trump won 60% of conservatives.They knew that he could get the 60% of conservatives, but when it comes to New Hampshire, you just have such a large swath that could go either way. Again, because they identify as independents, but could be more left-leaning or right-leaning. Now, I will say that they are taking all of this into consideration, they being Trump's campaign. They launched a series of ads attacking Haley on immigration. I'm told that was to sure up that conservative base. They believe that Donald Trump has a grip on the conservative base. They wanted to make sure that they held on to that. The other thing, those ads on Social Security and Medicare, that's meant to target more moderate independents. They want to chip away at that. They know people are going to show up. They're going to show up. They're going to show up. They're going to vote against Donald Trump because they don't like him, but they want to chip away at that number and hope more Republicans come out than moderates or independents.",

So, one of those ways is she is changing her framing. We heard her a little bit last night talk about how she is viewing this as a two-person race.Specifically, she, it seems, has discounted Ron DeSantis as a candidate altogether. DeSantis started his day in South Carolina as opposed to here. She says that she is really looking forward to trying to challenge Trump. In particular, she painted a red line today. She said she's not debating anymore unless former president Trump is on that stage. We know he has not appeared at any point on the stage to this point. But take a listen to how, in her own words, she is framing this next phase of the campaign. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) NIKKI HALEY, PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE (R): When we know it's a head-to- head, you heard me last night say, look, we have a choice. Are we going to do more of the same? Are we going to go forward? And more of the same is not just Donald Trump. It's Joe Biden. Both of them are exactly the same. They're both in their 80s. They both put us trillions of dollars in debt. They both are dealing with investigations, that are distractions. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

I think she had a strong showing in Iowa. And now we're going into New Hampshire, where she's polling very well in single digits behind Donald Trump. And we had a new poll come out today that's showing she's neck and neck with Donald Trump. I think she's going to have a strong showing. And I think she's going to, you know, do very well.

      "sentences": "Well, it's clear that what we're seeing on the ground today is a significant shift in the course of this war effort that Israel has been running now for the past three months. We are seeing not only the defense minister, Yoav Gallant, saying in the clearest terms that the Israeli military has concluded its intensive ground operations in the north, also saying that that will soon happen in the southern part of the Gaza Strip around the area of the second largest city in Gaza of Khan Yunis.But at the same time as we are hearing the rhetoric, we are also watching the action on the ground match that rhetoric, and that is with the withdrawal of one of Israel's four divisions that have been operating inside the Gaza Strip. To put this in context, that could be somewhere in the range of 8,000 to 12,000 troops being withdrawn from the Gaza Strip in the northern part, but also some of the central part of the Gaza Strip. And this is a clear sign that Israel, after weeks of pressure from the United States, is finally bowing to that pressure, acknowledging that it needs to shift to a lower intensity phase of operations. And that is exactly what the defense minister, Yoav Gallant, outlined today, saying that the next phase of this operation will focus more on raids, on airstrikes, on special operations designed to continue to eliminate Hamas's lingering capabilities in the northern part of the Gaza Strip. But also in the southern part of the Gaza Strip to continue to go after Hamas's leadership. But amid this shift, what we are seeing is that Hamas still maintains the ability to fire rockets towards southern Israel, a barrage of at least 25 rockets hitting the southern town of Netivot along the Israel-Gaza border there. Most of those rockets intercepted by the Iron Dome system, but some of them were not, although no injuries were reported. And so amid that barrage of rockets, you're seeing already some criticism from right- wing members of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's governing coalition, notably Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, saying that it is an error that will cost lives to withdraw troops. But also Gideon Sa'ar, a member of the Israeli war cabinet, a member of the opposition who joined the war cabinet and is kind of a center-right politician, he also said that it is a mistake to reduce the strength of Israeli forces inside of Gaza at this critical moment.",

So, the preventative measure of striking those targets first before they could be used against shipping is part of the deterrence mechanism.Then later this afternoon at one San's time. the Houthis fired one missile at a cargo ship and struck it. So, I think they're trying to show that they haven't been completely depleted by the U.S. strikes, but they are still active in the area and they will still attempt to interrupt shipping in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden.
