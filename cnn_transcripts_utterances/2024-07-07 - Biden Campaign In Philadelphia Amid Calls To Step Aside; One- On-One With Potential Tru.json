But to the extent that he does have time to campaign, I think it is more important for him to be out there speaking directly to the public in an impromptu way.

I think that would be a much more effective way to answer people's questions than, you know, some medical test. The president will decide what the path forward is.

Donald Trump is set to be officially nominated at the Republican National Convention next week, where Trump has also said that he will announce his vice presidential pick.Here with me now from Miami is one of the top contenders, Senator Marco Rubio. Thank you so much for being here this morning. I want to start by looking ahead to just what's going to happen in the next couple of days for the GOP in Milwaukee. And that is delegates are meeting to adopt the 2024 party platform. For four decades, the Republican Party's platform endorsed a national abortion ban. Donald Trump opposes that as you well know. He thinks it should be left to the states. There are a lot of conservative groups who are not happy about the potential to change the platform. Do you support changing the official party platform to Trump's position that it should be a state issue? SEN. MARCO RUBIO (R-FL): Well, I think our platform has to reflect our nominee. And our nominee's position has actually happens to be one grounded in reality. The reality of it is the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. And what that basically means is that now it's not states, it's voters at individual states who will get to decide how and to what level they want to restrict abortion, if at all. Some states will have restrictions, some states will not. And so I hope that our platform will reflect our nominee. I also think it's important to remember the Democrats, their last platform, basically endorsed abortion paid for by taxpayers at any time without any restrictions. So I think really the question here is whether they are going to have a radical, you know, plank of their platform that basically requires Americans to pay for abortions at any time for any reason up until the moment of birth. That was their platform four years ago. Let's see what it looks like now --",

There's only one pro- life candidate in this race and it's Donald Trump. I think his position on this has been that the reality and that is you can't -- you can't pass a federal law now even if we wanted to. You couldn't pass one. But states -- not states, voters and individual states now have the ability to influence what abortion laws look like in their state and they can have that debate about how restrictive to what level, what exceptions and so forth. You couldn't even have that debate before the Supreme Court opened that up.
