People of the New Hampshire are casting their votes and the race is officially on. We'll take you to the polls. Also, ahead is a deal in sight. Reports now saying Israeli officials are more optimistic about an agreement that would see fighting stop in Gaza and hostages returning home. And later, lights, camera, action. Award season is upon us and the Oscar nominations have just been released. We'll tell you who's at the top of the leaderboard. Well everyone, live from New York, I'm Bianna Golodryga. Zain is off today. You are watching \"One World\". It's a fight to the finish, but of course there can only be one winner. And in a matter of hours, we should know who it is. Voters in New Hampshire are casting ballots in the first U.S. presidential primary and how they vote could ultimately determine the Republican nominee. It's a two-person race, and for Nikki Haley, the stakes could not be higher. This may be her final shot at beating Donald Trump. But despite the pressure, the former South Carolina governor appears confident and says she plans to stay in the race regardless of what happens today. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

The question, though, that they're askingeach other and are trying to learn is, how big will the margins be? And that's really the key here. You heard Donald Trump, you played that sound earlier of him telling voters, you need to turn out for me. Don't listen to the polls. Don't look at my commanding lead. Please turn out in a big way because margins matter. And that is definitely the mood that I'm hearing from my conversations with them. Another question as well is there have been some concerns about what New Hampshire will look like because of Nikki Haley's rise in the state over the past several weeks, especially among independents or as New Hampshire calls them, undeclared voters. They are able to participate in this primary and many of those people, really, are coming out for Nikki Haley. And actually, I spoke with many people here in Nashua at this polling location at Amherst Elementary School. I talked to some voters as they exited the polling location and it's been pretty surprising, Bianna. The majority of people I've spoken with -- I've talked to about 20 people now -- have said that they voted for Nikki Haley. There's a wide range of people from independent voters to Trump voters. There are some people, as well, who said that they voted for Donald Trump in the past but this election, they voted for Nikki Haley. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

And Israel as you reported has been proposing very, very far-reaching potential deals. Whereas, Benny Gantz, the leader of the Gadi Eisenkot Party which is more a Centrist Party have been stressing over and over really the top priority -- the way they see it is somehow getting back the hostages and making the point that the goal -- the other goal of the war dismantling Hamas. You know, that may take a long time and must not be stopped. I suppose the key point to make is none of these ministers with their slightly different views are recommending an end to the war. We're talking about, you know, short-term ceasefires or slightly longer ceasefires and the terms and the priorities. But when you talk about 130 hostages who need  to be brought home, you're also bearing in mind that at the moment tens of thousands of Israelis in Israel are displaced and cannot go home and won't be able to do so unless Hamas is radically weakened or dismantled as a military force.",

But the bigger question you're asking, I think, if you're into sort of Hamas' mindset, what is Yahya Sinwar thinking, I think he wants to believe that he can see this through, that he can survive. Israel has indeed largely eliminated Hamas as a fighting force in northern Gaza. But southern Gaza is much more complicated, that maybe where Sinwar is hiding out and Khan Younis may be surrounded by hostages. That's the focus of the fighting right now. And beyond that, Israel has yet to get to Rafah at the southern tip of the Gaza Strip, on the border with Egypt. Netanyahu has said, if we cannot ensure that that border is, if you like, immune to arms smuggling, then any effort to dismantle Hamas and demilitarize Gaza will be temporary. So that, you know, bringing security, if you like, to the Egypt-Gaza border is another war goal that requires negotiation with Egypt. That's incredibly complicated.

But the commander says sometimes it's all they can do. Every shell that is suitable for the Paladin we use, he says, it's better than no shells. The Russians face no such shortages in this area. Ukrainian military intelligence believes Russia produced around two million rounds last year and acquired around one million from North Korea. Massive barrages have laid waste to Bakhmut and much of the surrounding area. At the headquarters of the 93rd Mechanized Brigade's artillery division, the frustration is palpable. From their drones, they can see the Russians gathered to continue their assaults on Ukrainian positions, but they often can't take them out because they need to conserve ammunition, the commander tells me. The ratio is about 10 to one, he says. Ammunition is very important to us. Russia is a country that produces ammo. They have strategic reserves. Yes, they use old Soviet but Soviet systems can still kill. Even without enough ammo, the Ukrainians say they are stopping most Russian assaults here, and the M109 crew did manage to fire at Russian positions.
