There are obvious clouds over Donald Trump and now Joe Biden as both prepare for the 2024 campaign pressure on the Attorney General too. And as Congress demands answers, it's easy to see some hypocrisy. Our great reporters are back at the table and let's start there. The Trump investigation has been underway for months. You ask House Republicans about it, they say it's the Justice Department that's weaponizing the government to go after the former President. Listen here, this is the chairman of the new House Oversight and they call it the Oversight and Accountability Committee now. Listen to the distinction if there is one.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. JAMES COMER (R-KY): We've requested information just to see what was going on because I don't know what documents were at Mar-a-Lago. So, you know, that's something we're just waiting to see what comes out on that.",

But as heard there, reporters trying to ask him about various issues, including of course, about the classified documents drama swirling around this White House, he wouldn't take any questions. But I think what stood out to me was this emphasis on building on an existing relationship as opposed to starting anew, obviously both leaders mentioned the fact that last year the two of them had seen each other.This is a reference to the fact that the two of them saw each other both in Tokyo and then later in the year in Cambodia. And they talked about different areas of major cooperation, including the President mentioning the fact that Japan now has this new national security strategy which the U.S. has been largely supportive of, and this joint U.S.-Japan cooperate -- military cooperation agreement. They also talked about areas of economic cooperation as well. And it doesn't need to be said explicitly that so much of this has to do with trying to contain China. And the two countries believe that this is where there is ample room for cooperation, that the two countries can work together with other regional partners to contain China both militarily and economically as well. Now, when they do go into this bylaw and actually that meeting is happening right now, we of course, expect them to talk about other issues, like the ongoing war in Ukraine. Another area, of course, where the two countries feel like they can show support to Ukraine and discuss and deal with the global economic impact that the war has had all across the world. So again, this is a meeting where they are really emphasizing the strengthening of an existing alliance as opposed to building something from scratch, John.",

What they didn't expect was the storm to be so large and to hit so fast. So when you see the roof here ripped off, when you see the fact that all the insulation is just strewn everywhere.One woman told us that she was praying to God to get away from this storm. And at some point someone grabbed her and pulled her into a closet. So you can understand her fear. In fact, take a listen to a man who said he realized he had to run as well. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Officials there are already seeing widespread flooding from a little bit of rain that happened on Thursday night. They're now concerned that over the weekend, two major highways that lead into the peninsula there could be flooded and cut off traffic and essentially not allowing people to go in and out. We were there yesterday looking at some of the flooding in the agricultural areas. There were some homes that were already underwater. And officials were saying this is terrible for farmers, but it was allowing some of that water to flow out and create less pressure for the river there, and that leads to those highways that could potentially flood those highways. So a lot of damage here already happening and more expected this weekend. John?",
