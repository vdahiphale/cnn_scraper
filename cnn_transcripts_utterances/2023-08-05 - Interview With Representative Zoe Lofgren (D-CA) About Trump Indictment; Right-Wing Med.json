      "sentences": "You are live in the CNN NEWSROOM. I'm Jim Acosta in Washington. Good evening.New drama and a new deadline. And a new legal ruling in the latest indictment of Donald Trump. The federal judge overseeing Trump's election fraud case has responded to a court filing from Special Counsel Jack Smith late last night. Smith wants a protective order after Trump posted this last night. It says, quote, \"If you go after me, I'm coming after you.\" Smith wants the judge to stop Trump and his legal team from publicly discussing sensitive evidence and he's citing that social media post as one reason why. And the judge has now given the Trump team until 5:00 p.m. Monday to respond. A short time ago the judge denied their request to push back that deadline. Smith had called it an unnecessary delay. Joining us now to talk about this is Congresswoman Zoe Lofgren, a California Democrat who served on the January 6th Select Committee. Congresswoman, thanks very much for joining us. We appreciate it. Your sense of what has been taking place over the last 24 hours, the special counsel is asking the judge to issue this protective order to restrict Trump and his lawyers from publicizing sensitive evidence. And they're noting this social media post that came from Trump yesterday evening essentially leveling a threat. An unspecified generic threat. But I supposed some could infer that he was trying to send a warning to people involved in this case. REP. ZOE LOFGREN (D-CA): Well, yes, it certainly is an obvious reading of that. He's coming after people. Now I understand some of his supporters said it was in a political sense. But any ordinary person reading that would come to the conclusion that he would be coming after people he perceived as opposed to him. I think seeking this protective order is not unusual. There's a protective order already in the documents case in Miami. And it's not uncommon in criminal cases. If the special prosecutor is going to share all the evidence with the defendant, which is what he wants to do promptly, he needs to be sure that that won't be put out there in the public to intimidate witnesses, make people afraid to speak. And we do know that the ex- president has a record of threatening and demeaning other judges, their families, lawyers who are prosecuting. So this is not something that is just out of the air. And I think the special prosecutor has a legitimate concern that people who might speak up or would be afraid, that witnesses' testimony would be chilled. It doesn't prevent the president from speaking. It just prevents him from publicizing the evidence that he receives from the special prosecutor.",

If the former president can go out there and stir up a hornet's nest like he did with this social media post and it props the special counsel to say to the judge, we need some kind of protective order in this case.You can see where I'm going with this. The former president can continue to do this from now until there's a trial, and that would play right into his playbook, as you know all too well, of delay, delay, delay when he gets into legal hot water.",

But perhaps it's true. It has nothing to do with what the wheels of justice have to do. If prosecutors feel that he and have evidence to support that he's committed a crime, they have to charge that. They can't weigh the politics of this thing.Now it's pretty clear, I mean, he doesn't have strong defenses on many of these indictments. It looks like his biggest defense is to try and get elected and pardon himself. So that's another factor I think that's going on here.",

There were a few things that we did not uncover. For example, Mike Pence would not talk to us so we didn't know he'd taken contemporaneous notes. We didn't know that the president said he was too honest when he refused to go along with the president in overturning the election.We didn't know that there was a discussion about calling out the army to American cities if he succeeded in overturning the election. But for the most part, the scheme that the president, then president was at the center of, the multifaceted effort to overturn the election was what we uncovered. And I think it probably was of help to the special prosecutor. Obviously he would have to interview the witnesses himself. He couldn't rely on our interviews. But it looks like he went ahead and did that. And it was a pretty quick process for a federal investigation. Really less than a year.

It's almost an admission of dishonesty on the part of Trump.Yes, we would have liked to have heard from the vice president, although we did hear from his people and learned a lot. The other witness we don't know about, it doesn't look like Mark Meadows fits the description of any of the co-conspirators that are mentioned in the indictment. Now I don't know whether something about him is going to come later or whether he's a witness. If he is a witness, he knows a great deal. And we did try to speak to him.

In fact if you watch right-wing media, you might come away with a very different understanding of the indictments and the accusations against Trump.CNN's senior media reporter Oliver Darcy joins us now.

If you were to turn on FOX News or just listen to right-wing media, whether it's talk radio or visiting sites like Breitbart, you would see dark and really sinister language being used to describe these indictments. In that world, Joe Biden is an evil force. I don't say that lightly. He's an evil force in that world and he's nefariously using the Department of Justice as a weapon to target and unjustly potentially imprison his political opponent.Now of course, this is not what's happening. But in that world, millions of people are immersed. And so they're walking away with a very different picture of what's taking place with these Trump indictments. And it's really worrisome because this is the type of rhetoric of course that potentially leads to violence. When people feel the democratic institutions have been taken over by autocrats, people who don't believe in democracy, who have overthrown the democratic institutions and weaponized them, that's what leads to them taking action into their own hands. And that's what you saw after January 6th when people felt the election was stolen. And it raises alarm whether something similar could happen as Trump is prosecuted for these various charges, if people feel that the justice system is no longer representing American justice but has been weaponized and is, you know, at the hands of a tyrant.",

And, you know, that just raises alarm bells all over again like we saw in the days before January 6th when he was saying, you know, this could be wild.I mean, he does have an effect on his followers out there. And you know, what is remarkable about what you're saying about FOX is that FOX executives are said to be pressing Trump to take part in this first Republican debate.

And Trump seems to not like FOX very much these days. He doesn't think it's sufficiently loyal. And so over the past year, you've seen him attack FOX News, attack Rupert Murdoch, say the channel is basically becoming a leftist network which is of course preposterous. So FOX News now is hosting the first Republican debates later thismonth and Trump is effectively floating the idea of skipping it. Refusing to participate. And so you have FOX News executives, the president Jay Wallace and the chief executive Suzanne Scott, they dined with Trump on the night of his third indictment and they tried to persuade the Republican frontrunner to participate in their debate. But he's no longer seemingly a fan of that network and I think from his point of view, you know, he's leading the Republican field by a substantial number. So perhaps he's thinking, why risk that, why put that at risk by going on stage with people who are trailing him significantly.",

Since the years that came before the Civil War. But it's gone way beyond him. You know, I mean, we certainly saw in 2020, Republicans in the key state who are closest to administering the election, by and large defended the integrity of their own state elections, and we saw that there were people immediately around Trump who are now raising alarms, certainly more visibly than they did back in 2020. People like Bill Barr and Mark Esper.But in between the vast majority of both elected officials and rank- and-file Republican voters, have lined up behind Trump. I mean, we forget that the vast majority of House Republicans in 2020 voted to overturn the election, to reject the election results. Something like two-thirds of the Republican attorneys general joined a spurious lawsuit to overturn the election results. We see in the CNN polling 70 percent of Republican voters still say that Joe Biden was illegitimately elected. And now 60 percent say they describe January 6th as legitimate protest. This is a broad strain now in the party and it really does cause you to question whether if Trump is the nominee and loses in November, whether there would be any more resistance in the Republican Party than there was in 2020 to him trying to overturn the election in anything short of another full-scale physical assault on the Capitol itself.",

I believe since really for the last 15 years or so, the fundamental fissure between the two parties is between those who are comfortable with the way the country is changing demographically, culturally, and economically, and those who are alienated or fearful of it. And Trump has solidified the Republican identity, and solidified the Republican reliance on the voters who are most uneasy about the way the country is changing.You know, this last -- in one of his rallies after the election in 2020, in Georgia, he was in front of a virtually all-white rural audience and he said this is our country. And they are trying to take it away through stealing and rigging of elections. And it's clear that he ties this idea of election fraud in big cities to this broader concern among his predominantly white, predominantly nonurban, predominantly culturally conservative base, that they are losing control of the country. And I do believe that is something that is going to outlive Trump, whatever happens to him legally or politically in 2024.

And some of the women taking zuranolone even said they started to experience those symptoms improve as early as within three days of taking the medication. Now some women taking the drug experienced side effects like drowsiness and dizziness, but the drug was overall found to be safe and effective, and it is known that about one in eight women in the United States and about 17 percent of women globally experience symptoms of postpartum depression after giving birth.
