Tonight, U.S. VicePresident Kamala Harris and her running mate Tim Walz give the first sit- down interview of their campaign. What we learned about their day one plans, that's just ahead. Plus, we're following breaking news out of Ukraine. President Zelenskyy has just fired his Air Force chief. It comes just days after an F-16 jet crashed, killing a top pilot. We'll have a live update from Kyiv in just a moment. Then kids around the world heading back to school. But in Gaza, the classrooms are very different. My conversation with a teacher there about what she's doing to support her students. Now, right here on CNN, the Democratic nominee sat down for her first major interview since rising to the top of the ticket, by her side, running mate Governor Tim Walz. Now, CNN's Dana Bash asked her key policy questions including what Harris would do on day one in the Oval Office. Here's how Harris responded. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

When I look at the aspirations, the goals, the ambitions of the American people, I think that people are ready for a new way forward in a way that generations of Americans have been fueled by hope and by optimism. I think sadly, in the last decade, we have had in the former President, someone who has really been pushing an agenda and in an environment that is about diminishing the character and the strength of who we are as Americans, really dividing our nation.

Now, she's been relatively vague about what she means or she just means, more aggressive anti-trust enforcement, more resources for the federal trade commission, the DOJ, et cetera, that enforce anti-trust violations. Does it mean something more expansive than that about actually banning particular levels of price hikes? We don't really know.

This after a pilotwith the call sign Moonfish was killed in the crash of a U.S.-made F-16 fighter jet. Now, it's not clear if the two incidents are actually related. But the crash was a major blow, as you can imagine for Ukraine after it struggled for years to just get access to these western fighter jets. Now, the firing comes as Ukraine makes its pitch to the Pentagon about which enemy targets it wants to strike inside Russia. Earlier, Ukrainian Defense Minister Rustem Umerov met with U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin at military headquarters. Ukraine is pressing Washington to lift restrictions on the use of American long-range weapons on Russian territory. We have complete coverage of both of those stories. We're going to go to Washington, and also to Ukraine. Fred Pleitgen is in Kyiv for us, Oren Liebermann at the Pentagon. Fred, can you bring us right up-to-date?

      "sentences": "The key question of course, is what happened here. Ukraine has one of the most complex militaries inthe world, simply because of the various systems they have from so many different countries. The U.S. uses for obvious reasons, most of its own equipment, so, it's relatively easy to make that equipment talk to and communicate with each other, to make sure your air defenses don't target your own aircraft. In Ukraine's case, it's possible that that's a more complicated question, because they have different systems from so many different countries. On top of that, they're also facing massive Russian barrages. So, making sure your air defenses are coordinated with your aircraft, and we know that Ukraine has used F-16s for air defenses to shoot down Russian drones and Russian missiles when it can. It's a far more complicated question and a far more difficult task because of how much Russia is firing and because of all your different systems. So, the U.S. will try to sort through all of that information, and that in and of itself is a challenge. And then of course, there's what aid can the U.S. provide? The U.S. isn't likely to put service members on the ground to be a part of the investigation, but the U.S. is likely to be ready to answer any questions the Ukrainians have when it comes to what may have interrupted with an F-16 systems, where are the weak points in terms of the maintenance? How much is Ukraine flying these F-16s, are complex jets. The U.S. Air Force F-16s don't fly 100 percent of the time, they need to be down for maintenance routinely. So, all of this will go into an investigation into what is a major blow to Ukraine's Air Force to have lost their F-16s that they only got so recently.",

They have called the Kursk offensive an effort to create a buffer zone. But the Pentagon is still as clearly, still had questions about that. In terms of what they're pushing for today, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has been very public about that, saying at least part of this meeting is about trying to get the U.S. to ease or remove restrictions on the use of long-range U.S. weaponry, particularly the ATACMs which they've used effectively to strike targets in occupied Crimea. They want to be able to use that to strike targets deeper inside Russia. That's not where the U.S. wants these meetings' focused. The U.S. has, if you will, a bigger picture perspective, Russia has moved a lot of their targets outside of ATACMs range, so, it's not clear from the U.S. perspective what easing those restrictions will do in terms of hitting high-value targets that the aircraft that have launched these devastating glide bombs that Russia has used. Instead, they want the conversation on air defenses which the U.S. is very much trying to race there. And then they want to hear Ukraine's plan on what they're going to do with the Kursk offensive and the land they've taken there. And then how do you blunt this massive slow-grinding Russian offensive in eastern Ukraine, but one that is still gaining ground for Russia.",

And without a vaccination program that could happen, it could get into Egypt, it could get in other countries. When he was here, Secretary of State Antony Blinken was applying pressure on Prime Minister Netanyahu to give the pause, U.N. Secretary-General wanted a seven-day blanket complete full-on pause, that didn't happen. Prime Minister Netanyahu was really politically arguing very strongly in defense of his position that there would be no blanket pause.

His running mate says Trump could soon announce how he'll vote on a Florida amendment that would protect abortion rights. Remember, the President is a resident in Florida. And it comes a day after the former President signaled that he opposes Florida's six-week abortion ban. Now, Trump also announced a proposal to have IVF treatments paid for by the government or insurance companies defending his support of the procedure. On top of that, he defended a recent visit to Arlington National Cemetery to honor U.S. troops killed in Afghanistan three years ago. Trump insisted photos he took at the site were not used for political purposes. We want to get more on all of this now from CNN's Jason Carroll who is in Pennsylvania for us. Obviously, interesting continuing the early voting dynamic. I mean, I think they vote there in a few weeks in Pennsylvania. I do want to get to this issue though of abortion rights first. I mean, Donald Trump has been fairly coy about a few things and that includes how he will vote in Florida regarding the abortion issue. But then what some regard as well as a flip-flop on abortion rights altogether. JASON CARROLL, CNN U.S. NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, look, what the campaign is trying to make clear here, and that's simply because, you know, a lot of folks are saying the former President didn't make it clear. When it comes to what is going on in Florida the President's position is the following. He does not support a six-week ban. That is what the campaign is trying to make that point after Trump himself spoke about this and was not specifically clear about what sort of timeline he was talking about in terms of what would he support. That's why there's so much ambiguity there. But the broader issue here is this. What the campaign is trying to do is they're trying to appeal at this point to as many people as possible, including those people who turned away from the GOP, who turned away from the former President with the feeling that this is a party that is not receptive to those who respect Reproductive Rights. And so, that's why you see the former President now trying to find that sweet spot if you will in terms -- in terms of what to do with this -- with this initiative in Florida. And not surprising now he's come up with this new plan in terms of IVF treatment which is a new initiative that he's putting forth. He is saying that if he were to be reelected, his administration would see to it that any couple seeking IVF treatment would have that covered by the government. And if the government doesn't cover it -- cover it, then it would be the responsibility then of insurance to cover the full cost. Again, some questions still outstanding there in terms of where's this money going to come from, how is that going to be paid for. So, a lot of still outstanding questions here surrounding the topic of Reproductive Rights. Again, all in an effort to reach out to some of those voters who have left the fold.",

It'sworth noting gas prices are 13 percent cheaper than Labor Day weekend 2023. For more in all of this, we'll bring in CNN's Pete Muntean. Pete, you know, I'm a little surprised that this weekend is so busy. I kind of assumed a lot of the holiday travel, summer travel was over. I guess not.",

      "sentences": "So many people are just trying to shim in one last trip because it's been such a huge summer for holidaytravel or huge summer for travel just sort of in general. We saw an all- time air travel record here in the United States back on July 7th. That was just after the July 4th rush. Three million people screened at airports across the country. That's the biggest number they've ever seen in the history of the Transportation Security Administration. And the number today will come pretty close to that. The TSA tells me they were expecting 2.86 million people at airports across the country. Now they've resized that number to be closer to 2.9 million people. Here at Reagan National Airport, they're expecting 40,000 people to pass through security checkpoints like this one and the three others at this airport. It's a number that they've not seen even before the pandemic. So, travel is really so big right now. It's not just the pent-up post-COVID demand. It's not just the Taylor Swift phenomenon, people wanting to get out and get abroad to catch up a little bit of the last part of the Eras Tour. So many people are just really trying to book and shim in one more trip. The big story here on the East Coast of the United States is that there was a lot of bad weather moving through the Mid-Atlantic late last night, and so Airlines have been mostly in recovery mode today. There were a lot of cancellations. Here at Reagan National Airport, about one in five flights canceled. At Washington Dulles which is the big international hub here for the D.C. Metro area, about a third of all flights delayed. At Philadelphia International Airport, a big international hub for American Airlines. I want you to listen now to passengers though who are really taking all of the challenges in stride and grateful for that one last chance to get away this summer. Listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
