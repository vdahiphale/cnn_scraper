Despite all of that, it's clear that there are still other issues to resolve. And sometimes even minor issues can ultimately hold up a final agreement. So the caution is important here as we head into what will be a critical, less than two weeks until the start of Ramadan. That is a very short timeline, given the number of issues that still need to be resolved. But it's clear that both parties at least seemed to be engaging in these negotiations. We know that the head of Hamas was in Qatar yesterday. An Israeli delegation over the last couple of days has been there as well and that there are still ongoing talks about this.

But more so for the old guard Republican Party, the Reagan Republicans. You go back about 20-25 years, that's who she's speaking for right now. Two numbers to think about, though. First number is she got 40 percent of the vote in South Carolina. That means Donald Trump didn't get 40 percent of that primary vote in South Carolina. That is troubling for Trump. Question is, can she repeat that in Michigan? That's still to be seen. Of course, we'll see that over the next week starting tonight. Second number is not necessarily a number but it's how much money she can raise. And we are still seeing people donating to Nikki Haley. We saw the Koch brothers, a very large international conglomerate that had been funding her through a super PAC here. But the fact of the matter is people are still donating to her, even though that super PAC has stepped down. So look, she's going to be around for the next 2-3 weeks at minimum.

In central and southern Gaza, hundreds crowding the beaches, to try and secure their piece of the rations. But this is the other side of desperation, groups of men wielding whips and bats, steering crowds away from their precious cargo. Months of hunger and war triggering fights for survival, when there is not enough for everyone. This is what they are fighting over, ration packs, a lifeline for the lucky few.

There's a lot of talk about relocating people from Rafah, which are about 1.5 million Palestinians right now. Have you seen any plans to evacuate? Would you be involved in that?",

Well, mourners gathered outside the Israeli embassy in Washington on Monday to remember the Air Force member who lit himself on fire there in protest on Sunday. The Air Force says he was 25-year-old airman Aaron Bushnell. In a video from just before the incident, Bushnell said he, quote, \"would no longer be complicit in genocide\" and that his suffering was minimal compared to the plight of Palestinians in Gaza. Bushnell then lit himself on fire and later died from his injuries. At the Pentagon, reporters asked if there could be more members of the U.S. military with similar feelings. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

BRIG. GEN. PATRICK RYDER, PRESS SECRETARY, DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE:  Well, look from a Department of Defense standpoint, since Hamas' brutal attacks on October 7th, we've been focused on the four key areas that the secretary set out from the onset. That's protecting U.S. forces an citizens in the region, supporting Israel's inherent right to defend itself from terrorist attacks, working closely with Israel to support and secure the release of hostages from Hamas and ensuring that the crisis, the conflict between Hamas and Israel, doesn't escalate.

But the two that are top of mind is how lawmakers are going to come together to try to avert a government shutdown and also how they're going to pass the national security supplemental package that would provide the necessary aid for Ukraine in its fight against Russia. Now we know that Biden usually finds that these meetings that he has with congressional leaders, he finds them to be productive and that they can really get down to the heart of the issue and try to come together in somewhat of a bipartisan fashion. But there is a lot at stake here. We know that funding is running out when it comes to certain entities within the government. And so that is a top priority. And Biden has been very adamant about lawmakers passing more funding for Ukraine. Now at this time, House Speaker Mike Johnson has said that he's not interested in taking up this bill if they don't address border security and finding provisions and fundings to address some of the issues alongside the border. And we know that Biden is actually going to the border at the later end of this week. So these are things that come to top of mind. The White House -- House officials are saying it's a top priority and that they're expecting to see in the days ahead.",

So this is, this is space travel. This is what it takes to try to do something as crazy as landing on the surface of the moon. And yes, it was done by the United States more than half a century ago. But these are new people in the control room, new hardware. And for each company, they have to get these growing pains out for themselves. So I think that's what we're seeing here.",
