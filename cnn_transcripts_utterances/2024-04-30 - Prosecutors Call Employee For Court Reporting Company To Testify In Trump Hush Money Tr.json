So now, we're starting to see this evidence that they had to get in through some of these lesser-known witnesses. Applying to the main plotline here. And Mr. Davidson will likely talk about receiving that payment and how it was reimbursed.

And he was pushing Michael Cohen and thereby pushing Trump very hard to come up with the money. And Michael Cohen went so far as to set up an LLC, which was testified by the banker this morning, to actually receive money to get back to Donald, to get -- to get -- to be a pass through, so to speak for the $150,000 from Trump and the Trump organization back AMI.

I think they want the message sent out there that they're not here willingly. They're here under subpoena.
