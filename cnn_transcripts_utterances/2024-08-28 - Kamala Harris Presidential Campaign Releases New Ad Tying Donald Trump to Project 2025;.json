Kamala Harris and Donald Trump both being accused of flip-flopping on a lot of different issues. She's talking about spending hundreds of millions of dollars on a wall on the southern border, something that she called un-American during the Trump administration. She says now that she does not support the electric vehicle mandate while in the Senate, she was in favor of eventually outlawing petrol powered cars. Donald Trump for his part, has plenty of things he's flip-flopped on, banning TikTok, and now he's totally in favor of TikTok, demonizing undemocratic undocumented immigrants, and now he's saying, oh, they should get visas if they go to college. What do you make of flip-flopping in this new political climate that we're in? Does it matter? Or is there a way for candidates to try and say, look, they've evolved?",

And so I think that is a natural part of the ebb and flow as it relates to that.I think beyond the statements, you have to have explanations about why you've evolved, and why your position has changed about that. I mean, that's just the nature of the beast. But I think, again, for Vice President Harris, she also has a record of achievement, particularly here in Georgia as part of the Biden-Harris administration that has brought unprecedented funding to cities directly, which places like Savannah appreciate. They have invested in time, but also in people, and so that's meant a lot to us, particularly as we have dealt with some of the most challenging times in recent history through the pandemic, through trying to revive and reengage.

With us now, the former chief of Organized Crime and Gangs Section for the Department of Justice, Attorney Jim Trusty. Counselor, thank you so much for being with us. Jack Smith changed this indictment, no longer referring to Donald Trump as the 45th president of the United States, but calling him a candidate for president, taking out the charges and references to conversations he had with people in the Justice Department.

It's paring back the indictment to try to anticipate how the judge would rule on this official acts quandary that he finds himself in after the Supreme Court case on immunity, that basically says personal acts are prosecutable, but official acts are not.So he's anticipating that, but it's really interesting because the opinion says not just that immunized information is not properly before the court at trial, but that it contaminates the grand jury process if you include that information in pursuing an indictment that's a huge land mine. He's trying to get in front of it before Judge Chutkan has to rule on all of these acts to decide which stuff is fair game or which stuff isn't. But the problem is if he guesses wrong in one instance, like in other words, if he says, oh, the president was consulting Mike Pence as president of the Senate, not as vice president, which is part of this new indictment. Then if he gets it wrong once he's got the same problem, he's got to go back to the grand jury, re-indict for the third time based on this ruling coming from the Supreme Court. So it's interesting, it's taking the initiative, but it doesn't necessarily make it a bulletproof indictment.",

And you can call it lawfare and I certainly have called it that, it tends to make the judges bristle. The judges are becoming the safety valve. They have to look at questions they've never had to address and figure out, are we going to let this proceed? So I think if you look at the Jack Smith prosecutions, both of them now have significant legal issues. Obviously, down in Mar-a-Lago, the case was dismissed and that appeal is being pursued by the government. You've got the immunity question and frankly the same question about Jack Smith's authority that could be raised in DC on the January 6th case. So, they may die of their own weight without any sort of political interference because they're inventive, because they're reaching for new territory. But if not, I guess we'll see whether the incoming Democratic administration to follow up your hypothetical, whether they have the stomach to let that stuff continue or whether they will look better if they end up just washing and cleaning and saying, let's have a new chapter.

It says, \"I'm close to finishing a manuscript and I began asking experts like yourself to review these chapters.\" Now, it takes you to a link that instead of showing you a manuscript, it actually shows you -- it unleashes malware into your systems and gets these hackers who work for the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps access to your computer.
