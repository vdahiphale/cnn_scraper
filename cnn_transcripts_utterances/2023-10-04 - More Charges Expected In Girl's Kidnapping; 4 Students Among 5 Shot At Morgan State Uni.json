They were just caught in the middle. And it's really a stunning situation for the people who go to school in this community.

But we also know, Pam, that this woman isn't the first or the only -- I'm sorry -- the only to come forward alleging that the CIA mishandled her claims of sexual assault. We know that the Senate and House Intelligence Committees are both looking into this issue, as is the CIA inspector general.

It's unclear if it will come to pass.But I asked Mr. Lawler whether or not he believes Matt Gaetz should be expelled from his conference. He said, \"In my opinion, yes.\" He called his conduct, in his view, quote, \"disgraceful.\" This comes as a number of allies of Speaker McCarthy have railed against Matt Gaetz and said what he did was beyond the institution, was beyond the pale. They accused him of using a personal vendetta to go after Speaker McCarthy, to boost Gaetz's personal and political profile, boost his fundraising, and the like. Many want nothing to do with him or for him to serve in the Republican Conference. Those allegations, of course, Gaetz has denied. He said this is not personal. He says this is not about an ethics investigation he is facing, but it's simply about, in Gaetz's view, McCarthy is not keeping his promise on a whole range of issues, including over the issue of federal spending. Nevertheless, this fight still continues to linger. And there are tons of raw feelings within the House GOP conference over all the historical and unprecedented events of yesterday and McCarthy's ouster as Republicans try to figure out what is next. One of the question questions, if how can a new speaker, if and when they're elected as soon as next week, can work with some of the folks like Matt Gaetz and people had help push out Kevin McCarthy, if the threat to push out the new speaker continues, to kick McCarthy out, given that one member can call for his ouster. And, Pamela, that's a big question right now. One thing some members are pushing for is to get rid of that tool altogether to push for the speaker's ouster. And just moments ago, Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell endorsed calls for the House to get rid of that rule, to call for the ouster of a sitting speaker. We'll see what the speaker candidates do as they line up the votes right now behind the scenes to succeed Kevin McCarthy -- Pamela?",

We've learned from our sources that that mountain of legal debt is only set to increase by a magnitude of millions of dollars if some of these cases go to federal trials, if Hunter is not able to reach a settlement in some of these cases. Financiers like longtime friend and Hollywood attorney, Kevin Morris, are no longer able to bankroll Hunter's legal efforts. Now Hunter's team is trying to get creative. There's an expectation that could go to deep-pocketed Biden allies to try to shore up his financial position, to try to fill that hole and raise some of that money. For the last several months, his team has been considering the idea of launching a formal legal defense fund. It would have been run by an ethics attorney. It would have been by the book to closely monitor where money is coming in from and where it is going out to. We're told the White House seriously pushed back against that. They were very leery of the possibility that they could be seen as breaching campaign finance laws or just generally in an ethical gray area. The legal defense fund, we're told, has gone quiet for now. That doesn't mean his team isn't going to try to get creative and find that money somewhere -- Boris?",
