So she walks in wearing a long gray trench coat. She has the rifle hidden under the trench coat. Churches are usually a kind of welcoming environment, come one, come all.And when she gets to that hallway, she tries to enter a door that would go to the choir area, but that's locked. And at that point, she takes the gun out, opens fire, at some point yells, \"I have a bomb.\" She has this backpack. So these officers step forward and engage and that's when more than 40 rounds are fired back and forth in the middle of this hallway as people scatter for cover. It is amazing, if not a miracle, that more people weren't wounded in this. And whatever was planned for this incident, whatever her ultimate tactical plan was going in, it was interrupted by the presence of these two armed security people.",

It was in this hall, because there were 26 people killed, 22 injured at Sutherland Springs where you also had an intervention by law enforcement.And in this case, it's incredibly sad what we're talking about here, this young boy, seven years old, one person who was shot in the leg who's been released, the casualty is pretty low considering what they could have been, though, John.",

But it's certainly some of the things they're thinking about, as well as what was having a backpack that purported - that was made to look as if she had a bomb, even though there were no explosives found in it, was that something that she could use to hold off people from opening fire.

So if this shooter had ever been arrested for a criminal offense, that gets reported into the national database, and that would come up on the NICS check, the federal pre-purchase gun background check, so that's one.The second is the detention. If she was, in fact, adjudicated to be detained against her will for mental health reasons, that also, if it was adjudicated, should go through the system and end up hitting on the background check at the same time. If this person had weapons taken away from them, like, for instance, because of the action of a red flag law or something like that, that wouldn't necessarily detain them or prevent them from purchasing weapons permanently would - during dependency of that red flag action. But what we have here is a person who, from preliminary information, there seem to be several reasons that should have prevented her from legally purchasing a firearm. Now, we know there's many other ways to purchase or come in possession of firearms in this country without going through the federal background system. You can go to gun shows and buy guns without passing a background check. You can purchase weapons and deals between citizens one at a time, no background check required. So the system is very porous.",

The Arab leader is expected to press Biden on a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas. But on the other side, Biden is facing a resistant Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu. CNN has learned that Biden is growing more frustrated with Netanyahu and Israel's tactics in Gaza.Netanyahu, for his part, is vowing to go after Hamas in their last refuge of Rafah in southern Gaza. But Rafah is also the last refuge for roughly a million - more than a million, Palestinian civilians. That's why the U.S., the U.K. as well as other allies are all urging Israel to scrap that planned offensive. Now, it hasn't started yet, but Rafah was bombarded overnight heavily, Israel launching ground and air operations, which were part of a successful operation to free two hostages from Hamas captivity in Rafah. But in the process, dozens of Palestinians were reportedly killed. Joining us now is Israeli government spokesman, Avi Hyman. Avi, thank you so much for joining us. Israeli forces pulled off a remarkable rescue of these two older men, getting them out of Rafah. Of course, everyone happy that they're home. We saw those scenes of joy earlier today. But at the same time, scores of Palestinian civilians were killed in that bombing of Rafah. So how does the Israeli government make that calculation? What amount of collateral damage is acceptable to rescue a hostage?",

We were very, very happy to see that sight. I am not aware - I am aware that scores of terrorists were killed, scores of Hamas people were killed.

There was a lot of terrorists trying to make sure that we didn't free those hostages.But we needed to send a message to Hamas, we needed to send a message to Israel and to the entire world that we care about every last hostage. We said from day one that we will destroy Hamas and we will bring home every last hostage.

The Prime Minister has asked for a plan to be put forward to evacuate the civilians of Rafah. Our fight is not with the people of Gaza, it is with Hamas. We have taken out 18 out of 24 Hamas battalions. There are four more in Rafah. If we don't go into Rafah, we lose the war, simple as that.
