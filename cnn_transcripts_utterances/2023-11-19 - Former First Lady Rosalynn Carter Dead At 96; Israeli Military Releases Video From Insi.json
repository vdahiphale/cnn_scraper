I remember covering him, you know, when he was president of the United States, and I was a young reporter. And during the Camp David Peace Accords between Israel and Egypt, you know, he was very much involved in working to bring peace between Israel and Egypt, the largest and then most important Arab country, and he succeeded. And you know who was there with him side by side at Camp David almost every step of the way? It was Rosalynn Carter who was deeply involved and she was a peace maker all of her years, during her years at the White House and ever since. Peace was so important. And I could see that then and certainly in more recent years when I went down to Plains to interview them. I could see that as well.

And they were deeply, deeply loved, deeply respected.And I have to give Rosalynn Carter a lot of credit for all the achievements that President Jimmy Carter did because she was by his side. And even, you know, I remember on Friday when we were reported that the Carter Center had announced she was going into hospice, and he was already in hospice since early this year, it was just a moment I figured they would be together. And they were together all the time. They would spend a lot of quality time together all the time. And it was just a moving moment for me in simply reporting that they had announced she was in hospice. She had been suffering from dementia for several years. And President Jimmy Carter is almost 100 years old, and he had been suffering from various illnesses, and she was always there to take care of him, to be by his side. I'm sure, you know, now that she has passed, you know, he's missing her a lot, and it's a very sad moment for me to just try to comprehend what President Carter is going through right now without his wife by his side.

Yes, sure, there were political differences when he was president and when he was defeated in his bid for re-election, but I think most people, especially now, look back on what they did not only as president but as former president and all the good deeds that they did, and they admire them greatly.

And when her husband's team told her not to because it was politically inconvenient for them, she was going up against the chairman, Ted Kennedy, who was challenging her husband in the 1980 primary, historic.

We all support a cease- fire, we all want to have a world where people on both sides of the border live in peace and have hope about their future.But a one-sided cease-fire doesn't deliver that peace either in Israel, in Gaza, in the West Bank, and more broadly in the region. You know, I think we're seeing some movement of the Arab countries against Hamas and supporting Israel's right to be a state which is remarkable, and, yes, there's some real concern on the ground about making sure that as Hamas hides behind civilian casualties, we don't cause any more civilian casualties than have to be there.
