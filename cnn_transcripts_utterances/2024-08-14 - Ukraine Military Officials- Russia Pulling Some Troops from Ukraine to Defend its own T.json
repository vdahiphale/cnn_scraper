The Middle East on tender hooks, as the region looks to Doha, where ceasefire talks are expected to resume without Hamas.

These are, well, a mix to better look, as far as the futures are concerned, indicating a better opening. We've had some inflation data out should convince investors that the Fed will be cutting rates at its next meeting, not confirmed, of course, as of yet, but that inflation data should spur these markets higher at the open. Well, Ukraine claiming new advances inside Russia and says it has seized almost as much land in its week long offensive as Russia has taken this year. Ukrainian military officials say Russia is pulling some of its forces from Southern Ukraine to the East Kursk border region and now the neighboring Belgorod region has declared a state of emergency as thousands there flee. CNN's Fred Pleitgen has reported extensively from Ukraine. He joins us from Berlin at this point. We are a week into what was this surprise offensive a surprise to Russia clearly, a surprise to many of, if not all of Ukraine's Western allies. Kyiv says it is taking more Russian territory, while the Kremlin says it shot down more than hundred Ukrainian drones. From your position and speaking to your sources on the ground, what's the state of play with regard the fighting at this point?",

One of the things that we saw earlier today is that the President of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, had a video call with his top general, Oleksandr Syrskyi, where Syrskyi then said that the Ukrainians had already advanced another one to two kilometers into Russian territory just this morning alone. So, on Wednesday, another one to two kilometers just as this day has started. So certainly, the Ukrainians saying that they are still very much on the move there. Zelenskyy then also said the Ukrainians are consolidating those gains. They do say that they're getting the services there back up and running, that they're obviously also, to a certain extent, digging into some of those places that they're capturing. We've seen some videos also over the past couple of hours, of Ukrainian forces in some of the smaller towns and villages in the Kursk area, raising the Ukrainian flags and going through those towns, sweeping those towns, seeing if there's any more Russian forces left in them. The Ukrainians also saying that just on this day alone, on Wednesday, hundred Russians have already surrendered. The Ukrainians, of course, hoping to exchange prisoners of war that they take for Ukrainians who are in captivity. There's another set of things that we're looking at as well at Becky is the Russians now saying that they are making more use of their own aviation, that their air force is dropping glide bombs, which, of course, have been very effective in other areas of the front lines. However, the Ukrainians this morning also say that they shot down a Russian plane, a Russian attack aircraft called a Sukhoi Su-34 also in the Kursk region. So, as you can see, a very dynamic situation that continues to unfold. And the Ukrainians really putting on the press right now also saying that overnight, they attacked several airfields in Russia as well Becky.",

U.S. President Joe Biden laid out a three-phase deal in May. First, a six week pause in the fighting, a withdrawal of Israeli forces from populated areas in Gaza and a limited hostage prisoner exchange. Phase two would see the release of all remaining living hostages and a permanent end to the fighting, a permanent ceasefire. And finally, the reconstruction of Gaza. But since July, there has been little progress on reaching that deal. Mediators are expected to put forward a bridging proposal at the talks tomorrow. CNN's Ben Wedeman is in Beirut, and that is where we saw Amos Hochstein speaking earlier, and I'll get to you shortly Ben. Nic in Tel Aviv for us today.

      "sentences": "Becky, it's very hard to say, because Hamas is engaged in ambiguity. Israel is engaged insilence. And I think you know there's been a lot of pressure on both sides. But really it will be Israel that's the first to go at the talks tomorrow. They -- they're -- all they have always been proximity talks. Israel and Hamas have never been in the same room. The mediators go talk with Israel, and then separately, the mediators go talk with Hamas. And in many ways, even within the context of the ambiguity that Hamas is putting down, it is very much the same scenario. But Hamas has the added caveat that they will only talk with the mediators if Israel, in their words, is serious about the proposals that they're going to hear from the mediators. And in that context, it means that they don't want Prime Minister Netanyahu adding anything additional. We know the Head of the Mossad, David Barnier, will be at those talks. But we understand at the moment, it might just be him. He might not have a larger delegation with him, as we've seen at other talks. How significant or not is that we don't know. But I think when you stand and look at the situation right now, we've been here many times before, and if you judge it by past practice, past evidence of what we've seen happen, there will be very little change at these talks. I do think that's where we're at right now. And Hamas's position here to only engage if they think Israel is serious, really makes the stakes higher and puts more pressure on Israel at the talks, simply because they get to go first. They meet with the mediators first, and the mediators hear from them first, and Hamas will have a chance to react or not react to that as they desire.",

      "sentences": "Yeah. Becky, this morning, I was in contact with a source who was very close to a Hamasleader, who is privy to the details of the negotiations, and basically said -- they said, at this point, our position is not to have a position on whether to participate or not in these proximity talks. He told me, and this is one part of his statement, is that the ambiguity is the movement's position, which was announced in its latest statement. It is intentional and did not come by chance. It comes as a result of Netanyahu's behavior. He said that if it's just talks for the sake of talks, meetings for the sake of -- sake of meetings, Hamas isn't interested. They want to see an end to Israel's military aggression, as it describes it. They want to see a complete withdrawal by Israel from Gaza. They want to see those hundreds of thousands, almost 2 million, people, who have been displaced repeatedly in Gaza, to be able to return what remains of their homes. And I think they -- there is -- in this my interaction with this source, there's real frustration that they feel that Netanyahu keeps changing his conditions to an agreement that Hamas insists it has already agreed upon. And there's also growing frustration with the Biden Administration, which, on the one hand, expresses concern over the horrendous bloodshed in Gaza, but at the same time, we are hearing that it's approved $20 billion in weapons sales to Israel. Of course, those weapons won't be delivered for several years, but the optics seem to be all wrong, as far as not just Hamas, but many in the region would feel. Because the feeling is that the United States has all the power and leverage to put pressure on Israel to insist that it reaches an agreement. But instead of putting pressure on Israel, it seems to be sending these signals that, yes, we'll provide you with ever more weapons, ever more diplomatic cover. So, in my interaction with this source, it definitely felt that they have very little confidence that these talks tomorrow in Doha, whether they attend or they don't attend, participate or don't participate, will come to anything Becky.",

CNN's Steve Contorno is covering the Trump campaign for us, and he joins us now from Florida. So, when the voter says they just trust Donald Trump more than they do.

But Donald Trump again during that interview with Elon Musk, waited until the end of a two-hour interview to actually bring that up himself. So just there's such disconnect between what the campaign wants Donald Trump to focus on the areas where they feel like they have the upper hand, and yes, Donald Trump has not necessarily been out there touting an economic message. You know, he has said things like he wants to get rid of taxes on tipped wages, and that he would try to, you know, get his arms around inflation, things like that, but not very much detailed policy.

They are a little bit higher. A key U.S. economic gage released just last hour shows a number that hasn't been seen almost 3.5 years. The latest CPI, or Consumer Price Index, indicates prices increased 2.9 percent for the 12 months ending in July.

We saw all these massive drops in the stock market, and things have calmed down so much in large part because of the inflation picture. Yesterday better than expected numbers on wholesale inflation, and today, we have this better-than-expected Consumer Price Index, as you mentioned, the big milestone here is sub 3 percent inflation, 2.9 percent look at that chart. This same metric was at 9 percent just about two years ago. That's when gas prices were at $5 a gallon. And we can see a massive improvement initially, and a little bit more of a gradual one, but going in the right direction. And when you dig into some of these numbers, there is a lot to like. We saw price drops on things like gasoline, appliances, new cars, used cars, 11 percent cheaper than a year ago. And one of the things that I pay attention to is the price of suits. We saw a 12 percent drop in the price of suits. Now this is not to say everything is great. Of course, some things are still too expensive, car insurance, the cost of shelter, and overall, I mean prices overall, they're not necessarily going down, they're just going up at a more gradual pace. But Becky, this is exactly what the Federal Reserve wants to see, right this is going to give them even more confidence that inflation is going back towards normal and that they can lower interest rates, and that, of course, would be good news for consumers because it means lower mortgage rates and car loans credit card rates, but it also would be good news for Wall Street, where they are hoping for not just one interest rate cut, but multiple rate cuts in the coming months, Becky.",
