We are also told that Santos and McCarthy met last night in McCarthy's office where the idea did come up, and then, Santos informed the rest of the party of his decision during a closed- door conference meeting earlier this morning saying he wants some of these controversies and investigations to be resolved until he does serve on those two assignments. So, small business committee and the science committee as well.Here is a little bit of McCarthy's reaction to all of that. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY (R-CA): We had a discussion and he asked me if he could do that. So, I think it was the appropriate decision. He will have a voice here in Congress. And until he answers all of those questions, then he'll -- at that time, he'll be able to be seated on committees. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

But this has all become a huge distraction for Republicans. It has become a huge political liability.And it also comes as Republican leaders are struggling to lock down the votes to kick Democratic Congresswoman Ilhan Omar off of her committee. So, perhaps Santos deciding to temporarily relinquish his committee seats could alleviate some pressure on Republicans. But one other thing I want to point out here, Kasie, is that up until this point, Santos has been really defiant. So, we are starting to see a little crack in that, but he is still refusing to step down as a congressman. He is refusing to resign and he continues to insist that he did nothing wrong or illegal.

It really does go to show you that there is clearly some pressure building on him within the Republican conference, otherwise, there's no way this would be happening. Melanie Zanona, thanks very much as always for your reporting. Really appreciate it.Meanwhile, Americans spend the most money on health care, but it is not paying off. A new report shows that people here in the U.S. actually have worse health outcomes compared to people in other high- income countries. And the bad diagnosis doesn't stop there. CNN Medical Correspondent Dr. Tara Narula joins us now to talk some more about this. Dr. Narula, always great to see you. There are several alarming findings though that we got to break down here. First, let's just walk through. I mean, how much more are Americans spending on their health care? DR. TARA NARULA, CNN MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: A lot more. So, this data basically compared the U.S. to 38 other high-income countries. And when you look at the numbers in general in America, we are talking about $11,911. And you can look at the full screen, compare that with most of the other countries where we are talking about more in the range of $5,000, $6,000, $7,000. In South Korea, it is as low as $3,900. So, clearly, the expenditures here are very, very high. And when you talk about outcomes, which I know we will, it makes it a hard pill to swallow to see how much we're spending and how poor the outcomes.",

NARULA: Well, here in this country, we have the highest infant and maternal mortality rate. We have the highest mortality rate when it comes to preventable or avoidable conditions. We have the highest death rate from assaults, and that includes gun violence. Highest rates of obesity. Third highest rate of suicide. And in general, the highest rate of chronic conditions, multiple chronic conditions. So, really not a great picture from this report.",

NARULASo, going forward, as I said, we really need to invest in expanding health care coverage, decreasing costs, investing in prevention, because we talked a lot about these chronic conditions as well as social services. I will say the one bright spot of this report is that America does very well when it comes to cancer screening and treatment, particularly breast and colon cancer and also, flu vaccine up take. So, there was some positive here.",

You can see they've already started to dig out some of the sand there where they can eventually do the burial. That will take place later on this evening.What is really alarming, not just to see that this whale had beached himself, but this has happened several times, at least eight whales have beached themselves over the past several weeks in the New Jersey/New York area, which obviously has a great number of people, especially environmentalists alarmed wondering what is going on here. I want to bring in Don Clavin. He is the town supervisor here in Hempstead and he has been watching this since 6:30 yesterday, is when this huge mammal beached himself, 6:30 a.m. yesterday, died about half an hour later, correct?",

Police in Texas are investigating a string of suspicious incidents over the past several weeks and it now includes the apparent theft of two monkeys. All of this started on January 13th when a clouded leopard disappeared for several hours, prompting a frantic search and the closure of the zoo. She was later found near her habitat.But around the same time, officials discovered damage to a fence holding langur monkeys. Now, none of them were harmed or escaped. But then, last weekend, this endangered lappet-faced vulture named Pin was found dead from \"unusual circumstances\" inside his enclosure. Pin was just one of four lappet-faced vultures at the zoo. He had been living there for 33 years. And finally, just yesterday, officials reported that a pair of emperor tamarin monkeys were apparently stolen after their habitat was \"intentionally compromised.\" Dallas police earlier today tweeted a picture of this man and his Doritos, who they say they would like to talk to in connection with those missing monkeys. They also released the surveillance video showing him at the zoo. Joining us now is Ron Magill. He is a long-time wildlife expert, conservationist and communications director at Zoo Miami. Ron, thanks for being with us. I mean, have we seen anything like this before? I mean, what is going on?",

And generally speaking, animals, if they do escape from a habitat, they generally, like what was suggested with the clouded leopard, they stay around that habitat because that's where they find their security, that's where they find their food, that's where they know how to live. So, they stay around that habitat. And like they do like with the clouded leopard, they usually are found close to the habitat.What is strange about these monkeys is that they're not being found. And my concern is, in Dallas now, it's in the 30s. These are tropical monkeys. There's small prime ape, it's only a pound, nine, 10 inches long. They're from the tropical forest of the Amazon basin. They're not going to survive in Dallas weather at 30 degrees without the specific food and comfort that they need that's given to them by the Dallas Zoo.",

And the lappet-faced vulture is one of the largest of the world's vulture. To have an animal like this die with -- from unnatural causes, as they're stating, again, if this connected to all of these other incidents, it is really a sad reflection on somebody or somebodies who has either got a hardwood grudge with the Dallas Zoo or zoos in general, an extremist trying to make a point and trying to do so as -- brought nothing but harm to these animals.",

You don't see somebody trying to let out a tiger or a lion or a bear or something like that.So, the clouded leopard is a small, highly endangered cat. It doesn't really present a danger to human beings. So, I don't want people -- I know people think right away, oh, my God, leopard, spotted cat, it is going after a human being.
