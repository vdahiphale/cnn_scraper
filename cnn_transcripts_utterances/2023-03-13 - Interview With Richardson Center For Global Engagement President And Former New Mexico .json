We revisit our interview with her. Welcome to the program, everyone. I'm Christiane Amanpour in London. The families of Americans imprisoned in Iran are being buffeted by a, sort of, psychological warfare between adversarial states. Over the weekend, Iran's foreign minister said, a prisoner swap agreement between his country and the United States has been broken. And now, the ball is in their court. But Washington quickly quashed that. The state department's, Ned Price, told CNN, \"A -- it's a cruel lie that only adds to the suffering of their families.\" Now, this follows the heartbreaking appeal made by the Iranian American Siamak Namazi when I spoke to him inside Evin Prison last week. He spent seven and a half years there, repeatedly left behind in other prisoner swap deals between the two countries. Two other Americans are also imprisoned alongside Siamak, Emad Shargi and Morad Tahbaz. They call themselves hostages, and that they are pawns caught up in the decadeslong standoff between Tehran and Washington. Just ahead, we will hear from one of their daughters. But first, my next guest has made it his mission to try to help. Bill Richardson has been an American cabinet secretary, he's been ambassador to the U.N., and the former governor of New Mexico. A long-time interlocutor with regimes like Russia, North Korea, and more to secure the release of America captives. And he's joining me now from Albuquerque. Governor, welcome back to our program. It's a long time since we've spoken. And I just want to get your opinion, based on your experience, these dueling narratives and claims now about any kind of a deal to get the remaining Americans in Iranian prison released and returned.",

There are very serious negotiations going on, but I agree with the administration view, there is no deal at this time, but they are meeting intensively. And the victims here are these three Americans that are suffering, that are wrongfully detained, that are being used as political pawns. And this has happened in Russia, Venezuela, Iran, North Korea. It's a pattern, it's a new hostage diplomacy that we have to start confronting. And this president, I believe, has done a good job so far.",

South Korea got oil worth some $7 billion, and Iran wants the money back. And it appears Qatar has figure out something from the Iranian side that seems acceptable, and next it has to go to the U.S. but so far deems it not acceptable. So, let's play devils' advocate for a moment. Because there is a whole, sort of, global notion.

It could be unpopular. It could be a bad person in a prisoner exchange. But in this case, I am not going to go into details.

And most are not coming to the U.K. Those coming to Europe are going to other parts of Europe. Last year, there were about 550,000 asylum applications across Europe. Maybe 5 million Ukrainians receive access to temporary protection in the European Union. And the U.K. was very generous in offering about 160,000 places to Ukrainians through its homes for Ukraine scheme.

One is, can the government realistically detain the number of people crossing the English Channel? They've talked about using military bases, royal air force bases and repurpose them. But the scale at which that would be necessary to provide detention that's in any way humane, including possibly children and unaccompanied minors, is open to question.

And I want to know, right now, if I open a newspaper, I'm dating (ph) myself. If I open my phone, I see headlines about new classes of medications with names like Wegovy, and Mounjaro, and Ozempic. First of all, just explain to us what these medicines do. DR. FATIMA CODY STANFORD, OBESITY MEDICINE PHYSICIAN, MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL AND HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL PROFESSOR:  Absolutely. This particular class of anti-obesity medications are what we call GLP-1 receptors agonist. Now, that's super fancy and it stands for Glucagon-like Peptide-1 receptor agonist. You might not have to remember that, I do. But let's talk about how these medications work in your body. They actually worked primarily in the brain by causing two pathways to function in a way we want them to. There's a pathway of our brain called the plum C pathway, it's a pathway that tells us to eat less and store less. And these medications work by really augmenting that pathway. Stimulating that pathway to be more active. But it also works by down regulating or inhibiting the pathway called the AgRP pathway, and that pathway tells us to eat more and store more. So, you can imagine that since it's working directly in the brain, we are seeing really potent degrees of weight loss in the order of somewhere between 15 to 20 percent total body weight loss on average for the agents that you mentioned that -- the outset. But -- and that, they work in few other ways. They actually slow movement through your G.I. tract. What does that mean? You go and eat something and it moves really slowly. So, you can imagine, if you eat breakfast and things move really slowly, by the time lunch happens, you're probably still full, whereas you would normally be hungry. So, that's another way it works. And it actually improves how your body secretes a hormone called insulin. And then finally -- and this is what a lot of people don't know, it actually browns your white fat tissue. You might be like, why does that matter? The more brown are fat issue is, the more active it is, which means that even when we are sitting here, like we are doing, Hari, we are burning more at rest than we would be normally. So, it works in a lot of different ways in the body and this is why, I think, it's gotten as much attention as it's gotten.",

You know, it was in 2013 when the American Medical Association acknowledged obesity as a chronic disease, but that new story came and it went. Now, we actually see people really taking medications and benefiting from these medications. We are seeing responses, such that they feel like they no longer have to struggle with weight. And they realized that their weight struggles are not all their fault.

I mean, one of the things that people have been reporting is that if they get off of this drug, thatthe weight that they worked hard to lose is going to come back. DR. STANFORD:  You know, Hari, that's an excellent question. I'm so glad you asked it because I really want to answer it and make sure that we understand this. I want us to think about this, and I'm going to divert our attention to thinking about diet and exercise. You know, we don't expect to eat one healthy meal or eat healthy for one month, and that can last us. Similarly, we don't expect those exercises we were doing back in the late 90s -- I was a Tae Bo enthusiast, to last us till today. Similarly, when we are looking at these medications, they only work when we are using them. Tae Bo was really great back in the day. But if you're not doing it today, it's not giving you that impact. And when you withdraw the medications and the wilding studies in the New England Journal really demonstrated this, when you pull that back, what we start to see is weight regained back to where the patient was prior to adding that in? Why? We are no longer acting on those pathways of the brain we talked about. It can't work if it's not being utilized. So, if you are a responder, if you do need these medications, and they do work for you, this is a chronic use medication for the chronic relapsing, remitting disease, that is obesity.",

DR. STANFORD:  I typically follow the guidelines. And there are several sets of guidelines, but they all align with each other. So, they say that we should consider medications for patients with a body mass index of 27 plus in obesity related disease. In which diseases, Hari, these are disease like high blood pressure, type 2 diabetes, obstructive sleep apnea. Now, if a patient has a BMI greater than or equal to 30, which places them into having obesity by BMI criteria, we could utilize medications in that group also. So, those are the key criteria that we are often utilizing now. I am not a huge fan of BMI people who have heard me talk about this. And so, I think on an individual clinician basis, this is also important to look at the full profile of that individual. What type of obesity do they have? Do they have obesity related disease? What is necessary for that individual in front of you?

DR. STANFORD:  You know, I don't see these as medications as a jump start, because that puts us into this idea of weight cycling, right. We have something acutely that brings us down. And when we weight cycle, we can lose and then we typically regain, you know, as soon as we withdraw. So, I look at these as appropriate tools for people that do need these long-term, not for a jump start or, you know, anything of that sort. And just thinking, like I said, treating this as a chronic disease. I wouldn't put, you know, someone on a high blood pressure medicine that came in with one high blood pressure reading, right.

I'm the director of equity here at Mass General for endocrine division so I'm always thinking about equity and the role it plays and access to therapies, particularly for chronic diseases like obesity. And you're right, this has created this dimorphism such that those that have wealth and have this tremendous access or able to access them, and those without aren't able to. And that really creates significant angst for me as someone who cares for a sizeable portion of the population. Who are recipients of Medicaid, which means that the medications would not be covered. Now, I happen to reside in the commonwealth of Massachusetts where our private insurers, meaning Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts, Mass General Brigham's insurance, et cetera, are covering these medications for patients that have those high tier plans. People, you know, that fall into the group of myself. But what about those people that who don't have those high tier plans? Where they can't get these medications for $30 a month, which is very accessible. It creates a situation where I can't even prescribe these medications to those individuals that are most needing these medications. You know, I really would like to see a shift in us thinking about this from a Walmart approach, right. If we give full access then people are able to get what they need, we can drive down costs. It's just pure economics. That's what I would like to see, eventually. Because we're talking about over 110 million adults, and over 20 million children that could potentially benefit.

But I have a 12-year-old patient that is being treated with pharmacotherapy for obesity, that I've been taking care of the last two years. And I happen to take care of both her father and her mother. Recently, for some reason, they asked her what she thinks about her weight doctor. I don't call myself, but that's what they asked her. And she was like, I don't see a weight doctor. And they were like, well, yes, you do, Dr. Stanford. She was like, oh, is that what she does? And so, you wonder, how might I able to talk and deal with a patient from the ages of 10 to 12, seeing her at least seven or eight times over that time, and her not know what I'm doing. Because my focus is her overall health. I know this can be done in a way that's respectful, that doesn't set someone up for disordered eating. And something that when she looks back at 12, she had no idea even what I do for a living until recently when her parents told her. That she will not feel as though this was a punitive situation. She's been able to live life in a much fuller fashion after being treated for her obesity. Similarly, my patients that underwent surgery. Several of my patients underwent bariatric surgery in their, you know, teens, 14, 15, they're now in their mid-30s.
