Trump's attorneys right now are trying to destroy the credibility of this witness. His name is Keith Davidson. He's the one time lawyer for adult film actress and director Stormy Daniels and 1998 Playboy Playmate of the Year, Karen McDougal, both of whom were allegedly paid hush money for keeping quiet about their liaison with Mr. Trump, alleged liaison. Mr. Trump denies them. Trump's attorney, Emil Bove, is right now running the jury through a laundry list of clients with whom Davidson dealt on a routine basis. Ones that perhaps to some witnesses, to some jury members, to some of you out there, are somewhat seedy situations. Bringing up the Davidson was at one point suspended from the bar and getting Davidson to answer, I don't recall at least half a dozen times. All right. So, let us tiptoe through the tulips of Mr. Davidson's client list here. If we can just to help illustrate what exactly the defense is getting at.
