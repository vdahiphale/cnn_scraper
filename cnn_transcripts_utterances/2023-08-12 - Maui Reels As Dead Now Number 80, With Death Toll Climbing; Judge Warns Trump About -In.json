We're told the area was untouched by the initial wildfire.That comes as a search for survivors is taking a bleak turn. Days after devastating wildfires tore through parts of the island, countless people remain unaccounted for. Cadaver dogs are sifting through the charred remains of homes and buildings. And although the number of people confirmed dead stands at a grim 67, officials warn that figure will likely rise much higher in the coming days. Authorities predict it will take years to get the island back to where it was, with damage estimates running well into the billions. Thousands of people have been left homeless and in desperate need of shelter after running from the flames, often with little more than the clothes on their backs. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

We all had warnings that there's going to be high winds and fires. I personally thought it's going to be some brushfires. We get those every now and then. Seems like we've been getting them annually.Luckily I wasn't needing to evacuate. I woke up in the morning and just wasn't getting any news from Lahaina. Obviously the power lines were out. Cell phone signals weren't working. I got notified just through some EMS, emergency medical services people, paramedics, firefighters that did some runs over there. And they're telling me they're seeing bodies on the ground. And I said this could be serious and had this gut feel that something could be wrong. I activated our team and started a nonprofit called MODO for the people, where we do MODO Mondays and we help on the island. And I called in that team and got in my mobile unit, the little private ambulance I built out with everything in it, from oxygen, portable EKG, wound care, IV fluids. And we drove out to Lahaina. And it felt like an atomic bomb went off when we got to ground zero and a apocalyptic like, kind of like COVID-19 but yet with just trauma and disaster and hot smoke and smells and fires. And just seeing the wounded kind of come out of the woodwork a bit little. So we triaged a couple people, whether dehydration; started with some people who felt like they were starving. Some had hypothermia. I was just shocked to hear their stories. People had swam into the ocean and hung on for dear life. I've seen some of the footage that's very disturbing now that's coming out. We had people that had eye issues, respiratory issues. The second day we went out, it was a little bit less but some people kind of congregated in our area. And I think that's the hard part. Some of these people don't want to leave. There's people still in tears, looking for their pets, their loved ones, very disturbing. So each day it's like another scene and the island's doing its best with shelters. But I realize now we had a meeting or some of the higher-ups realized that we might have to go to them and I'm the only doctor that's been going to them because I'm a mobile setup and that's what I've done during COVID-19, house calls. That's my specialty as an ER doc. I do concierge (ph) and (INAUDIBLE) calls but I help the people and this is like my calling. And that's what I do with my team. But there's still -- the roads aren't good. They're still not letting -- I see the vision and the purpose that they wanted to have people come out of there and get to the shelters in the middle of the island. When I went there, I felt like I was stuck because some people have chronic medical conditions and their medication's gone. Guess what? I'm a doctor. I'm like, let me prescribe it for you. Wait, how you going to get there? Your car's gone. Wait, you don't even have gas. There's no gas on that side of the island. So there's nothing that can be done unless we have the resources. So we need them for the people. We need to take medicine to them. That's what I think we need to start working on these next few days. And I think the Department of Health is on it and they'll go visit and adjust.",

I don't know how they're surviving for 3-4 days now without it. We're doing runs; I'm delivering pizza, food and water and half the time I'm out there but I'm also doing medical work when I find people.

Officials have warned that number will likely rise much higher in the coming days.Supporters of Niger's coup staged a large protest against the regional bloc, ECOWAS, a day after it activated a standby force for a possible military intervention. On Friday, thousands of people condemned the bloc as they rallied near a French military base in the capital. Many also demonstrated against France, saying the former colonial ruler should leave their country for good. CNN's Jim Bittermann joins us now live from the French capital. ECOWAS' punitive measures are starting to bite. But a peaceful transition of power seems even more remote than ever. Is France still backing a potential ECOWAS intervention in Niger? And is Paris at all worried by how deeply unpopular France now appears to be among the population in Niger? JIM BITTERMANN, CNN SR. INTL. CORRESPONDENT: Well, I think France, at any cost, would love to see the situation stabilize and Mohamed Bazoum, the democratically elected president in Niger reestablished in power. And if that takes ECOWAS intervention, then I think they'd definitely be for it because they see this as an important base. They've got 1,500 soldiers based in Niger. And that base is the base that's been fighting terrorism across Western Africa in the Sahel. The Americans, by the way, also have about 1,500 soldiers based in the northern part of the country. And so I think for Western interests anyway, they would love to see the situation stabilized. And we're watching very carefully what happens with this ECOWAS force. They said earlier this week they would stand up what they call a standby force, put together a bunch of military from the various countries that are members of ECOWAS -- for example, Ivory Coast said they would donate perhaps 800 to 1,100 soldiers. But they're meeting now in Ghana, trying to figure out the whole confused logistics of this operation, who's going to contribute what forces, how they're going to be supported, who's going to pay for it, all that sort of thing that has to be worked out. So I think everybody is depending on them to take this first step, because the last thing the French want to see is a kind of the anti- French sentiment we saw yesterday at the demonstration in front of their military base there. People were saying things like down with France, down with ECOWAS. We need Russia's help to get rid of these French monkeys, things like that. And they would like to get a little stability in the region and get the democratic authority to reestablish in power.",

New Zealand may be out but there's a good 1,000 or so people here very much nervously watching and supporting their co-host, Australia.As you mentioned, looking for a Women's World Cup semifinal for the first time and they know that they are not only looking to do that but also overturn the weight of recent history for Women's World Cup hosts. The last four have all gone out at this stage, the quarterfinals. And Australia's opponents, France, know all about that because exactly that happened to them four years ago in 2019. They were beaten by the USA. But France equally have said they knew exactly what they were walking into in Brisbane today, about 50,000 passes and support all decked out in the green and gold very much supporting the home side. This Australia team have really galvanized the nation. There's billboards. There's airport signs supporting them. There's even talk of a public holiday if they are to make that semifinal next week. As you rightly said, it is really, really tight. So there is nothing to split these two teams at the moment. This promises to be a fascinating 45 minutes. The big question, will we see Sam Kerr come off the bench? She's been there with a big smile on her face. She certainly looks ready for action but there is still that question mark about her fitness. What we know is that the winner of this one will face the winner of the other semifinal taking place in a few hours' time. England very much the favorites to progress from that one. The European champions against Colombia in the semifinals of the Women's World Cup for the first time but England are going to have to do without Lauren James. She's suspended, has been so influential so far in this tournament. She scored three goals. She's made three goals in just four games. This Colombia team are on a fairytale run and they know they are saying they're not only here to make history but they're doing it to earn respect and dignity for women who play football and around the world.",
