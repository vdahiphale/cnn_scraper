While at the moment, the protests seem unlikely to reach the same scale as intensity -- in intensity as those that we saw in the spring, there is fresh anger over universities new safety policies and the Biden-Harris administration's approach to Israel.Joining us now, a Democrat from Massachusetts, Congressman Jake Auchincloss. Congressman, always wonderful to have you on the program. You obviously say those protests re-escalating or at least coming back as students return to campus. The students in that video were chanting \"From the river to the sea.\" And that phrase has also been in the news because Meta's board recently said that phrase does not constitute hate speech. I'm wondering your reaction to the students but also to that decision from Meta. How do you view that phrase and should it be considered hate speech? REP. JAKE AUCHINCLOSS (D-MA):  Thanks for having me on, Kasie. Good morning. I personally find that phrase reprehensible because it calls for the extinction of Israel. And that's why I think that most of those protesters who were chanting it -- they really shouldn't be described as pro-Palestinian protesters. I mean, Kasie, I am pro-Palestinian. I want to see the Palestinian people have security, dignity, and prosperity. That is anti-Israel protests. However, I always bend towards free speech and protests and speech are sacrosanct in this country. It's one of the reasons I voted against a misguided policy in Congress that I thought might chill speech even though I agreed with its intentions, which was to help colleges uphold a suitable learning environment on campus. But if I was a university president right now, Kasie, what I would be doing is really three things. One, I would be very closely attentive to my Title VI obligations. That means protecting students on campus from targeted harassment. If you are walking to class and people who are not showing their face or banging drums and shouting epithets at you day after day, that is targeted harassment and that's not acceptable. University presidents do need to prevent that. Number two, I'd be trying to model better behavior. I'd be bringing faculty together to have tough conversations -- critical debate about complicated issues -- and show students what civic engagement is meant to be. And then finally, I think these college presidents also should regain the conversation at the national level and lead a conversation about how do we do a better job of civic education and making sure that our young people in this country really know how to engage with one another across lines of sharp ideological disagreement.",

And the courage that they are demonstrating in the midst of these last 11 months should be an example for the rest of America in how we are resolved to return these hostages.These hostage families have expressed to me a diversity of opinions about the right path forward and their voice is critically important. I think that the prime pressure needs to be applied on Hamas to get this deal done. Remember, Hamas had these six young hostages record videos to their family members and then shot them execution-style. This is not an organization that can be negotiated with absent supreme military leverage. And I worry that if we get into a dynamic where every time Hamas executes a hostage Israel is pressured to provide a concession, we are creating a downward spiral and an incentive structure whereby Hamas executes more hostages for more concessions.",

But 2) we've got to help Ukraine win. And Ukraine can't win if they are being handcuffed in their use of American-made weapons.
