One of the systems that failed after that winter storm back in December. Southwest just couldn't reconnect their crews and aircrafts. And as you might remember, they ended up canceling nearly 17,000 flights. Now, we have heard from Southwest's chief operating officer and he has apologized again and again as lawmakers grill him about what exactly went wrong and what they're going to do to fix it.

And they're also planning to upgrade their winter resiliency, things like de-icing, which were a major problem back during that disease meltdown. They are working on a top-to-bottom fix. It's going to cost many millions of dollars, they say. But they believe they're going to have a better assessment of what that will look like by March.

Zelenskyy says, yes, he is making gains and making headway on this push to get fighter jets. The British obviously saying they'll train the fighter pilots. He said that he wouldn't spell out what's been discussed in these private meetings behind closed doors. But his appeal wasn't just to these leaders for military equipment. Really sort of for the long term here, shoring up support for Ukraine. When he spoke to the 705-member European parliament talking about how Ukraine shares European values, that Ukrainians are European, that Russia doesn't share these sorts of values of human rights, freedom of the press, all those things. Indeed, he said, and this is perhaps his most emotional appeal, that Ukrainians are coming home to Europe. That's what got him the big standing ovation. And it's important because the appeal that reaches out to the people of Europe will sustain the political positions and that strength of unity among the leaders.",
