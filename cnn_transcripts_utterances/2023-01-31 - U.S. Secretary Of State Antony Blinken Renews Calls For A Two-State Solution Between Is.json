Tonight, the U.S. Secretary of State wraps up hisvisit to a region that's even more tense than usual, renewing calls for a two-state solution between the Israelis and Palestinians. Then, the U.S. President sounds on a critical note, F-16 fighter jets for Ukraine, but are the allies in agreement? And protests across France, people angry at a government that says it has no choice but to raise the retirement age. But first, the U.S. Secretary of State says he has no illusions that tensions can be defused overnight. But Antony Blinken says, he's working to lay the foundations for a more stable as well as secure Middle East. He wrapped up a diplomatic mission to the region today, giving final remarks in Jerusalem. Blinken's visit comes amid the worst violence between Israelis and Palestinians in years, with no peace process on the horizon. He announced no concrete agreements, but clearly laid out the goals. Have a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

I think many people would disagree with that, but I also think you have to keep in mind the internal political pressures that Netanyahu is facing. Because first of all, you have the pressure from the public. You know, they've seen these two shooting attacks in Jerusalem. There's fear on the streets, they want to see action, they want to see security forces boosted, and he's talking about getting more gun permits in the hands of everyday Israeli civilians. Actually, Secretary Blinken was specifically asked about that saying, hey, isn't that just going to make things worse if more people are running around with guns? And he didn't exactly, specifically address that. And Benjamin Netanyahu leads the most right-wing government in Israeli history. Netanyahu is actually, arguably the more centrist person in his entire government. Everybody else is almost to the right of him. And he has ministers who are arguing for him to go even further. And some of the ministers are calling for death penalty for people who have been accused of terrorism. And so, he has to balance the pressure from the Americans, his own internal pressure, because without this coalition, without his governing partners, not that he's anywhere near to losing power, but if he -- if these fights between them get big enough, they could threaten to walk away from this government coalition, and that means Benjamin Netanyahu is no longer prime minister, Isa?",

Mr. Macron wants to raise the pension age from 62 to 64. These were the scenes in Paris earlier. Our correspondent, Melissa Bell was there, and we're going to be speaking to her live in just a moment. But first, we want to show you what the atmosphere was like earlier in the day, and here is Melissa's report. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MELISSA BELL, CNN CORRESPONDENT (on camera): Another massive day of protests here in France and of strike action, not quite as heavy, the strike action, as it was on January 19th. But still an important show of strength on the part of the unions who are more unified than they have been in years here in France. Not since 2010 and the last time a French government tried to reform the pension system. Then Nicolas Sarkozy managed to get it from 60 to 62. Now Emmanuel Macron is determined that he's going to raise the retirement age here in France from 62 to 64. And he's given himself a very difficult timetable, getting it through, he hopes, by the Summer through parliament. The aim of the trade unions who are standing together and intending to cause more strikes and hold more protests against it, is to try and get Emmanuel Macron to back down on this, what was a key proposal when he was first elected back in 2017.

That was according to France's official figures. And the point of the trade unions today, Isa, was to top that number, and they did, 1.3 million, we've just heard the French official figures. Of course, there's always a discrepancy between what the unions say and what the official figures are, and perhaps most importantly, those images you saw a moment ago of the march here in Paris, it was 80,000 people on the street, according again, those official figures on January 19th, 87,000 that took part today. And of course, that's important because the unions want to keep up the momentum. In fact, they've just announced two fresh dates for general strikes and protests February 7th and February 11th. Their point is that by getting a sufficient number of people out on the street, by seeking to paralyze the country over the course of the next few weeks, by a series of successive strikes, that they might just get Emmanuel Macron to back down. But as I mentioned to you a moment ago, this is a reform he's been planning since 2017. He had to back down in 2019. Again, this -- the protests from the streets, COVID, all of that made him put them on ice. But this is the real test for him, Isa, that he's the reforming president. He promised to be. And he's picked a fight, in terms of the timetable he set himself. The unions are saying, this is a fight we're all too willing to wage. Coming out onto the street and vowing that they're going to get the government to back down, as they did back in 1995 when pension reform was on the cards, Jacques Chirac had to back down. The unions really hope that this time, they're going to be able to push this reforming president to admit defeat. He, however, has vowed that he will stand firm and it is, of course, a test of his mental, a test of his vow to be a reforming president, and it is an important thing that will count for the rest of his presidency, as four more years left in power, he has other reforms planned. If he backs down on this one, he will very much prove himself to be a lame duck president. That's why he's been so determined, despite the protests, to keep on pushing it through, Isa.",

In fact, we've been hearing from the French Labor Minister speaking from parliament today, he said that if things wereto stand as they have been, it would be a deficit of some 150 billion euros by 2045. That is what he told parliament today, the idea is that the government will be in deficit when it comes to pensions, specifically, hence, the need to raise them. Now, what the trade unions say is that this is something the French simply will not stomach, 62 to 64 is something that affects everyone, and what we saw today on the streets were teachers, trade unions, pension, not just in the private sector, but the public sector as well representing transport networks, all kinds of different workers who have been out on the streets saying, we simply refuse to work for those two extra years. This was not what we signed up for. So, it will be a battle of wills going ahead into the Summer, with both sides vowing to see the end thereof. Isa.",

And that predicts the global economy will grow 2.9 percent this year. That's a slowdown, but less than what was previously expected. China's reopening is one of the main reasons for the upgrade.

There are still headwinds, there are still the war in Ukraine impacting commodity prices, there are still central bank raising rates across the board, really, to tackle inflation.

The Memphis Fire Department fired the three EMTs, saying they failed to adequately assess Nichols' condition at the scene. Memphis police also announced they suspended two more officers, in addition to the five others they fired and who are now charged with murder. Meantime, the brutal videos of Tyre Nichols' arrest appeared to contradict the police's initial report on Nichols' behavior and their own actions in multiple ways.

The hitting over and over of this young man as he was pulled out of his car. After watching the video and looking at the initial police report, one of the things that you will notice is it says that Nichols was agitated and was an aggravated assault suspect. Said, he was spreading profusely and irate upon exiting the vehicle. When you watch the video itself, you can see the officers approach with a lot of aggression. They actually pull him from the car, then there's that initial struggle, where he's asking, what did he do? So that doesn't really go along with that. Then it says that Nichols grabbed for Detective Martin's gun and it listed Martin as a victim. As you watch that video, you really never see him attempt to go toward the belt of any of those officers. So that's something else that you can't really clearly see on any of that video that's listed. Then it says that Nichols pulled one of the officer's duty belts, then it makes no mention of the kicking, punching and hitting and even the tasing of Nichols. So all this comes together -- I was actually talking to some Memphis Police Department officers today, when they go use of force, when they go hands on with somebody who's considered a suspect, they must file a report to go along with the incident report and say what they did, how it escalated, the reasons why. And as we look at this so far, we don't have that initial information. Now there's also the fact that another person has been relieved of duty, a seventh person. We don't have that person's name so far. We've been calling the police department, which has been very transparent so far. They haven't shared that person's name. Of course, we talked about those three people connected to the fire department, who were fired because, when you watch this video, you see that young man sort of in pain and barely able to sit up and no one giving him assistance, that's one of the things that stands out to you as you watch this video more than one time.",

So the seventh one, we don't have a clue where he or she may be in this video. Again, this is a very fast investigation. We've covered these before and sometimes it takes police departments months before they start sharing this sort of information. So now that we have the information, we have gone back to the police department, asked them why this bit of information is being held. You have to wonder whether or not that person has maybe been cooperating with the DA's office and that's why they haven't done it. There's is also a question about how they can move forward with this. But so far, all these questions have not been answered by the police department or the DA's office.",

In other words, Ithink there is a mythology that a police report is sort of authored by Moses or Buddha or Jesus Christ; it's a perfect reflection of what actually happened. Juries treat it that way, judges, prosecutors. But it's always an act of self protection by the police officer writing it. No police officer is going to write, you know what? I just kind of lost my temper and beat this guy up. No police report has ever said that. And so, instead, police officers are trained to assert certain things in those reports, whether they happened or not, to make sure that their actions are deemed as lawful. So they're going to act like the person was violent, et cetera. What's happening now for the whole world is we are peeling back the curtain, because you can see what was written on paper versus what was recorded on video and that discrepancy happens every single day, all across this country, when it comes to U.S. law enforcement.",

If you don't, your opponent will use that against you, that you are soft on crime, that you don't care about public safety. And so, the police use that power to give themselves unbelievable protections in the law. Also, the police officers' unions use their leverage to get unbelievable protections in the contracts. And so, what happens is, allegedly, to protect good cops from being taken out, taken off the force because they made a mistake, et cetera, you wind up, you might protect one good cop who made a mistake but you protect 100 bad cops who are corrupt and terrible. And this has just been a -- before you get into the racism of it all, just a structure of U.S. law enforcement. They are a political force in our country.

In other words, when you apply to be a police officer in the United States, even if your department is getting federal money, there is no screen, there is no test. There's no check to see whether or not you are a sociopath or a psychopath. That is how wide open the doors are for people to join U.S. law enforcement who have no business having a gun or a badge.

It's not -- listen, in most countries, the people watching right now, the human rights abusers look just like the human rights victims. So you can't say that if a particular group is being targeted and you have a pattern and practice of misconduct against that group, that just because the color of the officers in that particular case is different, that somehow race is off the table.
