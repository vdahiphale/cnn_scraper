Senator, thank you so much for joining us on such an important day, such a dramatic day in that hearing. You saw that stunning moment when Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg stood up, turned around, apologized to those families, but then he also denied the very premise of that hearing you held, that social media causes worse mental health. So, do you think that today's hearing actually achieved anything in terms of making these platforms safer? SEN. RICHARD BLUMENTHAL (D-CT): We think it is a very, very dramatic, even historic step, because what it demonstrated again and again and again was the unanimity among Republicans and Democrats that something needs to be done. With all the verbiage and all the big tech baloney, and you heard a lot of it, what the parents in that room were demanding was action, because we have heard these hollow promises and empty commitment again and again. And I think today's hearing crystallized the overwhelming momentum that we're generating. It's the reason why Snap has endorsed the Kids Online Safety Act and Microsoft, and we have almost half the United States Senate. Republicans and Democrats evenly divided co-sponsoring the Kids Online Safety Act, and Senator Schumer committed to working with us to bring it to a vote as soon as possible.

Those launches coming, of course, from the Houthis, an Iran- backed rebel group in Yemen. That cruise-missile evaded other defense systems such as intercept missiles, too close to within a mile when it was intercepted by the CIWS, the close-in weapon system, an automated gun that was able to track the cruise missile and shoot it down. That gun is a form of last offense, the short range defense system for these destroyers, an expert we spoke with a short time ago, said it was concerning that had been beheaded -- been able to close to within that distance and come so close to the destroyer, a U.S. official says it does not indicate that the Houthis have developed some sort of new weapon. But the reason that it got that close, well, that will have to be looked at here. Still all of this underscores that continued Houthi attacks on international shipping lanes. And their attempt to target U.S. and U.K. vessels and warships operating in the region as we have seen, not only a number of these attacks now, approximately 40 at this point, but also a growing number of U.S. strikes against Houthi targets in Yemen.
