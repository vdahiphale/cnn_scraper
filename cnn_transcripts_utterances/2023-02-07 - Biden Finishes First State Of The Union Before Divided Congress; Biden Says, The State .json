Anderson? ANDERSON COOPER, CNN ANCHOR (voice over):  Jakes, thanks very much. David Axelrod, what do you make of that? I mean, if the president was trying to show energy and enthusiasm, he certainly -- DAVID AXELROD, CNN SENIOR POLITICAL COMMENTATOR (voice over):  He did that for sure, in his sparring with the Republicans was really inspired. I mean, I think, you could see he was engaged and enjoying the exchange. It felt like the British parliament in that sense. But more than that, Anderson, I said before the speech if it is just him crowing about accomplishments, that's not going to answer the mail. But if he's telling a larger story about the country and fitting the things that he has done and wants to do within that narrative, then it is a much more powerful speech. He did that tonight. He told a story about where we were and where he wants to go and how the things he is doing will help advance that vision, and it was value-laden and it was energetic where it need to be energetic, it was reflective where it needed to be reflective. Honestly, I think he did a great job tonight. COOPER (voice over):  Van? VAN JONES, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR (voice over):  I agree. [22:30:00] And, look, people had a couple of questions about Joe Biden. Is he feebleminded, et cetera? When you saw him going back and forth in real time with some of the top politicians in country and getting the best of them and being a unifier in doing it, he said, okay. You want to go back and forth with me? Do you agree with me that you're not going to cut Medicare and social security? Well, hey. And so, he's -- is he going to be a divider, he was unifier. Is he going to be weak mind or a strong mind? I think those are very, very powerful. I also thought that he -- he was relating the real people's stuff. These corporations rip folks off and he was talking about that stuff. The airlines rip us off. Felt that was really good, but I thought the most powerful thing, he got both parties on their feet, not once but twice on police reform. The open wound on this country is police reform. And Republicans and Democrats stood together twice to honor the family and also to honor policies that would make a difference. That was unexpected. You can handle that 12 different ways wrong, he handled that right. I thought Joe Biden did really well tonight relating to the American people. And if you had doubts about him. look, he was a sharp tonight as he could be. I thought he did a great job.",

I think that he went into this knowing and somebody used this earlier, that something he has to do going into 2024 is win back working-class voters who flocked to Donald Trump in 2016. And I think his blue-collar blueprint did just that. I was looking at some of the messaging and it could have been straight out of a Trump state of the union talking about buy American, (inaudible) American jobs.Now, will the policies actually reflect that is the question. Will there be enough that feels like it's actually catering to that base that's called fairly alienated? So that would be my positive. My critique would be he has glossed (ph) over China. China watchers, you know, around the country and in light of the spy craft ordeal that we dealt with last week, I think it felt like a very sort of, you know, sub-point at something that is a major concern on the minds of all Americans after what we saw.",

So, part of the course for Joe Biden, he is clearly running. I mean, I've heard no, you know, equivocation in that.And the Democrats are going to obviously be saddled with a nominee who is going to be 86 at the end of his next term. He can't fix that with a speech. I agree with you Van on the timing on the Tyre Nichols section. I thought that was his best section. I was glad to see the reaction to that from the Congress. I like the bipartisanship with McCarthy, congratulating McCarthy at the beginning. I like the nod to PEPFAR at the end. The dishonesty over entitlements is outrageous. The Democrats are proposing Medicare advantage cuts. The Republican leadership is unified against this. The idea that he baited or go to them by shouting lies about their positions to that, and by the way. If he wants to be serious maybe he'll pledge tonight not to run any campaign ads about social security or Medicare in 2024.",

He was lively, he was very engaged in it. And I think what we are talking about going into this speech was it being a preview of his next election run, of what the 2024 run is going to look like. And I think we just saw it because he was engaging with these Republicans. He was going back and forth with them. He made the joke about converting them. After that, he made clear that cutting social security and Medicare was not something the majority of them wanted. That I think is going to be when he goes to Wisconsin tomorrow, we see him on the road in the future, and once he does have this announcement, that is the 2024 message of the president.

That is kind of really what jump started the whole back and forth between them. I do wonder how Republicans in their response will use that line as their overall responding to everything we just heard from President Biden there. And as you know, it is going to be Sarah Sanders. She is the youngest governor. She will be responding obviously to the oldest sitting president. That is a welcome message that Republicans want here, but we'll see how they use that line there.

When he said let's, all stand up for seniors, there was no politician who was not going to stand up for seniors. And so, they were standing up while he said, let's all agree not to cut social security, let's all agree not to cut Medicare.

They wanted to put a Biden agenda on the table that actually, if you're listening -- if you're an American person at home and you're not listening to all the back and forth and for the first time you are hearing anything about some of these things, you're hearing it from President Biden, giving a plan on dealing with opioids, giving a plan or saying to Republicans, let's talk about immigration, but if you don't want to talk about immigration, let's at least pay for border security.
