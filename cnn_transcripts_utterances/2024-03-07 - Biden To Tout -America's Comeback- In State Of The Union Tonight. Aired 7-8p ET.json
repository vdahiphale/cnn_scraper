The president about to deliver his State of the Union Address, one of the biggest audiences that he will have before Election Day. And we have new details on what the president is about to say. Plus, Trump welcoming a strongman to Mar-a-Lago. Hungary's far-right authoritarian prime minister getting the red carpet treatment tomorrow. Is it a sign of how Trump wants to run this country? And should Trump be allowed to get classified intelligence briefings again? It's a question that is now front and center as he is about to formally clinch the Republican nomination. Let's go OUTFRONT. And good evening and welcome to a special edition of OUTFRONT. I'm Erin Burnett and I am live tonight on Capitol Hill. And we begin with the breaking news, President Biden is set to arrive here soon to deliver his state of the union address to what is I mentioned could be the largest audience that he will get, all at one time before Election Day. This is a moment that he must seize. It's a Biden-Trump rematch is now where the country is. According to new excerpts that are married much -- that rematch is very much on the president's mind tonight. It doesn't actually name Trump in these excerpts, but he does draw a clear distinctions between himself and Trump, like this. And I quote from the speech that will all here tonight: My lifetime taught me to embrace freedom and democracy. A future based on the core values that have defined America, honesty, decency, dignity, equality, to respect everyone, to give everyone a fair shot, to give hate no safe harbor. Now some other people see my age -- my -- other people my age see a different story, an American story of resentment, revenge, and retribution. That's not me. Some people of my age, its obviously clear who he's talking about and there's so much pressure riding on this biggest speech so far of the election year. Last year, more than 27 million people watched President Biden's address on television and another nearly 2 million on YouTube. Earlier today, I had a chance to sit down with the president and other journalists for an off the record conversation at the White House. And what I can tell you is this, it was a substantive conversation. The president spoke for 90 minutes and a very free -- freewheeling back- and-forth without notes. His comments were extensive and expansive on a wide range of issues. And it was clear that Biden knows the seriousness and the importance of tonight, as he is now preparing to go head-to-head with Donald Trump and the election itself. Now one thing we should not necessarily expect when the president starts speaking is civility on the floor. In fact, Biden is anticipating jeers from the Republicans. Congressman Lauren Boebert who has heckled Biden in the past, telling CNN, quote, I don't even promise my pastor I'm going to hold back in church. We have a lot to cover in the next hour as we count down to this momentous speech. But I want to start with MJ Lee because she is OUTFRONT live outside the White House. And, MJ, what are you learning about Biden's speech tonight?",

He'll talk about the importance of defending freedom. He'll talk about these threats toward democracy and the importance of everyone Republicans and Democrats to commit themselves to a democracy that makes so much possible. And he'll talk about his determination to make sure that the middle- class and working class in this country are the ones who grow the economy, that we grow the economy by growing the middle-class, by lowering costs for them, by investing in programs that are going to help them. And that he's going to bring very much his orientation as someone who grew up in Claymont, Delaware, in Scranton, Pennsylvania, to that economic argument.",

Unemployment is as much, much lower. These are true points. But there are issues, Anita. Housing costs are still 19 percent higher since Biden took office. Thirty-year fixed rate mortgages, when Biden took office, was 2.77 percent now, it's 6.88 percent to obtain that same mortgage. Those affect Americans every single day. How does President Biden talk about that tonight? Does he address that pain directly?",

He'll say it's too tough to get a mortgage if you're a first-time home buyer and that it's such an important thing because it's one of the ways that you really address the wealth gap in this country. He'll talk about coming out of this pandemic and the fact that four years ago this week was when the country really shut down.And obviously, the supply -- the supply chain disruptions we so all of the labor disruptions we saw all of this disruptions from the worst pandemic in over a century left this economy with all kinds of tensions in it, and we're still working those out. But he'll address housing costs directly. He'll address other cost directly because he understands. He grew up in a family where they didn't have a lot of money lying around. He knows that the American people, American families, need a break here, need a little breathing room at the end of the month. So, yes, and he'll talk very directly about housing tonight.",

And that's what he's going to continue to do and he'll address issues that they care about -- housing, the cost of health care and prescription drugs, which he's bringing down.He'll address, shrinkflation, and the fact that you feel like you're getting less for the same amount of money while corporate profits stay very high. And he'll address a tax code that rewards the wealthiest and that by the way, his predecessor put big chunks of it into place. And he'll talk about the need to make the wealthiest and the large corporations pay a little more of their fair share so that the middle- class and the working class aren't bearing all of the burden.

JONATHAN DEKEL-CHEN, FATHER OF ISRAELI-AMERICAN HELD HOSTAGE:  Well, I think that the very fact that we are all going to be in the building, in the gallery, meeting all representatives from all seven families of the American hostages, I think that already says an awful lot about the administration's commitment to getting the hostages home, ll of them, not just the U.S. citizens, and also the congressional support. Whatever he can tell us, whatever hope he can give us, that there is a way forward is something that would only add to that. But we feel by our very presence there that the U.S. government did in the executive and the legislative branch is -- are with us. They're behind us.",

And I do just want to add, you know, there's a -- there's a bitter sweetness to this in so many ways. And one of them is that her name, which means dawn in Hebrew. Also she's named after a little girl who's one of Sagui's other daughters best friends and this little girls Shahar, her sister, her little brother, and her parents were brutally murdered on October 7.
