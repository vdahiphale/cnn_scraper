The lawsuit even tries to throw some shade at Elon Musk. There's a key line here where they say that \"Musk, by allowing his company to wrongfully operate on Cards Against Humanity's property, cast the shadow of possible association between him and Cards Against Humanity. And nothing could be more offensive to Cards Against Humanity, nor more harmful to his reputation with supporters.\" Now, we've reached out to SpaceX. We have not heard back. But, Sara, I do think there's a moral to this story. Anytime you're pulling off an elaborate stunt involved with buying a vacant piece of land to stop a border wall, make sure you keep an eye on that piece of land and make sure that the richest person on the planet is not allegedly trying to take over that land.",

      "sentences": "Well, Kate, no doubt this is going to be a difficult balancing act for President Biden when he comes here to the U.N. He's due to speak in just about an hour. He's coming to speak on what is arguably the biggest international stage with a number of priorities, including cementing his legacy on this global stage, talking about his priorities, talking about his accomplishments and what still needs to get done.This was going to be a U.N. General Assembly that was already dominated by the war in Gaza, concerns about a widening war in the Middle East, and that is going to be even more the case now with this expanding Israeli operation against Hezbollah in Lebanon. And the crises in both Gaza and Lebanon really serve to underscore what many see as a failure by President Biden and administration officials to get to a ceasefire deal in Gaza, to figure out a deal between Israel and Hezbollah that would allow tens of thousands of residents on both sides of that border to return home. So, senior administration officials acknowledge that that is going to be a major focus for this week. It is, obviously, going to be talked about during President Biden's speech. But he does have a number of other priorities to get to as well. He wants to talk about the conflicts in Haiti, in Sudan. He wants to talk about climate change, the rise of AI. He wants to talk about the competition with China. He wants to emphasize, certainly in stark contrast to his predecessor and this election that we're now seeing with former President Donald Trump, about global engagement. But, Kate, so much of this is going to come back to the Middle East and what is going on there, the concerns about an expanding war there. There's a lot of anger among other countries about Israeli aggression against Palestinians and now in Lebanon. Following President Biden, we're going to be hearing from the leaders of Jordan, of Qatar and Turkey. You will certainly hear some of that anger there. So, while this is a moment and a place for international unity, for international cooperation, there are also deep divisions among the countries here. Kate.",

So, likely, that's what it is this time. There's certainly plenty of speculation that that's the case. But who it might be, and has the intended target escaped, that's not clear. Certainly when the IDF tried to target a very senior Hezbollah commander in the suburbs of Beirut last night, the commander of the southern forces of Hezbollah, close to the border with Israel, he, according to Hezbollah, was not injured and is in full health. So, we're waiting to get details.But this is a part of a huge package of airstrikes that have been going on today. Three phases so far at least. Over the past day, the IDF says that they've dropped 2,000 munitions on more than 1,500 Hezbollah targets. There have been more than 100 missiles incoming to Israel today. Only one casualty, an IDF reservist, that we're aware of. But I think we get a sense of what is planned and what's to be expected from the IDF's chief of staff, General Herzi Halevi. He said that Hezbollah must not be given a reprieve, that they must continue with full force - the IDF must continue with full force. And he said, operations will be sped up and that they must have continued action with full vigor across all areas. It feels as if the IDF sense they have momentum in the fight right now, and that they have no intention of letting up. In fact, they intend to increase as well. Sara.",

Frankly, the Democrats are very vulnerable on this issue because for far too long they really didn't take this issue as seriously as they needed to. They were late to the game in terms of dealing with asylum reform. I think Republicans and Donald Trump gave the Democrats a gift on the border by tanking the bill that James Lankford negotiated with Chris Murphy and others that would have added more border patrol agents, made asylum changes.So - so, the issue is a little bit more muddled. But make no mistake, Democrats are vulnerable because this - this big surge at the border has happened on their watch and they were just too slow to get there. Just one thing on Pennsylvania. By the way, before Trump, Pennsylvania was much better at absentee voting. Republicans are much better at absentee voting than Democrats. I just have to get - we were much better at it for years and then Trump came in and blew it all up.",

An issue that Donald Trump has been vulnerable on - you know the word - consistently is on abortion and reproductive rights. Yesterday he was making a statement to women at his - at a campaign rally because he said he'd seen reports that women don't like me, and then said, I am your protector. And then went on to say, we're going to end up in World War III, and all they can talk about is abortion. I think he's talking about Democrats.

And I would rather have a president who actually has humanity to people of color than Donald Trump.But on the question on women. Well, why do not women support Donald Trump? Well, maybe because he's sexually assaulted them repeatedly. Maybe because he's tried to make sure he's going to block abortion from Project 2025. If he would actually focus on policies and having humanity, then we'd have a different conversation. And so, on the other side, Vice President Harris leading on maternal health crisis and what's happening within the administration, and actually communicating saine policies. And as a man, I can say very clear, you can be a man and a feminist at the same time. Donald Trump clearly is not that. Their policies are against that. His rhetoric is against that. And if he's wondering why women are not supporting him, it's because he has not supported women his entire life.",
