Two sources familiar with the plan tell CNN Trump's lawyers worked out that date during talks earlier today with the district attorney's office, a major and historic development after Trump was indicted there for his efforts to overturn the 2020 election, including racketeering charges. This is video of his legal team leaving the courthouse late this afternoon in Fulton County. During those negotiations, Trump's lawyers also agreeing to a $200,000 bond. It's the first time that Trump has had to put up a cash bond. The former president will have to abide by a host of rules under this bond agreement, including not communicating with his 18 codefendants or any witnesses. He's forbidden from threatening anyone related to the case, including with social media posts, and reposts. And the clock is ticking for more than just Trump, because Trump and his codefendants now have less than four days to turn themselves in. And while we're watching all of this out of Georgia, we're also following more breaking news out of Washington tonight. Special counsel Jack Smith pushing back on Trump's argument to wait until 2026 for his trial on election interference. Evan Perez is OUTFRONT. So, Evan, we'll get to Jack Smith here in just a moment. But this breaking news that Trump will turn himself in Thursday after we learned about his bond agreement. What else can you tell us about these negotiations today for Trump's surrender on Thursday, and what are we expecting to see?",

You saw the legal team for the former president arriving there at the government center to hash out the details of how the former president is going to turn himself in.And to get the $200,000 bond, which was negotiated and approved, by the state judge that is overseeing this case. As you pointed out, the first time that he's having to put up cash, essentially, to have his freedom while he awaits trial. In the previous cases, the two federal indictments, the one in New York, he was released on his own recognizance. He had a lot of restrictions in all of those cases. But this one has the most extensive set of restrictions on the former president. A lot of it having to do with his penchant for lashing out at some of his critics including people who could be witnesses. You pointed out the defendant, the former president, is required to refrain from any direct intimidation or threats against codefendants, against co- conspirators, people who are unindicted co-conspirators, 1 through number 30 listed in this indictment. And, of course, they also mention that he is restricted from making any threats on social media, which, of course, he already has been doing that kind of thing even on the day of his indictment. For instance, he warned the former lieutenant governor from going in to testify, again, on that day of his indictment, Brianna.",

And also, Gloria Borger, CNN's chief political analyst. Elliot, I want to start with Trump's bond agreement, part of the negotiations that he would also surrender on Thursday. And there are these very clear parameters here. Trump has to abide by them, including that he is prohibited from any direct or indirect communication about the case with witnesses or codefendants or any direct or indirect threats toward any codefendant, witness, or victim in the case. The agreement says that those rules, quote, shall include posts on social media or reposts of posts made by another individual on social media.

Look, any judge lives in the real world and is aware of the history certainly of defendants that come before them, but of this particular defendant and is aware of this defendant's history of sometimes incendiary social media postings.It's giving him a little bit of a leash here, but making clear that if the president steps out and engages in misconduct while there is a pending court proceeding that there could be serious consequences for it. And I think, yes, it was aggressive, there's nothing in there that violates any right of the president, and it was certainly probably the right thing to do given the circumstances, and all the chaos surrounding this case.",

I think it's important to note, however, that most Fulton County defendants won't get the slack that Donald Trump will get simply because he's Donald Trump. So that's a very important fact.And I think just as a general matter, the kind of sanctions that a defendant might get for engaging in the kinds of activities that Donald Trump has a pension for engaging in, even in the best of circumstances, you know, a judge or the prosecutor's office trying to get some kind of remedy for that could be a very slow process in an ordinary case. So, I think that folks who think there will be some kind of swift reaction necessarily to each and every possible offense that Donald Trump makes that could run against this order, I think that there will be slightly disappointed or surprised that that won't come to pass.",

We know about his social media at 2And I don't see him changing his behavior in any way, shape, or form. I'm sure they are going to try and read him the Riot Act if they can to say you got to cool it. But he's going to say, look, I'm a presidential candidate, and if you muzzle me, your -- it's my First Amendment rights you're infringing upon and you cannot -- and you can not do that. So then there will be a fight over that. And then if he doesn't think that he's going to be really threatened in any way, say, getting thrown in jail, which I agree, I doubt that they would do, why shouldn't he do whatever he wants to do?
