As Israel launches new attacks across Gaza, U.S. officials repeat their warnings to stay out of a city that's become the last refuge for more than a million Palestinians.Donald Trump's former fixer, Michael Cohen, is set to take the stand in the former president's high-stakes criminal hush-money trial. We will break down what Cohen's expected to say and why his testimony could be critical. And more than two years into Russia's unprovoked war on Ukraine, Vladimir Putin is replacing his long-time defense minister with an economist who has no military experience. Good to have you with us. Well, as Israel continues to plan an expansion of its military operations in Rafah, the Palestinian death toll from the war has passed 35,000. That is according to Gaza's Ministry of Health. On Sunday, this large explosion in Gaza, as the health ministry says, at least 63 people were killed over the weekend. Meanwhile, U.S. officials are warning that a full Israeli invasion of Rafah could lead to massive civilian deaths. The U.S. Secretary of State says it could leave a vacuum filled by chaos. So far, more than 300,000 people have evacuated from Rafah and they say they have no safe options. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MAHER Al-RABAIA, DISPLACE PALESTINIAN (through translation):  We are tired and lost. We don't know where to go. In a small area, we are lost. No one is standing with us, not Netanyahu, nor Muslims, nor Saudi Arabia, nor any Arab country. This is the destruction. We are working as workers. I left with a shirt and a torn undershirt. I'm working as a worker for 10 shekels. We are suffering from the high prices from one side and the war from the other side, and we are displaced. I swear, since five days, I only had one meal.

And those concerns were raised in a phone call on Sunday between President Biden's National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan and his counterpart in Israel.The White House says that Sullivan raised those concerns, discussed alternatives to a ground invasion of Rafah. Israeli National Security Advisor said that those concerns were being taken into account. But at the end of the day, these concerns are nothing new. President Biden has been raising them with the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, on phone calls dating back to February. And there are no signs that Netanyahu is necessarily taking those views into account. He has said that a ground invasion of Rafah is necessary to completely eliminate Hamas. That view is completely at odds with what we heard from American officials on Sunday, including the Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who said that a ground invasion of Rafah could launch a Hamas insurgency. Listen to more of a little bit of what he said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ANTONY BLINKEN, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE:  They will be left holding the bag on an enduring insurgency because a lot of armed Hamas will be left no matter what they do in Rafah. Or if they leave and get out of Gaza, as we believe they need to do, then you're going to have a vacuum and a vacuum that's likely to be filled by chaos, by anarchy and ultimately by Hamas again. We have the same objective as Israel. We want to make sure that Hamas cannot govern Gaza again. We want to make sure it's demilitarized. We want to make sure that Israel gets its leaders. That's what we're determined to. We have a different way and we think a more effective, durable way of getting that done. We remain in conversation with Israel about exactly that. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

He cannot claim that Hamas was eradicated or that it was militarily and politically, well, most importantly, politically toppled. I go back to the segment that you showed from Secretary Blinken. He's exactly right. If Israel stays, there's chaos. If Israel leaves without a postwar plan, it's chaos.

Even if the invasion or operation is limited in scope, it could still go on for a few weeks, in which case I don't see any negotiations.And this goes to something else, how the two sides define victory. Israel defines victory as eradicating Hamas. Hamas defines a win or victory by merely standing on their feet and waving a flag, even if it's the very last flag. So, both sides, and again, this is tragic, both sides seem to have a disincentive to end this at this point, because neither can get what it wants.

The testimony of Michael Cohen, Trump's one-time attorney and fixer, could make or break the Manhattan district attorney's case against the former president.He's the only witness who will testify about Trump's involvement in both the alleged decision to pay adult film actress Stormy Daniels $130,000 to keep her from going public about a past encounter with the former president ahead of the 2016 election and the plan to reimburse Cohen for advancing the money. Now, tying Trump to both the decision to pay Daniels and the reimbursement is critical for prosecutors who are seeking to prove Trump allegedly falsified business records to keep Daniels quiet. [02:15:02] Now, the jurors have already heard a lot about Cohen from other witnesses who have testified over the last three weeks, and most of it has been unflattering. Trump's defense attorneys will likely try to further undercut Cohen's credibility during what is sure to be a tense cross-examination. Prosecutors, meanwhile, have tried to lay the groundwork for Cohen's testimony by introducing documents, including e-mails and texts they say back up his version of events. Ultimately, the case could come down to whether or not the jury finds Cohen's testimony credible or if Trump's attorneys are able to convince them otherwise. Zachary Cohen, CNN, Washington.",

So that's how we know that's where they're going with Donald -- with Michael Cohen's testimony. In terms of the prosecution, the prosecution is going to allow Michael Cohen to be the person that he is, and then later argue that this type of person is the same person that Donald Trump needed and trusted to fix his problems, to try to hush Stormy Daniels, to try to hush and conceal this from ever coming to light. In the end, the prosecution's going to tie Michael Cohen's testimony and all the corroborating evidence, including meetings, telephone records, that audio recording that we already heard earlier in the trial, as well as statements that were made previously in order to find and tell this jury that you can find him credible and that you can find Donald Trump guilty based on his testimony, but not just his testimony in total, all the testimony that they've heard throughout.

That's Ukraine's second city speculation that they were trying to launch an assault in that direction, albeit while military analysts are saying they probably don't have the capacity to take over that whole city the second thing is that the Kharkiv region is right bordering the Russian border. We know that Ukrainian attacks over the border, particularly in the Belgorod region, has stepped up. So they may be trying to create a buffer zone. That expand that to try and prevent those attacks and President Zelenskyy has also said that he believes they're trying to stretch Ukrainian forces even thinner.

They then walked out of that event and also add Virginia Commonwealth University, at least a dozen students also walking out when the governor was beginning to give his commencement address. So again, that's what a lot of universities are trying to avoid this weekend, and others who have events later on. And, of course, this has also caused us a lot of frustration amongst students who had to deal with graduating from high school the middle of a pandemic. And now again, having to deal with commencement under difficult circumstances or under something that they do not consider a normal commencement ceremony. Camila Bernal, CNN, Los Angeles.

      "sentences": "After a very brief reprieve of severe thunderstorms across the U.S., the threat is now back and its going to be focused across much of the Gulf Coast region here, not only Monday but also into Tuesday.Now, the main threats are going to be damaging winds, the potential for very large hail golf ball size, or even larger. And yes, the potential also, for some tornadoes, you can see here the Monday, it stretches essentially from southern Texas all the way over into the panhandle of Florida. Tuesday, that threat shifts a little bit farther to the east, but the threats themselves remain the same. Here you can see is we start off the day Monday that first wave really focused across eastern Texas, much of Louisiana, and portions of Mississippi. By the time we get to Monday afternoon into the evening hours, while it spreads east. It also begins to fill in. So several more areas have the potential to see those strong to severe thunderstorms and it will continue moving ever so slowly to the east, even as we head into Tuesday, which is why that third read also continues there. In addition to tornadoes, damaging winds and hail, there's also the potential for flooding. Now the flooding extends essentially from Chicago all the way down to the Gulf Coast. But really the focus is going to be on Monday between Mobile, Alabama, back through New Orleans, keeping in mind, too, that there is still the potential for flooding across east Texas. If you recall, we had some devastating floods north of Houston just one week ago. So even though that area is not really the focus for Monday, any additional rainfall in that area is likely just going to exacerbate a lot of the cleanup efforts that are still on ongoing in that area. Most of these locations, you can see here in the yellow anticipating about two to four inches total over the next few days. But there will be some isolated spots. They could pick up as much as four or even five inches of rain total. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

The roles themselves are more complex. The age of streaming has also ushered in more opportunities for diverse storytelling.
