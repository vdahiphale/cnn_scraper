The Israeli military isramping up airstrikes after announcing it was expanding the ground assault to all of Gaza. The President of the COP28 Climate Summit makes controversial comments about fossil fuels and then defends his commitment to science. We will explain. And in the Red Sea, a U.S. Navy destroyer comes to the rescue of three commercial ships attacked by Iran backed Houthi rebels. Well, there is almost nowhere the people of Gaza can get go to -- to get out of harm's way. Israel warns it is expanding ground operations against Hamas in the entirety of Gaza, including places where civilians previously sought shelter and it is calling on people to move even further south. Nearly 80 percent of the population is already displaced now many are having to move again. These people are heading to Rafah but even there it isn't safe. A warning the video you are about to see may be disturbing. Well, this is the aftermath of an airstrike in Rafah; the Israeli military says it struck 200 Hamas targets overnight. Qatar calling for de-escalation and a ceasefire in the war between Israel and Hamas that's from a discussion between the Qatari Prime Minister and the U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken. Excuse me, Qatar played a key role of course in negotiating last week's truce and the U.S. says it is working to revive those talks. CNN's Arlette Saenz is at the White House. Arlette, what is the U.S. doing to try and get these talks back on track and how hopeful is it that that could happen anytime soon?",

A senior administration official over the weekend saying that they are going to take every step possible to try to get these hostages back but really what remains unclear is whether there is any hope that this could be done in the immediate future as these hostilities between Israel and Hamas have resumed. Now over the weekend Vice President Kamala Harris held several phone calls and meetings with Arab Leaders as she traveled in Dubai, including a meeting a sit down meeting with Egyptian President El-Sisi as well as the Emir of Qatar. Both of those leaders were key in these initial negotiations to secure the release of women and children being held by Hamas. The U.S. and Israel have insisted that the onus is on Hamas to adhere to the original terms of the deal. But Hamas has said that they will not release any more hostages or talk about releasing hostage until there is a complete ceasefire. So the White House while they say that they are trying to pursue every step to try to get these hostages home, that it appears that those talks simply seem to be at this time, with Qatari counterparts with Egyptian counterparts and the Israelis. And it's really unclear whether there could be any progress made on this front, as these hostilities have been continuing over the past few days.",

Mediation when it comes to hostages, and also trying to get humanitarian aid it.

According to Central Command the USS Carney, which is a destroyer that is stationed in the Red Sea currently it responded to these attacks. And it's found that several of these missiles had actually struck some of these commercial vessels resulting in some minor damage, no major injuries reported here but clearly a very dangerous moment in the region. And on top of all of this in addition to these missile attacks that were launched at these vessels, the Iran backed Houthi militants they also launched several drones in the direction of that U.S. destroyer the USS Carney forcing the destroyer to actually shoot down those drones to avoid any further damage or injury. So all of this is coming of course as these Iran backed militant groups they step up their attacks against the U.S. and its allies in response to the U.S. support for Israel -- as part of the Israel Hamas war. And the Houthi backed militants they said in a statement on Sunday that they are going to continue these attacks in solidarity with the Palestinians. Now the question is how is the U.S. going to deter these attacks in the future? Because while the U.S. has conducted a number of airstrikes in Syria and Iraq to try to deter future attacks by these Iran backed groups who have already launched over 70 such strikes on U.S. and coalition forces in Syria and Iraq. They have not yet been deterred. And even amid all of the -- you know massive U.S. presence in the region these groups are simply not backing down. So the U.S. now says in a statement from Central Command, that they are going to be weighing all appropriate responses but they hold Iran ultimately fully responsible for enabling these attacks. And we are told Becky, that the Department of Defense has communicated with the Iranians directly to convey to them that they expect them to rein in these proxy groups.
