      "sentences": "Hello for joining me this holiday weekend, thank you so much. I'm Sara Sidner in for the fantastic Fredricka Whitfield.All right. This holiday weekend is set to be a record breaker. More than 50 million Americans are expected to travel 50 miles or more according to AAA. That's the highest total ever for a Fourth of July holiday since AAA has been forecasting the travel numbers. From the roads to the skies, many of the people traveling will have to contend with threat of severe weather. I'm sorry to be the bearer of bad news. Today, more than 90 million Americans could get hit with damaging winds, hail, and even tornadoes. Those threats are expected to lead to disruptions at many travel hubs. So far today, more than 1,700 flights have been delayed. And more than 500 have been canceled. Although it will be a particularly hot day for many people across the U.S., the threat right now is those severe storms that we just told you about. CNN meteorologist Allison Chinchar is here with us. Hanging with us for the weekend. Allison, I hate to ask this. I just want people to be happy and enjoy this weekend but where is the worst of it right now?",

      "sentences": "Yes. It is a great question Sara. So let's start. Right now, the worst section of storms is really focused over the Ohio River Valley. Cincinnati, you know, Atlanta is the hub for Delta, but Cincinnati also has a lot of Delta flights out of it and there's likely going to be some delays there as this strong line of thunderstorms move through.But you also have other areas across the Midwest that are going to be dealing with the potential for some delays, cancellations, not just in the air, but also on the roadways. A lot of major interstates that run through this his area right here, all of these areas have the potential for damaging winds, hail and yes, even some tornadoes. And then also this secondary area across portions of western Texas. Now, it's going to be not one, but two separate rounds. The first is the one that is ongoing right now across areas of the Ohio Valley. Then by this afternoon, that secondary wave begins to push back in, and will continue through the evening hours. Once we transition into Sunday, that system pushes farther east. So now areas of the mid Atlantic and the northeast also starting to see the potential for some severe thunderstorms and more strong thunderstorms developing across the southeast. So a lot of target points here, based off of where you may or may not be traveling. Heat is another big story. We're starting to see a reprieve at least in portions of Texas, but a little bit farther east, it is a different story. We're still dealing with a lot of that heat for at least a few more days. Out to the west, this one is now starting to expand. But here's the thing. In the southeast, at least here, we're going to start to see those temperatures drop back. Dallas, for example, still triple digits today, but finally getting back down to just double digits once we get to tomorrow. And a little bit more of a delayed effect for New Orleans and Mobile, but we will still eventually get back down to those double digits. It's just going to take a little bit longer. Out to the west, it is the opposite direction, the temperatures are now just continuing to go up. Say for example, Salt Lake City 94, today, up to almost triple digits by Monday. Las Vegas, Palm Springs also continuing to see their temperatures going back up. Specifically speaking for Las Vegas, look at this, you've got a lot of those numbers well above the average and yes the average is 103, but I would like to make one point. Yesterday, the first time Las Vegas so far this year had hit triple digits. That's interesting, because that still takes time. The latest starting point in the year since the 1960s. Again, it has been a very long time since they've had that. Again Friday's high, reaching that 102. That's the latest triple digit date since June 30th of 1965, Sara.",

But just to give you an idea of what is expected this weekend. More than 50 million people are expected to travel by air or by car according to AAA. And the Transportation Security Administration says that they expect to screen 17 million passengers by the time the holiday weekend is over. Those are record-breaking numbers. Now, I spoke to some of those passengers this morning, and as I said, they came prepared. So far, even though they're seeing some delays, they're not totally hopeless just yet. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

This happened as the meltdown for United Airlines was unfolding right here in Newark Airport.So as thousands of people were stranded and his employees were trying to get people to where they were going, he was flying on a private jet. This is what he had to say about it, he said \"Taking a private jet was the wrong decision, because it was insensitive to our customers who were waiting to get home. I sincerely apologize to our customers and our team members who have been working around the clock for several days, often through severe weather, to take care of our customers. So Sara, in terms of optics, certainly not what you want from an airline that's having a hard time getting its customers to where they're going, but so far, things here remain calm and it seems like what is expected to be a record-breaking weekend is off to a pretty good start, Sara?",

There were about a thousand mourners came out to the mosque, there were people standing in the street for prayers as well. And it was very respectful.And you feel like with the sunshine out, that things are very calm, and those statistics for last night, while shocking, you know -- 1,350 cars burned, 26 city halls burned, 24 schools attacked -- those sorts of statistics sound really bad, but the numbers were actually lower than the previous night. The police had more police out on the street, 45,000 as you were saying. They had stronger armored vehicles. The government has had no large gatherings. They also took the buses and trams off the street last night at 9:00 p.m. So there have been mitigations put in place, and I think that gets to the point of what the government is saying. It doesn't want to go to a state of emergency because it wants a graduated response. And that's where we seem to be. The reality in this neighborhood is that right now, people would be nervous, and tense and concerned that when it gets dark, then there is that potential for the uptick in violence again. And I think everyone, everyone is waiting to see what happens tonight, because it was slightly less violence last night. Does it continue to trend down?

And it was a very quiet and moving affair to watch people holding prayers for Nahel. He's being laid to rest this afternoon in a cemetery here in Nanterre. Again this is, you know, it is one part of a picture. I think for his family, really, this is all going to be now focused on getting justice. The police officer who shot him said that he feels legally justified in pulling the trigger and firing that fatal shot. But the prosecutor says that's not the case.

These soldiers were advancing on Bakhmut when they came under intense Russian artillery fire. This stabilization point so far on this day has received more than 50 troops from the front, suffering from shrapnel, from artillery, and concussions.

This is another important new piece of law. This is House Bill 543, meaning that permits are no longer required for Floridians to carry hidden weapons in public. And it also ends current Florida requirements to undergo training before being allowed to carry a concealed weapon outside of the home. However, this is not open carry. And we've seen Sara, sheriffs across the state including over in Pinellas County, Bob Gualtieri putting out PSAs warning folks about facts from myth when it comes to this new law. It is still illegal to carry a gun in gun-free zones, things like police departments, schools, courthouses, jails and polling places. And finally, let's talk about a litany of new restrictions that are really impacting the LGBTQ community with gender-affirming treatments, for example, now banned for transgender minors.

The Supreme Court granted a Colorado web designer the ability to refuse to make websites for gay married couples as a violation of her First Amendment rights. A Christian woman named Lorie Smith brought the case. And in it, she claimed a man inquired about her services for his same-sex wedding. Here's the rub. The man at the center of that request says he never reached out to Smith. In fact, the man says he's straight and has been married to a woman for the past 15 years.He told CNN he didn't submit a request for a web design for a same-sex wedding and says he was unaware of his information being a part of the court record until he was contacted by journalists, namely the \"First Republic\" this week. He called the ruling quote, \"disgraceful\". Now legal representatives for the web designer told CNN that Smith doesn't do background checks on incoming requests to determine if the person submitting is genuine, but said the legitimacy of the request is genuine, telling CNN in a statement that no one should have to wait to be punished by the government to challenge an unjust law. She's speaking about the Colorado law. Now that the Supreme Court ruled against affirmative action as well, the future of racial diversity across college campuses is unclear. But higher education in California can offer a preview of what may happen. The state banned affirmative action back in 1996, which ultimately impacted black and Latino student enrollment. CNN's Kyung Lah caught up with a California college student about his experience. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",
