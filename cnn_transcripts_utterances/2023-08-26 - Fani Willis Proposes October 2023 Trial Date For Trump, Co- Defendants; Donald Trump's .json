But there's a long road ahead on the way to trial here with this case, the fourth criminal indictments against Donald Trump, and this one is relating to the January 6 and the 2020 election.In this situation right now, there are defendants who want to go to trial really fast. They want to go to trial in late October, potentially that is what the DA has staked out as the date is what a judge is already looking at, and seems to agree with Donald Trump. He doesn't want that at all. He wants the trial to be held back much, much further and potentially have himself taken away from other defendants here. The import of that is that it creates a situation where Donald Trump may be splitting from other defendants wishes that a 19 defendants might be going in different directions. We're seeing that in another avenue here too, because there are five defendants right now asking to move their case to federal court or the charges that are against them in this racketeering, criminal enterprise case in Georgia. The way that they say that they should be in federal court is that they had some sort of tied to the federal government either they were fake electors taking direction from Donald Trump, they say or we're looking at Mark Meadows, the chief of staff in the White House under Trump, Jeffrey Clark, a Justice Department official. And so watching that going forward is going to be very important to see many trials take place as judges look at this. The first one of those is set to begin on Monday, as the judge looks at Mark Meadows request to move the trial to federal court. Back to you. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

What does that mean? I anticipated that they would certainly -- many anticipated that there will be separate motions, that is, birds of a feather should not always flock together, just because someone engaged in inappropriate illegal, irresponsible behavior doesn't mean that I did.And when you mix yourself up and a group of others and you have evidence, which will come out in a compelling way, speaking of a criminal enterprise, you don't want to dirty yourself up with that. So I think a strategic move in doing that it's not only does it force the prosecutors hand to have the trial early, we know it's going to be held, or at least it's scheduled for October, late October 22, 23rd. But the reality is, is that now you act alone, because others are saying I can't be ready in a couple of months. And therefore also you're not sitting through all the evidence with all the other defendants as well. So there could be some strategic moves. It is a strategic move, but there could be some very good benefits to going early and being separated from the others as they move forward. And all of this damaging information comes out and about what everyone was doing, what specific roles they had, and how guilty they were.",

And so now you're even looking at an even shorter timeframe to examine, evaluate and get your strategic defenses.So to your question, it may not be feasible, but remember Amara, who asked for this, the defense asked for this, it wasn't the prosecutor saying, Hey, let's go, I want to be ready. Let's do this. This was in response to Mr. Chesebro, saying, hey, I want my trial. I want it now. Then the prosecutor saying fine, we'll have it now, the judge agreeing and setting a schedule. But to your point, it may not be practical to have it move forward. There are inherent delays, that could be motion practice, that could be rights that certainly the attorney for the attorney who's going on trial may assert that take time to sort out.

I think we would get a preview as the trial went forward with respect to the nature of the evidence, remember that when you have a RICO case, you're going to be talking about prosecutors, we'll be talking about the nature of the enterprise. What was everyone's role? What specifically did they do? How was that criminal? How did that fit into the others? This is a conspiracy. They were acting in coordination. And therefore it'll give you an overall sense of what the defendants as a whole were doing.And so to that extent, it has an impact. And of course, if there's a conviction, and the conviction is to adds to all counts, it has an even further impact. Is that going to be me next will say another defendant? And so in that regard, I think it'll certainly show the public whether the case is strong, whether it has the appropriate corroboration, and whether the other defendant should be worried. And remember, Amara, will certainly get other defendants who will plead guilty, many will fight of course, right. And many -- and some potentially can win. But the reality is, is that I think once everyone sees the evidence coming in, they may get skittish and say, hey, can I cut a deal? Can I turn state's evidence beyond the prosecution's team? Can I get out now? So I think it has effect in that specific way.",

Right. There are four total indictments, those cases of course being indicted prior to this. To what extent is Jack Smith's case take priority in the federal court dealing with election interference, dealing with the other with classified documents? To what extent should the Manhattan DA's case be considered? And so an answer to the question with respect to Trump, Amara, you have to factor all that in. There are other judges, other considerations, other parts of justice that have to be meted out. So, I think we're looking not until next year, unless there's a meeting of the minds with all the parties to say, hey, look, this is the way we're going to structure this. Let's coordinate, let's do this right in the interest of justice, and in that regard, unless the others take a backseat to the Georgia case.

But his conduct comes down to being on the call that you noted, Amara, in addition to traveling to Georgia to oversee the audit that was not open to the public and making some text and other phone calls.He's going to argue that he did it in his capacity as Chief of Staff to the President. The President had a good faith belief that there were problems with the election. As a result, he was following instructions of his boss as a public official to carry out his responsibilities. He wasn't engaged in criminality. That will be the argument. To the extent that he will argue, he was acting as a public official and under the umbrella and color of a president who really felt it appropriate to look at this. He certainly has a shot to having it removed to federal court. Remember, in removal to federal court, the essence of the case is the same. It'll be prosecuted under Georgia law, to be prosecuted by Georgia prosecutors, and he still faces exposure, but making the argument of removal he certainly has an opportunity to do that, and he could very well prevail based upon his arguments.",

New Orleans looking at temperatures pretty consistent the next two days. But then we finally start to see those temperatures dropping back down, at least for the upcoming week. So again, in New Orleans this weekend, it's still expected to remain in the triple digits.

Oliveira is the former administrator of the Hawaii County Civil Defense Agency and will start on Monday.Meantime, Maui County now suing the state's largest electric company they claim that Hawaiian Electric left their power lines energized during the high winds and at the fire was a direct result of their negligence. CNN's Natasha Chen explains. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) NATASHA CHEN, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (on camera): Amara and Rahel, the Maui County lawsuit against the electric companies alleges negligence and recklessness. They call this a human made disaster. Specifically the county is saying in this lawsuit, quote, defendants inaction caused loss of life, severe injuries, complete destruction of homes and businesses, displacement of thousands of people and damage to many of Hawaii's historic and cultural sites. They say that the electric companies didn't keep up their equipment well that there was advanced wood decay, that they did not have a policy to shut down de-energize the lines, especially when there were high wind watches and red flag warnings in those days leading up to the fires, that they knew there was a high probability that wildfires may happen. To that end, the CEO and President of Hawaii Electric said about a week after the fires, that is actually controversial practice. Even though there are places like California, Oregon, Nevada, that shut down those lines de-energize them as a way of preventing wildfires. To the lawsuit the spokesperson of the utility companies told CNN that their main priority is to take care of Maui residents and the county and they're disappointed that the county took this litigious route. And a separately the Washington Post is reporting that the utility actually removed poles and lines, other equipment from where the Lahaina fires reportedly started preventing investigators from being able to view the original scene undisturbed. That's according to the Post's investigation into court documents letters, records. CNN is still working to independently confirm that. The Post does say that those actions violated national guidelines on how utilities should handle and preserve evidence after a wildfire. To that, the spokesperson of the electric company said to The Post that they are in regular communication with ATF and local authorities cooperating to provide them as well as attorneys representing people affected by the wildfires with inventories and access to the removed equipment which they say they've carefully photographed, documented, and stored. Also, as you may have noted, the list of unaccounted people is down to under 400. Now, down from more than 1,000. The FBI verified those names and the police chief did say that this was going to be a painful moment for the loved ones of the people listed there right now.

CNN's Meg Tirrell breaks it all down for us. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)MEG TIRRELL, CNN REPORTER (on camera): Well, we know that drugs like Wegovy and Ozempic are widely used for weight loss and for diabetes. But increasing evidences suggesting that they have benefits for the heart as well. And a new study just out looked at the use of Wegovy, which is the drug called Semaglutide, which is approved for weight loss and obesity. They looked at this in obesity and heart failure, and specifically, a type of heart failure called heart failure with preserved ejection fraction. And that's one of the more common forms of heart failure, and It often occurs in people with obesity. So, in this trial, they looked at this group of folks, and they gave them this drug and compared it with placebo over the course of the year. And what they found is that it led to increased weight loss, 13 percent on the drug compared with just more than 2 percent on placebo, but also improvement in symptoms of heart failure, things like shortness of breath, fatigue, trouble with exertion and swelling, also improving exercise function and quality of life for these patients. So doctors, I spoke with were very excited about this data, saying it was really the biggest benefit they've ever seen with a medication in this patient population on that symptom score. And this really adds to the amount of evidence suggesting that this kind of medicine really can have benefits beyond diabetes and weight loss. With this trial, also a recent trial showing that Wegovy can reduce the risk of a heart attack, stroke or heart-related death by 20 percent, and people with cardiovascular disease and who are overweight or have obesity. So, these really are creating a lot of excitement in the medical world. There are also uses that Novo Nordisk, the maker of Wegovy is testing this drug for -- and the chemical name is Semaglutide looking at liver disease called NASH as well as Alzheimer's disease. So, there are a lot of potential uses here. Of course, a lot of folks ask about the side effects and the drawbacks potentially of these medicines. The most common side effects are gastrointestinal issues, typically things like nausea and vomiting. Those can be intolerable for 5 percent to 10 percent of patients, but typically, go away after you've been on the drug for a little while, and you sort of get used to it. There are some more severe side effects that doctors are on the lookout for, one that CNN has done a lot of reporting on, that has not been proven to be linked to the drug. But the way the drug works is partly to slow the passage of food through the stomach. And there is a concern that for some patients, that can happen too severely and actually lead to stomach paralysis. It has not been proven to be a link with the drug, but it is something that doctors are on the lookout for and are calling for more research into. Of course, there are other issues with these drugs including that, there's a shortage for some patients. They cannot access the medications, and also with insurance coverage. Doctors are hoping that increasing evidence showing the health benefits of these medicines will help with insurance coverage, but they are pretty expensive, more than a $1,000 per month without insurance. So that's something they hope will improve. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
