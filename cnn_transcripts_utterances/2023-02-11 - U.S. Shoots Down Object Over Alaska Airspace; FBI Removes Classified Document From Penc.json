The Pentagon says there's significant differences between this object and the Chinese spy balloon shot down over the Atlantic last Saturday.The object Friday had no surveillance equipment and couldn't steer itself. It was flying at 40,000 feet over Alaska's northern coast. Authorities say it posed a threat to civilian aircraft. The debris field has been mapped and officials hope to learn more from the wreckage but they aren't sure what it is or who it belongs to. Here's John Kirby. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ADM. JOHN KIRBY (RET.), COORDINATOR FOR STRATEGIC COMMUNICATIONS, WHITE HOUSE NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL:  The president absolutely was involved in this decision. He ordered it at the recommendation of Pentagon leaders. He wanted it taken down and they did that. They did it using fighter aircraft assigned to U.S. Northern Command. We are calling this an object because that's the best description we have right now. We do not know who owns it, whether it's state-owned or corporate owned or privately owned. We just don't know. We don't know. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And it was determined it was flying at around 40,000 feet and did not appear to have the ability to maneuver on its own. It was essentially floating with the wind and the president determined it did pose a risk to civilian aircraft because of the altitude. Unlike the Chinese spy balloon, this did not have any visible surveillance equipment on it, according to a U.S. official. It's also unclear still where the object actually came from. But it was heading in a northeasterly direction when it was shot down on Friday. It was also much smaller than the Chinese balloon. It was about the size of a small car, whereas the balloon's payload alone was about the size of three buses. The so the U.S. has now begun efforts to recover the debris. It will now be taken to an FBI lab for further processing -- Natasha Bertrand, CNN, Washington. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

In Turkiye, emergency crews from around the world have been digging through the rubble for five days now, hoping to find another survivor.On Friday they rescued a mother and daughter who had been trapped for 107 hours. With each passing minute, hopes of finding more people alive are fading. Many of those who died are being buried in mass graves like this one in Syria. And those who survived have been left with almost nothing. The World Food Programme says aid is arriving but more than half a million people need help. Nick Paton Walsh is in Turkiye with more on the rescue operations there.

We got a glimpse of how that might look in the last hours, when a false rumor was started amongst the crowds here that a dam nearby had broken and we're about to be flooded. That caused people to pile into any car they could and just try and drive out as quickly as possible. Of course the roads were jammed and that was impossible. It turned out to be false information. But shortly afterwards, some local men chased down other local men, who they say were trying to rob an abandoned building.

They do not believe anyone still trapped could be alive. Very sad and difficult news for those loved ones and family members hoping, praying, waiting for news that perhaps their loved ones may still be alive. It looks it may now be a recovery effort instead. So some real difficult moments ahead. Despite that, there's been some moments of hope.

      "sentences": "Clearly there's a great deal of interest in a visit of the U.S. president to Poland to mark the anniversary on February 24th of the latest Russian invasion of Ukraine.But the reality on the ground is that Ukrainians are grappling with another Russian offensive. Now they believe that the much vaunted spring offensive has come early, effectively with very intensive attacks by professional military personnel from the Russian airborne divisions in Kreminna, in the eastern part of the country. And also renewed activity around the city or the town of Bakhmut. That's a town that's been very, very bloody focus of the Russian efforts, with these wave upon wave upon wave of attacks by conscripts and volunteers from the Wagner mercenary group being thrown into a battle that they simply are not going to survive. And winning ground incrementally at gigantic human costs. Now on the ground, fighters on the Ukrainian side are saying they're seeing a more professional effort being thrown into that. They believe if you combine that with the overnight bombardment with cruise missiles, with the Shahed drones that have been put in by Iran, more attacks against the national infrastructure, particularly the energy infrastructure of the country, certainly the Ukrainian perspective is that the latest Russian offensive has begun. So what they would like to hear from a Biden administration before he gets to Poland but certainly by the time he gets to Poland is clearance to supply them with the long range missiles and the jets they say they so badly need to defend themselves. Firstly and secondly to get on the front foot and rid their country of the Russian invaders -- Sam Kiley, CNN, Eastern Ukraine. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

You both have a lot in common protecting democracy.Is that the main central thrust of your meeting here? DA SILVA (through translator):  Well, I believe that to defend democracy is an obligation of all democrats in the world. I would never could imagine that it could happen in the U.S. and North America, the invasion of the capital, as I could -- never could have imagined that in Brazil, after democratic procession elections, would -- could have an invasion of the Supreme Court and the presidential palace. And so, this means that you have extreme Right running around the world, an extreme Right that is very nervous and that uses fake news as if it was a tool to develop politics and talk to people -- communicate to people. And we have to destroy, you know, this narrative that the use against the Democrats. And I should say that yesterday, that I want to congratulate President Biden for his excellent speech at the State of the Union at the national Congress. That it was a very, very interesting speech. It looks like he was talking to Brazil because, in Brazil, the same thing that happened is the same thing that's going on in the U.S. now. (END VIDEO CLIP)",
