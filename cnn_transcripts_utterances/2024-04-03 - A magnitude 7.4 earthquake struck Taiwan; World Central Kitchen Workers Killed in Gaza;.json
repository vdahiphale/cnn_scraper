Now the magnitude 7.4 quake struck about 8 a.m. local time. We're hearing it was the strongest quake to hit the island in 25 years. At least one person is reported dead. Authorities say there are reports of people still trapped in some of the dozens of collapsed buildings. And more than 91,000 households at this hour have no electricity.Now Taiwan's defense ministry has now deployed troops to the quake zone. Now this quake struck off the eastern side of the island and led to tsunami warnings and evacuations for parts of Japan and the Philippines. Thankfully, those have now been canceled. CNN's Hanako Montgomery has been tracking all of this for us from Tokyo and joins us now. Hanako, what more are you hearing about injuries and potential damage here.

      "sentences": "Yeah, Paula, I mean, definitely a huge, huge shock. I mean, this earthquake was very alarming for people in Taiwan. Like you mentioned, it is the strongest quake that the island has felt in the past 25 years. The last time was back in 1999 when a magnitude 7.7 earthquake killed 2400 people. Now, in terms of this earthquake that happened this morning, we know that it happened near Hualien County.The epicenter was near Hualien County, which is known as a very popular tourist destination. It's on the eastern part of Taiwan. It's also a rural area and where most of Taiwan's earthquakes actually take place. Now, we have heard that  one person is confirmed dead. This is a hiker who was in Hualien County near that epicenter like I just mentioned. We are also hearing reports of injuries from the Taiwanese government. We also know that more than 91000 households are without power. We are seeing roads partially collapsed and really terrifying footage of landslides occurring around Taiwan, disrupting people's evacuation efforts and really debris just flying around there. We also know that people are stuck underneath some of these collapsed homes and buildings. Twenty six buildings, in fact, have collapsed. And in response to this natural disaster, the Taiwanese Defense Ministry has dispatched military troops to work with local governments and coordinate evacuation efforts. This is pretty common protocol in Taiwan. When you see a natural disaster of this scale, trying to get people to higher ground to safety and trying to account for those who still might be trapped underneath those collapsed homes, those collapsed buildings. Now, also to note Taiwan, of course, Taiwan was issuing that tsunami warning that was issued for Japan and the Philippines. Those have been lifted in Hualien County. We know that schools and work have been suspended for the day because of those constant aftershocks. And the Taiwanese government has warned that we could be seeing aftershocks for the next three to four days. Magnitudes ranging from six point five to seven, which is still quite powerful. And Paula, you know, as someone who lives in a very seismically active country, Japan, these aftershocks can be just as terrifying as that first initial earthquake because you never know when they're going to take place. They never feel like they're going to stop. And it's very, very terrifying, I think, for people in Taiwan at the moment Paula.",

I think there's been a lot of warnings in the past. And this is not a surprise in many ways, because we've had many other incidents. Obviously, this is a very more tragic incident than others we've had. But over the years, the months that this has been happening, we've seen many, many incidents that have taken place, resulting in the deaths of humanitarian workers and obviously attacks on houses, premises.

But there have been so many incidents where that hasn't actually worked. So the insecurity for humanitarian workers and installations has been problematic and it's actually reduced our ability to move and deliver. And I think these coordinated move vacation systems we have, have to be revisited because it's just not functioning properly.

It's the most dangerous place for the humanitarian work in the world right now. There's no safe places left in Gaza. Everywhere is a threat. We have a law and order breakdown because people's desperation causes them to actually attack some of the trucks that come through with aid. That's one thing. Also, the discipline and the unpredictability of IDF checkpoints is problematic. And I think those things are making it difficult. We have to have a conversation with the IDF themselves, and that's not something that's happened regularly.We already start to see now the government, the Prime Minister, the Minister of Defense, Gallant, saying that we have to have a different type of connectivity and conversation. And that means us sitting down in a joint operations center where we have face-to-face discussions to build two things, a better understanding of the work we do, which I think is lost on the IDF in many ways, and secondly, to build up a degree of trust, which is currently not there right now. And that's something that has to happen if we're going to take on this massive humanitarian challenge, because it's going to be with us for a long time. This is not a short emergency.

Israel has refused to claim responsibility for the strike, but Tuesday afternoon, the U.S. Defense Department spokesperson said the Pentagon assesses Israel indeed did it.U.S. officials insist they did not have prior knowledge of the strike. Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei and President Ibrahim Raisi have said the strike will not go unanswered. How that response will come, where, and when, is unclear. Until now, Iran has targeted Israel and U.S. forces in the region with the U.S. forces in the region through allied militias Lebanon, Iraq, Syria and Yemen. But it has always avoided a direct attack, but now Iran's prestige is on the line. If it doesn't respond forcefully, it will appear weak before its friends and its foes. If it does respond directly and forcefully to Israel, the war that rages in Gaza could spread across the Middle East. I'm Ben Wiedemann, CNN, reporting from Beirut.",
