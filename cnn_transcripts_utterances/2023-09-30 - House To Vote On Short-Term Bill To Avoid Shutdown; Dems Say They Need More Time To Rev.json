And the House is in session right now looking to vote on a short-term funding bill at any moment now. House Speaker Kevin McCarthy's 11th hour plan would keep the government open for 45 days, but relies on Democratic support in order to pass.Democrats say they need more time to read through the proposal and see what's actually in it. Just moments ago, House Speaker McCarthy expressed his frustration about the process. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY (R-CA): I have tried for eight months. It took me a long time to finally get the appropriation bills on the floor. They were delayed. I tried yesterday with the most conservative stopgap funding bill you could find that secured our border, that cut spending, and I couldn't get 218 Republicans on. This will be on suspension. It takes a higher threshold. But what I am asking Republicans and Democrats alike, put your partisanship away. Focus on the American public. How can you in good conscience, think of the men and women who volunteer to risk their lives to defend us to say they can't be paid why we work out our differences. That is unfair. I cannot do that to our men and women in uniform. And so, we're going to keep government open. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

So, you know, first off is the House Speaker's frustration well placed in your view? REP. DEBBIE DINGELL (D-MI)That gave us 15 minutes before they wanted to vote. We asked for 90 minutes just to be able to read the bill. None of us have decided what we're going to do. Every Democrat I know in this caucus wants to keep the government open. Republicans are this is solely on Speaker McCarthy and members of his caucus' shoulders. And we are all here. And we're going to do everything we can to find a solution to keep this government open, but not one that risks other things like women and children and our national security.",

There is a small group of Republicans, the Freedom Caucus, that hot step too many things -- called too many political things over people's head.And at some point, you got to decide what's right for the institution. But, you know, I'm going to remind people, if you've got time, and you're glued to what's happening in Washington. There was a gentleman by the name of Speaker Cannon about 100 years ago who was not popular and had many of the kinds of issues the Speaker head. And he finally challenged him and a lot of people thought he would lose and I -- my office is in the Cannon House Office Building. At some point, individual politics has to go to the wayside, and we need to do what's right for the American people. We should not be where we are today.

      "sentences": "Yes. Democrats are still trying to decide what to do. As you can imagine, they were a little bit caught off guard this morning when House Speaker Kevin McCarthy announced he was going to put this clean bill on the floor. Basically, it is a 45-day short-term spending bill that would fund the government through November 17th. It includes disaster aid, but as one Democrat put it to me, there are some trust issues with House Speaker Kevin McCarthy.So, they want to look over this 70-plus page bill, make sure that there's no poison pills in it, make sure that there's nothing in here that actually would be a Republican policy that they don't support. And there have been some Democrats raising concerns about it. One of them Representative Rosa DeLauro, who you see there on your screen on the floor of the House of Representatives. She's the top Democrat on the House Appropriations Committee. You know, Democrats are having conversations with the White House. They're having conversations with their Democratic colleagues in the Senate. Because there's a question. Do they want to give up a fight for Ukraine? There was $6.2 billion in the Senate, short-term spending bill for Ukraine. Some of that money, Democrats argue is really essential, even though it's only for a 45-day spending bill. But Democrats are weighing. Is it worth potentially shutting the government over that issue? One of the Democrats that I talked to, Adam Smith just a few minutes ago, he's the top Democrat on the Armed Services Committee. He said he is as dogged of a supporter of Ukraine, as you will find here on Capitol Hill. But he's not sure he would be willing to shut the government over it. So that is really what Democrats are weighing at this moment. And he said, you know, Democrats still want to go through this bill. He made no promises about how we would vote. But there is really sort of this push and pull the Democrats are feeling right now, given the fact they didn't think that they would be in this position in this moment. So that is why you've seen the delay of more than an hour and a half at this point. That is why you're starting to see questions from Democrats about how they want to proceed here.",

      "sentences": "Yes. I mean, once again, Congress is very good at delaying things. And that is exactly what happened. What you're seeing on the floor right now is Hakeem Jeffries, the Democratic leader using his so-called Magic Minute. And the reason it's called the Magic Minute, is because you never know how long leaders will go using that device. This is basically another delay tactic as Democrats are trying to continue to work with their colleagues over in the Senate at the White House to try to understand the best path forward right now.They are still going through this legislation, still trying to understand if it indeed is just exactly as House Speaker Kevin McCarthy and Republican leaders described it. They have some trust issues with the Speaker. And you heard from Jefferies, just a few moments back there where he said we could have avoided this. He is referring to a debt deal that was made between McCarthy and President Joe Biden that set spending levels for an entire fiscal year. And the expectation was always that Republicans and Democrats would try and work along those contours to come up with a way to avoid this moment that you are seeing right now unfold at the U.S. Capitol. And as we wait to see whether the government is going to shut down. What happened instead was you had Republicans in the House of Representatives marking their bills up at a much lower spending levels because of hardliners who were holding the House floor hostage, arguing that Kevin McCarthy had cut a bad deal. So, McCarthy turned to them and basically moved forward with a series of spending bills that were at such lower levels that they were never going to get Democratic support. And so, that is what is being alleged here from Jeffries. That is what he's talking about when he says this moment could have been avoided. But what's happening right now is the Senate has delayed a vote right now in their chamber because they are having conversations with their Democratic colleagues in the House. Again, if the bill that has been presented is as how speaker Kevin McCarthy described it, it's a 45-day short-term spending bill that includes disaster aid, but does not include about $6.2 billion in Ukraine aid. And that is something that Republicans and Democrats in the Senate wanted to see in this package. So, right now, Democrats are just trying to have a conversation about whether or not they need to keep fighting for that aid or whether or not they might be comfortable moving forward without it. They're also again, scrubbing the legislative text to just make sure there's no surprises. Again, they did not expect to be here today playing out as this has.",

And I wonder, well, this Magic Minute is an opportunity for the minority leader to speak as long as he wants to, quite frankly, right?Is that part of the objective here to -- that he's going to speak as long as he can, maybe not 90 minutes, but take up a good amount of time while other Democrats are poring through the language, looking at over. We also understand the White House is talking to house Dems about what may or may not be in it.

Here we are, now just hours away from a possible government shutdown. This, as House Democrats are also now considering trying to read through some 72 pages of a stopgap measure that has been proposed by Republicans in the House there. House Speaker Kevin McCarthy earlier saying it was an important measure, one that would buy about 45 days' time to keep government open. It would allow for national disaster relief money and allow for payment to U.S. troops and Border Patrol, but it would be without aid assistance to Ukraine. Let's talk about all of this as these goings-on on Capitol Hill continue. I want to bring in David Swerdlick, he's back now, with \"The New York Times,\" and Juliegrace Brufke, from \"Axios.\" Good to see you both. So, David, let's pick up from where we left off. If we remember where we were at that point.

We'll know by midnight if that's going to happen. On the substantive question that you asked, you have this situation where I think right now the speaker has realized that his holdouts are really trying to hold out. So his choices are either try and negotiate for 45 more days or try and figure out a way that he won't take political heat for using Democratic votes to pass a bill that Republicans want to pass on their own. I think, as we talked about before, he's trying to look like the adult in the room without signaling to Republicans that he is caving on their priorities. I heard him today say that this was a really conservative bill. There's a clip of Congressman Crenshaw going around on Twitter of him using that line as well. I think the majority of the Republican caucus wants to find a way to get this done without starting a war with those 21 holdouts threatening the speaker's speakership.",

I think one of the gifts of this period of time, really at the end of this last chapter of his life, it gives all of us a chance to really think about him as a leader.This was an American president, the most powerful human being on the planet at the time. He was president during the Cold War. He had to deal with a really serious nuclear confrontation, all of this. But what did he do? He did that, and he stood up for human rights, for human rights activists all over the world. He worked for peace. One of the things that he's most proud of is that he never launched a war. We had four years of peace under his presidency. He put solar panels on the White House and started an energy policy, adopted an energy policy that would have us on renewables by now. So I think the chance we all have is to think about what he stood for all of these years, when he was governor of Georgia, saving the rivers of Georgia, when he was president, talking about human rights and peace. And since then, really, the great work of the Carter Center, eliminating neglected diseases, advancing democracy and human rights throughout the world, all of this work. We get a chance to really reflect on that work. It made me think about how we could contribute to peace and the global movement for human rights and climate justice. All of these things, I think that's what he would want.",
