Right now Israeli forces control the Gaza side of the Rafah crossing,all at the same time, negotiators from Israel and Hamas are in neighboring Egypt, trying to broker a deal for a ceasefire and release of hostages.

But aid groups are criticizing so called expanded humanitarian zones as being inadequate. Rafah's last functioning hospital pleading for all available medical teams to help treat the wounded.

      "sentences": "Yes, we have a pretty good idea, although we don't know the specific precise details, John, but basically what Hamas held the press conference yesterday in Beirut and said that the deal that it agreed to, which of course is not an Israeli proposal, really ticks its boxes, it would involve the withdrawal of Israeli troops, movement of people from north to south who have been displaced and an end to the siege.And the wording of that last point is important here because according to a diplomatic source familiar with these talks, speaking to CNN, they said that what's in this deal, which is the rebuilding of Gaza, during a period of sustainable calm, is a way of essentially agreeing to a permanent ceasefire or effectively a permanent ceasefire without calling it that because Hamas, of course, is insisting that any ceasefire be permanent. And the Israelis are insisting the precise opposite, that they will not agree to any kind of permanent ceasefire, because the war will only end when not only the hostages are returned, but also when Hamas is completely destroyed. Now, if you ask the White House, they say that look, if you look at the text of what each side is willing to agree to they're not far off, there should be a way to make a deal in there. But this is at odds with what the Israelis are saying that there are still significant gaps between the two. Of course we heard the Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu say yesterday that this deal in his mind that Hamas put forward or said that it agreed to was just a way of foiling or torpedoing this invasion into Rafah, which did not happen. Of course, Netanyahu and Israel has been saying since day one, that the best way to get the hostages back is with military pressure and it seems like they're sticking to their own advice there, John.",

But perhaps it is enough to satisfy the hardliners in the Prime Minister's government who are insisting that he go ahead with this operation in Rafah, or that they'll threaten the or they say that they'll topple his government, if they don't, or if he doesn't.The reality, John, is that there are pressures on all sides here. Hamas, of course, is feeling pressure to get a deal because its survival may well depend on it. Of course, there are pressures on the Israelis at home, we're seeing the protests, we're also seeing polling data that suggests that most Israelis would rather see or think that the first priority should be to bring the hostages home and make a deal rather than the military operation or the goals of the military operation. We are also seeing pressure from the outside on Israel, namely from the United States. And that reporting that you mentioned from our colleague, Oren Liebermann, citing a U.S. source that a shipment of U.S. bombs destined for Israel has been paused over concerns that those bombs could be used in densely populated areas of Rafah, we're talking about some 3,500 bombs, about half of them are 2,000 pound bombs, the other half or 500 pound bombs. And when we're talking about these 2,000 pound or one ton bombs, these are things that will leave massive craters, they'll shoot shrapnel hundreds of yards perhaps. And so this is not the kind of weapon that is meant for a densely populated area. The U.S. says that, look, this has nothing to do with its ironclad resolve, or its ironclad commitment to Israeli security. But it is one more piece of evidence, perhaps of the pressure piling up on the Israelis. And perhaps there's also pressure on the Americans as well, because it is worth noting, John that today is the deadline for the Secretary of State Antony Blinken to report to Congress to confirm that assurances that is Israel has given that U.S. weapons will only be used in accordance with international law. Blinken needs to assess whether that those assurances are credible and reliable. So again, just one more piece of a very complicated puzzle here.",

And when it comes to these kinds of bombs, the other problem, though with them is that they can actually destroy large sections of the city, for example, several blocks worth. And that is why the administration apparently has decided -- the U.S. administration that is has decided to keep those bombs from being sent to Israel at this particular point in time.

You don't want anything bad to happen to grandma or your brother in law, your sister in law, or whatever it is, and so you better work for us. It's very complicated stuff. And those two societies it doesn't surprise me that the Russians have had some success in getting some penetrations inside the Ukrainian government.",
