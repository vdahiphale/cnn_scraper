Former U.S. President Donald Trump has received a letter from a special prosecutor indicating he is a target of the January 6 investigation. That special prosecutor is looking into attempts to overturn the 2020 presidential election as well as the attack on the capital building that day. Now we move to a developing story that we've been following an American man is believed to be a North Korean custody after crossing the border during a tour of the demilitarized zone. A U.S. official tells CNN the man is believed to be a U.S. soldier who was not in uniform. The United Nations Command which organized the tours says it is working with the North Korean army to resolve the situation. The orientation tour of the Joint Security Area is open to the public. Joining us now CNN's Marc Stewart, to give us an update Marc, look you've been to the DMZ. Not many details about the man apart from the fact that he is a soldier. We don't know how he crossed and why? So what is the latest?",

I mean, there are questions about whether he deliberately crossed the line or whether it was a mishap or mistake. I mean, there are so many things around it.

I actually have been into North Korea itself, but I did not enter through the DMZ, I entered in an area known as Kaesong at the time, it was an industrial area. And in order to enter North Korea, I had have permission. I was with a group of other journalists. This was back in 2008 actually. We had to take a bus. In fact, we had to leave our newspapers behind with news from the west because it is that insulated of a nation. And then when we were there, there were a lot of restrictions about what we could see pictures we could take people we could talk to. So this is not, it's very rare for Americans to access this area period. And it is it is not a place where Americans are necessarily welcome. So that's why this is also baffling.",

Russia says it retaliated for Ukraine strike on a key Bridge. Ukraine says it shot down a wave of Russian drones and missiles over Odesa overnight. Officials say debris damaged homes and symbolically as well as practically port infrastructure was damaged. Ukraine uses these ports along the Black Sea to ship its grain under a deal that has now been cancelled by Russia. Kenya is calling Russia's decision to terminate the deal of quote a stab in the back of global food security prices. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs pointed to the disappropriate, disproportionate rather impacts of the decision and how it will impact the Horn of Africa. And the numbers are staggering 33 million tons of foodstuffs have been exported from Ukraine under the initiative. In 2023, the World Food Programme has procured 80 percent of its wheat from Ukraine for its humanitarian operations. More than 300,000 tons have been sent to Ethiopia to Kenya as well as Somalia. Take a listen to what the U.N. Secretary General had to say after Russia pulled out of the deal. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ANTONIO GUTERRES, U.N. SECRETARY-GENERAL: Ultimately, participation in these agreements is a choice. But struggling people everywhere and developing countries don't have a choice. And that is of millions of people face hunger and consumers are confronting a global cost of living crisis and they will pay the price. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And this is at a time when the region which previously was on fire now feels as though it has been doused with petrol. War in Sudan particularly, is coming at the worst possible time. We expect that in that country alone, over 40 percent of the population, because of the conflict and because the inability of WFP to scale its operations could be acutely food insecure.

If this break continues for an extended period of time, there's only one direction that prices can go and that's an increase. Now, in the U.S., in the U.K., typically a household spends about 10 percent of its budget to put food on the table.

And I think most people had expected or in the tradition of the Israeli- U.S. relationship had expected some sort of invitation to the White House sooner than that. Now, the Israeli President visiting this is ostensibly connected to Israel celebrating its 75 years as statehood. That's why the Israeli president is addressing the joint session of Congress. He's actually the only second Israeli President to do so. And the last time in Israeli leader address a joint sessions of Congress in this way was actually Benjamin Netanyahu in 2015, when he gave his infamous speech against the nuclear Iranian nuclear deal that the American government was negotiating that was seen, of course, as a largely a slap to the face to the then Obama administration. And it is interesting to see the difference between how Isaac Herzog is being treated, versus how Benjamin Netanyahu has been treated so far in just the next few hours. The Israeli President is expected to sit down with Joe Biden with the President Biden in the Oval Office to have a photo op. He's meeting with several other major American leaders, everyone from the Speaker of the House, of course, to Kamala Harris, the Vice President. And then of course, tomorrow will be his major speech to the joint sessions of Congress. So he's getting the traditional sort of red carpet treatment you would expect from a leader. Now, as you noted, he's really President is mostly a ceremonial figurehead. He is not a member of Benjamin Netanyahu's government. He's not even a member of Benjamin Antonio's political party has actually been trying to mediate. He had been hosting mediation talks on this judicial overhaul at the President's residence.
