What he's not entitled to have is appointees who don't have the character and the judgment to wield the responsibilities of the office to which they have been appointed.This is the whole purpose of the Senate confirmation process. The founders set it up to make sure that a president cannot install unqualified loyalists into positions at his pleasure, cannot put the trust and faith of the American people and the powers of this government in the hands of people who cannot be counted on to wield that power responsibly. So, that's the point of this whole process. And the FBI review, it's not about FBI approval, it's about the Senate having an informed basis on which to render its judgment on confirmation.",

We don't know what their qualifications are. But, more importantly, we don't know if they are going to be consistent and thorough in the way that they review those nominees. And what that throws away too is this long established Senate process that Gregg and I were a part of in a bipartisan way where the Senate Judiciary Committee would receive these FBI background checks, would know what to look for, would follow up if there were gaps or things that required further investigation so that the Senate would have all the information it would need to make sure that these nominees were appropriate people to serve the American people. With a private company, you just have no idea that that's going to happen and that the Senate is going to get the information that it needs.

It's a system that's also confidential, which I don't think people understand.The Senate confirmation process has a public component. The hearings that everybody's familiar with. But the background investigation is done on a bipartisan basis, behind closed doors, and is taken very seriously. Noah and I worked together at a time when confirmation battles were maybe the most politically divisive issue in Washington, but that never extended to the background investigation, which we handled, again, confidentially and responsibly on a bipartisan basis. It was never weaponized or misused. It was just used in service of informing our bosses in the U.S. Senate and performing their constitutional duty.",

So, people are going to be online shopping at that point. Black Friday was also really big. We saw numbers, about $10.8 billion this year compared to last year. That's up about $1 billion. And the trends that we're seeing this year are more people are shopping directly from their phones, not cozying up with their laptops anymore, directly from the phones, and buy now, pay later. This is like the modern day layaway. So, you pay in installments. You don't have to pay everything up front. $7.6 billion to date. And today alone, on Cyber Monday, $1 billion expected to be buy now, pay later. Experts are concerned about this because that's when you start racking up debt.

Although the latest data we have from the CDC, and we expect they will be updated today, are from about two weeks ago, mid-November. But as of that point, you can see across the country really low levels, a little bit elevated in certain states, but still not at the really high levels we expect to potentially get into later this fall and into the winter.Also, though, we all just got together for Thanksgiving with family and friends. And so what doctors are telling us is that about a week after Thanksgiving often you can start to see an increase in levels of these respiratory viruses. So, Covid, right now, is actually at pretty low levels and declining after a bump we saw in the summer. That's a pattern we often see and then we have seen every year since Covid joined us that we get a bigger bump during the winter. And so we're sort of bracing ourselves to see what happens there. Right now flu is pretty low, but is starting to increase, especially among younger children. The same with RSV, especially in the south. And that's a pattern we often see. It starts there first. So, these levels are starting to rise. But, Kate, there's another thing that's been afflicting children basically since late summer called mycoplasma pneumoniae. That's sort of a walking pneumonia. It's a bacterial infection that has been affecting kids. You can see here, we're showing you the flu vaccine rates for children. And this is something that's really concerning public health officials right now. The rates in that blue line right there are underneath the orange line. That is the vaccination rate for kids for flu before Covid. So, we're tracking quite a bit lower in terms of pediatric flu vaccination rates. And that's something that's worrying folks because they do find that kids who are hospitalized for flu are typically ones who have not received the updated flu vaccine, Kate.",
