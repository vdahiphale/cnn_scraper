And we begin this hour in Ukraine where the country's military says Ukrainian forces have been fighting off dozens of Russian attacks in and around the battered city of Bakhmut in just the past day. This video posted on social media appears to show a Ukrainian combat vehicle coming under fire from fighters with the Wagner Mercenary Group.But despite the nonstop attacks, Ukraine claims Russian forces are suffering significant losses. This video appears to show Russian soldiers retreating from an area on the outskirts of Bakhmut. But Russia says its forces are making gains and have already captured settlements around the eastern Ukrainian city. Russia's Defense Ministry -- Minister I should say, says a victory in Bakhmut will lead to further advances. That's a concern for Ukraine and for President Volodymyr Zelenskyy who spoke with CNN about the decision to continue defending Bakhmut. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) VOLODYMR ZELENSKYY, PRESIDENT OF UKRAINE (through translator): This is tactical for us. We understand that after Bakhmut they could go further or they could go to Kramatorsk to Sloviansk. It will be an open road for the Russians after Bakhmut to other towns in Ukraine in the Donetsk direction in the east of Ukraine. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

A source told CNN that assessment was not made with high confidence and is not the predominant view of the intelligence community.The Kremlin is also reacting with the spokesman telling Russian state media the report is part of a \"obvious misinformation campaign coordinated by the media.\" And CNN's Salma Abdelaziz is following all the developments for us.

      "sentences": "Rosemary, I think that this new reporting will only add more questions rather than give us answers about something that's really confounded investigators across both sides of the Atlantic for months now. And that is who is responsible for this very brazen attack, the sabotage attack or what is believed to be an intentional attack on the Nord Stream pipelines.Just a reminder, this occurred September of last year. It is believed than an intentional attack and explosion, a powerful explosion ripped through these two pipelines. Nord Stream 1 and Nord Stream 2 tearing four holes in the two pipelines. These were important pipelines that funneled natural gas from Russia into Germany into mainland Europe. At the time of these powerful explosions in September of last year again, Nord Stream 1 was already shut down by the Kremlin due to maintenance that kept being extended in Nord Stream 2 was under construction. So, neither of them were functional at the time, but of course, a major incident in the Baltic Seas. Since that incident took place German, Danish and Swedish investigators have been trying to find out what took place. And yesterday on Tuesday, the New York Times publishing this report that says according to The New York Times, its own reporting, its own journalism, that pro-Ukrainian groups may have been behind the sabotage attack. The New York Times reporting goes on to say that President Zelenskyy himself and his top lieutenants, there's no evidence that they were aware or involved in the attack. But again, it points to pro-Ukrainian groups. Now, for a long time since this incident occurred, there's been disbelief in the intelligence community that potentially it was Russia that stood to benefit from these pipelines being attacked, although NATO never directly accused the Kremlin. So, this very much turns that narrative on its head. Now, Ukrainian officials, for their part, as you mentioned, have denied this outright. They've sort of left off these allegations, these accusations, calling them conspiracy theories and saying that there was no involvement in no evidence of involvement by pro-Ukrainian groups. Moscow has done a very similar thing, calling this an obvious misinformation campaign by the media. And again, brushing off these reports. But it still adds to that question of who was behind. Again, this very brazen attack on these two pipelines. Something that was a very crucial connection for natural gas to Europe and of course, a source of revenue for Moscow. But in some ways the attack on those pipelines accelerated a foregone conclusion, if you will, Rosemary. Europe was very reliant dependent on gas and oil from Russia. Prior to this conflict, it's been weaning itself off since the start of the Ukraine war that was accelerated by the end of these North Nord Stream pipelines. But again, still these investigators trying to find out what's happened. CNN has reached out to us officials for common. They say that this is not the predominant view of the intelligence community, but they continue to dig to find answers.",

Even some Republicans are setting the record straight. SEN. JOHN THUNE (R-SD): And I think it was it was -- yes, it was an attack on the Capitol. SEN. KEVIN CRAMER (R-ND): And I think that breaking through glass windows and doors to get into the United States Capitol against the orders of police is a crime, to somehow put that in the same category as, you know, permitted peaceful protests is just a lie. I get (INAUDIBLE). MURRAY (voiceover): Fox News Tucker Carlson, using curated clips of the Capitol attack to falsely claim, there was no violent insurrection. TUCKER CARLSON, FOX NEWS HOST (voiceover): These were not insurrectionists they were sightseers. MURRAY (voiceover): House Speaker Kevin McCarthy gave Carlson exclusive access to thousands of hours of video from January 6. SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY): Speaker McCarthy is every bit as culpable as Mr. Carlson. MURRAY (voiceover): As U.S. Capitol Police Chief Tom Manger, tore into Carlson's program for its quote, \"Offensive and misleading conclusion. The program conveniently cherry-picked from the calmer moments of our 41,000 hours of video.\" Manger wrote in an internal memo, \"The commentary fails to provide context about the chaos and violence that happened before are during these less tense moments.\" SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL (R-KY): It was a mistake in my view, for Fox News to depict this in a way that's completely at variance with what our chief law enforcement official here at Capitol thinks. MURRAY (voiceover): The chief also defending fallen officer Brian Sicknick, who was attacked with chemical spray and physically fought members of the mob. After Carlson questioned links between his death and the insurrection. CARLSON (voiceover): Here's surveillance footage of Sicknick, walking in the capitol. MURRAY (voiceover): A day after the Capitol attack, Sicknick died from a series of strokes. The medical examiner said he died of natural causes, but \"All that transpired on January 6, played a role in his condition.\" Sicknick's family slammed Fox in a statement saying, \"Every time the pain of that day seems to have ebbed a bit, organizations like Fox rip our wounds wide open again, and we are frankly sick of it.\" Another Carlson claim that the QAnon Shaman walked through the Capitol without pushback from police. But in court where Jacob Tansley pleaded guilty, prosecutors say officers repeatedly tried to get him and others to lead. But officers felt outnumbered on January 6, and weary of confronting them. This as the Justice Department still works to hold writers to account for the attack back then. MERRICK GARLAND, U.S ATTORNEY GENERAL: We have charged more than a thousand people with their crimes on the day and more than 500 have already been convicted. I think it's very clear what happened on January 6. MURRAY (voiceover): Former president and current presidential candidate Donald Trump proclaimed, \"Let the January 6 prisoners go.\" and offered his thanks to Carlson and McCarthy.
