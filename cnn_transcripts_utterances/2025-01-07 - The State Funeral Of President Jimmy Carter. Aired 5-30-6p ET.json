Holy and loving God, receive into your eternal joy your good and faithful servant, James Earl Carter, Jr. Reward him richly and grant him your own well done for his humble and honorable life, worth far more than the many accolades and attributions we have gladly given. May President Jimmy Carter now rest from his labors and be received into the embrace of your everlasting arms.And when the ceremony and fanfare due this man of character and compassion fades into history, when the processions and parades have dispersed, leave with us, O God, the lasting impression and inspiration of a life well lived. Ignite in us the same passion for public service, the courage to champion the underserved, the strength to bear as faithfully the weight of the call to which you have called each one of us to do as justly, to love mercy as unreservedly, to walk as humbly with you as we have witnessed in the testimony of President Jimmy Carter's life of faithfulness. We offer our prayers in the name of the one whom Jimmy Carter would have known to be the first and the last, the Alpha and the Omega, his rock and our redeemer. Amen.",

And the time when we've had so many stories of people doing the -- the convenient thing, the short sighted thing, the weak thing, to have the story of this man's life is really important. I think we heard that was part of what Vice President Harris was talking about.The secular point is we know that Jimmy Carter was a man of profound faith with his -- with his Christian faith. It's underappreciated how he was a man of all faiths. He tried always to address Islam and Judaism and Hinduism and all the rest. I think probably what he would have chosen for this moment is the Jewish sentiment. May his memory be a blessing. STUART EIZENSTAT, FORMER CHIEF WHITE HOUSE DOMESTIC POLICY ADVISER, CARTER ADMIN.: Yes, Jim's point is very important. He did embrace other religions. For example, he came to our Passover Seder just two weeks after he had negotiated the Egypt-Israel Peace Treaty. It was so moving to be with the person who 25 years, 2,500 years earlier, the Israelites fled from Egypt and here he had negotiated the peace with them. He stayed with the entire Seder. He also was the first president to light a Hanukkah Menorah, the first. And he created the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum.",
