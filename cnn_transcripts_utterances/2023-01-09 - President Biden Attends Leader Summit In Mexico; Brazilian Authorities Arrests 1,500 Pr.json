And while things were incredibly tensed as you know between the U.S. and Mexico relations during the Trump years, it's not as though there hasn't been moments of friction under President Biden's watch as well.So, we can certainly expect that the two leaders will want to highlight areas of potential cooperation, and then, of course, immigration is expected to be a top issue of discussion. And this comes at a moment when we have seen, particularly over the last week, that President Biden really needs the cooperation of partners like Mexico as he tries to get a handle on the situation of migrants at the U.S. southern border. You know, when the administration announced its expansion essentially of Title 42 last week, it included an agreement from Mexico to accept tens of thousands of migrants who are being turned away at the U.S. border back into Mexico. So that is going to be, again, a very important topic of discussion. And Jake Sullivan importantly told reporters this morning, don't expect some new plans or new announcements on the migration front from this bilateral meeting. The two countries are really just going to need to take some time to figure out whether that initial agreement is working.",

And he, of course, did spend a lot of time with border officials, local leaders, community leaders.And then he visited this migrant aid center. But it seemed just like a notable mission that he didn't really get to spend any time with migrants, either at the center or even just along the motorcade route. The scenes that we have been seeing reported by some of our colleagues over the last few weeks, those were scenes that the president didn't seem to see and administration official told me this was purely coincidental. Jake Sullivan also said that he was really focused on seeing and meeting with groups who are providing essential services to these migrants. Of course, we are seeing this White House trying to balance seeming stronger on the border, but also showing a humanitarian and humane approach in how they are dealing with this crisis at the border, Jake.",

Thank you so much.Now to Brazil, a soon to be sworn-in lawmaker in Brazil just asked the foreign ministry to extradite the former president, Jair Bolsonaro, back to Brazil from Florida where he currently is, after Bolsonaro's supporters attempted to overthrow the government in widespread protests on Sunday and today. Nearly 1,500 Brazilians have been arrested after rioters stormed all three branches of government fueled by Bolsonaro's familiar echoes, lies about voter fraud and his refusal to concede his loss to his more liberal rival, Lula da Silva, who was inaugurated on January 1st. As CNN's Isa Soares reports for us now, the angry crowd ransacked the presidential palace, destroyed priceless art and even tried to set the carpet in Congress on fire. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ISA SOARES, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  A stunning attack on Brazil's seat of power, as thousands of supporters of former far-right President Jair Bolsonaro broke through security cordons in Brasilia. Roaming presidential building corridors, vandalizing Congress, scenes reminiscent of the 2021 U.S. capitol riot. One week earlier, the scenes were of Democratic triumph, as Bolsonaro's left-wing rival, Lula da Silva was inaugurated as the new Brazilian president following a tight election result. Bolsonaro never explicitly conceded, and neither did his most ardent followers. This, this is my hero. I am at his home, our home, our home, a Bolsonaro supporter says from inside the presidential palace. Protesters dressed in the colors of the Brazilian flag, now a symbol of Bolsonaro's far-right movement. Unfelled banners from the congressional building rooftop, demanding the results of Brazil's most fought election in a generation be overturned. More than 1,000 arrests were made after security forces used tear gas and stun grenades to regain control of the congressional building, the Supreme Court and presidential palace. But by the time they did, the damage had already been done. The president's chief of communication showed destruction inside his own office. UNKNOWN (through translation):  It's unbelievable what was done in the palace. Look at the state of the rooms, equipment, computers. Look at this. SOARES (voice-over):  World leaders condemned the attack as an assault on democracy. Brazil's new president pinned the blame on his predecessor, accusing him of encouraging rioters through social media from Florida. He promised no stone will be left unturned, vowing to find those responsible. LUIZ INACIA LULA DA SILVA, PRESIDENT OF BRAZIL (through translation): We will find out the financiers and they will pay with the force of the law for this irresponsible gesture, this anti-Democratic gesture of vandals and fascists. SOARES (voice-over):  Bolsonaro denounced the actions of his supporters from the U.S. where he traveled after the election. Most of his supporters have now started to disperse their camps in the Brazilian capital after the armed forces were given 24 hours to remove them. In their absence, destruction and lingering fears of what's next for a country that remains bitterly divided. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

They were convicted of killing a member of Iran's Basij paramilitary force during a protest in November.

Among them, 19-year-old Mohammad Boroughani and 22-year-old Mohammad Ghobadlou, sentenced to death by this notorious judge, Abolqasem Salavati nicknamed the Judge of Death. On Sunday night, a crowd gathered outside the prison where Ghobadlou and Boroughani are being held after activists reported their execution was imminent. Scenes of sheer bravery as the crown chant against the regime and support Ghobadlou's mother, wasting it all to try and save her son. Activists are urging the international community to do more than just condemn these executions, to try and save the defenseless on death row. To save their families from this unimaginable pain.

You know, I think the words of the Hamline president are more than a little unfortunate because it pits it as an issue of freedom of speech versus the sensitivities of Muslim students. The fact of the matter is that these kinds of images have been an important part of the Islamic tradition.They are a sacred icon tradition, if you want to use that word. And they have existed in both the Sunni and the Shia tradition going back almost a thousand years. So I think there's a big difference between the kind offensive images like the ones that we saw in Charlie Hebdo and iconic devotional works of art which have been produced by Muslim artists for consumption of Muslims, with the specific goal of drawing the audience closer to the Prophet and closer to God.",

It's also to expand our horizons. Many of the students probably had never been aware of the fact that these images exist. They have existed. If they would get an opportunity to go to the Met, they would see that the Metropolitan Museum of Art has 13 of these images. Two of them are on permanent display. So does the Smithsonian, so does the British Library and museums in Turkey and Iran and elsewhere. So that's an opportunity to expand their horizon. It doesn't mean that they have to agree with it, but it does mean that they deserve the opportunity to be challenged, to have a reasoned to discussion about the role that these kinds of images have played historically and to make up their own mind in that context.",

In general, I tend to be interested in how is it that some practices and some interpretations, which used to be quite commonplace, come to be marginalized later on. And we find that sometimes to be the case with mystical, with spiritual, with aesthetically powerful presentations of Islam, which used to be absolutely mainstream.And this was true in the Sunni and the Shia tradition. For example, many of the kinds of images that we tend to show in art history courses, in some religion courses, they tended to come from the Ottoman empire, which was a seat of the Sunni caliphate. This is about as central to the center of authority and power as it gets in Islam. It really is in the last 150 years or so, where interpretations that we could call Salafi or Wahhabi tend to rise in prominence and they want to erase what has come before. Those of us who are educators, I think what we try to do is to point out why is it that these images have been produced? And they usually point out two services. One, they depict the scene of the Prophet Muhammad's ascension to see God face to face, the mirage, that's the pivotal spiritual experience of Islam. And then, secondly, they show Muhammad in the company of other prophets, which points out to the universality of the Islamic tradition. I hope that as all of these discussions go on, that we get a chance to go back to those two fundamental points of what is it that this iconic tradition was designed to do. To point out the way to see God face to face, and the universalism, which has always been a hallmark of the Islamic tradition.",

They're saying that it's fewer than a dozen documents that were turned over to the National Archives.
