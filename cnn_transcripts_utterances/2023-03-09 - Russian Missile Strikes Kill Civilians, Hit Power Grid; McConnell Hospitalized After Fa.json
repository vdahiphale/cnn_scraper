It is the largest scale bombardment we have seen in nearly a month.The Russians struck several major cities, including the capital, Kyiv, far away from the front lines. Ukrainian officials say a Russian missile obliterated these homes and killed at least five people in the Western city of Lviv, which is right on NATO's doorstep. This is a photo of Russian missiles rising up into the sky in the predawn hours. Ukraine's military says Russia launched more than 80 missiles in all. And Europe's largest nuclear power plant in Zaporizhzhia has been completely disconnected now from Ukraine's power grid because of that Russian shelling. That's according to the energy company that runs it. So we do begin with our Ivan Watson. He is live on the ground in Kyiv. Just a barrage overnight and so far West. What can you tell us?",

Well, you know, as Ivan mentioned in his report, it really struck all across Ukraine. You can see from the West in Lviv all the way to the Northeast in Kharkiv and then down South in Odessa, plus, of course, the capital in Kyiv. All of these areas are critical to Ukraine from an economic standpoint. Many of them do not have military installations. But the very fact that they're being hit indicates that the Russian strategy is one in which they're going after all the different civilian infrastructure installations that they can hit. You know, the key fact, of course, they're going after power. Not very effective, as Ivan mentioned, you know, in the aggregate, but it's still, at the very least, an inconvenience and, of course, can be a fatal inconvenience when these missiles strike in apartment areas and in other inhabited areas.",

You also have Senator John Fetterman, the Pennsylvania Democrat, who is receiving treatment for clinical depression at Walter Reed right now. So, you know, there's just a lot of questions.

But this does have a significant impact, potentially, on how things work in Washington for any senator, but especially one as powerful in his caucus as Mitch McConnell. ERROL LOUIS, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: For sure. We should keep in mind that it is still a closely-divided Senate. We had the vice president come in and break some ties on judicial nominations of no particular moment. That's how closely we still have to keep in mind. Fifty-one/forty-nine is nothing to sneeze at. And all it takes is one or two to be incapacitated or not in the chamber, and all of a sudden, a lot of things can change. But I think your larger point, though, the interesting thing about McConnell is that we don't know where the Senate would go without him. He's, you know, he's the longest-serving Republican leader in history. And where they might go. You look at somebody like senator Rick Scott, who made an abortive challenge to maybe take the leadership away.

Obviously, that stands out to us. And then you can see, it discriminates against people with disabilities. And as you talk to people in the black community, they say for a long time, when they had issues with this police department in particular, they had no one to go to, as they were complaining to city hall and community leaders about changing things within the police force.

But it is the entire country.In 2020, it was in front of us. We had three very high-profile case that's we can remember at this point. We had Breonna Taylor. We had Ahmaud Arbery and we had George Floyd, all in our faces and right in the middle of COVID. And I remember writing about this, and what stuck out to me is, as I spoke to experts and talked about the history of policing in this country and the patience that people of color have had with people saying go slow. And one expert that I wrote in my book says from the beginning, police as we know it has not been about maintaining public safety but about maintaining public order. And with that comes militarized police departments and police officers who feel, as you see in Memphis with these units, as you saw in Louisville, that basically, they can do anything, especially to people who have no power.",

And, you know, one fact that always bowls me over, in the 1994 crime bill, going all the way back to 1994, there's a provision that says we must get an annual report through the Justice Department from local departments about how many people have been killed by the police. It's never been enforced.So, you know, year after year after year, since 1994, even now, it's, you know, it's \"The Washington Post,\" or it's \"The Guardian,\" it's media organizations, it's activists who are out there piecing together bits of local news that they pick up by scanning Google or something to try and figure out just where we are right now. The fact that the -- the country hasn't really sort of figured out how to be serious about this in an institutionalized, sustained way. It's OK to go out and protest. It's OK to sort of make some changes. Name a black police chief is another big strategy if you look city by city. You see, gee, there seem to be a lot of black police chiefs out there.
