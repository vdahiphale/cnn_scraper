And he is trying to establish himself tonight as the Democratic candidate who is most likely to be able to rack up a victory in November of 2024. He does not want to be Dianne Feinstein in the democratic primary. He does not want to be beaten by someone who is much more vulnerable in a general election scenario. He harped on traditional democratic themes. He harped on abortion, he harped on race, he harped on entitlements, subjects that will get Democrats to rally the troops, but not put him in a category that makes him (INAUDIBLE) to a general election audience. That's his play for political survival in the next couple of years, to make himself the one who is most likely to keep the presidency and the democratic column.

It's important to point out that 62% of Americans do not think that he has accomplished much in the past two years.Meanwhile, empirically, setting partisanship aside, this man has actually gotten some major legislation through the Infrastructure Act, CHIPS, COVID-19 bailout, and the Inflation Reduction Act. I mean, these are major pieces of legislation, and he's not getting credit for it. Fine, he hasn't done a good job of communicating that. But I also think there's another component here which is that the aggregate economic indicators, the big economic indicators, you know, adding 500 jobs a month, having the lowest unemployment rate in 50 years, is not necessarily translating to everyday Americans in the sense that there are still high prices at the gas pump. It's coming down, but high food prices, eggs, et cetera. So, while some sectors are thriving, there are working class Americans who are still hurting and that message that Joe Biden is sending about the economy is not something they are feeling in their everyday lives.",

That is the reason why Republicans took control of the House of Representatives. People are very upset about inflation. They are very upset about the state of the economy. And for him to just say, everything is okay, you just don't understand, isn't the sales pitch that the Democrats need to win the issue over. There needs to be serious improvements.

And the big fight ahead will likely be over the lifting of the debt ceiling.And when Mr. Biden and Kevin McCarthy met last week on the issue, they both seemed to think that they could find common ground.

It's being weaponized now by the Republicans.But at the end of the day, the consequences are such that it could cause not just a global recession, but a global depression if the U.S. defaults on its debt. We have until June to figure this out. And so, it's really a matter of what Kevin McCarthy is willing to or what he can get from the more extreme members of his party. And it's not simply on him. I, of course, have faith that it will happen. He is using budget cuts that he wants to put forth, more extreme members of his party want to put forth, to put pressure on Biden. But at the end of the day, this is definitely what we incurred under Democratic and Republican presidents.

He's also expected to go and visit Ukrainian troops doing training here in the U.K.Of course, we've heard from the British Defense Secretary Ben Wallace over the past week or so saying that the Ukrainian troops that are doing training here in the U.K. on the U.K. Challenger 2 tank. The U.K. of course. the first to give tanks, offer tanks to Ukraine, modern main battlefield tanks. Ben Wallace has said that those Ukrainian troops are really doing well in the training. So, President Zelenskyy will be, we understand, visiting them. So, I think in the speech to parliament, not getting ahead of myself here, but the U.K. has been one of the countries that has received a lot of praise. Prime Minister Boris Johnson received a lot of praise, or former Prime Minister Boris Johnson received a lot of praise from President Zelenskyy. So, I think the speech to parliament today we could expect to hear gratitude from the Ukrainian president. But obviously, whenever he speaks, he does like to talk about what else he wants. He wants jet fighters for Ukraine forces. We understand at the moment that the British may expand their current training program for Ukrainian forces, to include training for jet fighter pilots. There is no commitment for the U.K. or any other nation yet to give Ukraine modern fighter jets. But the British are -- will be, we understand, offering that training to the Ukrainian forces so that their fighter jet pilots can in the future fly modern NATO fighter jet aircraft. Now, of course, this is not the whole of what President Zelenskyy would want, but this is certainly a step in the direction. As we've seen before, Britain leads the way on tanks. So, is this opening the door for other partners of Ukraine to step up and step in the direction of fighter jet support for Ukraine? But this is a very big moment for President Zelenskyy. He's only stepped out of the country once since (inaudible), since the war began almost a year ago, and that was a very quick visit to the United States. Here he is arriving in the U.K. today. We know that he has an open invitation from the European Union who are having a key meeting tomorrow, Thursday, in Brussels, but today, his visit here in the U.K. speaking with the prime minister, speaking to parliament, visiting Ukrainian troops who are in training here.",

Most Americans say they're dissatisfied with the economy and over 60 percent in that Washington Post/ABC poll this week says they do not believe he has accomplished much or anything. I thought tonight he did a very effective job of blending conciliation with confrontation. You know, Obama in 2011 and Clinton in '95, in those first speeches after those bad midterm elections, really went out of their way to kind of reach out to Republicans and to signal to voters that they were going to make a course correction. Joe Biden didn't have nearly as bad a midterm as they did and he didn't -- he clearly didn't feel nearly as much pressure to suggest that he was going to find a different direction. I thought he was very confident in starting by where he would work with Republicans. But as you know, as the speech went on, he put more and more emphasis on what he would not give up or concede to them. Cuts in social security and Medicare, a nationwide ban on abortion, an increase in the debt ceiling that requires other spending cuts.

Reagan ultimately won 60 percent of the vote in 49 states.Biden's overall approval and the sense that he has accomplished things is probably not going to be affected enormously by the selling job that they go out and do in the coming weeks. It's really going to be affected by continued improvement in inflation, a sense of voters that they are lifting their heads above water. But Rosemary, what I think he did tonight was begin to frame the contrasts that could be effective for him if that predicate is reached. I mean, when voters are dissatisfied about the economy, it's always a headwind to the incumbent president. But if that dissatisfaction begins to fade (ph), and even if it doesn't, the ability to draw contrast with Republicans are going to be critical to his fate.",

He mentioned, and you have to pay attention to the words that are being used. Every time he talks about reform, he said that he's going to ban federal officers from doing certain things. But understand this. Federal officers did not murder Tyre Nichols. Federal officers did not sit on the neck of George Floyd, did not choke Eric Garner, did not shoot Breonna Taylor.And so, all of what he might propose would stop nothing from happening on the local level. Police officers need to be deactivated in terms of certification on a local level like we do here in California, SB2, Police Deactivation Act of 2021, to get these officers off your police department and prevent them from moving over to another. That would be a great start sinc they won't end qualified immunity.",

They should be, those officers, very concerned about a sergeant like me rolling up on a stop like they did with Mr. Nichols.
