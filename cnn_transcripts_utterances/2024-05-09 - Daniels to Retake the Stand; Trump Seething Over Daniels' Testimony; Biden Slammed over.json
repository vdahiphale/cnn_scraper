This is after she told the world, and the jury more importantly, a lot about the alleged sexual encounter with Donald Trump. Sources tells CNN this morning Trump's lawyers still have awhile to go, is how it's being described, when it comes to questioning the cross-examination of Stormy Daniels. The defense planning to add new questions to their cross now. CNN's Brynn Gingras is outside the court for us once again. Brynn, what are you learning about what the - what the defense team is planning now, what's - and what changes?",

And we were told from sources that the defense really didn't have much more questioning to do.However, after the prosecution has asked its questions and basically, according to the defense, Stormy Daniels alleged that the relationship between Donald Trump and - or sort of insinuated, I should say, that the relationship between Donald Trump and Stormy Daniels was not exactly consensual, apparently the defense didn't like that and so now they're going to fire a lot more questions at her. So, that's why we're learning from sources they now say they have a while to go in there cross-examination with Stormy Daniels. Of course, in that 90 minutes that they've covered so far, they really attacked her credibility. They questioned her motives with coming forward with her story. And they really were hammering home questions one after another with her. So, it's going to certainly be another eventful day in court with Stormy Daniels on the stand. Again, we don't know how much longer they're going to take, but after that we will see prosecution most likely have a redirect of Stormy Daniels as well. So, it's possible the whole day will be filled with Stormy Daniels. And then, of course, Kate, we don't know who's up next after that.",

Apparently they tried to take a picture of Donald Trump as they were getting to that well. So, in the aisle of the courtroom. And the judge did not like that. Apparently Judge Merchan is saying there will no longer be pictures taken of Donald Trump now inside the courtroom.So, that means we won't see that photo. All we will be able to have from inside are court sketches. Now, the video that you were just showing of outside of that courtroom, that is still going to be allowed, and that is fine. But it appears, for now, there will be no more photos inside the courtroom, so we won't get those every morning as we have been doing for this course.

Remember, this is the gag order that bars Donald Trump from talking about witnesses, the jurors, family members of the judge and prosecutors. And he violated it according to Judge Merchan ten times. They had said that this was unconstitutional. They asked earlier that the appeals court in New York stop this trial until they made a ruling on that - basically on their - on their argument there. That ruling has not been made. So, essentially, they just now filed a new filing that is asking thecourt to hurry up with the process, hurry up with a decision on whether or not they believe this gag order is unconstitutional. So, that's what the filing was made in the court of appeals in New York yesterday. So, we're still waiting to see where that lands.",

      "sentences": "Well, it hasn't really changed, Sara. Donald Trump is still angry. And I think you can anticipate similar activity from him in the courtroom at least regarding this.Look, this is very uncomfortable for the former president. And, you know, from what I cover, the politics of this, this is something really that his campaign and his team and Donald Trump do not know how this is going to play out in a general election. And this is really one of the key testimonies that they were worried about, about hearing from Stormy Daniels. And, remember, she is a woman who has alleged that she had an affair with Donald Trump. These are very salacious details that she is describing on the stand. Details that they do not want playing out in the public. And yet that is what we're seeing. And so when I talk to Donald Trump's team behind the scenes, they're kind of telling me the same thing that you're hearing his attorney say in court, which is that they think that she's making this up. That they think that they really want to try and undermine her credibility with this second day of cross examination. I think you'll see that play out in court today. But, from my conversations, again, this is embarrassing for Donald Trump. And that's really this entire trial. You know, unlike some of the other criminal indictments he's facing, I've consistently been told by his team that they actually think this case is the weakest of the criminal indictments. However, it's also the most personally embarrassing for Donald Trump. And this testimony from Stormy Daniels is really kind of the pinnacle of that. Her sharing these details, things that Donald Trump does not want out there. That's why you're seeing him scowl in the courtroom, shake his head, talk to attorneys. And one other thing that I found really interesting, and, of course, this is according to our great reporters who have been inside the courtroom bringing us these details, is that, you know, Donald Trump has been, at times, not as engaged in other testimony. He's closed his eyes as he's listened to other people on the stand. He has been very engaged when Stormy Daniels has been testifying. He's been paying very much attention. And as you mentioned, again, leaning over to talk to his reporters (ph), cursing at times, shaking his head at times, being admonished from Judge Merchan. So, I think that really just speaks to how important this is and how really damaging this could be for his public image.",

He will be inside the courtroom.And this is really interesting. This is actually the first member of Congress that we've seen appear with Donald Trump, who will be inside with him today. But, look, from my conversations with a lot of Trump's allies, and the Trump campaign, they tell me that many people, like Senator Rick Scott, have offered to appear with Donald Trump, kind of show that they support him, stand in solidarity with him. We know that we saw Eric Trump, one of his sons, appear with him. Last week we know that David McIntosh, the president of Club for Growth, a conservative fiscal organization, also attended court one day. So, we're seeing his allies want to come and appear with Donald Trump and show solidarity. And so that's kind of what we're seeing play out this morning. It will be interesting to see if more people try to do this, to come to New York, travel with the former president, stand with them and really, again, just saying, I'm with Donald Trump. I'm going to stand in the courtroom. I'm going to show that we support him. And we know - I mean we've seen a lot of his other allies, you know, repeatedly, even though Donald Trump has this gag order, his allies don't. We've seen them kind of attack people that Donald Trump can't attack. And I think we'll see some of that from Rick Scott today. Sara.",
