(ph), a fictional 13-year- old Albuquerque girl. And the complaint states that these decoy accounts were served, quote, a stream of egregious sexually explicit images, even when the account never expressed interest in the content. Meta denies these claims and denies that its platforms put children at risk. A spokesperson from Meta tells us, quote, \"we use sophisticated technology, we hire child safety experts, we report content to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children and share information and tools with other companies and law enforcement, including state attorneys general, to help root out predators.\" Meta also says it has removed hundreds of thousands of accounts, groups and devices for violating its child safety policies. But New Mexico's attorney general says Meta has failed to make sufficient changes, arguing, quote, \"Meta's business model of profit over child safety and business practices of misrepresenting the amount of dangerous material and conduct to which its platforms expose children violates New Mexico law.\" And we are joined now by the attorney general of New Mexico, Raul Torrez. Mr. Attorney General, thank you for joining us. I think every parent is certainly listening up right now. RAUL TORREZ (D), NEW MEXICO ATTORNEY GENERAL: Yes.",

It's about, number one, misleading consumers and, number two, how they have designed this - how they have designed those platforms and organized them.

Republicans are calling for tighter immigration laws that would overhaul the way the U.S. handles asylum claims. They also want to rein in presidential authority to allow certain migrants into the country on a temporary basis.Joining us now is Congressman Mike Lawler, a Republican from New York. Sir, on that issue itself, would you be willing to go home for the holidays if an agreement is not reached here? REP. MICHAEL LAWLER (R-NY): Look, obviously, I want to get our work done. The House Republican majority, on a bipartisan basis, passed aid to Israel weeks ago. Chuck Schumer, the Senate majority leader from New York, and the highest ranking Jewish official in America, has done absolutely nothing on it. Frankly, it's disgraceful. You know, he may disagree with the House's position, but then put a position forward and negotiate. With respect to the border, here's the problem. This administration has failed miserably to secure our southern border. You're talking about nearly 10 million migrants crossing over the southern border since Joe Biden took office, many of them illegally. The asylum system is fundamentally broken. These cases are taking two to three years to be heard. And when they are heard, nearly two-thirds of them are rejected.",
