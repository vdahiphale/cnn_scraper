It sounds like he's going to be playing against the Netherlands tomorrow, but we have yet to actually see him of course, Pulisic was the star of their final Group B match against Iran scoring the only goal and that is the reason they're in the knockout stage, but he was injured in that game with a pelvic contusion. He has been described as day to day since but the mood from the camp is that he will be involved against the Netherlands. That is the first knockout game to take place here on Saturday evening in Qatar. And the American team will be so desperately hoping he can be involved. They've only scored two goals in this competition. He's been involved in both of them. He's, of course, a very experienced international player. He's one of the stars in the Premier League. And this is one of the youngest teams in the World Cup so inexperienced at this level, because they didn't qualify for the last World Cup four years ago 25 of the 26 players in this squad have played in a World Cup before. But so far, they've acquitted themselves very, very well. Huge tests next, though, when they're up against the Netherlands, world number eight, one of the top teams in the world.

The man nicknamed Captain America by fans coming through with a signature goal sending Team U.S.A through to the knockout phase. But the 24 year olds game and end goal came with a cost as the star forward was forced to leave the game at halftime with an injury.

SCHOLES (voice over): For years Pulisic has been deemed the great next hope for U.S. Soccer, and it's finally coming to fruition. Pulisic was born in Hershey, Pennsylvania and soccer has always been a part of his life. KELLY PULISIC, CHRISTIAN PULISIC'S MOM: He has really learned to walk with a soccer ball at his foot. SCHOLES (voice over): Both of Pulisic's parents played collegiate soccer at George Mason and Pulisic played in the U.S. developmental program at a young age before starting his professional career with Borussia Dortmund in Germany when he was 16. When he was just 17 Pulisic became the youngest us player to appear in a World Cup qualifying match. But in 2018 Pulisic and Team USA suffered heartbreak failing to qualify for the World Cup.

If you look back at the seven last series of waves of cruise missile attacks, most of these have been, of course, conventional cruise missiles. In other words, armed with pretty substantial warheads up to 400 kilograms, nearly half a metric ton, full of explosive, these are guided missiles, that the Ukrainians do have some capacity to shoot down, but they don't get them all. So in the last wave, the government said that they were up to 100 were fired, more than 70 percent of them they believe was shot down, but that still leaves a number that get through and can do a lot of damage. So by putting up these obsolete or deactivated cruise missiles, it's surprising they don't put a warhead in of any kind. But of course, if you're sending a piece of equipment high into the sky, and then it comes down, it comes down with considerable force. It could destroy a block of flats, it can kill people within buildings and it can cause a lot of damage if there's any residual fuel supplies left on board, but it's really trying to overwhelm the Ukrainian air defenses, Becky, I think that's the first thing to take away from that. The other is an interesting note that they made from that press conference when they put these fragments on displays. They said that the serial numbers had been removed, hinting perhaps that some of these missiles might actually be Ukrainian in origin, because of course, Ukraine gave up its nuclear arsenal in return for defense guarantees that the West was supposed to implement. And of course, the West failed to do just that when Russia seized Crimea. So they're slightly hinting there that maybe these are cruise missiles built for their own nuclear uses that the Russians have taken away and repurposed and fired back at them. And I think the third issue is that this may be some indication that perhaps the Russians are running short on the sorts of essential supplies that they might need for cruise missiles, particularly navigation systems and other high tech items that usually they would have to import before their own manufacturing could catch up with making them Becky.",

Russia's Wagner private military group is facing questions about the death of one of its recruits in Ukraine. The reason while he was from Zambia and his home country is not buying the explanation about how he ended up fighting for the group in the first place, Fred Pleitgen has more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) FREDERIK PLEITGEN, SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice over): Mercenaries for Russia's Wagner private military company are fighting on some of the toughest battlefields in Ukraine. A social media channel affiliated with a group recently posted this video allegedly showing a severely wounded Wagner fighter trying to shoot himself rather than fall into Ukrainian hands. Now the group has acknowledged a man from the Southern African nation of Zambia has been killed fighting on the front lines in Ukraine. This is 23- year-old Lemekhani Nathan Nyirenda, Wagner's Founder Yevgeny Prigozhin known as Putin Chef admits he recruited and you'd end up from a Russian jail and says he died a hero. And I talked to the - region Prigozhin wrote in a statement, why do you need this war after all the chance of dying is quite high? And he answered what I expected. You Russians helped us Africans gain independence for many years. The Wagner Group saves thousands of Africans. And if I go to war with you, this is probably a very small way in which I can pay our debts. Zambian authority saying Nyirenda was studying nuclear engineering in Russia, but was thrown in jail for more than nine years for what his father told Reuters was a drug offense. Despite what Prigozhin said about Nyirenda's alleged gratitude, the Zambian government is demanding answers.",
