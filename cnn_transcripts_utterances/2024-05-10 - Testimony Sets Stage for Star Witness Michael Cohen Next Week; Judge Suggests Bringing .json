They agree there has been a dramatic shift on the issues that served as roadblocks in that first term. The courts now 200 plus federal judges that were nominated by Trump, the Supreme Court, 6 to 3 conservative majority, lawmakers, especially in the Republican Party, very much in line with Trump.

Now, it comes down to the fixer against the former president, how Michael Cohen's testimony could seal Donald Trump's fate as a felon or how his credibility problems could sink the state's case.Also tonight, his sometimes loud, often controversial journey from enforcer to informer to star witness for the prosecution with stops on cable news and federal prison along the way. Plus, a true demonstration of solar power, how severe storms on the sun could wreak havoc here on Earth, even as they bring the northern lights as far south as Alabama. Good evening, everyone. John Berman here in for Anderson and we begin with the hush money trial and the prosecution witness whose testimony Stormy Daniels set the table for. Michael Cohen, who will take the stand on Monday here in New York, he is expected to be, if not the final, then at least the central piece of the prosecution's case against his old boss and client, the former president. Although it is not yet known precisely what he will say, we do know what has not been said so far by prosecution witnesses. Namely, any testimony that Donald Trump directed to the falsification of business records to hide his and Cohen's hush money payout to Stormy Daniels. Other witnesses up until now have established that he was very conscious about how he spent his money, that he signed the checks to Cohen, that they were to reimburse Cohen and then some for paying off Daniels, and that the former president along with Cohen and tabloid publisher David Pecker had arranged a scheme to keep potentially devastating news quiet before the 2016 election. Cohen could provide the rest or not. We just don't know. Here is what he has said already in congressional testimony five years ago. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MICHAEL COHEN, FMR. PERSONAL ATTORNEY FOR DONALD TRUMP: So picture this scene in February of 2017, one month into his presidency. I'm visiting President Trump in the Oval Office for the first time and it's truly awe-inspiring. He's showing me all around and pointing to different paintings and he says to me something to the effect of, don't worry Michael, your January and February reimbursement checks are coming. They were FedExed from New York and it takes a while for that to get through the White House system. As he promised, I received the first check for the reimbursement of $70,000 not long thereafter.

But because Michael Cohen has a criminal history and one of the - his charges is lying under oath, that's problematic. So what the DA's office wants to do is corroborate as much as possible of what they - of what he's saying and so far they've corroborated him 12 ways to Sunday.I mean, they've corroborated every little detail. And when you're a prosecutor and you have a witness who's telling you stuff like, oh, yes, we talked on the phone. Yes, we went and met in his office. Yes, this happened, that happened and then you go get the records and the records back up what they said, that's corroboration and that's what they're showing the jury. That being said, of all the evidence that they put in there's still this piece of the link to Trump that I think is dependent on Michael Cohen and that's the one thing that has not been established yet through corroboration. Now, Michael Cohen, we have no idea how he's going to do on the stand. And if past is prelude, you see how aggressive they were with Stormy Daniels.

It's been authenticated as his saying the sort of how we get from 130 to 420, but that critical conversation where Trump directs it, I think will be only Cohen.

And there's another person too, his bodyguard, Mr. Schiller is another name that the jury has heard about. He was the guy who Stormy Daniels would contact, who was standing outside the hotel room door when they had their little rendezvous.

Just a short time ago, U.S. weather officials officially upgraded an already powerful geomagnetic storm caused by ejections of plasma from the sun, as we all know. Moments ago, it was upgraded to G5 or extreme, that is according to the Space Weather Prediction Center.This is the first G5 storm in more than 20 years. Fears are that it could disrupt power grids and satellites or the technology used by planes, ocean vessels and emergency response agencies all around the world. But it has also produced something else. We have images of the aurora borealis, the northern lights. This is typically something you're more likely to see in like northern Canada, Sweden, Norway. Tonight, these images come to us from as far south as the United Kingdom, Switzerland and Germany, and many Americans, perhaps as far south as Georgia and Alabama, may have the chance to see these beautiful sights tonight. I'm joined now by Meteorologist Chad Myers at the CNN Weather Center in Atlanta, and our Chief Climate Correspondent Bill Weir. First, Chad, to you.

A couple days later, the telegraph or a couple hours later, the telegraph system goes haywire in the United States. Operators are able to unplug the battery and send messages over the air.There was so much electricity. A train station in Albany, New York set on fire when fire -- when the flames lit from the switch there. These big storms, that was probably a G5. I've only hit the Earth like that pre-electrical grid. Now we are all connected by this Rube Goldberg machine of thousands of different utilities hooked together with transmission lines. There's East Coast, there's West Coast. Texas has their own. They did a study that if the 1921 event were to happen today, it would cause a blackout for 130 million people, close to half of all Americans. And the report estimated a cost of a storm between $1 trillion and $2 trillion. What would it take? Four to 10 years to recover from. Because when a big -- one of these big pieces of equipment that sends electricity long distances, these transformer blows, these are sort of bespoke pieces of machinery. It takes months to build a new one. And if hundreds of those go out, it can connect it. And that doesn't even get us into the GPS satellites, which get mucked up when this happens, which connects our banking shipping, military, national security, all affected by all that power.

Crump says Fortson had been home alone just 30 minutes before the deputy arrived. He heard two knocks at the door and when he couldn't see anyone through the peephole, Crump said, citing the girlfriend, then Fortson grabbed his gun which Crump said he legally owned. In the girlfriend's FaceTime video, we hear Fortson struggle to breathe after the shooting as he lies on the floor bleeding out. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Do not move. Stop moving. VALENCIA (voice-over): The deputy is now on paid administrative leave while the Florida Department of Law Enforcement investigates. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
