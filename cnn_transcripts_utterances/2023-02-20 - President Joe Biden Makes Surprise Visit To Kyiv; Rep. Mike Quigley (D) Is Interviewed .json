I don't think he's thinking that right now.MARQUARDT (voice-over):  While Zelenskyy called the moment the most important in the history of the U.S.-Ukraine relationship. VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, PRESIDENT OF UKRAINE (through translation):  This is the visit in this most difficult period for Ukraine when Ukraine is fighting for our own liberty. Today our negotiations were very fruitful. They were very important and crucial. MARQUARDT (voice-over):  Negotiations about continued military aid. Today, President Biden announcing an almost half billion-dollar aid package for Ukraine, including ammunition, Howitzers and air defenses, but big-ticket items that Ukraine wants like longer range missiles and fighter jets still up for discussion. ZELENSKYY (through translation):  This conversation brings us closer to victory. MARQUARDT (voice-over):  This surprise, unprecedented visit on the eve of a bloody anniversary. Extreme secrecy shrouding Biden's journey. No word but there were signs, deserted streets and a heavy police presence suggesting a prominent arrival. President Biden quietly left Washington for Poland just after 4:00 a.m. under the cover of darkness. And after a long train ride across western Ukraine, arrived to warm smiles and laughter from Ukraine's first couple. His feelings left in a handwritten message about solidarity and friendship which was echoed on the streets of Kyiv. ANATOLIY, KYIV RESIDENT (through translation):  It is support for us and the message for the Russians that this issue must be resolved and Ukraine must win. We hope that his visit will speed up the events. (END VIDEOTAPE) MARQUARDT (on camera):  And John, the White House says that they warned the Kremlin that Biden would be on the ground today for what they called deconfliction purposes so that the Russians wouldn't do anything while he was here. Now, that was hotly debated in Moscow today with some hardliners criticizing President Vladimir Putin for allowing Biden to come here to meet with Zelenskyy. We did hear from former Russian president, Dimitri Medvedev, who has become something of a belligerent hardliner. He did acknowledge that they knew Biden was on the ground today. He then went on to accuse NATO of earning money and stealing weapons to sell to terrorists around the world. Now, we have not heard directly from President Putin since Biden's visit. We are expected to hear much more from Putin tomorrow. He is due to give a big speech not long before President Biden does the same thing in Warsaw. John?",

There were a lot of deliberations that went behind this we were told, but in the end, they basically decided the message that they would be sending by having Biden go into Ukraine was worth the risk that he was taking by going into Ukraine.And so, they had this plane that left in the middle of the night in Washington. The blinds were pulled down as he was traveling and flying over. The reporters were only two of them, one photographer, one print reporter on the plane. They had their phones confiscated and taken from them during, basically, the entirety of this trip, obviously to keep it under wraps. President Biden himself only taking a small contingent of aides with him. Typically, as you know, John, he travels with a big footprint, but they tried to keep it incredibly small as they flew to Poland. And then in Poland is where he boarded the train for that 10-hour ride into Ukraine, of course, into Kyiv. You cannot fly into Kyiv. You haven't seen any of the world leaders do that. And so, they took this 10-hour journey in the middle of the night with reporters in different cabins than President Biden as they made a few stops to pick up more security. But that is all what led up to that trip that you have seen. These remarkable images of President Biden and President Zelenskyy meeting. But it is something that the White House said he had wanted to do for some time, but only now did they decide that it was a manageable risk where he could make this visit.",

We've heard comments from German officials supporting it. This comes at a moment where there is a need for unity. There is strong unity in the alliance at the moment, but there are little areas and little ways that it is fraying and it took the United States after all to commit tanks before Germany and many other nations would, and some are still to step up with tanks as well. So, this is important. When the president of the United States does something demonstrably courageous, demonstrably big, that's a message and it's heard and understood here.",

No red lines were drawn, I am told, but those perspectives were consistent with where they have been up to this point, which has been the president repeatedly saying no when asked about fighter jets. Long range missile systems being rebuffed out of concern about what it would mean for as escalatory issues with Russia. One thing I would not though, there has been a great clear evolution over the course of the last 361 days of what the Ukrainians have asked for. The U.S. and its allies have said no, not an option, and then at some points have slowly over the course of time shifted towards yes and then delivery or training. So, that is an evolution that has transpired. That is an evolution that is certainly expected to continue. Whether or not it will continue on fighters and these long-range missile systems, that's still up in the air, John.",

There's no point in that.Also, the consensus seems to be around there is so much else to give Ukraine that's important. You need to coalesce, organize and get that in in a constructive way, and that is the tanks. That is the spare parts for tanks, the mechanics for the tanks, the ammunition for the tanks. And it's proving not to be easy to organize. So, the fighter jets seem to be waiting for another day. Having spoken at the Munich Security Conference to some of the military -- former generals on the scene there, they seem pretty clear that these longer- range missile systems are going to come, and they're absolutely needed for the next phase of the war which is more, if the Ukrainians can pull it off, more a shock and awe style that sends a clear message to the Kremlin.",

And in fact, they displayed them at a military parade just last week. A lot of the attention was focused on Kim Jong-un who was standing there with his 9-year-old daughter who a lot of people believe might be being groomed right now as a possible successor. It seems pretty early in that process, but it is raising speculation about why is Kim so urgently putting his daughter front and center and also ordering so many missiles to be produced and perhaps testing them, even testing them at not a highly lofted trajectory that goes far up.

And that has given them some reason to pause about DeSantis being an alternative to Trump.But we've also heard from people in DeSantis's corner, some people who would be supporters of him who are saying that they are concerned that these actions are flying too close to the sun. And his war on woke is not going to -- might not play out well in a general election in 2024. And some of this concern has come from people who have been pretty big backers of him, including from Ken Griffin. He is a hedge fund owner who has given more than $10 million to DeSantis over the years. Last year, he was very critical of DeSantis for penalizing Disney, saying at one point, quote, \"I don't appreciate Governor DeSantis going after Disney's tax statU.S. It can be portrayed or feel like retaliation. And I believe that the people who serve our nation need to rise above these moments in time in their conduct and behavior.\" Now, Ken Griffin went on to say later in the year that he thinks Governor DeSantis has a, quote, \"tremendous record.\" So, he hasn't necessarily lost a lot of support yet. But we are seeing some Republican governors draw some strong and stark differences with the governor over his handling of business and punishing people. Here's what a couple of them, Governor Sununu and former Governor Larry Hogan had to say about DeSantis. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV.
