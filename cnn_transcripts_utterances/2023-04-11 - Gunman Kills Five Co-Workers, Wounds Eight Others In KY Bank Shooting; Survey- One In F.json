First, the shooter, an employee, live streamed the atrocity on social media using a gun he purchased legally days before the attack. Police have not released the shooter's social media video yet but in it, today say he tells an employee to leave before shooting her in the back. He then aims his AR-15-style rifle on his other co-workers gathered for a staff meeting. The ambush lasting all of just one minute. The shooter then waits for another minute and a half before a shootout with police where he was killed.",

JASON SMITH, CHIEF MEDICAL OFFICER, UNIVERSITY OF LOUISVILLE HEALTH: I'm weary. I've been in Louisville for 15 years, all of it at University Hospital. For 15 years, I've cared for victims of violence and gunshot wounds. And people say I'm tired, but I'll be answered. It's more than tired. I'm weary. There's only so many times you can walk into a room and tell someone they're not coming home tomorrow. And it just breaks your heart when you hear someone screaming Mommy or Daddy. It just becomes too hard day in and day out to be able to do that. Now, my team is fantastic. They're absolute professionals and they're wonderful. But sooner or later, it catches up to everybody.

Bring us up to speed.OMAR JIMENEZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT (on camera): Well, for starters, we do expect body camera video to be released today of what the officers encountered when they first got to the scene. We also learned that this gunman purchased this weapon legally last week at a gun store here in the Louisville area. But we also got more of a sense for the timeline itself that obviously, the shooting lasted for about a minute. But it was nine minutes total where after the shooting happened was when the first 911 calls went out then three minutes after the police arrived, and then about three minutes after that was when the gunman was killed here. But by that point, even in just that short amount of time, five people were killed, eight others were wounded. And the overarching sentiment we've gotten from public officials here. You heard a little bit of it from that hospital official that they're not just tired, they're weary, not just of acute events like this but the everyday events. It was part of why the mayor here is calling for changes to the state laws so that -- and quickly because every day in his mind that that law is not changed, lives are lost. Take a listen.

Omar Jimenez, thank you.Well, the tragic events in Louisville have sent shockwaves throughout the community and the country. Joining us now is Congressman Morgan McGarvey, a Democrat who represents Louisville, Kentucky. Congressman, thank you so much for joining us. We are all grieving with you. And that was quite a powerful press conference specifically referencing what you said. You call Louisville, the biggest small town in America. You recall the friend, Tommy Elliot, who the governor and the mayor was also close with as someone who was lost. And then you called for change. And you really countered those who said not to use this moment as a political one by saying that public safety and lives aren't political. Congressman, it sounds like you were speaking for more people than just yourself. REP. MORGAN MCGARVEY (D-KY): Yes, this is terrible. And you know, I -- you said it about Louisville. We are. This is Louis Village. We are one degree of separation away from everybody. You know, we say this all the time. The joke here is that when you ask when somebody where they went to school, you mean where they go to high school. And so, it's not -- it's not surprising to us Louisvillians how many people each of us knew or how many connections we had to the people who were killed in this tragedy. I went to the vigil of a young man last night, I think I mean, it's like two years younger than I am, Josh Barrick, who leaves behind a wife and two small children. And I had somebody come up to me at the vigil and it just said, when is this going to be enough? When can we do what's necessary to keep us safe? All right. This isn't political. If -- when you go to work and you're worried about coming home, and you send your kids to school and you're worried about them coming home, that type of safety is not political. You know, unfortunately, in our jobs that we have, sometimes our kids get a front-row seat to this. I've got three young children, all of whom are in elementary school or younger. When my wife dropped off our fifth-grade daughter this morning at school, she looked back at my wife and said, hey, Mom, stay safe at work today. Our kids shouldn't have to worry about us. So, don't make this political, but make it about policy. Come together and put those policies first, whether it's universal background checks. Whether it's removing these weapons of war from our streets, whether it's getting the mental health support, whether it's passing some type of extreme protection law that will keep people in crisis from hurting themselves or others, let's come together and make sure that not another family experiences this loss, that not another community is ripped apart at its very fabric by this type of savage and senseless violence.",

It also offers some really important insight into how Americans view gun violence in this country.JOSH CAMPBELL, CNN SECURITY CORRESPONDENT (on camera): That's right. You know, as if we needed further proof, this new study from the Kaiser Family Foundation certainly paints a bleak picture about America's gun violence epidemic. And it's important to note that respondents in the survey weren't asked for their view about gun control. They were asked about how they experienced gun violence themselves. And over half of Americans who were surveyed say that they either personally or knew someone in their family who has been impacted by a gun-related incident. And just to show you some of the top-line results here about the sentiments of the American psyche right now as it relates to guns, they were asked how often do you fear gun violence in this country. 40 percent of respondents said sometimes, ten percent said almost every day -- or excuse me almost every day, and eight percent said every single day. So, you can imagine that you have more than half of the country impacted by gun incidents, and people continuing to think about that. You know that that continues to impact the American mindset. Now, as we look at communities of color, the data here is certainly even more unsettling. I'll show you some of these figures of the respondents. 31 percent of Black adults and 22 percent of Hispanic adults say they have actually witnessed someone being shot. 34 percent of black adults have had a family member killed by gun violence. Guys, that figure is double compared to white respondents. So, certainly troubling figures here, the number of people who are experiencing gun- related issues, and just the fear that we see permeating across the country.",

Specifically on the protests yesterday, the petrol bombs, the Molotov cocktails thrown at the police, and those pipe bombs. We were in that cemetery yesterday when those new IRA members and their political wing were there. They were doing something that we were not allowed to film. They put out umbrellas. They hid themselves away. They stopped all the journalists from filming what they were doing. They set fire to something behind a shed there. The police had surveillance helicopters, surveillance drones overhead. And so, what we understand now today is that the police realized and found out and went there and found these pipe bombs, which of course would be very dangerous. Typically, they used in dairy against the police, so the police are cracking down. President Biden's unlikely to see any of that sort of potential for violence here in Belfast. Big security operation underway here. And we understand now as well as doing the ribbon cutting at a new university campus here in Belfast, he is going to have the opportunity to meet with representatives of all five political parties here.
