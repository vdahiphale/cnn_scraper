That's after primary wins in three more states on Tuesday put both candidates over the top securing enough delegates to win their party's presidential nominations. A projected win in Washington state made it official for Donald Trump.His last remaining Republican challenger Nikki Haley dropped out of the race last week. And President Joe Biden wrap things up with a win in Georgia. He will officially be nominated at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago in August. Poll show voters are concerned about Biden's age and many in his own party disapprove of his handling of the war in Gaza. Meanwhile, Trump is facing 91 felony charges for his alleged efforts to overturn the 2020 election, mishandling classified documents and covering up hush money payments to adult film star Stormy Daniels. More now on President Biden's reelection bid from CNN Senior White House correspondent M.J. Lee. M.J. LEE, CNN SENIOR WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: President Biden saying in a statement Tuesday night that he is honored to have clinched the Democratic Party's nomination for president and echoing some of the language that we saw him use in his State of the Union remarks last week. He said that he believes that the country is in the middle of a comeback. But he also goes on to say in the statement of mid this progress we face a sobering reality, freedom and democracy are at risk here at home in a way they have not been since the Civil War. Donald Trump is running a campaign of resentment, revenge and retribution that threatens the very idea of America. Voters now have a choice to make about the future of this country. Are we going to stand up and defend our democracy or let others tear it down? Now the Biden campaign going into Tuesday fully expected that the President was going to cross that delegates threshold. But the fact that it was the state of Georgia that put the President over the top is basically a cherry on top for this campaign. Of course, President Biden ended up defeating former President Donald Trump in that state back in 2020. And that marked the first time that a Democratic presidential candidate had won that seat in 28 years. And there's no question that the Biden campaign continues to see that state as a battleground state going into November. They would very much like to win that state. It's not a coincidence that the President traveled to Georgia this weekend as he kicked off his post State of the Union tour. Now zooming out, Tuesday night was not only just a symbolically important moment for the campaign, but campaign officials saying that they are hoping that the events of Tuesday night will help some voters who have so far been tuned out of the election, see and realize for the first time that the 2024 election is in fact going to be between Joe Biden and Donald Trump.

So, first of all, looking at the maritime issues at this point, we know that World Central Kitchen does have a barge on its way with open arms, a Spanish NGO that's expected to take around 60 hours from Cyprus to Gaza.And onboard they say they have some 200 tonnes of food, which could be the equivalent of almost half a million meals. Now they are planning to distribute it independently. They say that they have thousands of contractors and locals on the ground who are at this very moment working around the clock to build some kind of a makeshift pier on a Gaza beach. They haven't specified the location, obviously for security reasons. There have been concerns though, of course about distribution as we have seen some devastating incidents happen when it comes to distributing food within Gaza at this point. But they are hoping this is the first of many, they say that it is Spain. It's also the UAE and Cyprus involved in this effort. They've already had other countries, talk to them about how they can get involved in future efforts. So, they're hoping that this will be something going forward. The U.N. says it is highly appreciative of this effort, but it is simply not enough and there does need to be more from these land crossings. Now we also heard from the E.U. policy chief talking to the U.N. Security Council about the lack of land access criticizing Israel for these restrictions. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOSEP BORRELL, E.U.

Meantime, you've got gang and former coup leader saying they either won't recognize that transitional government or they say it won't work because it doesn't represent the will of the Haitian people. They see this as put in place by an outside force. This comes after weeks of anti-government protests and gang violence. A lot of it directed towards Henry. We were in Port au Prince a little more than two weeks ago and you could feel the anger amongst folks who believed that Henry had overstayed his welcome and they wanted him out. At the same time, the country has been dealing with lawlessness and gangs taking more and more control, especially following the assassination of President Jovenel Moise in 2021.

Space One said the flight was interrupted after the launch and is investigating what happened. Boeing officials could be subpoenaed to testify before U.S. investigators in the coming months in a rare public hearing over the door plug blowout on an Alaska Airlines flight back in January. On Tuesday, the airline released new information on the Boeing plane involved, revealing it was scheduled to be taken out of service for maintenance on the night of the incident, but it did not specify why. The National Transportation Safety Board was aware the plane had pressurization issues prior to the door plug incident, but believes those issues were unrelated. But, the issues for Boeing don't stop there. On Monday, one of its planes experienced a sudden mid-air drop on a flight from Australia to New Zealand. Medical officials in Oakland where the plane landed, said about 50 people on the LATAM Airlines flight were treated for injuries. One passengers says the pilot admitted he lost control of the plane when his gages malfunctioned. Some of the passengers on that flight returned to Chile on Tuesday. Here is how one described the incident which is under investigation. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) VERONICA MARTINEZ, LATAM AIRLINES FLIGHT 800 PASSENGER (through translator): There was no turbulence. It was like suddenly everything went off and it went like on its face, like a roller coaster. What struck me the most was a woman who was with a baby, I saw the baby fly. Yes, it was terrible (END VIDEO CLIP)",
