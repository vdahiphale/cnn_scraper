I'm Fredricka Whitfield.And we're following breaking news out of Morocco, where more than 1,000 people were killed after a powerful 6.8 magnitude earthquake after it struck Friday night. Its epicenter located in the High Atlas Mountains, just southwest of Marrakesh. The quake was the strongest to hit the historic tourist area in over a century. And rescuers are now struggling to access the hardest-hit areas after roads, of course, were damaged. One witness said that they're hoping for miracles from the rubble. More than 700 people were injured in the quake and are in critical condition. Intense aftershocks have hit the area. Experts expect the death toll to rise. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MOHAMED TAQAFI, WITNESS: I heard people screaming. Everyone went out of their houses, the street is full of people and women screaming. That's what happened. Even now, people can't go back home because they're still afraid. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

I've been hiking up there and you have very steep mountains, remote communities, villages, and towns scattered in the mountains.And the Moroccans, it appears simply don't have the man power and equipment to deal with all of these different locations where we're seeing so much damage. In fact, some eyewitnesses are telling us that in their towns where there has been damage and death, the rescue workers have not actually gone there, because they're focusing their efforts on the worst hit areas. Now what we've seen throughout the day, and actually, the earthquake took place at 11:13 p.m. on Friday, and there have been more than a dozen aftershocks. So lots of people are staying outside, sleeping outside. That includes tourists as well, who have been sleeping in the streets. But what we've seen is that the death toll has been rising steadily, throughout the day, as the rescue effort gathers pace. The last number we heard was 1,037 dead, more than 1,200 wounded, 721 of whom were in critical condition. Now, what we're seeing is an outpouring of efforts and offers to help from a variety of places. The French have mobilized for instance firefighters to help with the rescue effort. Turkey is mobilizing more than 260 people, a thousand tents ready to go. The Israelis have also assembled emergency medical teams to go to the worst affected areas. And in these affected areas, for instance, in many of them, there's no running water, there's no electricity. The medical facilities are overwhelmed. For instance, the main hospital in Marrakesh, they have had to put beds out in the streets because they simply don't have the room to treat all of the injured people. And as I said, the number of injured and dead is expected to rise steadily, as the rescue effort moves forward, Fredricka. WHITFIELD: Yes, it is an incredible situation there. And then Ben, is there a way you said kind of describe for people the Marrakesh region, the area from the locations where tourists love to flock to those more remote mountainous areas?",

And that's going to make the situation difficult. And it is simply, you know, the area is so mountainous, and there's little villages dotted around up in the hills, very hard to reach. So they're going to really need all of the help they can get, the Moroccans that is, from outside to try to get to these people who are most badly affected in these very mountainous areas, Fredricka.",

But as you say there is already that very clear ask for blood which is very common in these early stages. I think it is important to recognize that it is roads, transportation, it is health care, it's communication, everything is impacted by a disaster of this nature specifically by an earthquake. So everything is complicated and it is a very complex response that will be required. People will be living outside for the foreseeable future. And not only is it very hot during the day and they will need some shelter but certainly in those mountainous areas that have also been hit where the epicenter was, it will experience very cold temperatures at night. So we need basic shelter to really protect people from the elements.

Today, world leaders agreed on a joint statement laying out their views on a range of issues including climate change, economic development, and the war in Ukraine. Earlier President Biden met one-on-one with Indian Prime Minister Modi as he seeks to embrace India as one of the most critical partnerships for the U.S. and a key regional ally to counter China. Noticeably absent from the summit are Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping. This is the first G20 summit that Xi has chosen not to attend since he took power. Let's bring in now CNN's Kevin Liptak live for us in New Delhi. So Kevin, today's declaration, you know, came as a surprise to many. Bring us up to speed on everything that has happened thus far.",

Diplomats really furiously trying to come up with some kind of consensus language when it comes to describing the war in Ukraine.And so when Prime Minister Modi came out and announced that they had agreed to a statement, many people were sort of surprised that they were able to, and were able to do it a day before the summit ended. Now, as you mentioned, this statement, the description of the conflict in Ukraine was pretty mild, and it didn't actually name Russia, it didn't condemn Russia explicitly for the invasion, instead it talked sort of in broad terms about the need to protect territorial integrity, sovereignty, and the necessity of not using nuclear weapons. So certainly the divide is still very much on display in that statement. And certainly, the absence at this summit of the Chinese President Xi Jinping and the Russian President Vladimir Putin only underscores that this is a fractured moment for this alliance. And in a lot of ways shall President Biden was hoping to use the absences as an opening for his pitch to poorer nations, to the developing world, and you saw that in the package of announcements that he made today here in New Delhi including bolstering the World Bank, hoping to use that institution as a more attractive lender to the developing world than China. And also this major announcement about a train -- a shipping corridor from the Asia to the Middle East to Europe. Really an important announcement that President Biden is using to help to tell the world that the U.S. remains a reliable partner for them going forward, Fredricka.",

And I think that the absence of these two leaders, Russia and China, suggests the kind of polarization, the polarization in American domestic politics, and at the global level, I think, you know, Biden himself has sometimes framed this moment in the world as an inflection point, as a conflict between democracies and autocracies.That makes it harder and harder to have institutions in which the adversaries can come together. You see that in the relative ineffectiveness and fecklessness of the United Nations where the security council is essentially permanently gridlocked between Russia and China and the United States. The G20 as well. And so I think that, you know, it really suggests either a future in which this will become much more common in which major world leaders cannot even come together to sit in the same room and speak with each other about mutual global problems. I worry this is a harbinger of where the world is going. And a harboring of where the world is going, and the decline of these institutions from a different and less threatening global security order.",

That has been a common aspect of American presidents' diplomacy for a long time.In Biden's case, I think it is very striking as well, because what I hear when go internationally and I am sure the president is hearing this as well, is enormous concern, especially for many U.S. allies, about the imminent -- the potential prospect of Donald Trump winning re-election again. You know, Trump was the first American president ever really to consistently have riffs and to downgrade America's allies at the expense of America's adversaries. And he -- you know, as you know, has not just spoken admiringly of Vladimir Putin, he called Xi Jinping a great guy -- sorry a strong leader that he got along famously with.

And it raises questions about why this is happening.And the obvious question is, are they cooperating? Which is a pretty dangerous proposition because Epshteyn is still working closely with former president Trump, having if you will, sort of a mole in the camp of the defendant is dangerous stuff. So it is hard to know, but when I read this, that was the first thing that struck me, Fredricka, was why are these two not indicted?",

And the judge meticulously went through all of the things that Meadows did, and said in the totality of the circumstances, what Meadows did was to act on behalf of the Trump presidential campaign, not on behalf of the Trump presidency, and then he made his decision.

Authorities telling CNN that he was sighted twice within the search area on Friday, evading almost 400 law enforcement officers, canine units, and helicopters. Cavalcante has been spotted at least eight times overall since he escaped. The 34-year-old is serving a life sentence for stabbing his girlfriend 38 times in front of her children. He is also wanted in his native Brazil for another murder that took place in 2017. Authorities are offering a $20,000 reward for information leading to his capture. A police officer in Philadelphia is facing murder charges after a deadly shooting during a traffic stop. Officer Mark Dial was arraigned on Friday, but did not enter a plea. All this happening after the Philadelphia D.A. released body camera footage of the moment when Eddie Irizarry was shot and killed. And that video forcing police to now change their original account of the incident. I want to warn you, some of the video that you're about to see is disturbing. Here now is CNN's Omar Jimenez.

They saw a car driving erratically, going up the wrong way on a one-way street. I've investigated a lot of police uses of force, including officer-involved shootings, and you literally have to look at the entire picture of what led up to the event, the event itself, and so forth.At the time, the officers don't know what they have, quite frankly. They get out of their car, the one officer who I believe was the driver, peers through the passenger window and yells to the other officer that he had a knife. Now, whether that officer heard knife, heard weapon, heard gun, I have no idea. He went around to the driver's side, I don't know if he saw something, thought he saw something, but the bottom line is, he opened fire on the individual. Now, you know, the windows are rolled up, the door is closed, if there is a knife, there is no immediate threat to the officer. So based on that alone, this shooting would not have been justified. Had he believed the individual had a gun, obviously, then a gun could fire through a window and you could be in danger. It's going to be interesting, as this begins to unfold in court, exactly what was on that officer's mind at the time of the shooting. But from what I've seen, if I was, YOU KNOW, making a judgment on this particular incident, the use of deadly force in my opinion was not justified in this case.",

So that part of it, by itself, I don't find to be all that unusual. But what I am concerned about, again, is the fact that this individual was armed with a knife, he was not outside the car, despite what was said earlier. He was inside the car, with the windows rolled up. That would have given officers enough time to de-escalate, to actually, you know, coax him out of the car, or do whatever, short of using deadly force. So again, it is going to boil down to what the officer thought he saw at that particular point in time, and we certainly can't read his mind.

But then to try to justify it knowing that it really was not a justifiable shooting in my opinion is a problem in and of itself. But the department when they first made a statement to the press about the shooting, made the statement that he was out of the car and that he lunged at the officers. Now, I have no idea where that came from, but obviously the individual from Public Information Office did not look at the video, because clearly that is not supported by the video. And so to make a statement like that again, when you make those kinds of errors, it erodes trust, because people say, oh, they're trying to cover it up, you know. And it could be just a simple mistake. I don't think anybody's dumb enough to make that statement knowing that the video shows somethings that's just the opposite.
