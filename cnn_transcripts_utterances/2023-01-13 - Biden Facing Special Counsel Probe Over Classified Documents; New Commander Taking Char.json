Another document was found Thursday. On Monday, Biden's legal team confirmed they recovered sensitive government material from an office at a Washington think tank, which Biden used before being elected president. At the same time, there are new questions over what appears to be a less-than-transparent accounting by the Biden team of when and where all these documents were found. That will now be part of the investigation by Robert Hur, a former U.S. attorney appointed by then- President Donald Trump, who is promising his investigation will be fair, impartial, with dispassionate judgment. The Biden team has promised to continue to cooperate but also insists the small number of documents were inadvertently misplaced. It was all just a mistake. When questioned by reporters, President Biden insisted the documents, when found, we're in a secure location. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SCOTT MCLEAN, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): A major shake-up in the highest ranks of the Russian military. General Valery Gerasimov is the experienced commander Putin has now put in charge of the so-called special military operation. His predecessor was shuffled out barely three months in, following setbacks on the battlefield. But the Kremlin says it is making progress in the small but strategic town of Soledar, where both sides say the fighting has become intense. \"The situation is difficult but stable,\" this Ukrainian soldier says. \"We are holding back the enemy. Nobody leaves the positions. The positions are being held. We are fighting back.\" The Wagner mercenary group claimed to have taken full control of the area, with Russian forces blockading the city's Southern and Northern access routes. Kyiv denies the town has been captured, despite some indications it's lost considerable ground. HANNA MALIAR, UKRAINIAN DEPUTY DEFENSE MINISTER (through translator) The enemy has high losses. The area outside the city is covered with the bodies of Putin's troops. Nevertheless, they're moving over their own corpses. MCLEAN (voice-over): New satellite images reveal the devastation in Soledar, craters scarring the landscape, buildings reduced to rubble. Local officials say hundreds of civilians are still there, most of them elderly. PAVLO KYRYLENKO, HEAD, PRO-RUSSIAN DONETSK MILITARY ADMINISTRATION (through translator): As of now, there are 523 people there. It would be wrong to say that they don't want to leave now. We are doing our best to help people to leave. MCLEAN (voice-over): For the Russians, victory here would be a morale boost for a stalled campaign. The Kremlin spokesman hailed the enormous effort in Soledar but says the main work is still ahead. It will only get tougher. For the first time since the war began, Ukraine will soon have tanks, after Poland agreed to send the German- made Leopards. Germany and the U.K. are mulling the same decision.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ISA SOARES, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): They came in their hundreds. On alert and with weapons at the ready. A show of force to protect democracy. And head off expected pro-Bolsonaro protesters. For the police, this was about protecting control and order after growing accusations they colluded with rioters on January the 8th. Video shared on social media showed security forces talking to protesters, some even standing idle as rioters stormed the three branches of power. Former policeman Cassio believes some of the criticism is unwarranted. CASSIO THYONE, FORMER POLICE OFFICER AND LAW ENFORCEMENT RESEARCHER (through translator): Some policeman ended up not acting, because they didn't think there was a risk of invasion. Also, we've had a big ideological influence inside the security forces, right-wing influence. I don't think it was incompetence. SOARES (voice-over): For the last four years, Brazilian forces have taken orders from former President Jair Bolsonaro. But several sources here tell me what remains are accusations of a politicized police force. THYONE (through translator): We have research results that show that between 50 and 60 percent of policemen were Bolsonarismo sympathizers. But that doesn't mean they are against democracy.

RICARDO CAPELLI, INTERIM HEAD OF SECURITY FOR BRASILIA FEDERAL DISTRICT (through translator): Police officers have every right to make their political choice. That doesn't interest me. What is important is the respect for the constitution. SOARES (voice-over): Respect that Capelli says most have, even as investigations begin into the role some may have played. Still, he believes they were set up to fail. CAPELLI (through translator): What happened on the eighth and today's operation clearly demonstrates that was the absence of command. The previous head of security was traveling. SOARES (voice-over): The man he's referring to is Anderson Torres. Until December 31st, Torres was Bolsonaro's justice minister. After leaving office, he became head of security for Brasilia on January the 2nd. CAPELLI (through translator): He changes the core of the leadership, travels, and leaves the office without command, allowing the unacceptable actions of the eighth. SOARES (voice-over): Torres denies wrongdoing and says on Twitter that he's always based his actions on ethics and legality. Despite that comment, authorities have issued a warrant for his arrest. His involvement and ties to Bolsonaro, too much of a coincidence, Capelli tells me. CAPELLI (through translator): He was justice minister to Jair Bolsonaro. That's a confidence role and one of the highest importance. We would not be justice minister if he did not have president Bolsonaro's complete confidence.
