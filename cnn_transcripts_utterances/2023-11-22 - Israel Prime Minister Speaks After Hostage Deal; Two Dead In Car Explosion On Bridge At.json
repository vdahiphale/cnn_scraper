Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu just spoke after a major hostage deal was finalized between Israel and Hamas.We're also following a developing story out of New York State. Two are dead and the FBI is on the scene after a vehicle exploded at the U.S.- Canada border crossing near Niagara Falls. Sources say a car carrying two male occupants exploded on its way to a secondary search location at the checkpoint at the Rainbow Bridge. We know President Biden is receiving updates, and the White House is in touch with senior Canadian officials. We'll, of course, to bring you the very latest from Upstate New York. But first, we want to listen to Prime Minister Netanyahu. He's speaking for the first time since the deal was announced. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, ISRAEL PRIME MINISTER (through interpreter): At the beginning of the war, I cannot stop thinking about them and about you, the members of the family. I met you. I heard from you what's going on with you, what you're going through about your nightmare, the uncertainty not knowing and the worry that has no limits. When I meet with you, you (inaudible) your love ones (inaudible) and me and my friends will look at every (inaudible) this photos are (inaudible) to bring them home, everyone. And when I say everyone, I mean everyone, including (inaudible) to bring back the (inaudible) Gaza will not (inaudible) we will act to create the (inaudible) the first effort is massive military pressure.

      "sentences": "All right. So there you hear the Prime Minister of Israel, Benjamin Netanyahu, making his point, his major point, that he's not going to rest until all the Israeli hostages have been returned safe and sound back to Israel. He's also insisting that the war, the effort to try to destroy Hamas in Gaza, will continue.All this happening just hours before this exchange is about to unfold, the first of several Israeli hostages, we're told, are about to be released. We'll watch that very closely, see how Israel is going to deal with that, how these hostages will be coming back to Israel and all of that. That's supposed to happen in the coming hours. But, Boris, we're also watching this major story coming out of Niagara Falls, New York. This incident that has occurred aboard the - on top of the Rainbow Bridge, separating the United States and Canada. I know you're getting more information. You're watching these breaking developments as well.",

      "sentences": "Well, they're trying to determine what it all means. When you look at the car in the footage, you see it passing all the other cars at the high rate of speed. You see it engages with the curb and then goes flying over a barrier, crosses to the other side of the highway, and then upon impact, literally disintegrates while exploding in a ball of flames and black smoke.So this is the high energy impact of a car traveling at a high rate of speed that then is airborne and flying at a high rate of speed with great force, which then impacts on the ground. That is the kind of thing that you don't really need an explosive device to get a spontaneous combustion on a high energy impact with a full tank of gas. It also explains, Boris, a lot of the early confusion. And that's why we always say in this reporting the information is preliminary because the first story usually does change. They believed it was coming from the Canadian side towards the United States because it ended up on the other side of the road in the secondary search area, which would have been the direction you'd be going when you were headed to the United States. It wasn't clear until they saw the video. It had actually started on a local road in Niagara Falls where it jumped the divider. So it's not even clear that the car intended to leave the country. And that brings up the possibilities. Do we have an incident of a driver under the influence? Is it a driver with a medical issue? Is it a driver who decided to commit suicide? Is it a driver who simply had an unintended acceleration and lost control of the car? Those are all going to be questions. And the FBI's Joint Terrorism Task Force, the ATF, Customs and Border Patrol, the Canadian authorities, they are all at the scene trying to literally put the pieces back together in terms of this vehicle where it impacted. But try and identify who is the operator of the vehicle, who is the person who is with them, what's their background, and what can they learn from their travels today before this incident, what was going on in their life from friends and family. That is the main focus right now is who is the person who is at the wheel and what can that tell us?",

We are in close contact with U.S. officials and we'll continue to work closely with them.We will continue to be engaged. We will provide updates. Updates I can give right now is there are four border crossings that are right now closed: Rainbow Bridge, Whirlpool Bridge, Queenston Bridge and Peace Bridge. Additional measures are being contemplated and activated at all border crossings across the country. We are taking this extraordinarily seriously. And Mr. Speaker, I will have to excuse myself now to go get further updates and work on this very serious situation. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Robert, your read of the situation based on the details that you've heard.ROBERT D'AMICO, RETIRED FBI AGENT: Right now, with John Miller's input, that they have a video of the vehicle going is huge. In the bomb tech world, they blow up cars all the time. And due to Iraq and Afghanistan, our knowledge of VBIEDs is immense. So they're going to start looking at this video and even from the video, they're going to be able to start looking where that explosion was actually initiated. Was it high explosives? You can tell by some of - how the debris is thrown out of an explosion at the rate of speed, was it high explosives, was it low explosives? They're going to have local teams with technical stuff. Even if it's not safe, they can send robots down to start taking samplings. So all this stuff is going to go into actually different bomb techs. They're going to send it down to Quantico where the national level guys are at, and they're going to start looking for it. And they're going to start analyzing those videos. We used to study them all the time when we did explosive work. And the start of it and how the explosion goes and how the vehicle comes apart, like I said, they do that all the time. And they can literally just take the video and start looking at it and really come up to a better determination.",

They're not going to come off of a definitive answer because even if it wasn't a high explosive initiation of the vehicle, it still could have been something that had some type of terrorism background. But what they're going to be looking at is how this vehicle exploded. They're going to come back and say, was there high explosives in it that it started, what was created by it and walk that backward.They're going to start interviewing the family members. Again, was there something going on in the family members that were killed that were in the vehicle that would indicate something else? But I think the biggest thing, if they can determine, hey, that was a high explosive initiated and - vehicle, then it's going to ramp it up a little bit. They really determine that it's not looking that way, I think you can start looking at other things coming in. They'll probably have NTSB coming in because they deal with vehicle explosions all the time and bring those experts in to start looking at that scene with the JTTF.",

It's obviously a very challenging window of time that officials are also working in, given that tomorrow's the Thanksgiving holiday and some two plus million people are going to be traveling.

And so - and I think that as Director Wray said, this is not a time for panic, but it is a time for vigilance.And so, you know, I would just encourage everybody to - I mean, I hate to take us back to 9/11, but we really need to be paying attention to stray backpacks and where you are and your surroundings and to take extra precautions because these threats are at a heightened state that we haven't seen for decades.",

You see the flames there, vehicle parts scattered throughout that border crossing. We also have new information about something that's happening at the Buffalo Airport, which is not far from Niagara Falls. Let's go to CNN's Pete Muntean, who's live for us from Reagan National.

      "sentences": "We are hearing things change by the moment here, Boris, both locally near the incident site and also nationally. We just heard from the FAA that the Buffalo Niagara Falls International Airport is now closed to all international arriving and departing flights. This just crossed from the FAA. No time when they posted this about when this would expire.We have also heard from Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg. He has been briefed about this, he says, also has spoken with his Canadian counterpart about this very dynamic situation. We are learning that also at the Buffalo Airport from the Niagara Frontier Transportation Authority, which runs it, that cars coming into the airport are being screened as well as the passengers who are going through security and so they're trying to get the word out for passengers leaving the airport today on a huge holiday travel day to try and factor in some extra time because of that. The TSA says it's already in a heightened state of security posture because of this. And the TSA and the Department of Homeland Security say they are coordinating with local and federal counterparts to try and make sure that this situation, as it unfolds, they can change things quickly as needed. They say there are things that have gone into place that you can see like dogs at the airport. We have seen them here at Reagan National Airport throughout the last couple of days of this Thanksgiving travel rush. We have also heard of things in some cases that you cannot see. And so there are many things changing here by the moment when it comes to transportation, because this was at a border crossing. This did involve transportation and now we are learning that the airports are potentially a factor here as well. And that is something coming from the FAA, in which they say that these international arrivals and departures are being halted at the Buffalo Airport. Pretty significant, because it's only about 20 miles from the blast site and also, it is significant because it's right on the Canadian border. And so, presumably, a lot of international flights come in and out there, 2 million passengers a year at the airport, 5,000 flights a month. And this is a huge time for Thanksgiving travel. They were expecting about 2.7 million people, according to the TSA, at airports across the country today, Boris.",
