With cameras a'rollin', Mr. Trump's lawyers appeared in Fulton County, Georgia, and begin their attempt to defend their client. What they presented today before Judge McAfee and what's likely to come down the pike. We're going dive into all of it. Plus, the cease-fire, regrettably, is over. The White House is blaming Hamas and now Israeli strikes resumed in Gaza, while Prime Minister Netanyahu is facing new criticism and tough questions about warnings his government received and dismissed as recently as last summer about a pending Hamas attack. And the locks changed on George Santos' office already, just hours after the historic vote expelling him from Congress. All the day's drama, the fire, the fury, the tears, the cheers, as we say not good- bye to George Santos, but let us say, until we meet again. (MUSIC)",

      "sentences": "Welcome to THE LEAD. I'm Jake Tapper.And we start with two major developments in Donald Trump's legal battles. First off to Fulton County, Georgia, Trump's lawyers arguing before Judge McAfee in the Georgia election case for the very first time, saying Trump's charges should be thrown out on First Amendment free speech grounds. Trump's defense is going after the current timeline for the case, which has the timeline starting next August, just three months before the November presidential election. Trump is one of 19 people charged in the case regarding efforts to overturn the state's 2020 election results. Of those 19, you might recall, four of them have pleaded guilty. And then more breaking news in D.C. earlier today, a three-judge panel on a federal appeals court ruling that Trump can, in fact, be sued in civil lawsuits related to the January 6th Capitol attack, with the chief judge stating that not everything a president does is necessarily protected from legal liability. This ruling will impact several legal cases against Donald Trump, including cases brought by Democratic Congressman Eric Swalwell of California, as well as cases brought by Capitol Hill police officers. And beyond Donald Trump, this could have major implications for the presidency in general. Let's get straight to CNN's Nick Valencia down in Atlanta outside the Fulton County courthouse. So, Nick, what did Trump's lawyers argue in court today about free speech and what Donald Trump said about the case in Georgia?",

They both entered plea deals to avoid having to go that far.Now, today, Trump's lawyers argue that, in fact, you can decide this pretrial.

And we know that federal officers from the president on down enjoy civil immunity for things that they do in the course of their official duties. But here, the court found that his remarks on January 6th were part of a, quote, pro-Trump rally, and more like campaign activity, not his official duties as the leader of the free world.

So this would be, you know, incredibly damaging if it goes to the Supreme Court and is upheld for him in the criminal arena.

She found middle ground and shaped the law for many of the nation's most controversial issues, affirmative action, abortion rights, voting rights, religious issues.

And it's important to point out we know what these viruses are. They they're not necessarily novel or mysterious viruses because you've seen in the headlines as well. We -- it's flu. It's RSV, and it's COVID. It's this triple threat. But I do want to show you, just to give you some context if you look at respiratory pediatric hospitalizations and just sort of go back over the last few years. You can see as far as where we are now, in the 2022 winter, there was a significant spike. When you can see where we are now, and that number is likely to continue to go up. But so far it's not out of whack compared to what we've seen in the last couple of years. In fact, let me show you what things have looked like the last couple of years and compare that to pre-COVID as well. So the green line in the middle that's sort of 2022, 2023. The two previous years actually had higher hospitalizations for respiratory virus. These are all higher post-pandemic. So gives you some sort of context of what's going on here. But I think the really critical point is, you know, having covered these types of stories for a long time you look to see is the virus spreading human to human? Is it spreading within a community? The answer is yes, and we're seeing that in places around the country. And then trying to figure out what exactly is causing this. And again, it is viruses.
