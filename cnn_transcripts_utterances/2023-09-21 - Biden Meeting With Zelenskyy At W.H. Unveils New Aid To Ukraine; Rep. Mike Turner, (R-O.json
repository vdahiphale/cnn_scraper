Firefighters rushing the wounded out of the burning ruins of this hotel in the town Cherkasy. The sound I heard was boom, and I saw all the windows were gone in the kitchen and in the bedroom, this woman says. And she adds, at around 06:00 in the morning, there was an explosion, a strong one. We came here, saw the windows that shattered in the shop. Kyiv says the Russians launched 43 cruise missiles in the early morning hours. And while Ukraine's air defenses were able to shoot down most of them, some did come through, also hitting energy infrastructure. Kyiv saying the power grid here hasn't been attacked on this scale in half a year. The Ukrainians certain more strikes will follow as temperatures begin to fall. We can make certain assumptions that the fuel and energy sector facilities will be further targeted by the enemy, the Air Force spokesman says. Zelenskyy urging the U.S. and its allies to provide more modern air defense systems, but Ukraine also fighting back.

On the front lines, the Ukrainians say they're making gains. Cover me, I'll get closer to them, the soldier says. This video released by a unit operating on the eastern front. While in the south, Kyiv says its counter offensive there is also gaining steam, even though the going remains tough. Despite mining and engineering equipment, as well as strong resistance from the occupiers, our units had a partial success advanced into the depths of the enemy's defense and along the front, he says.

And also that the last time, just within the last two months that there was a bill on the floor questioning support for Ukraine, over 300 members of the House, out of 435, voted in the affirmative to support that aid. So the discussion wasn't about should there be aid, the discussion was, what should the aid be? The problem relates really to the Biden administration. They've sent over a package without much description, without an understanding of what the strategy is. Speaker McCarthy has made it very clear he's not going to be for a blank check. And the discussion today was around, what does Zelenskyy need in order to be able to win? He said, certainly long range missiles, F16s, air, you know, support. Those are the types of things that really the Biden administration has been very slow to provide, saying that they're going to supply but they have not showed up yet as the Ukrainian people stand against this Russian aggression and continue to fight for democracy in Ukraine.",

Joining us now, New Hampshire's Republican governor, Chris Sununu.Governor, thanks so much for joining us. This poll of your state shows that Trump is way ahead with some 39 percent of the vote among likely Republican voters in New Hampshire. But Ramaswamy, Haley, Christie, and DeSantis, they're all bunched up far behind Trump in a statistical tie for second place. Why do you think a Trump alternative has yet to emerge? GOV. CHRIS SUNUNU (R-NH): Well, it's still early. It really is. I mean, if you look back in the days of Bush versus McCain, I think at this point in September, Bush was ahead of McCain by, you know, 30 points or something like that, he lost by 19. So there's still a lot of politics to play out. Most folks won't really decide who they're voting for till well after Thanksgiving. And the most important part of that poll is Trump's at 39 percent, right? It's 15 points below his national average showing that where the conversation is happening, where folks are getting engaged, they're realizing there's great alternatives out there. The most important part, really, of that as well is the number of Trump voters of that 39 percent, it's about a third are willing to walk away from him. So his floor, I used to think it was about 32 percent, 33 percent is really down to about 25 percent when a third of his own support right now has says, we're open to different ideas and different candidates.

So there's a lot more debate to happen. And when the first debate happened, you saw Nikki Haley surge, you saw a lot of the numbers change, you saw things sift out.We used -- about a month and a half ago, we had 13 or 14 candidates. By the first debate we had eight. I think maybe six or six or seven will make the second debate stage. So, the field is winnowing down like we want to see. And so, again, if it's Trump and one other candidate, Trump's going to lose. So it's just up to the voters to figure out who that alternative is going to be.

      "sentences": "Well, look, as you said, I mean, the former president holds a commanding lead and he is in command of this race without question. But this is largely becoming a race for second place, a race to eventually go head to head with him. And we see a lot of national polls, of course, but we're starting to get a closer look at these state by state polls, which of course are much more important.So let's take a look at some of those recent ones. So just give a snapshot in time of where the race is. In Iowa, for example, a poll out yesterday from \"Fox News\" shows that the former president is at 46 percent, certainly a head and shoulders away. But look below there, Governor Ron DeSantis from Florida, he has fallen considerably. Nikki Haley, the former South Carolina governor and U.N. ambassador, she has climbed. So you can see some distinctions there in the race. But then when you look to South Carolina, of course, that is the third spot in the road to the White House here in the Republican primary. Again, the former president holding the same level of support. But Nikki Haley once again going above all of her rivals, including a fellow South Carolinian, Tim Scott, the senator there. And again, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis has fallen. So if we look at Nikki Haley specifically here how she has climbed. Look at this, Wolf, from July to September in Iowa and South Carolina, she has climbed considerably in those states as well as New Hampshire. And we look at New Hampshire overall. This is a place where she was campaigning in this afternoon. Now she is locked in a fight for second place here. Donald Trump, not quite as high in New Hampshire, 39 percent. But Nikki Haley, of course, going into the next debate, which is of course next Wednesday, is trying to essentially play off the momentum from the first debate. And she was asked some interesting questions this afternoon at a town hall in Portsmouth, New Hampshire about how she distinguishes herself from the former president. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) NIKKI HALEY (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: He was the right president at the right time. He was being skinned and easily distracted. He didn't do anything on fiscal policy and really spent a lot of money, and we're all paying the price for it. He used to be good on foreign policy and now he has started to walk it back and get weak in the knees when it comes to Ukraine. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

How do they walk that fine line of distinguishing themselves and differentiating themselves from the former president, particularly her, because she of course, served in his administration. But Wolf, one of the reasons that she is gaining ground, it is because of the moderates, so that message is likely to resonate there with her. She'll be giving a major economic address tomorrow in New Hampshire, again trying to make the case to voters there. But Wolf, that next debate next week. It truly is a race for second place. Wolf?",

Here in Eagle Pass, we've witnessed hundreds of people crossing the river and turning themselves into authorities. And this is the last part of some of the largest groups we've seen cross today. And these are people, mostly from Venezuela, who crossed over several hours ago and crawled underneath the razor wire that has been lined up along the river here by Texas authorities.But despite all of that, they have come across many of these migrants saying that despite the possibility that they could face stricter penalties for crossing illegally between ports of entry, that they are willing to take that risk because they have been waiting for months and months to get through what is called the CBP One app, which is essentially a process by which these migrants can set up an appointment to request asylum. But many of these migrants say that they were simply tired of waiting and that is why they decided to cross here. So some very tense moments throughout the day as these migrants, many of them were standing on the banks of the river, standing in waist high water, several of them mothers with their toddlers standing there in the river. And we do know that over the last two days, there have been two people that have drowned. One of those was also a three-year-old boy, so very dangerous and treacherous conditions that the migrants are, you know, facing when they cross the river here. And all of this happening as officials here in Eagle Pass say that their ability to handle this migrant surge has really been stretched to the limit. The shelters are full. The processing centers are filling up. So obviously a great deal of tension here with the numbers of migrants arriving here. Wolf?",
