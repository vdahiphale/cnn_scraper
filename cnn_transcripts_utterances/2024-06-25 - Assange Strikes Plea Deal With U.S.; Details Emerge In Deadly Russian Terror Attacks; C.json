The Wikileaks founder striking a plea deal with the Biden administration ending his years long standoff with the U.S.As the war in Gaza ships to a new phase a second front is heating up in Israel's north, as tensions with Hezbollah hit a boiling point. And horror in Russia. A martial arts fighter is accused of being among the gunman who attacks places of worship and police in Dagestan, killing at least 20. Well, we're going to go right now to Beijing and our Steven Jiang where a Chinese space object is returning to earth as we speak. China's lunar probe has completed its historic mission to the far side of the moon. Steven, what can you tell us?",

But what we didn't know -- what we do know is how fascinating intricate this collection process was because involved a drill and a robotic arm. And as I said, they collected samples from this sprawling region on the far side of the moon. And upon collection, a -- an ascender actually scooped up these samples from the lunar surface and then transfer them in lunar orbit to a reentry vehicle. That reentry vehicle is actually what we are looking at right nowbecause it is descending to Earth after separating from its Lunar Orbiter. This process, of course, is extremely complex, which is another reason why China is very proud of its achievement because it is a late comer in the space race. And now of course, it's not only catching up but also trying to get ahead of the United States and other countries. As we mentioned, this, of course, comes only five years, some five years after China became the first and still only country of the world to make a soft landing on the far side of the moon. Now of course, they are making further progress by collecting samples from the far side of the moon and bring them back to Earth. Anna?",

So that of course, they have pointed as another evidence of China's scientific prowess.And as we are looking at this picture, I think a lot of Chinese viewers are also comparing their space achievements to that of the United States. And it's not lost on a lot of Chinese viewers because when this is -- as this is happening, of course, the U.S. is facing new challenges in its crewed missions to the space as we know two American astronauts are currently stuck in the International Space Station because of the Boeing Starliner is new problems with helium leaking. So, this -- the Chinese are always trying to brush aside this concept of a space race and competition with the U.S. I think even the NASA director has acknowledged this is very much.

And we're just learning a statement from the Australian Prime Minister that the Australian High Commissioner to London is apparently accompanying Julian Assange, as he makes this long journey from the U.K. all the way to this U.S. territory in the Northern Mariana Islands. It is certainly a fascinating twist in Assange's long saga where he has completed more than five years of incarceration in largely solitary confinement in Belmarsh prison in London.And now this announcement of a plea deal that he has agreed to or he is about to agree to plead guilty to one count. There is going to be an appearance scheduled before a U.S. federal judge inside pan. That's one of the islands in the Northern Mariana Islands as part of this plea deal. Take a look at the document that the letter that U.S. prosecutors sent to that judge where they announced we anticipate that the defendant will plead guilty to the charge in the information of conspiring to unlawfully obtain and disseminate classified information relating to the national defense of the United States. The letter goes on to say that both parties have agreed and would like to have the guilty plea and the sentencing to be completed in a single day and that the defendant opposes traveling to the continental U.S. It does appear that the U.S. prosecutors have agreed to that. The prosecutors we understand have called for a sentencing of five years in prison. And that is about how long Assange has been in that London jail. So, it's assumed he'll get credit for that time served and will likely be released to Australia. WikiLeaks, his organization is celebrating this already saying Julian Assange is free trumpeting that.

But also, Israel has to shift its military attention to the north, including tens of thousands of Israeli reservists who have been called up and are prepared to take whatever action is necessary to defend the north and to restore simply Israeli controlling the sovereignty to the Galilee region and 80,000 people back to their homes.So, it's -- the answer is both.

And a warning, some of the images in his report are disturbing.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) It's the horror of Putin rose to power pledging to eradicate, but still nearly a quarter of a century later haunts him now. Pitched battles in the southern region of Dagestan where likely Islamist militants' attacks Jews and Christians in synagogues and churches over hours in which police struggled into the night to gain control. We still have an incomplete picture of what sends security services into a frenzy Sunday, as evening prayers began. But it is clear the flames spread along Dagestan's coast down to this synagogue in southern Derbent. And the police were also targeted. Their ranks stripped thin by mobilization to Putin's other war in Ukraine. Russia security services keen to emphasize their swift reaction, releasing this video of them securing the assumption of Our Lady Cathedral in Makhachkala. Dagestan used over two decades to scenes of mangled metal and police hunting militants. But this time, absorbing whether Putin's war in Ukraine had taken away the security forces from their own home streets. And the disturbing news that three of the gunmen were related to a local official. One his son, another a nephew, and a third cousin, a local MMA fighter. A key victim, Father Nikolai pictured here, apparently having his throat slit amid reports there was a hostage standoff for a while. The deaths announced so far, mostly police leaving questions as to whether more civilians have been killed when they came to evening worship. And the main suspect here, ISIS-K yet to claim the attack and officials slow to name them. Of course, we understand who is behind the organization of these terrorist attacks, he says. We understand what the organizers were trying to achieve. Extremism has long cursed Dagestan, the Boston bombers partially linked back to here, and its militants in 2013. Police have long been ferocious in their response, fueling yet more extremism analysts say. Yet in 2022, protests are rotted and so many Dagestani men were sent off to Ukraine. And so now, the old agony of terror, perhaps made worse by police being thinned out for Putin's long war of choice. Nick Paton Walsh, CNN London. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
