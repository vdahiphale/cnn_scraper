He will probably put his, you know, -- some of them in control of the DOJ, the Department of Justice and the FBI, go after his political opponents. And that's really going to stretch the rule of law. The point that we make, though, is that the military, the courts, and adversarial media, and especially federalism, we forget about state administration of national elections, it's really, really hard to steal an election right now. So, we think there's going to be another election, but we also think this could be the biggest erosion of institutional norms since reconstruction.

They had to spend a lot of time looking into every single possible corner to see whether there was more evidence to tie Donald Trump to the - to the violence we saw that day. One of the things they did find was, there was this tip that developed in about June of 2021 that seemed to indicate that there was some kind of meeting between Trump or someone very close to him and members of the Proud Boys. These are the people who were behind some of the worst violence on January 6th. And so they spent months looking into that.They looked into the infamous Willard Room where people were trying to help overturn the election results. They also looked into possible financial ties. All of that took about a year. And so, when you heard from Attorney General Merrick Garland about a year later, on the anniversary of the - of the attack, here is the words he said that gave people hope about what this investigation was about. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MERRICK GARLAND, ATTORNEY GENERAL: The actions we have taken thus far will not be our last. The Justice Department remains committed to holding all January 6th perpetrators at any level accountable under law, whether they were present that day or were otherwise criminally responsible for the assault on our democracy.

And they said what - what the investigation ended up doing was boosting Trump during that - during that primary, the Republican primary.Of course, for Justice Department officials, they believe they had to do all of these things, and that this was always going to take about four to five years.

Very much mirroring that drop that we saw that that folks said that, of course, would make him ineligible for the presidency. So, that is part of the reason why, right? Folks - fewer folks thought he was responsible - greatly responsible for what happened on January 6th. But it's not just that. It's that people, simply put, didn't care as much about the attack on the Capitol. Look at this, January 6th is the biggest - is your biggest memory of Trump's first term in office. By the time of 2024, look at this, look at this, it was just 5 percent. Just 5 percent of Americans. And among Republicans, it was just 2 percent.

Those were mistakes. And he let his ego get in the way in the end. However, there's one thing he didn't do. He never encouraged his supporters to go and march on the Capitol, to go and break the system, to go and break democracy, to go and break the law just so he could stay in power.

This shows a lot of things, including tech giants sort of bending the knee to Donald Trump. Tell me what you know. BETSY KLEIN, CNN SENIOR WHITE HOUSE PRODUCER: Well, Sara, we're learning that Melania Trump will be the subject of a new documentary coming to Amazon Prime Video this year, giving a rare and behind the scenes look at one of President-elect Trump's most trusted but also notoriously guarded advisors. An Amazon spokesperson tells our colleague Eliabeth Wagmeister in a statement, quote, \"Prime Video will be sharing more details on the project as filming progresses and release plans are finalized. We are excited to share this truly unique story with our millions of customers around the world.\" Now, this is a really notable move from Amazon. As you recall, Donald Trump was once a reality star but has essentially been a pariah in Hollywood since he entered politics back in 2015. So, this really underscores that Amazon recognizes his popularity among many Americans, particularly after his reelection in November, and is looking to capitalize on that. And to put a finer point on it, this documentary began filming in December, one month after Trump's win. It will be released in both theaters and on streaming in a few months after Trump has taken office. And, of course, this comes after Amazon chief Jeff Bezos met with Trump at his Mar-a-Lago club and has announced he would donate $1 million to Trump's inaugural fund. Now, Melania Trump is serving as executive producer. This means that the documentary is being made with her full participation and editorial control.
