Let me get you some images here because it is in this room that the House speaker, the Republican Kevin McCarthy, will announce shortly how he proposes to avoid that shutdown. Barring some sort of unexpected late progress the federal government is likely to grind to a halt just after midnight on Sunday morning. That is 38 hours from now. How do we get to this point? Well, hard-lined conservatives in the U.S. House are trying to scuttle their speaker's attempt to pass what would be a short-term funding bill. Something the Senate is advancing in a bipartisan fashion. Well, as I said, Kevin McCarthy preparing to bring that bill to a vote later today, but hard-liners may revolt and vote against a procedural rule to prevent the bill from even reaching the floor for a vote. So, we're left, it appears, with one big mess. Want to talk about it with CNN political commentator and Republican strategist, Alice Stewart. Alice, it's good to have you. As we await Kevin McCarthy into what is a packed room, a lot of press, waiting to hear from him, how he proposes to avoid this shutdown, it seems, though, that he's proposal is sort of dead before it arrives. Just explain to us exactly what's going on, and how it is that Kevin McCarthy can afford a shutdown if indeed you believe he could.",

And it's because Kevin McCarthy, the Republican leader in the House, has a very far-right wing of the Republican Party that is just determined to hold their ground on this. They do not want to pass what is called a continuing resolution or a CR, which would in essence allow President Biden's spending plan to move forward. That far-right flank is led by Florida Congressman Matt Gaetz and others who really are holding firm on that and some say they can't take yes for an answer. And they are determined to make sure that any type of CR does not pass. These are the same people that fought almost against Kevin McCarthy being in a leadership position, and what they did was in order for him to be the leader, they said we can't have a motion to vacate, in essence kick him out of his position with one person putting that to the floor, basically, if he doesn't do whatever they want. Well, they're showing that right now. They want to make sure we don't pass a CR, and they are threatening to remove him from his position if he doesn't placate to them. So he is stuck between making sure they get what they want and working with the Democrats to pass a spending plan to avoid a shutdown. The problem is, he is stuck between a rock and a hard place and he's not going to be able to get this done. The congressman I talked to says it's virtually inevitable that we're going to have a shutdown tomorrow night. The question is, how long and how many people will be impacted by this?

That was tremendous. He got Republican consensus on that. And it allows them to move that forward to the Senate. For them to vote on it. The problem, as I mentioned earlier, it's dead-on arrival. Some of the spending in that, specifically on border funding, we already know from the Senate that they are not going to pass that. So what Kevin McCarthy did, understandably, is he touted what the Republicans have done to this point and is now putting it, as he indicates, it's in the hands of the Democrats and also the Senate. So the problem is it sounds good on paper that they have done this, but what they have accomplished in order to placate that hard right-wing of the Republican Party it's not going to get anywhere. So what this means is it's not going to get through in the Senate, and we're inevitably going to have a shutdown. But this is what Kevin McCarthy has to do as the speaker and as the leader over in the House because the far-right flank of his party says if you don't do what we say, we are going to put in a motion to vacate, and you will be out of your job.

Conflict, violence, natural disasters all have long lasting impacts that reverberate for years, and oftentimes generations to come.

That number is according to UNICEF and it's difficult to imagine, isn't it? Can you imagine what these children are going through? How they are coping psychologically? Well, I find it really hard to imagine that. Look at this young boy watching over his destroyed city. Rescue teams search through the rubble. It's likely that his loved ones are stuck underneath or even dead. And this kid, standing amid the debris mud, reaching over his ankles as he looks on what his home has now become. Evidently he stays overwhelmed and sad. And there are thousands of them going through the same horror. Not only do they have to reckon with the loss of their homes and their lives, as they once knew it, but some have had to carry their dead parents, siblings, cousins, and friends. Some people have reportedly counted up to 25 family members floating by the coast of what was this once idyllic seafront. While we still don't know how many children have been orphaned, judging by the number of those killed, it is likely that they are in the thousands, too.

Well, now scientists believe they found a way to not onlypreserve the vulnerable environment, but also improve the island's economy. CNN's Patrick Oppmann explains. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) PATRICK OPPMANN, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Porpoises swim off the coast of Cuba. The waters here may seem pristine, but like seemingly everywhere else, this Caribbean Island nation is grappling with the threats from a rapidly changing climate. Now in the first research expedition of its kind, 24 Cuban scientists and crew circumnavigated the entire island to carry out what they say is the most comprehensive study ever done on climate change and the impact it's had on Cuba. Researchers dive from coral reef to coral reef and say what they have found is even more dire than they expected. We've seen a bleaching of corals, which is something that is worrying and that is massive, she says. The majority of coral is bleached and this is because of the high temperatures. The scientists say it's not too late to reverse the damage, but that we have to dramatically reduce human-caused pollution that is heating oceans to record levels, killing off coral reefs and filling the seas with microplastics. With this study, the scientists say they will be able to measure much more accurately how much harm is being inflicted on Cuba's unique natural environments. We are going to have a baseline, she says. We hope to identify the spots along the coast where the pollution is and how concentrated it is. For two months, the scientists carried out dozens of dives, taking hundreds of samples from the bottom of the ocean. Scientists are barely out of their wetsuits before running tests in their makeshift laboratory. They hope what they learn can change how resources on this island are used. (On-camera): Scientists say they're making the case to government officials here that the country needs to transition from commercial fishing to have a greater focus on marine tourism. As they say, a shark can only be caught and eaten one time whereas that same shark can be enjoyed by tourists on a dive excursion again and again. Something that's not only better for this country's environment, but also its economy. (Voice-over): The change will not come easy, but for Cubans who depend on mangroves to protect them from hurricanes and beaches to attract tourists, experts say there is no other choice. It's not a luxury, it's a necessity, he says. Even with so many difficulties, we can't stop learning about coral reefs. They protect the beaches, they protect us from extreme weather, they give us sand and fish and the things we eat. The scientists traveled more than 1800 nautical miles to better understand an incredible natural world off Cuba's shores that is increasingly at risk. Patrick Oppmann, CNN, Cien Pueblos, Cuba.
