We will have all the very latest on the conflict in the Middle East in a few minutes, but I do want to begin with a detailed update on that storm, the first impacts from this extremely dangerous hurricane already being felt as Milton's outer bands approach Florida. Milton currently a powerful Category 4 hurricane in the Gulf of Mexico, as you can see, set to make landfall in Central Florida late today, Wednesday or early Thursday. At that intensity, the storm will expand in size, and forecasters are warning, it will cause catastrophic damage. There are new urgent warnings from officials on Florida's West Coast to get out now. Here's what the Sheriff of Hillsborough County, which includes Tampa, said a bit earlier on CNN. Have a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

The -- and we know, of course, that there is disagreement, as there so frequently has been, between the Israeli government and the U.S. government over the scale of that response. Israel has said, as the Israeli Defense Minister told me just a couple of days ago, that everything is on the table, and that includes strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities as well as its strategic oil reserves and other potential targets as well. President Biden has made very clear publicly that he opposes a strike on Iran's nuclear facilities, and he has also sought to advise the Israeli government against striking Iranian oil targets as well. And so, this call is going to seek to get some kind of alignment between these two sides, whether or not that alignment can actually be achieved is another question. We know that the Israeli Prime Minister wanted to have this conversation himself. The Israeli Defense Minister, Yoav Gallant was scheduled to arrive in Washington today to meet with U.S. Defense Secretary, Lloyd Austin, but Netanyahu calling that trip off and instead scheduling a call with President Biden himself.",

Speaking on Tehran in Tehran, sorry, on Tuesday, the president said Israel was a quote, barbaric government which is refusing to follow the rules of war by indiscriminately attacking women, children and the elderly. Well, this comes as Iran's Foreign Minister said Tuesday that any strike on Iran's infrastructure would be met with a stronger retaliation. Abbas Araqchi is now visiting Saudi Arabia and other countries in the region, aiming, he says, to prevent the quote crimes of Israel in both Lebanon and Gaza. CNN's Fred Pleitgen is in Iran's capital, Tehran, and he joins us now. Look, I think it's really important that we assess what we believe is going on here. Iran's Foreign Minister traveling in the Gulf, very specifically to Saudi Arabia today, of course, a not a partner, not a friend necessarily, of Iran, but certainly closer than they have been over the past decade.

      "sentences": "Well, I think it's highly significant, Becky, that Abbas Araqchi, the Foreign Minister ofIran is in Riyadh today to meet today with the Saudi officials. Because, of course, one of the things that the Iranians are trying to do is they're trying to get Arab nations on their side against Israel. And I think a lot of this comes back down to the supreme leader last Friday, leading Friday prayers, of course, in those Friday prayers, eulogizing the slain Hezbollah leader, Hassan Nasrallah, who was very close to Iran's Supreme Leader. And in that speech here we're called that the supreme leader called for nations in this region, in the Middle East to unite, as he put it, in support of the Palestinians. Of course, in support as of Lebanon, as he put it as well. But then also, of course, against Israel and the United States. I think one of the quotes of the supreme leader in that speech that he gave here saying that the enemies of the of Iran are also the enemies of the Palestinians, the enemies of Jordan, the enemies of Saudi Arabia and other and Iraq and other nations as well. So, I think the newfound diplomacy and the shuttle diplomacy that we're essentially seeing from the foreign minister, but also from the President Iran, a lot of that goes back to that at the same time. Of course, you do have Israel's response to that, massive missile attacks of the Iranians launched last week against targets inside Israel. That still is very much looming. You can feel on the streets here that there are some people who are concerned that that could lead to a wider conflict. You also do, though, have a lot of defiance here on the part of the Iranians, and that threat to then hit back at Israel very hard. I was able to speak today to the speaker of the committee for national security and foreign relations of the Iranian parliament, and here's what he had to say about that. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) EBRAHIM REZAEI, IRANIAN SHURA COUNCIL'S NATIONAL SECURITY AND FOREIGN POLICY COMMITTEE: We will certainly respond to Israel. In a most recent attack on Israel, we targeted only military sites. Naturally, there are other targets that we could hit, and we have the capability to do so. We have so many missiles that we can, one by one hit these targets. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And I think one of the thingsthat we always that we always need to keep in mind with all of that, Becky, is that the unit of the Revolutionary Guard, of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps that launched that missile attack against those targets in Israel. That's the same unit, the aerospace forces that are also responsible for air defense here in that country. So that unit, no doubt, at this point in time, will be on high alert. I think they've already said some of the things that they fear the Israelis could try and strike, like, for instance, critical infrastructure, for instance, the oil and gas installations, a lot of which, of course, are in the Persian Gulf area, but then also in areas near the border with Iraq as well. And then, of course, there is the fear that the Israelis might try and strike some of the nuclear installations here in this country. Certainly, the Iranians are bracing for all that. They certainly are preparing for all that, but at the same time, they are threatening that a response will be met with an even tougher response on their part. And of course, with that, all of that brings the further fear of a possible escalation here in this entire region, and possibly in the end, the United States and Iran facing off against one another. And certainly, the Iranians have said that they do not have any interest in things getting that far, Becky.",

This is not a flag that belongs on that land. And if anybody is trying to undermine Hezbollah's popularity in Lebanon and amongst its support base, that's not the way to go about it. It's exactly how you breathe air into the lungs of Hezbollah and its supporters who do not want to see Lebanese land occupied by Israel. And of course, this was then followed by the speech of Bibi Netanyahu, ostensibly addressed to the Lebanese people. There is no Lebanese as anti- Iranian or anti Hezbollah as they can be that wants to be seen as taking their guidelines and points from Bibi Netanyahu. That is only counterproductive. And so, Bibi is better off talking to his own audiences than trying to address the Lebanese in the way that would only backfire and only inflame and strengthen Hezbollah's influence in that country.",

And this is purely for domestic consumption, even though it is ostensibly meant for a Lebanese audience, if Netanyahu continues to go down that path. And this is, you know, of great irony here.

That is not an affront to his defense minister. And this is not just domestic Israeli squabbling. This is an offense to the President of the United States. Now my understanding is that President Biden will oblige and there will be a phone call, but it is a very telling example of the status of the relationship. And how little regard right now Netanyahu has for President of the United States and an administration that are essentially a lame duck until we get to the November 5th elections and then the swearing in of a new president on January 20th.

It really never wanted to see itself in a direct confrontation with Israel. Arguably, it was baited into one. And so, to the extent that those meetings can result in some kind of back-channel diplomacy to de-escalate, they will find that as useful. The Saudis and others in the Gulf obviously very concerned about bull back against their oil installations as pro-Iran militias and groups in the region threaten those installations should Israel attack Iran's energy installations.

This is what they found, a slight weakening trend in hurricane Milton. But even though it is a Category 4 from a Category 5, we expect storm surge to be consistent with Category 5 status because of the amount of energy that this storm has enacted on the Eastern Gulf of Mexico, pushing up the water into this very vulnerable coastline. We're a matter of hours before we start experiencing the tropical storm force winds, by the way, which will close the bridges and evacuation routes for these areas. So, the window is narrowing down to next to nothing for people to who decided, hey, maybe I'll ride this one out, but made a last- minute decision that is narrowly, narrowly going away. Category 4 hurricane at landfall, according to the official forecast from the National Hurricane Center, of course, that's overnight tonight, late tonight or early Thursday morning. But the game of miles here really because the forecast track is dependent on who gets that right front quadrant, the most powerful part of a hurricane, with the storm surge being the direct impacts. And what we've picked up on is a lowering of the storm surge numbers in Tampa Bay, but still eclipsing record levels from Helene two weeks ago, with the greatest surge impacts across Sarasota County, 10 to 15 feet. If we believe this one model, European model, this actually is a worst-case scenario for Tampa Bay. Regardless, this won't be just a coastal impact storm with devastating winds. It will stretch across the entire Florida peninsula, and we are already feeling its effects. The eye clearly visible on our radar, and there's the winds picking up with the outer bands spinning up tornadoes. There's a tornado watch in effect through 09:00 p.m. tonight, a few warnings on going across Miami-Dade County, and that threat will only increase through the course of the day today, along with the flash flood potential, two to three months' worth of rain will fall from the sky, Becky.",

I learned that in my job, showing up and meeting with people andgetting a sense of the community and having conversations with people that are different than what you might be reading and trying to understand the fans here. So that makes a big difference in all the markets. I think that bringing the players, they become ambassadors for the market, in essence, to be able to go home and talk to other players about exactly what they've experienced on the ground.",

Essentially, that's what we're doing now. We're studying it intensively at the league office. I mean, there are the main issues are dilution, potentially player talent. I don't think that's the issue it once was, because we're seeing so much elite basketball played on a global level, to the point where, you know, back 30 years ago, roughly 5 percent of our players were born outside United States. It's getting close to 30 percent now.

And then yesterday, after our practice, we did a clinic with a bunch of local young boys, young girls. And I love that, because it's a chance to see all of our players giving back, bringing smiles to faces, and it was an opportunity to realize that it's perspective. The game is much bigger than ourselves. We're in Abu Dhabi. Let's give back and make sure we're doing that with smiles and -- HOSSEINI (voice-over): It's clear that the NBA global reach is about more than just the stars on the court, from grassroot programs to cultural exchanges, the league's inspiring a whole new generation of fans and players.
