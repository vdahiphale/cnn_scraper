Tonight, urgent questions about what went wrong and whether it could happen again. Welcome to our viewers in the United States and around the world. I'm Wolf Blitzer. You're in THE SITUATION ROOM. All right, let's get right to the breaking news, additional classified documents and other government records just found by President Biden's lawyers. Let's go to our Chief White House Correspondent Phil Mattingly. He's over at the White House with the latest on that. Phil, tell us what you're learning about this second batch of material that was discovered.",

What we're learning now, according to people brief on the matter with both myself and Evan Perez, is that there has been another set of documents that have been discovered. Some of those documents are classified. Now, the specific details of those documents are still sparse at this point and the president and his legal team, as they have discussed these issues up to this point, have only spoken about those first set of documents and notably have never closed the door to the possibility of additional documents, so much so that we've actually asked repeatedly if they thought there would be additional documents, including today at the White House briefing.

He doesn't know what the details of those documents are to this point. One thing that he did make clear in which has been reiterated today by White House officials said there would be full cooperation with what the Justice Department is doing at this moment. There is no sense that that has shifted in any way. But it certainly adds an element to an issue that is both legally and politically dangerous for the president and his team. We have heard Republicans on Capitol Hill make clear they believe that the Justice Department needs to appoint a special counsel. They are starting to launch their own investigations into this matter and certainly this will exacerbate that effort and that outcry on Capitol Hill, Wolf.",

So, I would be confident that is what the investigators and prosecutors have focused on now.The briefing to the intelligence committee is something -- that is a reasonable ask for the intelligence committee. I expect the briefing would take -- would be delivered by the DNI in the same way she briefed them when they made the same request about the documents that have been taken in the Mar-a-Lago search.

The FBI is working likely with the U.S. attorney in Chicago to conduct this review and eagerly awaiting some direction from the A.G. as to how this is going to be handled.I think, I agree with the Republicans, there should absolutely be a special counsel appointed and to review this matter. So, let's think about it, the special counsel, there is nothing magical about a special counsel's legal authority. They essentially have the same ability to investigate and charge crimes that a U.S. attorney has. There's no competence issue here. You certainly have very competent U.S. attorneys to be able to do it. The whole reason to put a special counsel in is when the public would be reasonably concerned that an investigation had been, might be, could be, possibly was tainted by politics. There is certainly that concern here with the attorney general making investigative decisions over the guy who appointed them, President Biden. So, you know, it absolutely calls out for special counsel and I think it goes a long way to addressing some of that criticism that the A.G. is receiving right now from the Republican side. I think they should handle each investigation in as similar manner as possible, acknowledging the fact that the facts in any situation are very, very different.",

That includes Michael Cloud, Andrew Clyde, Andy Harris, who also run House Appropriations Committee and Andy OGles, Byron Donalds and Ralph Norman who all serve on the House Financial Services Committee. So that will make a total of 16 members of the House Freedom Caucus who will be serving on these so-called top tier A-list committees but there are more assignments to come including, House Rules, House Judiciary, House Oversight, House Armed Services.

And when that happened, then many in the conference get very frustrated and kind of angry. So, I would hope that they would not be rewarded for that. But, Wolf, the key here is that many of those individuals, whether on the freedom caucus or others, we should involve them in these committees. If they're involved with appropriations, for example, like I am, where we're writing these bills and going through that process, then they're far more likely to support the language and the legislation once it actually gets to the floor. That's Kevin's point in trying to do this, involve everyone regardless of their ideological background or regardless of where they are within the Republican Party, whether they're moderate or whether they're very to the right, involve all of us, and then, once again, we'll have much more likelihood and much more likely that we would have support from everyone when were on the floor. Because, as you know, Wolf, you lose three or four seats, or both, you lose just a handful of votes and you can't move the legislation forward.

Anybody who has followed the FAA closely over the years is aware the agency has had great difficulty innovating in the world of technology. At lot of it is consistent underfunding over the years. Some of it is an aviation culture, which is a little bit hesitant to embrace technologies for obvious safety concerns. But what you've ended up with is a system that was built essentially in the 1950s with spitting radars and people talking on radios, VHF radios that really hasn't moved into an age of the internet, to an age of computers, to an age of satellites.

Go ahead, Richard.RICHARD QUEST, CNN BUSINESS EDITOR-AT-LARGE:  Well, what you now have, of course, is that there were these two systems, the primary and the backup, both of which had a corrupted file. And I guess they thought they were being very clever this morning when they decided the full reboot should take place. It was meant to take 90 minutes, it took considerably longer. So, we don't actually -- I mean, if I'm understanding this right and I take with this, the architecture that Miles has just explained, nothing actually failed. They went in there, they tried to -- they got done with the corrupted files and they rebooted the system. But the system is so old, antiquated, dilapidated, whatever you want, that it didn't return as fast as it should. And this, as Miles, rightly says, it goes to the problem of when people are going to realize, you've got to spend large sums and probably larger sums than are being spent at the moment for this critical infrastructure for the U.S. economy. BLITZER:  Which raises the question, Miles, how great is the risk right now that this system could go down again? O'BRIEN:  Well, it could do it again. Currently, there is a redundancy problem here. But it's important to point out, Wolf, the remedy for -- the failure of this system is you don't takeoff. It's not planes falling out of sky. So, while it was a huge inconvenience, it wasn't in the purest sense a safety issue.",

We're told the staffer is keeping his legal options open. He didn't come forward at the time, he said, because he didn't want to cause a distraction to the Herschel Walker campaign.
