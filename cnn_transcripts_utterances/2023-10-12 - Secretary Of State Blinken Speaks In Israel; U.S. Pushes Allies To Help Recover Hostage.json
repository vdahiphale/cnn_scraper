The President compared, rightfully, Hamas horrendous massacre to ISIS. Can you provide assurance to Israel that the Biden administration will not attempt to halt Israel effort until the goal of eliminating Hamas from Gaza is completely achieved, regardless of how long it may take? And with your permission, second question. If Hezbollah opens a second front in the north, can we expect that if needed the U.S. will use its military assets in the region to fight against Hezbollah together with the IDF? BLINKEN: OK. Thank you. With regard to the first question, the President's been very clear, I've been very clear, we stand with Israel. We stand with Israel in its determination to defend its people, defend its country. We stand with Israel in its determination to do everything possible to ensure that what happened on Saturday never happens again. And in that determination, we're, of course, as you know, providing assistance as requested by Israel for its efforts. That will continue, and we're working closely with Congress to make sure that Israel has what it needs to do what it must. With regard to the second front, as I mentioned earlier, it's our determination and that of Israel as well that there not be a second front or a third front. And we are working as hard as we can, working with other partners in the region, to try to ensure that that's the case. The President has also been very clear, President Biden. He's been very clear that no one, state or non-state actor, should try to take advantage of this moment. And he's backed up that warning with a deployment of our largest carrier group, the Gerald R. Ford, as well as, again, making sure that Israel has what it needs and that we also have appropriate assets in place. Beyond that, I'm not going to speculate on future events.",

      "sentences": "OK. Thanks, Ed. First, let me say this, with regard to 9/11. If you look at this in proportion to the size of Israel's population, this is the equivalent of ten 9/11s. That's how big and how devastating this attack has been. And of course, each of these situations is very different and it's important to keep that in mind. Of course, we're always trying to draw the lessons from our -- from past experience, as they may or may not be applicable to what we or our partners are doing now.And of course, we're in very close conversation with Israel about the work it's undertaking, as I said, to make sure it can defend itself, defend its citizens, and to the best of its ability ensure that this doesn't happen again. Those are the objectives. And, again, I'll leave the operational details to Israel and simply say again, that as we have these discussions, we're looking at past experiences, including many past experiences more immediate to this challenge, including in Gaza and including in the region. With regard to the goals of Hamas, I think that is a question mostly on which I could speculate but not give you a -- any kind of clear and definitive answer. There are a number of possible explanations. We have not heard from them what their goals are. And I have to tell you that in many ways the simplest explanation may be the most compelling, this is pure evil. There may be second or third-order interests. For example -- I've noted this before -- we've been engaged, as you know, in trying to support and advance the possibility of normalization between Israel and Saudi Arabia and other countries that do not yet have normalized relations with Israel. Something that is very challenging, very difficult, but also very possible. And something that would have a profound effect on the region, on the countries in question and on the region -- a region that's been in turmoil for so many decades that through normalization, through greater integration then has a path to much greater stability, much greater peace, much greater opportunity for everyone in the region. Now, who opposes normalization? Hamas, Hezbollah, Iran. I think that speaks volumes as well.",

As well known, you know, the Turks, the cutleries, our allies, our friends have over time provided economic aid to Hamas. They too have a choice to make. They too are part of this.

And the question of getting citizens, Americans who are in Gaza, Palestinian civilians, out of Gaza.Obviously, Tony Blinken is going to be making those please when he has discussions in Egypt and elsewhere around the region.

If we have seen the worst of the violence, and this stabilizes, and the threat therefore, to Americans, both in Gaza and in Israel are -- is reduced. That's a very different scenario than for example, if Hezbollah were to make the mistake to get involved here. Very, very different scenarios.Obviously, the government is planning for all of those scenarios. I do think that they will have more to say about additional ways for Americans in Israel to get out.

When we condemn unconditionally, the brutal murder and the deliberate murder of Israeli civilians can't be attenuated if there is the brutal murder of Palestinian civilians.No civilian is lesser or more worthy of our moral acknowledgment. However, the practical situation on the ground is that you have a band of terrorists that Israel will be and should eradicate, and, you know, hopefully do it in a way. And I have a lot of confidence in the way the Israelis think about the value of human life in contrast to Hamas. All of this creates a very, very difficult situation, both for the Israelis as well as for Palestinian civilians and hostages and Americans and other nationalities that are in that are in Gaza.",
