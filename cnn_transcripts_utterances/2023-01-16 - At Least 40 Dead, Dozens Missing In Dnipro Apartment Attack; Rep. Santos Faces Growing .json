Just take a look at this video.It just really obliterated huge portions of an apartment complex in Dnipro. And dozens of people are still missing right now. Fred Pleitgen is there for us.

      "sentences": "Well, Kate, let's first talk about whether this is a Russian missile or an air defense missile. It is the former not the latter. It doesn't take an expert to determine that that was literally hundreds of pounds of explosives in a missile that contributed to that building fallen, and an air defense missile does not have that. So, it's another instance of Russia just flat-out lying.Now, I won't get too geeky on air but this is an issue of a strategy of attrition on Russia's approach. You know, they're in warfare. They're strategies of attrition where you try and exhaust the enemy, wear down the enemy and bring different things to bear. Annihilation is where you try and outmaneuver the enemy, get them in a position where you can attack them, and force a decision on the part of the other government to surrender. But the difference here is Russia is using a strategy of attrition not against the Ukrainian military force, but against the civilian force in an attempt to make President Zelenskyy have a lack of will to continue this fight. It's not working, as you just said. There's more resilience now in Ukraine than there's ever been. But, unfortunately, this is going to continue.",

Kind of what this says about the war. He also talked about the war as being -- I believe the word that he used is when you look at it being in a stalemate right now. And I -- it makes me wonder how does Ukraine break out of this, this stalemate moment? Do -- what can be done? What needs to be done?",

      "sentences": "Yes. Well, I don't agree with Secretary Esper on that. I don't think we're in a stalemate. There are certainly massive struggles going on in Kherson, in the Donbass, and it's a difference in approach like I just said in strategy between Russia trying to affect the Ukrainian people while Ukraine's army is trying to affect the Russian army and get them out of the country. That's a strategy of attrition, force decisions because you are defeating the security force of the enemy.So, this is certainly not a stalemate. But what needs to happen, you know, unfortunately, a couple of things. Russia has to run out of ammunition, which I don't see happening anytime soon. There are certainly indicators that are -- that they have less and less ballistic missiles to fire. But in this case, I mean, as an example, this weekend, those Kh-22 missiles that Fred was just talking about, indicators are, there's about 50 of them as part of their Black Sea Fleet that Russia can fire. They allegedly fired about 14 this weekend. So, you still have almost three-quarters of the ones left on ships and submarines in the Black Sea, as well as coming by air. So, it's going to continue. But what has to happen with Ukraine is they have to get an improvement in their maneuver force to continue to conduct attacks and offenses against the Russian military and continue to drive them out of the country. That's what you see. It is somewhat of a stalemate between types of strategies but I believe that Ukraine will have the power to continue their counter offenses.",

That's one thing that we have seen in this.And local Republicans have acknowledged that and saying that kind of their vetting process of new people who want to run, there are going to be fixed in place to make sure something like this doesn't happen again -- happen again. But still, in the face of this, I still am wondering with the more that we learned -- we learn, how this all slipped through? What do you think? CANZONERI-FITZPATRICK: I think that because this was typically a seat in 2020 -- and I have to say, Chairman Cairo of the Nassau County Republican club has been very candid about it. In 2020, we didn't expect there to be a serious challenge. Tom Suozzi was our incumbent, he was a very strong candidate. So, in 2020, I think he got by everybody simply because this was a person that was running without real backing and real expectation of being successful. And it -- and he wasn't. In 2022, I do think that you know, we took him at his word in 2020. He stuck in there, and he continued to work hard to become a candidate -- you know, to win his election. And it's very --it's not easy to know exactly how it happened other than, as Chairman Cairo has been very honest, most of the candidates like myself have typically had long roots in our party. And George Santos came from Queens. He was recommended by other people. We didn't know about his background. And that's the difference. And in 52 years involved in Nassau County Republican politics, Chairman Cairo has never seen anything like this, and neither of most of us so it's an unusual circumstance that popped up.",

It is clear that it's very hard to force a member of Congress -- to force a member of Congress out. Do you think it would make a difference if Kevin McCarthy himself would call on him to leave? Because at this point, he has not.CANZONERI-FITZPATRICK: I do think he would. There is a procedure where the House Committee on Ethics would have to conduct their own investigation. If they find that there's enough evidence, they could bring it to the floor of the House with a two-thirds vote of the members, they could expel him. But as you -- I'm sure well aware, leadership has to decide what comes to the floor of the House for a vote. And that's where we don't know what will happen. If these investigations turn up some hard evidence of criminal activity, I think Kevin McCarthy will have a hard time not bringing it to the floor for a vote.",

Just in the last hour or so, a couple coming out here and posting this red Cross, leaving flowers, and doing a silent prayer over this cross in honor of the victims, those that pass, and those that did sustain injuries. I did, Kate, also speak with Devin Willock's aunt and uncle who were fighting back tears, but they so wanted to get across to our audience who Devin was. And that's a kind-hearted person who had such a pure love of football. They called him a gentle giant. At just 20 years old, he's gone way too soon. And, Kate, for any parent, that would be a nightmare, something that should never happen having to bury your own son. But the grief is profound in this family because this is not the first time that this has happened. Devin's older brother, Jonathan, just a couple of years back, getting into a car crash and then later dying from his injuries.
