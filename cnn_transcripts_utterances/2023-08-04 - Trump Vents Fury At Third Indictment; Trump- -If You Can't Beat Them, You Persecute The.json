The trial against Donald Trump takes shape as a federal judge sets the date to decide when prosecutors will present their case. A timeline careening into a campaign and now the former president issued a plea to the Supreme Court.Plus, Kevin McCarthy auditions for a supporting role in the Trump defense. The House speaker unloads an angry tirade over the special counsel indictment. sidestepping the former president's election lies that led to a deadly attack on the Capitol where Kevin McCarthy serves. And made by Bidenomics. New CNN reporting spotlights the White House strategy to make sure Americans know their roads, dams and ports and the jobs attached to them, are thanks to Joe Biden. I'm Dana Bash. Let's go behind the headlines at INSIDE POLITICS. Up first, Donald Trump's anger and anxiety triggered by a looming trial for alleged election crimes. The former president's public posture is defiance. Today, Donald Trump made a demand that the Supreme Court get involved, but behind closed doors we were told Mr. Trump enraged by the third indictment, made clear that he was not happy with what happened inside that courtroom. What he sees as an insult from the judge who oversaw Thursday's historic arraignment. Let's talk more about that with our panel here to share their insights, CNN's Evan Perez, CNN's Katelyn Polantz, former FBI director, Andrew McCabe, and former federal prosecutor Elliot Williams. Happy Friday, everybody. It feels like a Friday. It's been a very, very long week. Let's just start with where Donald Trump left us after he was serving inside, when he came for the arraignment. And this is what he said to reporters. He was very brief, a very deliberate. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, 45TH U.S. PRESIDENT: This is a persecution of a political opponent. This was never supposed to happen in America. This is the persecution of the person that's leading by very, very substantial numbers in the Republican primary and leading Biden by a lot. So, if you can't beat him, you persecute him or you prosecute him. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And you could see some of that yesterday, some of our great reporters, including those on your panel, or inside the courtroom yesterday and noted that he did appear somber, that he did appear a bit dejected.And I also picked that up when you could see him speaking with reporters before boarding his plane back to New Jersey last night, following his arraignment. He likes to normally be defiant when he's speaking publicly. He likes to seem energized, even though we know behind the scenes, he's very concerned and frustrated about these charges. But he didn't really give a lot of that off yesterday. And you know, he is going to Alabama tonight. He'll be addressing Republicans there. And I do think he's going to try to go back to using the defiant rhetoric and the bravado that he often tries to use when he's talking to supporters. But it's starting to really weigh on him. And you're starting to see that bleed into the public a little bit more. Now, I also just want to point to some things that he's been saying today on Truth Social. He's been railing against these charges as he has been all week. But he also had an interesting point today about the Supreme Court. He said this morning, it is election interference, and the Supreme Court must intercede. Also in this Truth Social post, he noted that he's frustrated about how much money is being dedicated to his defense team. He said, \"my political opponent has hit me with a barrage of weak lawsuits, including DA, AG, and others, which require massive amounts of my time and money to adjudicate.\" And so, you can clearly see here how angered Donald Trump is by this and frustrated behind the scenes.

Number one, one of those people's the attorney general the United States, one is the director of the Office of National Intelligence and on down. And moreover, prior to that point they'd filed I believe, it was like something 62 lawsuits around the country, all of which they lost. And so, yes, there were a lot of ideas around the president.

Joe Biden won the election. And so, Biden's biggest vulnerability from a general election perspective is the economy. That's what a Republican strategist want to be talking about.
