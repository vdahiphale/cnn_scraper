      "sentences": "Well, Jim, and part of what we're seeing this week is a lot of visits to early voting states and we're expecting that in the next couple of weeks as well. These are gearing up this campaign, it's not just or the general election, which is what we've been talking a lot about with this trip to Michigan.But South Carolina, Iowa, New Hampshire, these are all trips that he's doing to shore up that support in those early voting states just because he is leading and it's a comfortable lead in those states, it's a comfortable lead in those nationwide polls, his team is very aware of the fact that when these conservatives are polled, even if they say that they support Donald Trump, many of them are still interested in alternative options. They're out here now really hitting the pavement, trying to get support, trying to rally up the team here, those people within the states. The other thing I want to point here is, of course, what you mentioned about Michigan, talking about general versus the primary. He is clearly esteemed looking towards the general election with this stop in Michigan and particularly looking towards these union workers. I am told that when he gives his primetime remarks just outside of Detroit, it will be to current and former union members as well as UAW workers who are currently striking and their families. And the thing to notice here is that the UAW has not endorsed in this race. Of course, in 2020, they endorsed Joe Biden. They have not yet endorsed in 2024. Donald Trump has been boasting about this on Truth Social. His team believes that while he has had complications with unions in the past, that he can sell himself as pro-worker, essentially turn on the Biden administration on their green plans, their electric vehicle plans, say that those are going to kill jobs and then say that Donald Trump himself is pro-worker. Now, whether or not that will work, of course, remains to be seen. But this is a group of people that in a general election, Trump does believe he can siphon votes off of. BRIANNA KEILAR, CNN HOST: Kristen, you're a pro. If it is that loud in her microphone, I can only imagine how loud it is in real life. We've been there and we know. Jeff Zeleny, it's interesting. We see there Trump is in South Carolina. He's got a couple of contenders, Nikki Haley and Tim Scott, who are from South Carolina.",

      "sentences": "Exactly. And Nikki Haley, the former governor of South Carolina and who served as U.N. ambassador in the Trump administration, she's been really gaining some ground. And she is now in second place in most South Carolina polls. She's been on the rise a little bit.So as Kristen was saying there, yes, the former president has his eye on the long-term, hoping to have a rematch with President Biden, but he has to win the primary first. And so there was a sense of, are they taking things for granted too much. But just the travel schedule in the last week or so, they're trying to knock down that idea by being in South Carolina today, going to Iowa on Saturday. He's trying to essentially stop the potential rise of anyone. But the Michigan trip is so interesting because in 2016, of course, the former president won Michigan. He beat Hillary Clinton there in 2020. He lost by more than 120,000 votes and even though rank and file union members, some supported him, exit polls show that he didn't fare nearly as well as Joe Biden did on union members. That's why this is so fascinating tomorrow, the visit from President Biden to Michigan and then on Wednesday, a year from now, depending what deal they get, God forbid the strike will be over, is this going to be a central piece of the map or is Michigan sort of turning blue as we saw in the midterms last year. So that's what happens tomorrow and Wednesday. It's actually really pretty interesting. And, of course, whatever type of resolution to the strike happens.",

It's because since the early days of his presidency, Biden has staked out a position that, unlike Donald Trump, he is not going to put his thumb on the scale of third-party negotiations, be they Justice Department investigations or independent labor disputes.And in this particular case, there's an independent labor board that currently has more than two dozen cases filed by the United Auto Workers that are currently pending. And that board is appointed by President Biden. But even so, the White House knows the politics of this are very powerful, especially with the endorsement from UAW hanging in the balance and that direct invitation from the union's president outstanding.",

Now, a lot of those Reagan Democrats are Trump Republicans, as we spent time there. But look, I think that they will approach it differently in the sense that President Biden - he has tools at his disposal to help end the strike or help negotiate. They've pulled back somewhat from that. The acting labor secretary and Gene Sperling, who's been kind of tasked with this. But the former president, for his part, on Wednesday, he's just going there to give a speech in a rally. And he has no actual skin in the game in terms of what he can do to resolve this.",

He did get very harshly rebuked by the UAW president, Shawn Fain, who essentially characterized Donald Trump as sort of part of this billionaire set that is profiting off of the labor of people like the auto workers.

And what he says and what his team says to me is that, yes, they understand that the president of the UAW came out and rebuked his trip, calling him a billionaire.But they're not trying to appeal to the president of UAW. They believe that the people that they are going to try to appeal to are the rank and file. They understand that, as Jeff noted, that traditionally Democratic union workers, working class union workers have voted Democrat. They know that they're not going to win over every single worker. But what they are trying to do is to paint themselves as pro worker and pro job and a lot of this is going to be focused on the Biden policies, particularly around the environment, those green policies, talking about electric vehicles. I'm sure you've noticed that Donald Trump, who speak regularly about electric vehicles just in the last several weeks, has started talking all the time about how they are killing jobs. That is all part of this strategy, to try to paint him as pro job, pro worker, to say essentially that all he wants is to keep jobs here in America. And just to give you an idea, I mean, just moments ago he continued talking about here in South Carolina how they were going to start drilling for oil again here in the U.S., that they wanted to be energy sufficient here in the U.S. Something obviously trying to appeal to his base here and talking about, again, getting the jobs here in the U.S. So this is something that he is going to be hammering home, particularly when he is in Michigan and particularly in the middle of this strike. When, again, they believe that this is a block of voters that they cannot win every single one. But can they just take some of them away from Joe Biden in a general election, that is where they're going to be looking at several different pockets of demographics and this is one that they believe they can get voters from.",

I mean, it's a risky gambit for them as well. They don't want to be seen as saving Kevin McCarthy. There's not a lot of goodwill there, especially after Kevin McCarthy launched impeachment. But some of them say that they would be willing to protect McCarthy if - and this is a big if, Brianna - if he's willing to make a good, big effort to put a bipartisan deal on the floor.

He also responded to the most salacious piece of evidence in that indictment, the stacks of cash found in his home.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. BOB MENENDEZ (D-NJ): For 30 years, I have withdrawn thousands of dollars in cash from my personal savings account, which I have kept for emergencies and because of the history of my family facing confiscation in Cuba. Now, this may seem old-fashioned, but these were monies drawn from my personal savings account based on the income that I have lawfully derived over those 30 years.

So he's trying to draw a distinction between these allegations and what his public record is.

Menendez met with Egyptian military officials in his official Senate office with only his then-girlfriend, now his wife, and an Egyptian-American businessman, Will Hana, who is also under indictment here.

Menendez may have been taking official action.These are, again, allegations. Sen. Menendez correctly points out he's innocent until proven guilty. The government has the burden of the proof here, but if it's as they say it is, which is that he was there, he had made promises to do certain things, that this meeting was about the things they wanted him to do and he or his now-wife were getting paid for it, that's obviously hugely problematic and inappropriate use of his office if the government can prove that.",
