It has been embraced by Trump and really across the entire MAGA movement as proof, they say, that the 2020 election was stolen. Nobody's been able to stand up the claims in this movie including authorities across the country and election officials who have investigated this. And Dinesh D'Souza, who is the creator of the movie apologized over the past week because one person who is seen in the movie on video surveillance footage, who the movie alleges is a so-called mule, somebody who is stuffing votes into a voter drop box to steal the election. That man sued, he sued the movie makers because he was not a voter mule, he was not trying to steal the election, he was just dropping off a ballot for himself and his family. He was a man in Georgia. So D'Souza, who by the way, D'Souza was pardoned by Trump, we should mention in Trump's first term as president apologized this week but still stands by, he says, the other false and bogus claims that are in this so-called documentary.
