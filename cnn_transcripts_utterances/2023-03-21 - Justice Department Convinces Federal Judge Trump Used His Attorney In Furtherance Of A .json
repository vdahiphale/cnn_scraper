      "sentences": "Good evening, everyone. I'm Alisyn Camerota. Welcome to CNN TONIGHT.We are following breaking news about the classified documents found in Mar-a-Lago. Sources tell CNN that a federal judge believes Donald Trump may have used his own defense attorney to commit a crime. That means attorney-client privilege would not apply and that the defense attorney could have to testify in front of a grand jury. We'll have much more on this development for you. We're also hearing new details about the inner workings of the Fox network from the lawsuit filed by a producer who worked with Maria Bartiromo and Tucker Carlson. The producer describes the toxic stew of sexism, misogyny, and anti-Semitism that she experienced inside Fox, including all the names that executives called Maria Bartiromo, like, quote, crazy bitch and menopausal. And why Tucker Carlson was so enamored of photos of Nancy Pelosi in a bathing suit. We'll explain. This producer also alleges that she was coached by fox lawyers to give misleading testimony in the dominion lawsuit. Plus, we'll talk about law enforcement seeing in uptick and violent chatter online from right-wing extremists about a possible indictment against Donald Trump. We'll find out if it's any different than what they heard right before January 6th. And about those hush money payments, Donald Trump's lawyer is now saying something very different than he did on this very program back in 2018. We will play with you Joe Tacopina now arguing against Joe Tacopina and then. And here's a question for you. Did A.I. create this photo of? We have a quiz to test my panelists and your A.I. knowledge. And we'll tell you the secret to how you can spot what is A.I. and what is not. So, let's get to all of the news. My panel is here. I have The Roots' Jessica Washington here, also Political Commentator Scott Jennings, former Massachusetts Governor Deval Patrick is with us, and former pro tennis player Patrick McEnroe. But, first let's get to our breaking news. A federal judge believes that former President Trump may have used one of his own attorneys to commit a crime regarding those classified documents at Mar-a-Lago. CNN Senior Justice Correspondent Evan Perez is here with more. Evan, explain all this to us.",

But what this judge, Judge Beryl Howell, who has been overseeing these secret proceedings, is saying is that because what Donald Trump was involved in with his lawyer essentially may have been a crime, he no longer has the benefit of attorney-client privilege, and Even Corcoran, the lawyer in question has to appear before the grand jury, has to respond, has to answer questions from prosecutors. He can no longer say he can't blanketly declare that he won't answer questions from prosecutors because of attorney client privilege. This is the first time, again, that a judge is saying this. And so, that is a big deal. It now means that we may see Evan Corcoran have to appear in the next day or so before the federal grand jury in Washington.",

One deadline is at midnight and another one is at 6So, it appears that the appeals court wants to try to get to this and perhaps make a ruling and perhaps give some clarity within the coming hours. And, again, he might see Evan Corcoran, the lawyer for former President Trump, having to appear before the grand jury. Just to back up just a little bit, Alisyn, Evan Corcoran is an important figure in the investigation into the classified documents that were found at Mar-a-Lago, because, you know, he was involved in talking to the Justice Department about whether there were additional classified documents were there, which we now know, of course, there were. [22:05:08] And so the question is, was he -- did he mislead the Justice Department and the FBI based on lies that were told by his client, Donald Trump? That appears to be what the Justice Department is going for and why they want him to come in and answer questions to the grand jury.",

DEVAL PATRICK (D-MA):  Well, let me first say that I take no pleasure in a former president, any former president, being prosecuted, being subject to criminal indictment, potential criminal indictment. And I will say that the accountability of this president seems to be taking a long time. But brick-by-brick, the Justice Department is building its case. And this is a step forward and I think that accountability is essential. So, as I say, I take no pleasure. But I do think it's important in sort of a culture of impunity that we seem to have and that this president, I think, has lived in and even encouraged and flaunted for a long, long time, that this is an important step forward and a further indication that this case is being built and built well.",

And this is allegedly a crime that was committed in New York.We can't -- we don't parse out what gets investigated and what gets prosecuted in this country by what people are most interested in. We leave it up to prosecutors to determine when they have probable cause to believe a crime was committed and whether or not they have evidence to prove that crime sufficient to take it forward to an indictment.

To me, it's not that big of a deal in comparison to the other things that have been alleged against former President Trump. But that being said, wouldn't have been nice, Scott, to hear from some of these big Republican politicians over the last day, if they said, hey, we don't like this, we think this is a political witch hunt, but let's, as you said, Alisyn, let's wait to see what the evidence? Could just one of them have said that? JENNINGS:  Well, I mean, Don Bacon said. He is one of the more moderate members of the House. He held back. He said he was going to wait and see what the evidence is.
