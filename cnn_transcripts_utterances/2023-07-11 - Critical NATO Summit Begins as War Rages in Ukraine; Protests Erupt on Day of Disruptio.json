Bush proposed bringing Ukraine and NATO into NATO, along with Georgia in April of 2008, rejected by Germany and France, but with a NATO promise that ultimately Ukraine would be part of NATO.The Russians followed that up by invading Georgia four months later and Ukraine in 2014. And NATO did nothing. The United States did nothing. Now, they're saying, again, well, Ukraine will become member of NATO at some point. It's simply inviting the same lesson for the Russians to learn, that if a country isn't in NATO, it's vulnerable. Ukraine is fully qualified to be in NATO. It was in 2008 when Bush first proposed it. It was just as qualified as the Central and Eastern European countries that came in, in the 1990s and early 2000s. There's only one reason why NATO has a problem with Ukraine coming in, and that is NATO has a longstanding policy. It never invites into membership a country that's at war. Because to do that would trigger Article 5 of the NATO treaty and potentially put all of NATO at war. Nobody has given an answer to that objection.

I'm sure it has to do with F-16 sales. Personally, if I were in the Senate, I would still vote against selling F-16s to Turkey. They have not behaved like a good NATO member. They started down the wrong road by buying Russian S-400 air defense systems and it hasn't gotten any better over time. I'm glad Sweden is finally getting in, but we need to address Turkey as a separate problem. It's not that it's gone from being neutral.

There were attempts and negotiations. Those seem to have failed. Now, the government is pushing forward once again with this legislation. Now, they say it's watered down. The Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has walked away from some of the more controversial aspects of this overhaul, namingly allowing parliament to overturn Supreme Court decisions.

Think the problem here, though, is that it's very hard to challenge a decision by Judge Cannon to basically, quote, delay, unquote, the trial.It's not necessarily that much of an unusual delay. I mean, it's a complicated case. I think almost any defense counsel would be seeking to delay the case, and they're likely to succeed in putting it off easily to the point of the election.",

So, he is trying to have the benefit of that for his political purposes, but obviously try and pushing this down the road legally. But, look, he's always done this with all the legal cases against him. He's done a couple of things, rarely paid his legal bills, and tried to extend the illegal case as long as possible.
