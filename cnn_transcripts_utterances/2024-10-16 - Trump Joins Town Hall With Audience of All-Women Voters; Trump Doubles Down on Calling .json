That is why you are seeing Republicans say we need to make sure that IVF is available to families and these families rights are protected in the process.You know, a lot of people talk about the Alabama Supreme Court decision, but they don't talk about the context around that. You know, Vice President Harris loves to talk about context. But the context in that decision is rarely discussed. This case was brought by three couples who were undergoing IVF treatments. And the medical clinic and their provider disregarded their rights to protect their embryos and their future children. Their embryos were discarded because of the medical provider's lax provisions. And now they were suing for redress of grievances. And that is how this entire case came about. It was about protecting the rights of couples seeking IVF and making sure that they were protected.",

That doesn't sound pro-family to me. We need to make sure that everyone's paycheck goes further, which happened in the Trump years and is not happening now.
