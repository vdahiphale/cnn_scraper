Its day three of the four day truce between Hamas and Israel and the Israeli government now has the names of the hostages will be freed on Sunday.13 Israelis and 4 Thai nationals were released Saturday, but only after an hour's long delay threatened to up end the exchange. Following preliminary medical checks, all of the former hostages were taken to Israeli hospitals for care and to be reunited with their families. Well, the deal also called for the release of 39 Palestinian prisoners and detainees on Saturday. Earlier Hamas had stalled on releasing hostages in a dispute over which Palestinians Israelis were willing to release. Aid groups say 187 trucks made it into Gaza Saturday with food, water, fuel and medical supplies. It's only a small fraction of what's needed. 61 of those trucks reached heavily damaged Northern Gaza, the most trucks in one day since the war began. Elliott Gotkine is following all of this for you from London. A very good morning, Elliott the second hostage prisoner exchange completed but after a nerve wracking delay?",

And you can imagine the anxiety among Israelis as a whole and especially among the families of abductees who were due to be released all of those hours they were waiting to see if it was actually going to happen.In the end it did, and a further 13 Israelis were freed after 50 days in captivity, when they were abducted during Hamas's murderous rampage of October the 7th. They are now safely back in Israel. And that takes it to 26 Israelis in total, who have been freed so far by Hamas. This is out of a total of 50, which the agreement calls for at the same time, as you say, there are a further 39 Palestinian prisoners, women and minors who were released from Israeli prisons, that takes that to 78 out of 150 in total, who are expected to be released under the terms of this agreement. Now this delay apparently, according to Hamas at least was bought about over disputes over the amount of aid that was going into Israel into the Gaza Strip from -- into the Gaza Strip, excuse me, and also the identity of the Palestinian prisoners due to be freed. I think Israel was also a bit concerned about the identity of all of the Israeli captors being free. This particular concern I think about one of the hostages Hila Rotem is a 13 year old girl who was freed yesterday on Saturday by Hamas, but there was no sign of her mother Raaya. Now we don't know the precise details of the agreement between Israel and Hamas to the forces brokered by the Qataris. It's not been published. But Israel says that part of the deal is that mothers are not separated from their children when they are freed. And that is something Israel says that happened yesterday when Raaya Rotem the mother of Hila was not freed at the same time Israel saying its unknown where she is, and what happened to her. So that's something that's obviously causing more anxiety. And I suppose amid the joy of course among the Israelis and Israeli families of those who have now been reunited with their loved ones are of course, is a bittersweet emotion because there are still all of those hostages some 200 or so remaining in captivity with Hamas inside the Gaza Strip. But as we say, as we enter day three of this truce, it does seem to be holding, Laila.",

And when they're arrested without a warrant they're taken blindfolded and handcuffed.Their families do not know where they've gone. And oftentimes it takes 24 hours to 48 hours to even be able to locate what detention center they are in. And during that period children have said and have testified that's when they are experiencing a lot of torture, where they're being beaten, where they are being put in stress positions. They are not treated like children or afforded any rights as children. They are criminalized like adults and they're treated with the same brutality as adults.

What we generally do when I was still doing this in government, we are very direct with the hostage families. We lay out what the conditions are. And we continue to work the problem and try to find adaptive solutions. But you cannot put your faith in a terrorist organization. They are doing this because hostage taking works. You know one only has to look back to the 1972 attack in Munich. Israeli hostages were taken the athletes were killed and massacred. And two years later Yasser Arafat was speaking on the floor of the U.N. General Assembly with a gun belt on. So hostage taking works, Hamas knows that and they're using you know this is leveraged to buy time and to gain leverage with Israel.
