So, this is not a rerun of the last debates we saw four years ago.Of course, both candidates are significantly different in their own right. President Biden is 81 years old. Donald Trump is 78 years old. They would be the oldest president ever. But how this could change the rest of the campaign is certainly significant. Voters really have been watching this race with a good degree of reluctance. There's an exhaustion out there in America with the choices they have. But this debate tonight will frame these choices very succinctly. And Election Day is four and a half months away. The voting will begin in less than four months in some states. So regardless of all the changes in this campaign, we've seen a war in the Middle East. We've seen guilty convictions for the former president. Nothing has really changed the out -- the trajectory of this race. Tonight's debate, when they come face to face certainly will bring it all into stark relief. And it could have an effect on the next chapter of this race to come, Wolf. it",

She's inside the debate hall where history will unfold later tonight. Set the scene for us, Sara. SARA SIDNER, CNN ANCHOR &amp; SENIOR NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Wolf, this is where history will be made tonight. For a couple of reasons, actually. Actually, more than two. One of them is, as you have noted, that there's president and former president for the first time in American history are going to be debating one another to try to win their seats again. And secondly, this is the earliest that voters have ever seen a presidential debate in U.S. political history. Now, I want to give you some sense of what the debaters, these candidates, are going to be experiencing. So, I'd like to turn back here you will see there is where our moderators will be who you know very well, Dana Bash and Jake Tapper. They'll be sitting there asking the questions. The candidates will be sitting here -- standing here. They are not allowed to sit. They are not allowed to bring notes with them. They are not allowed to talk to anyone in their campaign, even though another first there will be a couple of commercial breaks for them to sort of stop for a second and try to get their thoughts together. What they will have is a notepad and a pen, and they will be timed very specifically. And here are their cues. I'm going to have Andy show you where they will be looking. Those cameras that you see over there will have lights on them. When the light is flashing yellow, it means that they have just 15 seconds to answer the question. It will then flash red, that means five seconds. And then after that, when that red light stays still, they will have their microphones put on mute. They have to stop talking. I do want to give you some sense, though, of what this room is going to be like. Because as you turn and look at the space here, this grand space, there is one thing you'll notice that you don't see seats. Because there will be no audience for the first time in a very, very, very long time. No audience in the room. Looks to have a real effect. And lastly, Wolf, and this is important. These two men have not been in the same room with each other. Never mind near each other since 2020 during another debate. They are so close that if they spread their arms out, they could touch one another just eight feet apart. They will definitely be feeling the heat as they stand there listening to one another's answers to the questions and then rebutting them. Wolf?",

You're in the CNN NEWSROOM.(COMMERCIAL BREAK) [11:38:43] BLITZER: While the candidates still have hours before they come face to face on the CNN debate stage later tonight, their campaigns are already lobbying searing attacks. This morning, for example, the Democratic National Committee is out in force here in Atlanta with a series of billboards attacking Trump over his criminal record. And take a look at this. Here's a mobile billboard that's on the streets of Atlanta throughout this day. CNN's Kayla Tausche has all the details on the president's media blitz and final preparations that are underway right now. Kayla, what are you learning?",

Kayla Tausche, here with us at CNN world headquarters in Atlanta.Also, today the Trump campaign is launching ads taking direct aim at President Biden's mental fitness and his record. CNN's Alayna Treene is live in the CNN debate spin room for us. So, Alayna, what is the Trump campaign telling you about the debate rules, for example, later tonight? ALAYNA TREENE, CNN REPORTER: Well, look, it's actually been really interesting, Wolf. Because at first, they were a little bit wary about the new debate rules and the formatting. We know that they had taken issue at first with the idea that the microphones could be shut off when the candidates a lot of time was up, and also that there is no live audience. However, it's been really interesting because, in recent days, they're changing their tune a little bit and arguing that it actually may be more beneficial to have the mics be able to be turned off and have no audience into that studio. That's because if you look back at 2020 during the first debate between Donald Trump and Joe Biden, Trump was very aggressive. He repeatedly interrupted Joe Biden. He at times didn't let him get a word in. And that actually led him to fall in the polls after that. It's something Trump himself acknowledged in a rather candid interview earlier this week. And so, his advisors have been telling me, look, perhaps having the mic shut off and also no audience so that he can't feed off the crowd. We know that Trump loves to take cues from the audience. Given that they won't have that either, they do believe that he'll be able to stay on message more. Now. I also want to just turn your attention to that ad that you mentioned. What I find really notable about this is we haven't seen the Trump campaign really put out any ads themselves on TV yet or really, since Donald Trump became the presumptive Republican nominee. I do want you to just take a listen to what one of these ads had to say. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

They've actually been trying to argue that they think Biden will be a strong debater tonight, that he will potentially come in jacked up, as Donald Trump has been saying, something that is alluded to, and has no evidence of Donald -- of Biden taking performance-enhancing drugs.However, this ad clearly kind of sticking more with the rhetoric they've used over the past year or so trying to paint the president as senile.

He could come back at him on Hunter.I think the best ground to fight on for Trump is obviously the economy, inflation, and immigration.

But that would give a spark in the current president to say, wait a minute, don't talk about my son. And every time he's on an opportunity to reflect on his relationship with his son, it does move Americans. It's something that people can relate to. I have heard, though from the campaign to your point, Scott, about immigration is that they're not going to run from that issue. They're going to lay out the facts. The reality is, is that border crossings are down lower now than they have been before the president took office because of the executive action that he took.
