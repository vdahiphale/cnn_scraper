      "sentences": "Hello, everyone, I am Zain Asher in for my colleague, Isa Soares. Tonight, the situation around Zaporizhzhia isheating up as Russia appears to be planning the evacuation of towns in the region. Then, CNN exclusive, Ukrainian foreign minister says a letter sent to embassies with explosives and animal parts are designed to terrorize. And even as Chinese officials claim to loosen some restrictions, new video shows the zero-COVID disaster, this video here, unbelievable. We'll hear from one person brave enough to protest measures like these. Ukraine says its special forces are carrying out operations behind enemy lines in Zaporizhzhia. One of the regions Moscow claims it has annexed. Ukrainian military officials say they've destroyed a Russian missile complex and a facility used to interfere with Ukrainian military and civilian communications. According to Ukrainian military Intelligence, Russia is preparing for a stepped up Ukrainian counteroffensive in Zaporizhzhia. It says that Russia is withdrawing its troops from some frontline positions and preparing for the evacuation of occupation officials which Russia denies. And Ukraine says that Russia is now preparing to evacuate civilians from several occupied towns as well, much like it did in the southern city of Kherson before it was liberated. Sam Kiley joins us live now from Kramatorsk in eastern Ukraine. So, Sam, just walk us through this. Ukraine is basically saying that Russia is withdrawing from key positions within Zaporizhzhia. What more do we know for sure here?",

But if we look at what we do know and what is really emerging as a pattern, first of all, we're seeing a number of special forces-type operations that the Ukrainians have claimed responsibility for, whether they involve people on the ground or precision missile strikes. A claim that doesn't matter because there is evidence indeed that some of these missile depots and other important strategic sites such as that communications note that you referred to that was blanking out the ability of local people to use the mobile phone system and attacking Ukrainian communications. That these have been attacks, and many of them destroyed indeed. There have been explosions seen from some of these attacks, even on the horizon. It's a very large explosion. At the same time, we do know even from Russian sources, that there has been the drawing up of censuses and the number of villages which was part of a consistent pattern from Kherson, essentially, the local authorities trying to figure out who is there and how to get them out of the area. And some of this is occurring, allegedly, in places like Nova Kakhovka, which is at the headwaters effectively, it's a dam that across the Dnipro River, that funnels freshwater into the Crimean peninsula. It was arguably one of the most important, strategic targets of the initial Russian invasion. It was captured very early on in their campaign when they captured the rest of Kherson City a bit later on. Because it is so important to send water into that part of the peninsula. So, we do know that we're seeing the evolution of something along that very long frontline that really has been in a state of stalemate for most of the last six months, long lines of trenches with each side firing back and forth at one another. But it does seem to be movement certainly on the Russian side, some of it back from the frontlines, some of it concentrating forces in particular areas at that frontline. And of course, the Ukrainians continue to talk about potential offensive there, also, perhaps part of the psychological operations. Although the pattern has been in the past the last six months, when they've said they're going to do an offensive, they very often do, Zain?",

However, when you speak to people in the street, you do feel that there's a bad feeling creeping in about many people, especially after those battlefield losses that the Russians have suffered over the past couple of months.

Of course,President Biden is saying that he would be willing to meet or to speak with Vladimir Putin, of Russia, if Vladimir Putin were seeking in some way to get out of Ukraine. Now, of course, the Russians are saying the exact opposite. In fact, the spokesman for the Kremlin Dmitry Peskov, he came out and he said that one of the big inhibitors to such a meeting, or such a talk taking place between the two presidents, is the fact that at this point in time, the United States is not recognizing what the Russians say are their new territories in Ukraine. Of course, the ones that they've annexed, of which, large parts of which they don't actually control, which is actually under Ukrainian control. And so it seems extremely difficult, especially since not many nations in this world have recognized those new territories. And certainly, the United States has made very clear that it believes that those territories have been illegally annexed by the Russians, and the U.S. says that they will continue to fund and aid Ukraine until Russia leaves Ukrainian territory. So, it seems as though, right now, the conditions for talks between the two presidents seem fairly difficult. However, both sides have said that they do believe that diplomacy needs to have some sort of chance. In fact, the spokesman of the Kremlin, Dmitry Peskov said that the Russians want to achieve their goals, which of course, are very difficult to really ascertain because they seem to keep changing. But they also say that they believe that diplomacy is the best way to try and do that, of course, right now, it really seems that both sides, and all sides, really, if you take the western nations and Ukraine as well, they are very far away from that happening.

The fact that the brains of teenagers aged over the course of 2020. DR. GUPTA: Well, you know, I think the most honest answer here is we don't know because we are talking about something for which there is little precedent. We've had pandemics before but, you know, at that time, we could not do these types of studies, looking deep on the brain with MRI scans. So, it is possible, Zain, and this is hopeful that maybe there would be a reverting back to more normal that you'd get some a reversal of those changes I just described. But we do know a lot of the symptoms that are associated with those changes in the brain. Some of them we mentioned, you know, anxiety and depression, which were going up even before the pandemic, but really accelerated during that time. And a lot of these what are called internalized problems or internalized symptoms, sadness, low self-esteem, fear, the difficulty with regulating emotions, social isolation, loneliness, things like that, that are all associated. Interestingly, they didn't see as many externalizing symptoms where you're talking about violence, and anger, and rule-breaking behavior. But I think you know, your question about long-term consequences, it's too early to tell. Some of these changes are associated to the same types of things you see with what are called adverse childhood experiences. Children who have adverse childhood experiences do see some of these same changes in the brain. But with regard to the pandemic and the virus and the stress from all of that, we'll have to wait and see these studies continue.",
