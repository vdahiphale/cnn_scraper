The president says, Donald Trump is responsible and warns that he'll go even further if he's back in the Oval Office. So how was the former president responding?Plus, tough and nasty or nice and calm? Donald Trump is testing out those debate strategies and asking his supporters to weigh in. Joe Biden spends the week behind closed doors with top advisers, preparing for the biggest night of the campaign so far. And the good the bad and the ugly, debate nights are all about the moments that can propel or to torpedo a campaign. I'll discuss with former top aides to both candidates. I'm Manu Raju in for Dana Bash. Let's go behind the headlines at Inside Politics. Three days from now, the CNN presidential debate is the earliest general election debate in modern political history. It could shake up a race that has been basically tied all year long. But the Biden campaign as promised and focused on abortion rights. And today marks the two-year anniversary of the Supreme Court overturning Roe v. Wade. Vice President Harris is speaking about abortion right now University of Maryland. Here she is this morning on MSNBC. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And that message, of course, is that abortion rights and reproductive rights have been taken away from people because of Donald Trump, and also that those very same rights could be eroded even further if Donald Trump were to return to the White House for a second term.Now, as you mentioned, Vice President Kamala Harris, who has really taken the lead role for the administration on this issue has just taken the stage at a campaign event in Maryland, focused on this issue where we expect her to once again warn that this is about fundamental rights being at risk. And then we also saw a new campaign ad by the Biden team released today that features a Louisiana woman who says that she was turned away from two separate emergency rooms in her state after she suffered a miscarriage at some 11 weeks of pregnancy. And she says in that ad that the pain that she suffered is the direct result of Donald Trump. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
