Kamala Harris and her newly minted running mate, Governor Tim Walz, hitting the ground in battleground states, the duo holding rallies in two critical Midwestern states, Wisconsin and Michigan. The whirlwind campaign aimed at energizing the Democratic base, which just a few weeks ago was feeling a lot less confident, the unity on display now though, running into reality. Harris tasked with repairing ongoing fractures among Democrats, including the divide over the Israel-Hamas war. Yesterday, the vice president was interrupted by a group who appeared good to be pro-Palestinian protesters. Here's how she tried to shut that down. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

That was because she was shutting down chants that the crowd had gotten into where they chanted, lock him up, talking about Donald Trump, of course.The battle for the Midwest engaged on both sides with J.D. Vance also making stops in Michigan and Wisconsin. This was his latest jab against his Democratic rival. When the United States Marine Corps, when the United States of America asked me to go to Iraq to serve my country. I did it. I did what they asked me to do it and I did it honorably and I'm very proud of that service. When Tim Walz was asked by his country to go to Iraq, you know what he did? He dropped out of the army and allowed his unit to go without him. CNN has reported that Walz retired two months before his unit received orders to deploy to Iraq. Joining me now, \"Politico\" White House reporter Lauren Egan, and \"Axios\" Capitol Hill reporter Juliegrace Brufke. Good morning to both of you. Lauren, let me start with you. Yesterday is in my view, is sort of the first day where this ticket actually faced some of the on-the-ground realities of what its like to actually be presidential candidates in the wake of this sort of honeymoon phase that Kamala Harris has enjoyed after the party breed this massive sigh of relief with what happened with President Joe Biden deciding to step aside. How do you see how Kamala Harris handled this? She's going to face more tough moments with Palestinian protesters in some of these events. The president faced them as well, and then she also handled the lock him up chants that showed up at his rally in Philadelphia as well. But again, these critical test for them, how are they handling them so far?",

The Biden administration has been very careful to say, were not involved in any of these Trump cases.But as for the pro-Palestinian protesters, that was super interesting. I think to some extent, she's still experiencing a bit of a honeymoon phase if we think back to just what President Biden was experiencing on the road, I mean, he could not get through a speech without every few minutes, protesters interrupting him. So the fact that this is the first time that this is really happened to her in a significant way, I think is notable and its sort of going away, speaks out of the Democratic coalition is trying to hold itself together and say, we might have all these different pieces to us. But we got what we wanted. Biden stepped down. We're in a feeling really good about things, let's just make it through November. And we'll see how long that that's actually going to last for.",

You can imagine how this could end up being super problematic for him. But again, he has been tested on this before. He's answered these questions before.

You know, the assumption had been there'll be a coordinated effort. We just don't know what's going on. That's the reality here.

This one valid until 1:00 p.m. eastern time today, this encompasses parts of North Carolina, but also spreading north into Virginia because this is where the storm is going to go. It's going to start to spread northward. We do have a tornado warning, two of the back-to-back right here, just north and west of Greenville, North Carolina. And again, you can see a lot of these heavier bands of rain really starting to spread into North Carolina not only in Greenville, but also around the Raleigh area, Charlotte also starting to get some heavier rain bands sliding in two. Now, another thing too is this is rain is the last thing these areas need. So you still have all of these floods he watches, and all of these red ones here are flash flood warnings. This one outlined here in white. This is a flashflood emergency. They've already had up to eight inches of rainfall ready. Now, there's going to be even more warning people to just be safe in those areas. Here's a look, of Tropical Storm Debby as it stands now, sustained winds of 50 miles per hour. So its come back down a little bit since yesterday, but now were really going to start to see that forward movement where it finally starts to take off and head in towards the mid-Atlantic as well as the northeast as we go through the rest of the day instead of the incredibly slow movement that we've really seen from much of the last several days. But even with that said, even with the faster movement, it's still expected to dump at least two to four inches widespread. Some areas could see up to six additional inches.",
