For some context here, Magill has been under growing scrutiny for her handling of antisemitism on campus, and that testimony that was offered on Tuesday was really the last straw here, mainly referring to that, or at least her inability to just unequivocally say that any mention of genocide of Jewish people would be against the Code of Conduct at the university. We should also mention that, you know, we heard from other university officials tonight, including one that we will talk about here in a few moments, basically trying to paint a clear picture of what he believed played out on Tuesday saying that Magill was \"overprepared,\" that she was over lawyered and essentially provided a legalistic answer to a moral question.

So I think people are probably going to have very different opinions, depending on where they stand politically, and how they feel about the Israeli- Palestinian conflict, et cetera, and that's a good thing, people should be having debates. They shouldn't cross over into violence, they shouldn't cross over into hate speech, et cetera, but within the sort of norms of human behavior, I think people should differ on their opinions and their conversations.",

He has pledged to go after his political enemies, investigate the press for treason, establish mass detention camps for undocumented immigrants and more. In \"The Atlantic's\" new issue, if Trump wins, it has devoted entirely to what writers imagine a second Trump term would look like if he wins in 2024. David Frum, our next guest, writes: \"A second Trump presidency is the kind of shock that would overwhelm all other issues. It would mark the turn onto a dark path, one of these rips between before and after that a society can never reverse. Even if the harm is contained, it can never be fully undone as the harm of January 6, 2021 can never be undone.\" And David Frum joins me now. David, your article is titled: \"The Danger Ahead.\" How dangerous would this be? DAVID FRUM, STAFF WRITER, \"THE ATLANTIC\":  Well, think of the first day of the Trump presidency, the day that he wants to be a dictator, from Trump's point of view, takes the oath of office. There are four sets of indictments heading his way, two federal, two state -- 91 counts. Also, the state of New York is pursuing a civil investigation that could result in the termination of all of his companies and that he and his family would be banned from doing business in the state of New York forever. Maybe those cases have already come to trial, or some of them have; maybe he's even had some convictions, but he is facing the prospect of a lifetime in prison, he be taking the oath of office. So what's he going to do about that? He has to, in self-preservation use the power of the presidency to shut down law enforcement? Now, one problem, that's what Richard Nixon tried to do in 1974 and was forced out of office for it. It used to be the case that it was a high crime and misdemeanor, something that made you resign. If you use the power of the presidency to shut down law, but Trump is campaigning on a promise to do just that.",

Those orders are probably illegal, and it will confront every military leader with the question, do I obey the order from the president, which is probably illegal, or do I disobey which puts civil military relations into chaos? Trump keeps invoking the Insurrection Act. That was a law passed during the first George Washington administration, when there were no police forces, no FBI.

You see that Trump easily beats both of them nationally, beats them - DeSantis by 30 points, beats Haley by 40 points.The comments that we saw today were perhaps the most promising sign that these folks actually recognize what's up, because they got to go after the former president if they want to beat him.
