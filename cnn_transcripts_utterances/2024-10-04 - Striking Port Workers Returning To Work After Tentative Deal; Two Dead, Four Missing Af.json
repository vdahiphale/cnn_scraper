They decided that they were willing to offer $4.00 an hour of an increase year-over-year on a six-year deal if the workers were willing to work under their current contract as they worked out the rest of the deal. And ultimately, what this did was get them a tentative agreement on wages but allowed them to work through some of the other nuances while folks went back to work. And that was so critical for these workers, in particular, though because they were not getting strike pay. They were not bringing in any money. And the longer this dragged out for the workers they were going without a paycheck. And then obviously for the overall economy the Biden administration did an analysis and found that if this strike last -- lasted two weeks this would have an impact on the October jobs report, which is the last jobs report that anyone was going to see before the election, and it could have an impact on the race for the White House. So there was a lot of pressure from all sides trying to make this deal happen.",

Yeah, there's going to be a little bit of a backlog at the ports obviously, trying to bring these containers off ships. But for the average consumer there is not a toilet paper shortage right now because of three days of port strike. But ultimately, this has to be ratified by the rank-and-file members. And we just saw with Boeing that their officials recommended a deal to them -- to the union -- and the union members voted it down. So we'll have to see what happens.

Iran's supreme leader is now vowing to respond with potential vast destruction. These threats are clearly not empty, as we've seen. So, Kim, are we closer than ever, in your estimation, to a sustained regional war directly between Iran and Israel? KIMBERLY DOZIER, CNN GLOBAL AFFAIRS ANALYST (via Webex by Cisco):  I think we're closer to a sustained tit-for-tat where everyone is on tenterhooks waiting for the next response. [07:55:00] Israel has vowed a response to the 180 ballistic missiles. So I think in the next coming days -- maybe early next week because we've got this Geostorm this weekend that could mess up communications and satellites -- but we're probably going to see them choose from hitting ballistic missile sites. Where they were launched from, where they're manufactured. And then look at what they did in Yemen this past week to punish the Houthis for firing missiles at Israel. They hit three different power plants and an oil port installation, which makes it harder to transfer oil, sell oil. That's the kind of thing that they're likely looking at to hit Iran with. If they hit Iran's secret facilities that is much less of an embarrassment to the regime because the regime could just tell its people it didn't happen. But if they hit the oil facilities of some manner or sort that creates a knock-on effect on the market and also, it's visible. It's hard to hide.",

They are already involved trying to keep the missiles from Iran from hitting -- from hitting Israel. But at what point will you see more involvement by the United States getting drawn into this? COL. CEDRIC LEIGHTON (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST:  Yes, Sara. I think the biggest point is exactly what Kim was alluding to, and this would be one of the things that also Matt Egan was talking about, and that is if there were a disruption to the oil flow we would definitely get involved if the Straits of Hormuz were closed by the Iranians or they attempted to close them. And if that happened the idea would be that we could get in there and try to prevent something like that from happening, kind of like what we were doing in the 1980s when Iraq and Iran were fighting and there was a huge impact on oil flows from the Persian Gulf at that particular moment in time. So that's the kind of thing that I would suspect we would get involved in. And, of course, all of the air defense and missile defense systems would be put in place not only to protect our assets but to continue to protect Israel as well.",

It is trying to crush it out of existence. They have tried this before with Hezbollah and Hamas but both groups regrew.Can this be solved militarily?",

I mean, there are certain things you can do militarily and we're seeing them in action, and that is the attacks on the -- on the Hezbollah leadership and on the Hamas leadership as well. But the ideology stays. These people have many reasons to feel the way they do even if we don't agree with what they are -- what they are -- the way they look at the world.So this is one of the areas where the Israelis are going to use as much force as they possible can. They're going to try to move the danger from Hezbollah north of the Litani River so it's less of an impact on northern settlements in Israel. They're going to do things like. But the ideology will stay. The group will morph into something else -- maybe a less dangerous version of itself but still a danger that Israel must contend with probably far into the future.",

      "sentences": "And it's very clear the involvement of Iran with Hezbollah where they stand side-by-side often.Kim, I want to ask you about an Israeli military doctrine laid out by an Israeli official around the 2006 war with Hezbollah called the Dahiya doctrine. It's named after an area of Beirut. Essentially, it allows for military to use disproportionate force when there is an attack on Israel and says the military should target not just military assets but other infrastructure and try to crush the economy that supports it, essentially putting civilians in the crosshairs. What do you make -- are we seeing this play out right now, especially when you look at what's happening in Gaza?",
