      "sentences": "Anderson, thank you very much.And good evening, everyone. Tonight, the nation is facing a situation that has never been contemplated, in its history before. A former President will sit trial, as a defendant, in the middle of his campaign, for another term, which means that jurors and voters will be deciding his fate, at exactly the same time. Donald Trump appearing virtually, in court, today, as a judge sets his trial date, for March 25 of next year. And in case you're wondering, that is 20 days, after Super Tuesday, six days after Florida, Ohio and Arizona, and one month before Pennsylvania voters go to the ballot boxes. The trial of course involving the 34 felony counts, related to the Stormy Daniels hush money case. Trump has pleaded not guilty, in that case. And also, tonight, Florida governor, Ron DeSantis, will announce his candidacy, tomorrow, in a rather unconventional way, appearing in a live conversation, on Twitter, with Elon Musk. We're already getting word that Donald Trump, and his allies, are making plans to upend that announcement. And Maggie Haberman will join us, in a moment. And just a reminder of how wide open and unpredictable these races are. Just take a look at the Republican primary polls, from this month, back in 2015. Marco Rubio and Jeb Bush both led the pack. Donald Trump, he's sort of just 3 percent, tied with George Pataki. And speaking of polls, fast forward to right now. New CNN numbers show that Republicans, they smell blood. President Biden's approval rating just hit 40 percent, the lowest number, since last summer. It is also lower than Trump's approval rating, at the same point, in his term. And joining me, tonight, is Senior Media Reporter, for Axios, Sara Fischer; New York Times Senior Political Correspondent, Maggie Haberman; Republican strategist, Rina Shah; and Democratic strategist, Basil Smikle. Sara, the fascinating thing about all of this, we knew DeSantis' announcement was coming. We didn't know it was coming in quite this way. An announcement on Twitter says both a lot about what DeSantis thinks, he has to do, but also, I mean, it says a lot about Twitter, and where that platform has gone, after all these months.",

You're seeing a slew of conservative personalities, now candidates, flocking to the platform.But if you think about Ron DeSantis, he's always been someone, who shied away from the mainstream media. This is a very strong signal, of what his campaign, is going to focus on, platforms that bypass traditional outlets, including Fox News, to speak to voters, directly. And one thing I want to note. Elon Musk hasn't come out endorsing a specific candidate. Of course, he's the CEO of Twitter. But, in the past, he said that he would endorse DeSantis, especially because DeSantis, from his perspective, is a younger, livelier candidate, compared to Joe Biden. Now, obviously, Donald Trump is not necessarily a young, agile candidate, compared to Ron DeSantis, either. But I think that it was notable, the other person that we're watching, in terms of Elon Musk, of course, is Tim Scott.

And the client, in this case, the former President, has access to those materials, but is instructed, under paying of penalty, for contempt, not to share that with the public. It's hard to answer your question in a vacuum. I don't know, what will be turned over. I know what the intention is. The government doesn't want there to be any adverse impact, on any of its witnesses, before trial. I would think there's probably enough room to maneuver that the President will not run afoul of the protective order. But who knows?

And the White House has offered revenue raisers. And that is not too unlike what we saw happen during the Obama administration. They said, OK, if we are serious about addressing this debt issue, or if we are serious about addressing a deficit issue, we have to address the primary drivers of the U.S. debt ratio, which are the 2017 Trump tax cuts, including tax cuts on things like yachts and private jets. And in order for there to be any sort of claim to a negotiation, there has to be a give-and-take. And, right now, what Kevin McCarthy and the Republican Party are doing is only going further and further, to the right, and more and more extreme, in their proposals.

A deal, the basic function of any deal is that one party may get one thing, and another party may get another. And if revenue raisers are not a part of that conversation, the question that we need to ask is what actual deal is even being proposed. And it is precisely because the Republican caucus refuses to concede, any single point, to the White House, that we are in the situation that we are. And that, it goes beyond the point that even President Trump said, during his administration, that using the debt limit, as a leverage point, or a negotiating tool, is absolutely ludicrous, and unacceptable, because the stakes are simply too high, to hold the entire U.S. economy, hostage. Particularly, if the Republican evaluation is a cynical one, saying, \"If we tank the economy, we'll expect people to blame the President,\" is reckless. It's irresponsible. It will hurt rural communities. It will hurt urban communities. It will hurt seniors. It will hurt kids enrolling in Head Start. All of these things could grind to a halt. And it could also include essential infrastructure issues, like air traffic controllers. The stakes of a deficit -- the stakes of a default, cannot be understated. The chaos that would ensue and the impact on people's everyday lives would likely be immediate.
