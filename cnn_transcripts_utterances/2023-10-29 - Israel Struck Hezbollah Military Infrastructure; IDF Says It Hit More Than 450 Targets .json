Also fire back and forth from Northern Israel into Syria where there are Iranian-backed proxies based as well.And we hear multiple times a day. One result of that is that many communities here in the north along the border are either under mandatory evacuation where many people have fled of their own choice, fearing those rockets, fearing those artillery blasts coming their way. My team and I, we found ourselves right in the middle of it along the Israeli-Lebanon border just a few hours ago. Have a look. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SCIUTTO (voice-over): Towns like Arab al-Aramshe along Israel's border with Lebanon are mostly deserted now. Evacuated due to fear of attacks by Hezbollah. Makes is one of the few who stayed behind, and from his roof he shows us where Hezbollah fighters attempted to cross the Israeli border just a few days ago. (On-camera): They broke through, they broke through the wall. (Voice-over): Minutes after we arrived, we see the threat is constant. Hezbollah shells fired from across the border land on the hillside just opposite us. (On-camera): We are on a border town between Israel on this side, and just beyond the fence is Lebanon. And as we've been standing here, if you see the smoke off in the distance, that is the result of Hezbollah artillery fire from Lebanon into Israel. You can see the smoke rising in the distance. And speaking to residents here, this is a regular event. It's happening every day. (Voice-over): Makes and his twin brother sent their families south for safety, but stayed behind themselves to protect their homes. The question for them and others like them is how long before this area is safe again. (On-camera): Does anybody talk about how long people will have to leave here?",

Minutes later Israeli soldiers block the road warning of more incoming Hezbollah fire. (On-camera): We're very close to the Lebanon border in Northern Israel, and soldiers have just blocked the road here in both directors. We can't go either way. You can hear mortar and artillery fire going out, that is going from Israel towards Lebanon. We've also heard artillery fire coming from Lebanon. And the concern is, the soldiers telling us, that there are possible infiltrations across the border from Lebanon by presumably Hezbollah fighters. And that's why the level of concern is so great. (Voice-over): The Israeli military is focused on Gaza, but the northern front now faces daily attacks. On Sunday a rocket fired from Lebanon landed in the city of Kiryat Shmona, setting this home ablaze. Hezbollah also claimed this strike on an Israeli tank a few days ago, with the IDF responding by targeting Hezbollah positions in southern Lebanon. All the while the constant exchange of artillery fire rumbles across the frontier. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

      "sentences": "Yes, very few details, Jim. And there's the sort of an ambiguity to precisely what they are doing inside the border at the moment. But I think we can see from where we know that they put a flag on a property close to the beach and the northern part of Gaza today that they have avoided so far, it appears, the dense concentrations of civilian populations.They haven't gone into Gaza City, which is a few miles from where they planted a flag. They haven't, for example, gone into Beit Hanoun which is just behind us close to the border of Northern Gaza. So they have appeared to sort of stick to a strip of land, a piece of land, a piece of territory, quite beachy, farmland, that they're not going to come across and come in direct conflict with a civilian population. We know that Hamas hides out in the towns. We know that the IDF today said that along the very northern border itself in the Erez Crossing, they discovered some tunnels built by Hamas that they engaged a number of Hamas fighters there, killed a number of them, wounded a number of others. Hamas for their part claimed that they damaged Israeli tanks on the Israeli side of the border. The IDF said that wasn't true. So it appears as if there is a sort of a holding pattern that is keeping the border in a sort of state of readiness, if you will, secure and ready for a bigger inflow of forces to come into Gaza. And at the same time, the presence inside Gaza staying away from the civilian population, which as we know is part of the phone call today that President Biden had with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The stress there on avoiding civilian casualties. But as you can probably here there in the distance there, Jim, very much like your day on the northern border the sound of artillery never far away. Fighter jets here as well this evening, still running missile strikes into Gaza as well -- Jim.",

There's been discussion, right, of asking civilian residents to move south, south of Gaza City. Does that give us an indication that that's as far in as they intend to go, or have they left that an open question, that they might go even further? ROBERTSONyou a slightly different answer because I was speaking a former IDF general who's pretty well informed about what's going to happen or what's expected to happen. I was speaking to a couple of government ministers, and the expectation then was to really take control of the whole of the Gaza Strip to provide a humanitarian corridor for the population to be safe, and to be able to supply them but control them. And that was the sort of broad contours. At the moment it really isn't clear. What we can say is it's going to take a much, much bigger force to move south of Gaza City, which would be to that area you're talking about, that sort of divides the north and south, the dry river that divides north and south of the Gaza Strip. We are not seeing that big force come into Gaza yet. We are not even seeing it, as best we can tell, lined up at the border. So it's a possibility. Again, we just -- the Israeli government is playing this very, very carefully. They are creating the conditions whereby they can push a bigger force and expand that presence. But it's going to take a lot more troops than we're seeing so far, but if they want to do what they say, Jim, which is completely crush Hamas, they're going to have to go top to bottom, and eyeball everyone they come across. And this is why most people, most military experts say that is a mission too far. It's not something that they're going to be able to accomplish, so what's the fallback if there's one that's decided, not clear yet -- Jim.",

There are areas that we can't drive into because there's a military presence, and it's either too dangerous or it's just restricted access for the operational or military reasons. Those areas, there are very, very few civilians there. A lot of the farms, their workers have left. A lot of the kibbutz that are close to the border really become basesfor the military at the moment and civilians aren't living there. The people of this town Sderot were initially told pull out for about 10 days and then you might be able to come back. There's no timeline that they're getting at the moment -- Jim.",

We asked about that, and all that we know right now is that there was this report of perhaps a missing person.But obviously all pointing to a very troubling picture of clearly missed signs and things that perhaps law enforcement could have done had they been more aggressive in trying to take this man off the streets.",

They were worried -- there were worries and concerns that there could be a mass shooting. I just think that's extraordinary. PROKUPECZall of this came about was because law enforcement officials in this city all over Maine were aware of this information, and they can't understand and -- for days we're trying to figure out why officials here were not being transparent about it.

I'm Jim Sciutto in Northern Israel.One of the many sad facts of this war is that the people of Gaza have been cut off from the world, under direct fire, caught in the crossfire of this war, but also cut off from power, fuel, electricity, basic supplies. And for a length of time, really from all communication with the outside world. Those communication networks blocked. But today in part under U.S. pressure, there has been a restoration of some of those communications. Our Kevin Liptak, he's in Delaware traveling with the president this weekend. And Kevin, among many cases of the U.S. pressuring Israel, one, to protect civilian lives there, to avoid them as they expand their military operations there, but also to allow more aid in and now to restore some of that communication. How do they carry that out? How do they communicate that to Israeli leaders? And in simplest terms, how were they able to restore those communications?",

This is their country. They're making their own choices.Kevin Liptak, with the president, thanks so much. We are doing our best to cover the plight of civilians in Gaza. It's not easy. It's hard to get information out. It's been hard at times just to maintain communication with journalists, aid groups on the ground. But what we do hear and the images we do see are of immense human suffering there. I'm joined now by Rula Jebreal. She's a journalist. She's also a visiting professor at the University of Miami. And Rula, it strikes me that at the start of this the U.S. tried to strike a balance. President Biden, when he came to the region, his initial plan was to come here to Israel, meet with the Israeli leader and others, and then of course go to Amman and meet with Arab leaders. That summit in some respects, it was canceled as there was a strike on a hospital initially blamed on Israel. Where does the U.S. position stand in the region right now? How do Israel's Arab neighbors, how do the populations in this region view the U.S.'s role in this war?",

The region, 400 million people in the Middle East, with their government, they truly believe that this is not only an Israeli war, this is an American war.And I'll say why. $14 billion of military aid, unconditional military aid to Israel, and then even they would take the aid, which is military weaponry to be used in Gaza and the West Bank and elsewhere, yet they refused to take the advice. That means there's pressure only sometimes to get communication, maybe a couple of trucks here and there in Gaza, but really nothing beyond that. Secondly, our leaders are deeply frustrated that President Biden is not pressuring Israel to put two track policies, or two strategies. What Ami Ayalon, the former head of the FBI of Israel, said in order to defeat Hamas you have to give Palestinians something. This is what General Petraeus is saying. This is what he applied in Iraq and during the battle of Mosul, during the battle of Fallujah, which is to give -- to separate the extremist from the population, give the population help and their subjugation, and this is when you kill an ideology, not only militarily but really eradicate the root that galvanize and radicalize people. And they feel in the region that President Biden is not doing anything except lip service. And thirdly, President Biden sent warships, and this is a clear sign to the region that America will militarily deploy its forces to aid and abet Israel.",

And I applaud what his message was, it's time for the GOP to put someone in the GOP nomination that, as he says, appeals to our better angels, someone less toxic and more on policy and not personality and not attacking people for their character. I think that is the right message. But at the end of the day, he only had about 3 percentage points in the polls. Those votes are going to be spread across the field. DeSantis has a great deal of faith-based support, as well as Nikki Haley and Tim Scott. So I think Pence's support will be spread across the board. But, again, you look at those numbers, Donald Trump, in many of these polls is up 50 percent.
