Sara Fischer is with us, Miguel Marquez, Vanessa Yurkevich, and Jason Carroll. Also joining us with her D.C. reporting, Paula Reid.So, two big headlines in the news tonight. First, Mark Meadows testified to a grand jury in the special counsel probe. Of course, the investigation into Donald Trump. And also, Chris Christie, former New Jersey governor, announcing he is running for president, saying that he wants to stop his old pal, Donald Trump, from becoming the nominee. So, Paula and Sara are here with their reporting. Let us know with Paula. Okay, so, Paula, tell us what we know about Mark Meadows's testimony. Which investigation was he testifying for? Do we know?",

This has been one of the biggest questions in the ongoing special counsel investigation. What is going on with Mark Meadows?Even the Trump legal team has conceded that, yes, they had been in communication with Meadows's attorneys. It is unclear if he was cooperating. The former president tried, quite a while back, to block Meadows from testifying before the grand jury, arguing executive privilege. He lost that battle. We knew at some point Meadows would be testifying but it has literally just been a complete black hole in terms of reporting on what exactly what's going on. So, this was a huge deal today. This is a very significant development because he could be an incredibly useful witness in either investigation. He is at the center of everything on January 6th, and he appears increasingly significant in the Mar-a-Lago documents probe as well.",

Where does this recording come from? Mark Meadows's autobiographers. So, the questions are, all right, what are other things did they record as they were preparing this book? What else does Mark Meadows know? I mean, he is not just a witness, he is the witness.

And the message was that he is a guy who is hometown values but he is a traditional Republican. And it is a year after Bridgegate. You will remember it is time for some traffic problems in Fort Lee. That was what propelled Chris Christie at the time for the national stage.So, now, let's fast forward eight years. He is trying to run as a totally different person. Remember, in the first years of the Trump administration, Chris Christie backed Donald Trump, but it reversed after January 6th. And so, his message is interesting for two reasons. One, where he announced. He announced in New Hampshire, not his hometown in New Jersey. You will recall that in the last time he ran for the presidency, that was a really hard state for him to win. He backed out after the New Hampshire caucus. But then, two, his message was very anti-Trump, which is not what we saw last time. And so, I think Chris Christie is using this as an opportunity to try a different strategy ahead of this next election. The one thing that I will note, though, of course, any time anyone enters a presidential race, it's to win, obviously. But I think for Chris Christie, it's also to beat Donald Trump.

Once they have narrowed it down to their suspect, a man by the name of Matthew Nilo, 35 years old, they said, okay, what we now need is another DNA sample to match. So, they put him under surveillance. They followed him, he is now an attorney, to a corporate function. He took a glass, was drinking out of the glass, using utensils. They were watching him. He puts the glass down, he puts the utensils down. They take the glass, they take the utensils, they get their sample, they get their match, they make their arrest. So, this is incredible only because you see how something as innocuous as drinking out of a glass can eventually lead you, theoretically, to finding your suspect, right?

So, this man, Matthew Nilo, now responsible, according to prosecutors, for raping three women, in the attempted rape of a fourth women. You could see him there in court.
