And today it finally happened.And we were fortunate enough to be with them, these two Ukrainian lawmakers, as they drove to the front lines in Zaporizhzhia, where you've seen a number of prisoner swaps happening over the last few weeks. We drove into No Man's Land. There was an agreement between the Russian and Ukrainian side that there would be two hours of cease- fire. So it was a very eerie, tense, quiet. Really unthinkable to move in these No Man's Land areas under normal circumstances for journalists. But this was a very particular occasion. We then stopped a little bit short of the actual handover for our own security. And a small convoy with just a few military intelligence officers went forward, got the body, put it in an ambulance and brought it back to our -- to the area where we were standing. The Ukrainian lawmakers then identified the body. And they could see, after studying this case closely for a couple of months, that it was, indeed, Joshua Jones. And that body is now being taken to Kyiv. And from Kyiv, it will be -- begin the journey home to Joshua's parents, who obviously have been waiting and really longing for this moment -- Ana?",

He was just 24 years old.When he first announced he wanted to come to Ukraine to fight with Ukrainian forces in the foreign legion, his father told CNN he initially discouraged it, but that Joshua had said, what could be better than fighting for freedom? He had served in the U.S. military for a few years. And he arrived here, joined the foreign legion. Quickly found himself on the front lines and was killed in August alongside another foreign volunteer from New Zealand. But I think today's news is really just so important for the family. We spoke -- CNN spoke to the father, Jeff Jones, Joshua's dad, who said -- who was weeping on the phone, and said, you know, finally, we're bringing him back. And one can only hope and certainly the hope of Ukrainian officials who really pushed to make this happen is that this will offer them some kind of closure. But also make it clear how Ukraine honors the families and those volunteers who do come here to fight -- Ana?",

Michael, an attorney for Meadows says they plan to appeal the ruling. But first, what does this ruling signal when the judge says, \"Meadows is necessary\" to the probe? MICHAEL MOORE, PARTNER, MOORE HALL &amp; FORMER U.S. ATTORNEY: Well, I'm glad to be with you. I'm really not surprised at all to see this ruling. Essentially, the \"necessary\" language is something out of the judge's order when the subpoena is issued out of state. And so it allows for the court in Atlanta to issue the subpoena, the prosecutor in Atlanta, and then for that to be served on a witness who is not within the jurisdiction of this court. So is there has to be something moving for that. And you saw early on the D.A. did that. In her order, said these witnesses were necessary to the case and may have material information. So the judge is just tracking that language. I'm not surprised they're going to appeal at all. That's just a game to run out the clock and they're trying to run it out past the midterms to see if, in fact, you know, there could be some different -- I guess people would place. But it wouldn't necessarily affect the Atlanta investigation here.",

But that belongs to the current president not the former.So he does have information, specific information about the facts of the case and what he observed. And in particular, whether or not he was in the room and listening to that phone call between Trump and Raffensperger. There's a question on who knew whether or not the call was being recorded. Who might have known whether it was Trump, Raffensperger said he didn't know. This may be something to sure up another witness on the Trump side to say that he heard the call and he heard, in fact, what Trump said so that there's no question about the recording itself.",

Federal investigators are also trying to get testimony.Sources telling CNN the Justice Department is asking a federal judge to force Pat Cipollone and Patrick Philbin, the deputy White House counsel, along with the White House counsel during Trump's time in office, to testify as part of its January 6th probe. And prosecutors want answers about their conversations and interactions with Trump. Michael, Trump has been trying to block former advisers from testifying, citing executive and attorney/client privileges. But we do know two advisers to Vice President Pence were compelled to testify over the last couple of weeks. Do you think a judge will grant the DOJ's request in this case?",

      "sentences": "I think it's likely. Remember, we're talking about two different privileges, whether it's executive privilege that may apply to aides or attorney/client privilege. The problem that the Trump team has on this is that Cipollone andPhilbin did not represent Trump. They represented the presidency. They were White House counsel. And so that's public information that -- and a public client that I'm not sure that they're going to allow -- that the judge would allow their testimony to be shielded by the attorney/client privilege in this case. I think there may be times that they could testify about what they saw, what they heard, you know, other statements made surrounding certain events involving the election and certainly the insurrection on January 6th. There may be times when they pause and say, I can't answer that because it may, in fact, involve some specific attorney/client privilege matter. But that will be taken up by the judge. I think, at this point, it looks to me like the judges are moving ahead. The prosecutors are moving ahead. And it's very likely that Mr. Cipollone and Mr. Philbin will testify in the case. And I think it's probably appropriate at this point. And, again, a lot of these moves, especially for the federal investigation, are designed to run the clock out through the midterms in the hopes that the committee will be disbanded and there will be a move away from interest in January 6th. So I think Cipollone's been a fairly agreeable witness thus far. And I expect you'll see him appear in the investigation, the federal prosecution in D.C.",

At times, she actually removed him to a separate courtroom when he became particularly combative and disruptive. But last night, what we heard were the closing arguments in the case. And we saw somewhat of a different defendant. You didn't see the bombast. We saw him very emotional. He appealed to the jury to make the right decision, saying that he did not intend to drive through this crowd. Of course, the state's case all along was that this was intentional.
