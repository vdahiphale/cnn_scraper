In Arizona down here, it's a slight lead for Donald Trump 49 percent to 44 percent. Georgia, Nevada, Pennsylvania, all within the margin of error, no clear leader in those states.

That means they tell us they could change their choice or they haven't made a choice between Harris and Trump.And so you see here, 12 percent in Georgia movable, 15 percent in Arizona and Nevada. Let's move to the other three states. And it goes up to 16 percent in Michigan and Pennsylvania. That is not an insignificant chunk in close races to have as potentially movable voters.",

So, overall, among likely voters in all these states, the second issue listed as the most important issue or the one that ranks second is protecting democracy. And, again, if you look at that split out by the candidate supporters, it's a very low ranking issue for Trump supporters. But look at this. Protecting democracy is and I think that this is the number one issue for Harris supporters across all these states, even more so than abortion rights.And then I just want to show you the Biden factor in these states. I find this so interesting. So, these are likely voters. Those that disapprove of Joe Biden's job, so somewhere between 55 60 percent across all these states are disapprovers. His approval rating, we know, is hovering around 40 percent on average. But take a look here. 12 percent of disapprovers of Biden are going to Harris in Wisconsin. In Nevada, 19 percent, nearly one in five who say, I don't like the job Joe Biden's doing, they're still voting for Kamala Harris. She's going to want to increase her margins among this group of Biden disapprovers as she tries to separate herself from the president she serves in her day job, John.",

After the Supreme Court granted broad immunity to Trump for official acts he did as president, Jack Smith removed some references to communications between Trump and federal officials while Trump was still in the White House. That includes former DOJ official Jeffrey Clark and Trump's former White House chief of staff, Mark Meadows.CNN's Katelyn Polantz discusses this with me now. How could this affect sort of the state level charges against Meadows and against Clark?",

      "sentences": "Well, Sara, it may help them, or at least their attorneys are making quite clear in court filings over the past week that they think this helps them with the way that Jack Smith has filed the superseding indictment rewarded things against Donald Trump in federal court. But, Sara, our sources, there were several of us where we were talking to sources across the Trump universe, and there is a sigh of relief for a lot of people.Now, Jeffrey Clark, his relief is that he's cut out of the federal indictment related to Donald Trump, and so his attorneys are trying to use that in other things where he's trying to keep his bar license, and then Mark Meadows, the former chief of staff, he's cut back in the indictment. There were a lot of things that he had been privy to in the version of the charges against Donald Trump before. Now, he's just in a small part of it. What his attorneys are saying in his state case in Arizona, there's a court hearing coming up on Thursday related to that. They're writing to the court that it wasn't an alleged criminal act by Meadows. As chief of staff, he was carrying out his official duties, even if the president was engaged in official activity. And so his attorneys are making this bid that bubble of official duties around Donald Trump, that should extend to Mark Meadows as chief of staff. And when Jack Smith even rewrote that indictment last week against Trump, it phrased what Mark Meadows was doing a little bit differently. It called him specifically the chief of staff who sometimes handled private and campaign related logistics for the defendants. So, Meadows' team is looking to carry that forward as they continue to argue against his state charges in Georgia and in Arizona. And then there's a bunch of other people too affected who are no longer in the indictment and thus may not be witnesses ultimately if and when Donald Trump goes to trial in federal court. Sara?",

It's clear that the Russians are trying to go after a number of targets. So, there's the transportation and what they think is the, you know, the transport of vital supplies for the Ukrainian war effort.There's what happened in Poltava, Central Ukraine, yesterday, attacking a military academy causing more than 50 deaths and more than a hundred injuries. This uptick of attacks on the infrastructure, the grid, as they see winter coming, and they again want to cripple this nation's ability to warm itself and to keep itself -- you know the lights on throughout the winter. So, amid all this is this reshuffle that President Zelenskyy, in fact, announced in an address on television last night to the nation, and he essentially said that we need to get our best people, our best minds, we need to reshuffle to be able to assault, or rather to be able to deal with the next phase of this war. Dmytro Kuleba, who's been foreign minister since March of 2020, i.e. before this full scale invasion, and has been a real champion, for the narrative of his government for the message of Ukraine to the world, I spoke to him yesterday just before news that he attended his resignation. We'll get to that in just a second. But what he says and what the others say who are telling us that this is kind of pro forma, there will be resignations tomorrow, there'll be a whole set of reappointments as 50 percent of the cabinet will be either shuffled out or reshuffled and reassigned. So, we'll wait to see what happens to Kuleba himself. But I asked him about this latest uptick in Russian attacks, and I also asked him about the strategy behind Ukraine's Kursk invasion, which happened earlier, about four weeks ago. What was the point of it? Here's what he said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

We've completely reshaped the sort of strategic thinking in terms of being able to take Russian territory inside Russia. That's their point right now.And what we need are more weapons. We need to have the shackles removed from the usage of those weapons. We need to be able to direct them into Russia against targets that are launching the attack on Ukraine. And they say, we need more, obviously, given the ballistic missile, assault on these cities now, we need Patriots, we need air defense systems, and we need those now.
