The National People's Congress wrapped up its session just a few hours ago with the Chinese leader, Xi Jinping, consolidating his grip on power.In the first speech of his unprecedented third presidential term, m. Xi vowed to build the country's army into a, quote, \"great wall of steel\" and, quote, \"reunite Taiwan with the motherland.\" At the end of the parliamentary session, China's new premier, Li Qiang, held his first news conference since taking the post. CNN's Steven Jiang is live in Beijing following all of this. First of all, what were the takeaways from the news conference, Steven?",

But, you know, as he pointed out several times during the press conference, that he actually ran some of China's most economically- diverse advanced regions, including Shanghai, but also some of its neighboring provinces. And actually, before the pandemic, he was known to be one of the more pragmatic and business-friendly provincial leaders. So he really highlighted that, and reassuring reporters and, indeed, the nation and the world at a time when he's now in charge of the world's second largest economy, as it faces a lot of strong headwinds, both domestically, and internationally. But the issue here, of course, is Michael, this in today's China political -- Chinese political environment, it is a very much a one- man show. Even the premiership, the power, the influence has been greatly diminished, because all the key decision-making has been -- been concentrated in the party amongst charging thing himself. So whether or not, you know, Li Qiang's closeness to Xi would make any difference remains to be seen. Now Li Qiang did refer to Xi Jinping's remarks in the past week, in terms of offering more encouraging supportive words to -- to the private sector, but obviously Xi's own policies in the past few years did not point to that direction. And if there's one thing clear out of this session of the legislators, that is Xi's overarching theme or policy of reasserting the Communist Party's control of dominance in every aspect of Chinese society, including the economy. That very much remains the same.",

Officials said they were not wearing life jackets.The BBC continues to face criticism from all sides, including a growing boycott of its flagship football show, \"Match of the Day,\" as long-time presenter Gary Lineker remains suspended for criticizing a new U.K. policy on asylum seekers. The network is now airing a scaled-back version of the popular program, while it tries to defend its impartiality and figure out its next moves. More now from WORLD SPORT's Patrick Snell. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) PATRICK SNELL, WORLD SPORT ANCHOR/CORRESPONDENT: Well, the \"Match of the Day\" highlights program is a national institution that's been around for decades, and it's watched by about 60 percent of the British population. That's around 40 million people, if you take into account watching it via mobile technology. SNELL (voice-over): Gary Lineker is the revered and highly-talented former player, the leading scorer at the Mexico 1986 World Cup, and then turning his hand very successfully indeed to broadcasting after his playing career. But here's what else is in play here: the battle between impartiality and free speech. This past week, the British government announcing its controversial new asylum seeker policy, with the home secretary saying, quote, \"They will not stop coming here until the world knows that, if you enter Britain illegally, you will be detained and swiftly removed back to your country, if it is safe, or a safe third country such as Rwanda.\" In response, Lineker on Twitter: \"This is just an immeasurably cruel policy directed at the most vulnerable people, in language that is not dissimilar to that used by Germany in the '30s.\" The BBC, which is Britain's public broadcaster and bound by what it calls due impartiality, saying the 62-year-old presenter breached its social media guidelines by criticizing government policy. Lineker, seen in London on Sunday, out walking his dog, and in Leicester on Saturday, where he attended one of his former team's Premier League fixtures. So what happens next? Well, we've seen programming disrupted, with \"Match of the Day's\" replacement on Saturday night airing with no presenter, no pundits, and no match commentaries. While on Sunday, the BBC telling CNN it will continue to show football match highlights, without announcers or pundits. This after so many former players who act as pundits on the show came out in support of Lineker. And Sunday's \"Match of the Day 2\" show also following the same format as Saturday's programming.",

This time located across Southern Malawi and into central Mozambique, creating flash flooding conditions.This video tweeted out within the past day or so by the Malawi Red Cross, and you can see just how dangerous it has been across the region. Freddy actually originated early February just off the coast of Indonesia, traveled across the Indian Ocean, made three separate landfalls during its lifespan, and we're talking about over a 35-day period where this storm has been named. Incredible. Only four storms have traversed the entire Indian Ocean, Freddy being one of them. Now, one of its strongest landfalling points was when it reached the East coast of Madagascar. That was on February 21. Wow, this is coming off a very active 2022 tropical cyclone season for Madagascar. As it moved throughout central Madagascar back into the Mozambique Channel, it danced its way and made another landfall in Southern Mozambique, edged its way closer to Madagascar once again, and then curved right back towards central and Northern Mozambique. And that's where we find it now. It made another landfall on March 11, with winds of 150 kilometers per hour. And to put this into perspective, Mozambique only receives two to three storms of winds of 120 kilometers per hour or more per decade. And it did it at least once, with the first landfall actually being slightly weaker than that, but nonetheless, we still got that landfall and tropical cyclone with an excess of 120 kilometers per hour. Rain has been impressive there. They're accumulated over 100 millimeters in some instances, and unfortunately, there is more wet weather in store. That means landslides and mudslides will be possible across the mountainous regions of Malawi. Back to you. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

And this year at the Academy Awards, they had its highest number of Asian nominees ever.And you had the sci-fi surreal epic movie starring Michelle Yeoh, \"Everything Everywhere All at Once,\" leading the pack with 11 nominations. In the end, it took home seven Oscar statuettes, including awards for Best Picture of the Year. There was that incredible acceptance speech that we heard from Michelle Yeoh, who has proven that she is a superpower, especially to women of a certain age. Let's bring up exactly what she said when she accepted her award, her historic award for Best Actress. She said this, quote: \"For all the little boys and girls who look like me watching tonight, this is a beacon of hope and possibilities. This is proof dreams come true. And ladies, don't let anyone ever tell you that you are ever past your prime,\" unquote. Michelle Yeoh has a career that spans four decades. She was born in Malaysia. She spent many years here in Hong Kong before heading to Hollywood. Look, she starred opposite Jackie Chan in 1992 in \"Supercop,\" proving that she is a very capable actress and martial artist. In 1997, she was arguably the strongest Bond woman out there when she starred opposite Pierce Brosnan in \"Tomorrow Never Dies.\" She became an international icon a few years later with \"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon\" by Ang Lee, which also was an Oscar winner, and went on to star in many other huge movies. You know, you had \"Memoirs of a Geisha,\" \"Crazy Rich Asians,\" \"Shang- Chi,\" her entering the Marvel cinematic universe, and now, winning Best Actress at the Academy Awards for her role as Evelyn Wang in \"Everything Everywhere All at Once.\" But we also have to shine the spotlight on her costar, Ke Huy Quan, who won Best Supporting Actor. He was well-known as a beloved child actor. Of course, he starred in \"The Goonies\" and \"Indiana Jones.\" And then he played a more behind-the-roles scene [SIC], doing stunt choreography, assistant directing. But he has won the Best Supporting Actor Award. His back story is absolutely riveting. He was born in Saigon. He had moved to Los Angeles in 1979. But after he fled Vietnam, he spent time here in Hong Kong as a refugee, and he cited that experience in his acceptance speech. Let's bring it up for you. This is what he said. Ke Huy Quan, Oscar winner for Best Supporting Actor, he said this, quote: \"My journey started on a boat. I spent a year in a refugee camp. They say stories like this only happen in the movies. I cannot believe this is happening to me. This is the American dream,\" unquote. Michael, this is just an incredible moment, an incredible achievement for Quan, for Yeoh, for the cast and crew of \"Everything Everywhere All at Once,\" and an incredible moment for Asian representation in Hollywood.

Twenty-one years later, she's handing it to Michelle Yeoh as the only Malaysian-born Asian actress to win a Best Actress Oscar.
