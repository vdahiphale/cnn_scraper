U.S. commercial and other aircraft, private aircraft, and military aircraft can operate at those levels. It's close to the ceiling of commercial aircraft, of course, how high the plane can fly.The pilots they have gone up to check the objects out have said in some cases, their communications were interrupted. They said they've been difficult to see. They don't put out the usual signals to identify themselves which would allow transponders and most importantly collision avoidance equipment to work. And then, of course, every time one is spotted, aviation has to be moved away. There has to be a restricted zone and the military flights have to come out. So, it's obvious this is a hazard to aviation. And even if we weren't concerned about military implications, it's the operations are illegal under the federal aviation regulations, so we have to take them out. At this point, this is a hazard not only, you know, in terms of our national defense, but in terms of our civilian aviation. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

And according to this official, the Chinese handled these situation in a professional and responsible manner. So, it seems to be their way of suggesting this kind of occurrences was fairly common in the past involving both sides and it was the U.S. deciding to blow this out of proportion due to domestic and geopolitical considerations this time. That is the real danger here. But the Chinese did refuse to comment on the latest developments from the U.S. over U.S. and Canadian airspace over the weekend. They did -- not surprisingly -- condemned the decision to sanction six Chinese entities involved in country's balloon program. Which of course, according to our own reporting, is part of a sweeping global intelligence gathering operation run by the Chinese state. But there's one intriguing development, as you mentioned the Chinese also declined to comment, that is on Sunday, state media here quoting local maritime authorities as saying they have spotted a UFO off the coast of eastern China, and preparation was under way to shoot it down. Given the timing and given the Chinese military's previous threats to take similar actions after the U.S. shot down that confirmed Chinese balloon, as you can imagine the story went viral. But since the U.S. story initially broke out we have not heard much confirmation or updates from Chinese authorities or state media. But all of that silence, of course, fueling even more speculation as well as uncertainty and tension in this bilateral relationship -- Max.",

The largest flower district in the United States. If you look at everything we have right here, you know, really the theme of our reporting is that demand is still so high. Even though we have all of these inflationary pressures, just look at the activity that we have right here. All of these beautiful roses for Valentine's Day. You know there is, perhaps, a record that could be approached with Valentine's Day sales with all of these roses, the perfusion of flowers for this year. If you take a look at the graphic that we prepared for you, last year spending was just under $24 billion. But this year, spending is probably going to approach, according to the National Retail Federation, just south of $26 billion. So, demand and inflation certainly fueling that projected rise.
