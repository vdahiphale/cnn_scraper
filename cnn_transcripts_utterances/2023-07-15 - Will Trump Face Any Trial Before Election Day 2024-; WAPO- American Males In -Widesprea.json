There's actually a long-standing tradition, not necessarily in writing, but tradition inside the Justice Department called the 60-day rule. And the idea is you don't bring charges or take some sort of investigative step within 60 days of an election. And just to show you how sort of fluid that is, some people understand that as a 90-day rule. So it's sort of urban legend or long standing informal practice within DOJ. But the reasons for that are exactly as you just read in those A.G. letters.DOJ can never do anything that either is intended to or appears to be intended to influence an election. Now they're in a very difficult spot now because unavoidably Donald Trump is very likely to be part of that election.",

But if we play this through, in a practical sense, when are you going to try him. If Donald Trump has to stand trial, that's going to take minimum a month on any of these cases or pending cases. He has to physically be in the courtroom for that trial. This is not a civil case where you can skip out as he did in the E Jean Carroll. So there is going to be every month from now until November either primaries, debates, conventions, or actual ballots being cast. And that's why DOJ is in such a bind here.And by the way, I don't even think this 60 or 90 day, really rule really applies because the concern is well, you can't do it too close to an election. I mean, if Donald Trump gets tried in, let's say, February of 2024, people are still going to remember that come -- come November when ballots are being cast, that's still going to absolutely impact the election.",

      "sentences": "The most read piece at the Washington Post website for several days this week was not about our record here. It wasn't about the President's NATO trip or the election. It was an article by my next guest Christine Emba called Men are lost. Here's a map out of the wilderness. While admitting that yes, men still dominate business and politics and many other spheres of American life, Emba documents what she calls a widespread identity crisis.Among her supporting statistics, men now receive only about 74 bachelor's degrees for every 100 women -- awarded to women with women becoming increasingly selective, more single young men now live with their parents than a romantic partner. Men account for almost three of every four deaths of despair either from suicide, alcohol abuse, or overdose. The person whose own this issue both on this program and most other forms of media is Professor G, Professor Scott Galloway, as Emba puts it before quoting him in the Washington Post piece, \"On his podcast and in his newsletter, the author, entrepreneur and professor at New York University's Stern School of Business has made a specialty of talking about the crisis of unattached, rudderless young men, and helping them aspire to more.\" Well, joining me now are Christine Emba, ideas columnist for the Washington Post. By the way, she wrote the recent book rethinking sex, a provocation. And Scott Galloway, his most recent book is Adrift, America in 100 Charts. Scott, when we first talked about this months ago, here on CNN, you actually thanked me for my willingness to discuss such you said controversial subject. So now I'm wondering whether Christine's coverage and the enormous reaction means that the nation is ready to have this dialogue. SCOTT GALLOWAY, PROFESSOR, NYU STERN SCHOOL OF BUSINESS: This is -- this is a master class and how powerful journalism is. There's a lot of us out there and a lot of mothers and a lot of young men themselves and people such as yourself who had felt something and have been talking about it, and Richard Reeves really moved the ball forward with his landmark book of boys and men. But this one article, this sort of to -- to tour de force has inspired more dialogue, and emails and real serious conversation than anything that I've been exposed to over the last year. So Christine, and her good work speaks for itself. And let me just say over the last couple of years, the conversation has gone from one that immediately inspires a gag reflex, where people sort of see compassion as a zero sum game and feel that if you're advocating for men, somehow that's misogynistic, or not recognizing the immense obstacles that non-whites and women still face to something much more -- much more positive. And also, we're beginning to crowd out the terrible, quite frankly, unproductive voices that fill this void that was created because people felt the problem and were talking about it but no one was addressing it. And then some terrible voices entered this void in Christine's work. And I think other work is starting to crowd out some of those thinly veiled misogynistic voices and have a more productive conversation. A long way of saying I agree with you, Michael, and Christine's done us all a real service.",

      "sentences": "Yes, first of all, thank you so much for having me and thanks You Scott for your kind words I mean I'll speak to the enormity of the reaction first.I have been overwhelmed by how quickly the piece is taken off and you know how many people seem -- it feels like people were sort of waiting for someone to finally say it so that they could begin to have the conversation that they had been worried about for months for years. And as Scott was saying, people are worried about their sons, their brothers, in some cases, their husbands, I get a good amount of email but I've never gotten this much email from a single piece before. And, you know, we run our comments section, usually for three days. And the comments were shut down early because there were 10,500 comments on this one piece, which I cannot think of another article that's had that sort of response. So it really does feel like people are -- are experiencing this in their lives. They're --they're seeing their male friends and loved ones struggle, look for direction and not know where to find it. And, you know what? I -- I'll say that I -- I started thinking about this piece, actually you mentioned in my book, Rethinking Sex. That book was sort of an investigation of sexual and relationship culture after Me Too, trying to figure out whether sort of our changes in norms had worked for us if they had delivered what they promised. And I talked to a lot of young women for that book. But I also spoke to young men too. And it was from them that I found the most curious and saddening response. So many of them just seemed totally confused, you know, the sands had shifted beneath them, as Scott lays out frequently, the economy has shifted in a way that doesn't necessarily favor manual labor or skills where men used to dominate. Women are succeeding more in college and elsewhere, which to be clear is a great thing. But young men didn't know what they were supposed to be doing or almost what they were for, should I talk to women, maybe I shouldn't talk to women anymore because that's seen as toxic somehow. So instead, they were just retreating. They were, you know, staying in their rooms. They were instead of trying to ask real personnel on a date, they were watching porn, to feel like they were, you know, getting their power back. They would begin to look up to these figures like, yes, Andrew Tate, for instance, or Jordan Peterson and they just -- they just don't know what to do.",

I think that one of the push backs that I've heard to this piece, and to this conception of, you know, men being last men needing more care, is the idea that there isn't anything specific, excuse me, about men, that, you know, we should all just be good people. That there isn't a particular sort of set of masculine attributes or something called manhood that men specifically should aspire to. And, you know, so they say, well, why are we focusing on them, we should -- we should kind of focus on -- on everyone. And I think that's -- it's a nice thing to think. And I do believe that everyone is equal. But we have to think about, you know, what we see in real life, realistically. There are attributes to being embodied as a man that are different than those that you see being embodied as a female and actually being a good person means paying attention to those attributes, cultivating them where they're necessary, and figuring out how to channel them into pro social roles. And we can be clear and say that there are many models for how to be a good man. There's not one kind of good man, you know.But to actually aspired to be a good man is a good thing. And I think one of the places where, you know, sort of the progressive movement, especially has -- has sort of lost footing here is by constantly saying that masculinity is toxic. By constantly talking down to men, and you know, sort of suggesting that men are trash or men are scum, which is not aspirational, makes them feel resentful and eventually drives them to seek role models who, you know, sympathize with them, and give them a path forward. It might not be a good path, in the case of someone like Andrew Tate. But when it comes to looking for a model, if the choice is between nothing being offered or you're a bad person being offered. And hey, you're great men are great. They're definitely going to choose the latter. And we're seeing this in polling actually, especially in Gen Z, and we can see how this is going to become a political problem. Right now fewer than 50 percent of Gen Z men say that feminism has been a good thing for America. So we're already seeing this resentment coming from lack of relationships, lack of support, lack of positive role models, and it is really going to rip down -- down the line.",

More third spaces so people can meet national service so people can meet other people from different -- different economic backgrounds, different sexual orientations, and also different romantic partners. Also, also, men like you and me, Michael getting involved in youngmen's lives. The single point of failure, we can reverse engineer all of this, too, is when a young man no longer has a male role model.

Because, after all, there are children sporting Steph Curry jerseys, cars with bumper stickers promoting the baseball Giants, even some lavish gates on mansions emblazoned with the 49ers' logo. But the relationship between this cluster of villages 3,500 miles southeast of the Bay City, is far more unfamiliar.According to a voluminous report this week in the \"San Francisco Chronicle\" -- quote -- \"The valley is also the hometown of a high concentration of people who, fleeing poverty and a country with one of the world's highest murder rates, migrate to San Francisco, where they ultimately sell drugs, according to an 18-month investigation by The Chronicle.\" In San Francisco, since 2022, more than 200 Honduran migrants have been charged with dealing drugs. Roughly the same time period in which overdoses fueled by fentanyl claim more than 2,200 lives, 346 this year as of the end of May. That number does not include Honduran dealers who were previously convicted or never arrested. Many of the Hondurans responsible for dealing drugs in San Francisco come from the same families and have often grown up together. Quote -- \"While some current and former dealers said they struggled to eke out a living, others who sell drugs successfully told The Chronicle, they can make as much as $350,000 a year or even more if they help run a local operation. At least some of that money is then sent back to the valley's villages, where it is fueling a real estate boom.\" The sophisticated and wealthy drug dealing network from Honduras has taken advantage of San Francisco's sanctuary city status befuddling local law enforcement and contributing to the scourge of a city in decline. What to do about the Honduran connection? That's a key issue as a major city election now looms in 2024. Joining me now is \"The Chronicles'\" lead writer and co-author of this piece, Megan Cassidy. Megan, we show that photograph of the Honduran gate, the 49er gate. How prevalent is San Francisco, what would I say, insignia, or iconography, and why?",
