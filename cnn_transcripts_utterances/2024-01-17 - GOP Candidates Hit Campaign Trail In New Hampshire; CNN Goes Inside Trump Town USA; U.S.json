It is 5This morning, Republican presidential candidates making their pitches to voters in New Hampshire ahead of the primary six days from now and following Donald Trump's landslide victory in Iowa. The GOP frontrunner made a brief appearance in court Tuesday for his New York defamation trial. He's going to be back there today where the writer, E. Jean Carroll, is set to take the stand. In the Granite State, Trump was joined by Vivek Ramaswamy who endorsed him after dropping out of the race himself. The former president mocking his two remaining rivals, Ron DeSantis and Nikki Haley. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) VIVEK RAMASWAMY, (R) FORMER PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  It's good to see you. DONALD TRUMP, (R) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  What the hell happened to him, by the way? Man, did he go down. Ron DeSanctimonious -- did he go down like a rock. I don't even want to talk about him because I don't want to waste it. I do want to talk about Nikki. She was OK -- not great. She was not great. She's not tough enough to deal with these people. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

It's always good to see you.You are in New Hampshire after the Iowa caucuses. Give a sense of what you're feeling on the ground there. Trump is clearly trying to push against Nikki Haley. He's throwing everything he has at her, including -- you know, we shouldn't be surprised by this -- or we should still be surprised by this but it seems incredibly predictable as well from the former president. He used her given name, which is Nimrata, in this Truth Social post. He misspelled her name, which is something -- it's kind of a device he uses to be disrespectful. I mean, you've seen him do things like that before, whether it's mispronouncing or misspelling, or anything like that. What do you -- what do you make of Trump picking this time? I mean, this has always been her name. Why is he doing this now? SHELBY TALCOTT, POLITICS REPORTER, SEMAFOR (via Webex by Cisco): Well, listen, I think it's pretty clear that New Hampshire is Nikki Haley's best shot at really competing with Trump, and in some of these recent polls not just competing but potentially coming out on top. Now, I do think Donald Trump has some momentum heading into here just because of how strong his victory was in Iowa. But this is a very different demographic than Iowa. This is a demographic that really plays to Nikki Haley's strengths and that -- and we're seeing that result in the poll -- in the poll numbers. And so, what Donald Trump is trying to do, as you said, is throw everything to the wall. His campaign is working overtime in this state. He's on the ground more than we have ever seen him be on the ground this campaign cycle. And so I think that tells you a little bit something about how his campaign views her in this state, in particular.",

There was an interview that she did where she talked about -- she was asked about another TV host's statement that it would be hard to win as a person of color in the Republican primary -- a woman of color, specifically. She was asked about that. Here's how she responded -- watch. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BRIAN KILMEADE, FOX NEWS HOST, \"FOX &amp; FRIENDS\":  Are you a racist party? Are you involved in a racist party? NIKKI HALEY, (R) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  No. We're not a racist country, Brian. We've never been a racist country. Our goal is to make sure that today is better than yesterday. Are we perfect, no, but our goal is to always make sure we try and be more perfect every day that we can. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

You know, that's actually a really interesting point because again, it does seems like -- and if you dig into some of the polling that shows Haley within single digits of Trump it relies heavily on undeclared New Hampshire voters. To get to that number she would need those undeclared voters to show up for her.What is your sense of how that is playing in the context of -- and the Democrats don't have a competitive primary? Dean Phillips is in the primary. But the president's not on the ballot. He's had to mount this write-in campaign. And I know I've talked to some people who are a little bit nervous that Nikki Haley potentially being able to take on Trump in New Hampshire is something that could dissuade those undeclared voters from going and writing in Joe Biden.

And really, her argument -- her whole argument here in New Hampshire has been that she is going to separate herself from Donald Trump. She's going to be less chaos. That the country needs to move on. And that's an argument that a lot of undecided voters are being swayed by.

Up next here, after months of negotiations, senior lawmakers unveiled a $78 billion deal Tuesday to expand the child tax credit and restore several popular business tax breaks. The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities estimating that expansion could lift at least half a million children out of poverty when fully in effect. The three-year proposal is a rare example of bipartisanship on taxes. It would also boost subsidies for affordable housing, crack down on tax fraud, and increase disaster assistance. And while negotiators hope to pass that framework by the upcoming tax filing season they face several hurdles in an incredibly busy Congress. I'll believe it when I see it. And in a small Virginia town business is booming at an old church- turned storefront. It's known as the Trump Store. They sell everything Trump there. And as CNN's Elle Reeve found out, indictments are very good for business. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

President Biden meeting with congressional leaders at the White House today. They're going to discuss funding for Ukraine, Israel, and the southern border.

Officials now warning ships to avoid the Red Sea until further notice due to the risk of Houthi retaliatory attacks.

CEDRIC LEIGHTON (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST, FORMER MEMBER OF JOINT STAFF AT PENTAGON, FORMER DEPUTY DIRECTOR FOR TRAINING, NSA (via Webex by Cisco):  Well, good morning, Kasie. The -- at the moment, that impact is kind of hard to discern but it's very clear from the first series of strikes that they probably degraded somewhere around 30 or so percent of the Houthi's capability to attack shipping in the Red Sea. So that's a pretty substantial portion but obviously, it's not enough to stop that -- these kinds of attacks, and that's what's making the difference. So this is going to have to take some time before we see any noticeable degradation of the Houthi's capability to attack these ships.",

The Saudis and the Houthis had been engaged in a war over the past nine years. And the reason to delist them was basically to, in essence, allow theHouthis to function more or less normally but as a kind of a gesture of goodwill. The problem is they didn't take that gesture of goodwill in the spirit that it was intended. And it is one of those areas where what the administration has to do in order to properly prosecute the Houthis in terms of the war effort but also, more importantly, in terms of financing. That's why if they go back on the terrorist watchlist then it becomes something where they get financial sanctions posed against them. They also have an impact on Houthi personnel.

But Nikola Jokic and Joel Embiid is as good as it gets. And Embiid -- you know, he's the reigning MVP. Nikola Jokic is the reigning NBA Finals MVP. Jokic had 24 points and 19 rebounds as his Nuggets had a five-point lead heading into the fourth quarter. But that's when Embiid would just take over. The Sixers center scoring 10 points in a row. He gave Philly a nice lead. Embiid would finish with 41 points and 11 assists. He's the first opposing center this season to have more points and assists than Jokic in a game. Philly would win this matchup 126-121. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOEL EMBIID, CENTER, PHILADELPHIA 76ERS:  He's the best player in the league, you know. He's the Finals MVP. So I just told him keep going. I'll see you -- I'll see you in two weeks. Keep doing your thing and that's why you're the best in the league.",
