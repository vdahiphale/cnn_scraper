A Forum of Israeli hostage families calling it nothing short of miraculous.Israel's military says that commandos rescued 52-year-old Qaid Farhan Alkaid from a tunnel in Southern Gaza, and what it caused a complex operation. This was Alkaid a short time ago in a hospital in Israel with his clearly overjoyed brother by his side. His family ran to greet him after they got the news that they had been desperately hoping for.

He appears to be in good condition, although he does appear to be to have lost quite a bit of weight from when he was first captured. But this is only the fourth time that the Israeli military has carried out an operation to rescue hostages alive from Gaza. So, it is a quite a rare achievement.

So, it seems unlikely that this operation, or any other operation to rescue hostages, is going to be mentioned otherwise.The sticking points though, for the negotiations in Cairo, at least what we know so far is one the Israelis insist on maintaining a military presence along the Philadelphi Corridor that is the border between Gaza and Egypt. The Egyptians in particular, do not want that. They say it's a violation of the peace treaty between Israel and Egypt, and they want the Israelis to withdraw from that area. The other sticking point is that the Israelis want to maintain freedom of action in the Gaza Strip, as well as a corridor called the Netzarim Corridor, which bisects the Gaza Strip east to west, dividing the strip in in north and south. That is a non-starter from the -- from the Hamas side of things. So, despite the fact that American officials are talking about that, the sides are talking nuts and bolts. These are very big issues.

They are trying to basically drive down, or even narrow the margins, shave off some of the voters that Republicans can get to have a fighting chance in some of these precincts and counties.

This is going to be one of the very few opportunities over the course of the next 70 days to hear directly from her where she stands on some of these issues, like the economy, like Bidenomics, like the border wall, these are all things.

And so, I don't get caught up in this idea that doing the interview is a must, not a plus. In fact, I think she should continue doing what she's doing, meeting folks where they are.

I was told by a person familiar with the talks just yesterday that they were making progress down to the point where they're discussing the fine details of the names of Palestinian prisoners held by Israel that would be released in exchange for the Israeli hostages held by Hamas. That doesn't mean that they are overall the sticking points or final issues, but they are at least getting to that stage of these negotiations. So, the hope is that they get to the point where they can make a deal and bring the rest of the hostages' home, perhaps before the one-year anniversary.

Researchers have found evidence of tiny shards of plastic and tissue samples taken during autopsies from brains and other organs such as the kidney and the liver.The study only shows exposure to plastics and does not establish whether they're causing damage to the brain or other organs.

Plastic can seep into that food item, and once we ingest it, the microplastic particles can take up residence in our cells, especially our fat cells, and then travel to our organs and the brain itself for how it's 60 percent fat.So that's likely what we're seeing play out in this new research. I mean, like you said, it's early research, it's a preprint study, but what researchers did, they looked at those tissue samples from autopsies done in 2016 and then autopsies done earlier this year in 2024. And they found that the brain tissue contained 7 to 30 times more plastic than the tissue samples from the kidney and liver organs. And they found that the samples collected in 2016 contained more plastic than the samples that came from autopsies done earlier this year. So that suggests our exposure to microplastics is increasing over time, and microplastics themselves, they're so small, they're less than the width of the human hair.

And here in the United States, the FDA has said it's continuing to monitor research specifically on microplastics in foods and beverages, but something we can all do in our everyday lives to really limit our exposure to microplastics. Try to avoid plastic water bottles, don't heat food in plastic containers, because, again, that can lead to the plastic seeping into your food. Use paper or cloth bags instead of plastic bags, and try to keep just your general home environment clean by vacuuming and dusting often.
