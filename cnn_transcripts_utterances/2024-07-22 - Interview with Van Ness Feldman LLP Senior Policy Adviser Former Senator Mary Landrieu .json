There appears to be little appetite for a contested convention, and so far, no one else has announced their candidacy. So, how will these crucial weeks unfold? Let's go now to former Louisiana Senator Mary Landrieu, who joins us now. Thank you so much for joining us, Senator. As someone who sat for nearly two decades in the Senate, I'm wondering -- you have a bird's eye view, you still talk to these players. Tell us the internal reaction to this decision overnight from the president. On the one hand, not much of a surprise, still a huge game changer in terms of where this race stands. FMR. Sen. MARY LANDRIEU (D-LA), SENIOR POLICY ADVISER, VAN NESS FELDMAN LLP:  Well, it's been an exciting 24 hours. And most and many, many people that I talked to are so grateful to President Biden for his extraordinary leadership, a really unusual act of humility and courage. Clearly, in his DNA, he has always been that kind of leader, amazing, you know, thinking forward, putting himself behind the needs and future of the country. So, it's been a really exciting time for so many leaders that I've talked to in the last 24 hours.",

But just given his age and questions now, following that devastating debate performance, whether he could serve another four years. Well, that now all changes with Donald Trump being the oldest president candidate now on record. But that doesn't change how many Americans feel about the state of things right now, specifically the economy. And given that she is so closely aligned with President Biden, despite what the numbers are saying that the economy is strong, as you know, many Americans don't feel that way. What can she do now to change that and stand on her own while at the same time still being a vice president to President Biden?",

And the fact that he has done nothingbut lie and cheat his way into the White House initially and then try to cheat the election from Joe Biden when Joe Biden won it four years ago. So, now, his voters are concerned, just like Democratic voters and Republican voters are concerned about, do we have a future in this capitalistic economy where many people seem to be getting rich, but our families seem to be left behind? Women who have had to go to work, some of them because they want to, some because they had to, without enough childcare and support. These are real issues. I think Vice President Harris understands this. These problems did not start three years ago. And President Biden did a remarkable job to turn the ship around with the IRA, with the Chips Act, restoring manufacturing in America, but nothing can be done in four years. I mean, nothing of a complete turnaround, but he has started to turn the ship around, and I think she can continue to build on what he has done by picking a good, strong, you know, running mate and then building on the support of many Democrats, Republicans, and Independents in this country who do not want to see Donald Trump in the Oval Office again and who believe in a brighter future for America.",

I'm wondering, in your view, how soon do we need to hear from President Biden and his speech in announcement before the American people, obviously going into more detail and what we read from that statement posted on Twitter. We understand he's convalescing and sick now with COVID, but it is clear that the time is of the essence here, and she doesn't have that much time before she really starts campaigning in earnest.

I mean, this move is really fast thesedays, and she is not an unknown quantity to the American people. She's been vice president for four years. She served many years in California as a prosecutor. She's been a United States senator. We've seen her on the domestic stage. We've seen her on the international stage. So, she is a known quantity and very, very respected. And it's quite exciting to see this day. She could potentially be the first woman president of the United States. But she has a great combination of being able to run on the solid record of Joe Biden to be able to go head- to-head with Donald Trump, who, again, is just all about lies and deceit and he has no respect for the rule of law, and I think the American people are really tired of it, and they do not want to see that leadership in our country. So, she just has to steady the ship, move forward. We have plenty of time. Literally, we have plenty of time. I mean, today, in 24 hours, you can, you know, tell the whole world what you -- or what you're thinking, not like the old days when it did take a year or so to campaign. So, she's building tremendous support. And again, I want to just thank President Biden. He -- not many people have beat an incumbent president. He did that. Very few presidents have passed the kind of legislation that he passed in a very difficult polarized time. He's going to go down in history as one of the greatest leaders and most courageous and a combination, as I said, of courage and humility, which you cannot find anywhere in the Trump family or Trump himself. And so, I really am grateful, and so many of us are for President Biden and the work that he's done, and we look forward to him being part of the team going forward.",

The idea that you have an increasing number of prominent Democrats, elected officials saying that the president should withdraw from the race and the president saying, I'm in this until the end, was a formula for utter disaster. So, once that happened, you could just feel the relief around the country from Democrats and a belief that now they can pivot and change to something very different. It's also, as I was talking to many, you know, Chicago, where the convention is, of course, brings back memories for many of us, really vivid memories of 1968, a catastrophic convention for Democrats that almost certainly cost them the presidency. Hubert Humphrey got the nomination. But he came very close to winning. And if it weren't for the deep divisions that were demonstrated at that convention, we would have had very likely a different outcome. Now, Democrats can go from a convention filled with tension to one where, first, you're going to see probably a rapturous response to Joe Biden when he arrives there to give his speech, maybe greater than we've seen for any leader before. And then, you're going to see a unified Democratic Party. And that's an unusual thing these days, but certainly, after the last couple of months. Now, we have a different race and a reset. And of course, it will present a lot of additional twists and turns, and we're not done with the surprises yet, but it's a very different environment.",

If that's the standing that we have out there, if that's the frame, Democrats have a lot to overcome.

But I do want to ask you to weigh in on an argumentthat people like Ezra Klein have been making, and that is that Kamala Harris has been underappreciated over the past three years in this administration and hasn't been actually utilized in her -- to her full capacity, and that the times have changed from when she first joined this ticket in 2020 to where things stand right now. And then perhaps some of the awkwardness. I mean, listen, I'm reading a headline on \"The Economist\" here. Kamala Harris lacks charisma and time. People like Ezra Klein argue that one of those reasons is that we haven't been allowed -- or she hasn't been allowed to show her true self. And that is a tough on crime prosecutor that perhaps on certain issues is more right of center than she has been portrayed. And that now is an opportunity to her -- for her to really shine a light on her past achievements and her own personal views on certain policies. How do you react to that?",

      "sentences": "I think that's true in many respects. I will say that I thought she missed an opportunity early on in the Biden presidency when he gave herthe two portfolios of the border and democracy and the reaction that I heard from her staff was, why are we getting the tough things? That's what you want as a vice president to show that you're presidential. And she took a while to seize those. She has come on, I think, much stronger in the last year. The tricky part of this is that you can show your differences only up to a certain point because you are still the vice president to Joe Biden who will be there until January 20th. You cannot begin to frame a different set of policies that will contradict that of your own president. So, she has to tread carefully here and be a little more sensitive to those realities. Having said that, I actually think if you watched her out on the stump, she has some charisma. She is able to really capture crowds. She's very strong, articulate, she is able to take on issues and to take on Donald Trump. And if you've watched her, for example, now doing the post Dobbs portfolio, which has been hers, she has been very, very strong. I think one of the problems though, just circling back to what you said, you're going to see Republicans and their allies criticize her in the black community and elsewhere for being too tough on criminals. And then, you'll see them going back to other audiences and saying she was too soft as a prosecutor. You know, every case that she took there, every action she took in the Senate, all of the stories and the some of them rumors about her relationship with Willie Brown, who was her mentor, and they had a romantic relationship for a while in San Francisco, trying to portray her in a different way. She has to try to keep off the defensive and define herself. That is key, I think, up to the convention and in the weeks that follow it. If she can get a little armor of protection against the attacks that you know are coming, she'll be in a stronger place.",

Now, I think those are back, and she does have to focus on that big three, as you say. The difficulty there is that it's not clear how much a vice presidential running mate really helps with the state. I do think one exception to that would be Josh Shapiro, the governor of Pennsylvania, who's extremely popular there. I also think that Mark Kelly, the senator from Arizona, with a storied background and career as a military man and astronaut married to Gabby Giffords and going through that trauma with her would help in Arizona. Although, you then have a Senate seat that would have to go to another Democrat for two years before that seat is up.

Joe Biden has played an extraordinary role in the public life of this country for a very long time.In the United States Senate, in an extraordinary period as vice president of the United States, Senator Barack Obama, and as President of the United States. There are very few careers in American political history like that. And I also look at this presidency as one that was full of promise, much of which he fulfilled. It was an extraordinary presidency in many ways, and I think it's been viewed that way. And in many of the retrospectives that have begun to be written, including by critics who did not want him to run for re-election and did not want him to stay in the race, there is a recognition of what a successful president he has been at a particularly troubled time. It's not as if he took office in 2020 in circumstances that would have voted well for success across the board for what he had said he would do. And yet, he had extraordinary success. And he met with challenges both here domestically and abroad with verve, imaginations, said (ph) fastness. And what I think he is particularly skilled at doing, and that is building support for good policy. And always keeping in mind the values that I think people have detected at the core of his career and his presidency.",

As you know, the recently selected vice-presidential runningmate of Donald Trump views himself as a so-called post liberal. There's a whole lot to be unpacked in the way he describes himself and the ideology he articulates. It's fair to say it's nothing like what Joe Biden holds dear and has articulated over the course of his presidency. What I think it is fair to say, however, is it's difficult as this has been, and you pointed to some of those accomplishments. Joe Biden accomplished an enormous amount, and it's hard to imagine any other political figure in this period of time who could have done what he did, and I think there's a general recognition, as I said, even among critics that that is the case. So, I think in that sense, as hazardous as it is for us in the moment to protect what a legacy will be, I do think that would be very much part of his legacy.

There are ballot access deadlines that loom toward the end of August. And so, one of the rationales, the leading -- the key rationale behind the virtual roll call vote, that is, you know, the DNC has been working on, has been to ensure that there is a ticket in place to avoid any conflict with valid access deadlines. And then, the other point to be made is this, if the party is coalescing around -- and again, especially just my personal view, if the party is coalescing around to Kamala Harris over this very short period of time that we have, relatively speaking until the election, then it is better that we have a ticket that we could have confidence in now as early as possible so that the general election campaign can begin. Having an ongoing and potentially divisive debate within the party, I don't know that it will be divisive, but any ongoing debate with party delays the moment when the party can prepare to take on Donald Trump and J.

It's too late or it is late for them to do it.
