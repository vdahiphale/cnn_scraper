And the idea that it's being papered over and that the people that attacked the Capitol, rioted, that they're being talked as liberators, as prisoners now that are being unfairly treated, we are a nation of rule of law. And it just -- it does break my heart. I -- every day that I go into the Capitol, I go to the Rotunda, I think about what we saw on that day and how we should always commit to never having that happen again.

If, in 2024, Republicans don't act on their promises from the past election, they risk repeating the failures of 2018 and 2020. Elon's leadership could be the catalyst needed to push them to confront America's biggest fiscal challenges.\" OK, so there's that, and you have confidence in that.

And my argument to the Republicans on the Hill here, are America has stood up in 2014 and say they want to break through the establishment, the traditional bubble of Washington, D.C. They want a little bit of disruption. They want some fiscal sanity. And the way I put it is, they want to ensure that that compact with America, that families have to balance the budget, Washington has to balance the budget, and that reinstills some of the trust that this place has lost. Now, Elon, I think, is very unique, in that he's an engineer. I'm obviously very partial to engineers. He's always looking for efficiency in redesigning a system. You have to know how the system works, right, to -- otherwise, you're just going to be a lot of talk and nothing's going to move on the Hill. So he's got to build a team around him that understands what can be done with executive order, what can be done on the Hill. And it's about structural. If you just say, we're going to cut a program here and cut a program there and find efficiency in defense, that's fine, but it's fleeting. What they want to do in their opportunity with the political momentum of this election is to build something lasting with a balanced budget amendment, taking on, maybe not tomorrow, but understanding the challenges of Social Security are real.

I think there's a different team he's surrounded himself with, a little more professional of a team within the White House itself. He's built a lot of better coalitions. He's more established in terms of the political aspects of what he wants to do on the Hill. And he has outsiders.

The difference, however, the substantive difference and something we have to watch -- and I know that media and journalists will watch it more now than we did with Joe Biden -- is that he's 78 years old. The presidency ages you.

And I think Americans are going to get sick of it. I think Americans are also going to get sick of kind of what we're going to see, which is a repeat of chaos on Capitol Hill. We have already seen sort of that clash with traditional conservative values around the budget, for example, and raising the debt ceiling with the president.

And more Americans thought that Donald Trump would increase peace and stability in the world than that he would not. So you can start to feel the green shoots of optimism. And so when I look ahead to what he's going to do with the inaugural and what he could do in the first 100 days of his administration, I hope he senses that from the American people, hits the ground running and strikes the optimistic notes, because I think people are tired of having weak leadership that has taken us off in the wrong direction.
