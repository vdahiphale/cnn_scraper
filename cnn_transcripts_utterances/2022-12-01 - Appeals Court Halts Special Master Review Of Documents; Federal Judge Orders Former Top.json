A federal appeals court stopping the special master review of documents that were seized at his Mar-a-Lago resort. This coming as federal judge orders Trump's former White House lawyer and his deputy to give additional testimony in the criminal grand jury investigating the efforts to overturn the 2020 election.Plus, there are new developments tonight on the investigation into the stabbing deaths of four University of Idaho students. Coming up, we'll hear what police are saying about who else may have lived in the house where the students were found. I want to bring in former Obama White House senior director Nayyera Haq, also former National Republican Senatorial Committee aide Liam Donovan, and national security attorney Bradley Moss. Glad to have all of you here on a night like this. First of all, Nayyera, let me turn to you, because the significance of the judges saying, hmm, actually, you're not going to be treated in a specifically special way because you're a former president, you can't help but think about the idea of no one being above the law, maybe it's little more truth tonight. The idea of the indictment rule -- I mean, not being able to indict a sitting president, a former president now, what do you make of it politically?",

Until now, police have only released information about five of the roommates, three of the victims and two other roommates who were not harmed. A fourth victim, Ethan Chapin, did not live at the home. A spokesperson for the Moscow Police Department tells CNN investigators are aware of a sixth person who could potentially live at the residence. That person was not at the residence on the night of the murders. An employee with the property management company for the home tells CNN that six people are listed on the lease, but they would not release the names. It remains unclear if that sixth person lived at the property at any point. (On camera):  We asked police if they have found this potential sixth. They may question him and clear him as a suspect. All they can tell us is that they continue to investigate anyone who potentially has information about this case. (Voice-over):  Kaylee Goncalves's mother tells CNN -- quote -- \"Kaylee had never mentioned that they were looking for a sixth roommate. If there was a sixth person on that lease, I didn't know about it.\" But she also said she had never been to the home and didn't know the other roommates besides Kaylee's best friend and victim about it.

Usually, you're talking about a perpetrator who knows the victims or at least knows of the victims or has been in the house before.

So, there may be literally hundreds of items that have to be DNA-tested. There's more to DNA, by the way. There is fingerprint analysis, there is blood splatter pattern analysis, there is trace evidence analysis. But with DNA, if there is successful -- if it successfully done, you may see stains that have a single source, mainly from each of the victims, but you may also see mixtures. And mixtures are very, very important because if there are unknown profiles in a mixture, that is something that needs to be followed up on.

Where your people from?FOSTER (voice-over):  British media identified the palace official as 83-year-old Lady Susan Hussey, the late queen's lady in waiting for more than 60 years and godmother to the prince of Wales. Buckingham Palace responded quickly and unequivocally. The individual concerned would like to express her profound apologies for the hurt caused and has stepped aside from her honorary role with immediate effect. William and Kate touched down in Boston on Wednesday ahead of their three-day visit for the second Earthshot Prize awards, a prize they helped set up for advances in climate science. The fiasco threatens to overshadow any focus on environmentalism. Behind closed doors, the royals would be devastated that the issue of racism within the monarchy has reared up yet again. Speaking to Oprah Winfrey in 2021, the duchess of Sussex, Meghan, pointed to her own experiences of racism inside palace walls.",

Like William and Kate's recent visit to the Caribbean, when they were dogged by questions about the monarchy's colonial past, this royal tour has again felt the effects of history. (On camera):  So, what do the prince and princess think about all of this? Well, I think it's pretty frustrating. But they're doing as royals do. They keep calm, they carry on, they go to the engagements, and are still very much focused on the big event, which is Friday night, the Earthshot Prize, something that Prince William and Kate have been building up to for months, if not years.

Trisha, I'm so glad to see you. When you hear about what has happened to Ngozi Fulani, I mean, the repeated questioning by this woman, doubting really -- and her question alone, that she could not really just have the heritage of somebody from the U.K. or England, but wanting to know, that can't be true, I mean, we've seen this before. I know you and I have talked about this in the past. This feels like deja vu, but the persistence of it. What do you think?",

I think our mistake has been being lulled into a false sense of security that those days were over. There are some two and a half million people of color who see themselves as British. You only have to look at our soccer teams, for instance, and the stars like Marcus Rashford. Nobody asks him where he's really from when he scores a winning goal.But, you know, it's still a hangover from those days. And we have to remember, I mean, when we talk about institutional racism, we have to understand that the royal family -- elements of the crown that Camilla may or may not be wearing on her head, from countries in the past, Britain robbed and enslaved their people. So, there still is that. People can say, oh, that's in their past. I mean, my mother's maiden name was Fortune, a slave name. My great grandparents were born into servitude and what have you. So, it is not that long ago. So, this whole conversation of where your people from, Ngozi at one state -- I don't know. They don't keep records, which was to touch upon the, you know, the whole thing about slavery. We don't know where we came from. And yet this woman persisted. It's a difficult one to explain because it's also one of privilege. It's like, I'm allowed to ask these questions because I'm a proper British person.",

She was there believing she was being asked about the organization she represented, the idea of trying to help to stop abuse of women and girls.

If you look at the comments on some of these newspapers throughout this whole reporting of the story, if you look at the slant of the reporting of the story, and it depends whether that newspaper has been successfully sued by a royal as to how they bought it, but the comments underneath, many of the newspapers actually say that comments here have been moderated.",
