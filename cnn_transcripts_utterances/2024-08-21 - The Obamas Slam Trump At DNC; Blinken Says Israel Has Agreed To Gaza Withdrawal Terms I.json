Tonight, the stars of the Democratic Party comeout for Kamala Harris, but will the DNC live up to the hype when it comes time to vote. We are live for you in Chicago this hour. Plus, a diplomatic confusion. The U.S. says Israel has agreed to fully withdraw from Gaza, even though the Israeli Prime Minister reportedly said the opposite, this as more deadly strikes hit Gaza. And more bodies have been found after a superyacht sank off the coast of Sicily. We'll be live for you in Porticello with the very latest. But first, a month ago, few people outside the state of Minnesota had heard of Governor Tim Walz. Tonight, Americans will meet the former coach as he introduces himself to the world. Walz will formally accept his party's nomination on day three of the Democratic National Convention. The Harris-Walz campaign is enjoying a huge boost in funding, announcing it had raised a record-breaking $310 million in July, and will soon reach a total of half a billion dollars from donors. Former U.S. President Barack Obama and former first lady Michelle Obama really electrified the crowd on the convention's second night, slamming Harris' Republican opponent Donald Trump. Have a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

He is not widely known in the United States, althoughhe's the governor of Minnesota and he was a former congressman, most Americans don't know very much about him. Generally, people don't choose their votes in a presidential election, depending on who the vice presidential nominee is. But it's still a very important part of the ticket, a botched roll-out by a vice presidential pick can really hurt the candidate. So, Walz, I think has to make sure that he doesn't distract at all from Kamala Harris and her big speech tomorrow night. And to show that if the worst happens, he would be able to step in as president. The key now is for Walz and Harris to translate the momentum, the euphoria we've seen here, the successful roll-out of their campaigns so far into a more sustainable political force that can boost them all the way up to the November election, and really pose a serious challenge to Trump. There is -- despite the euphoria in this bubble in Chicago, this Democratic bubble, there is, I think a dawning realization this election isn't over, and that Trump remains very serious adversary.",

Harris has taken a very populist economic term. She repeatedly stresses the difficulty people have had paying for groceries, for example, over the last few years. And it's still very painful even though inflation has come down from very high levels. This was something that the President didn't really appear to understand or effectively empathize with people. So, she's definitely meeting voters where they are. Talking to important figures in the grassroots efforts for Democrats in the Harris campaign. They believe the most significant thing they've achieved so far is to change the perception of the election among many of their voters, some of whom especially younger voters, minority voters which are very important for example, in a place like Georgia. The election was not really worth them getting engaged in, that wasn't worth from voting. So, they've given themselves a chance. But one thing I would say is, Harris, despite putting on a polling spat, and in some cases moving into a narrow lead over Trump in national polls, she's still polling well below where President Joe Biden was four years ago, and even below where Hillary Clinton was polling in 2016. And Clinton, of course, no one needs reminding, went on to lose that election.",

Alayna Treene is keeping a close eye on the Republican ticket, and she joins us now from Washington.

The war between Ukraine and Russia, the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan and how Joe Biden handled that, trying to tie Kamala Harris to that withdrawal. We actually heard Vance himself discuss that earlier in his remarks. So, a lot of focus on that, but then also on border and the crime -- and crime, excuse me, immigration and crime. Those are issues that I know Donald Trump and his team view as larger national security issues. I think you'll hear Donald Trump walk through those as well. But I'll remind you that yesterday, Trump was in Michigan talking about crime. Tomorrow, he's also going to be in Arizona talking about the border. And so, this week is really -- you know, every single day he's been to a different battleground state with a different issue that his campaign is really pushing him to focus on.

One of the other things that we did specifically on that because there's so much talk about the ceasefires, speak to several members of parliament throughout the past couple of days about what they think, whether they think a ceasefire is possible. And all of them said they think a ceasefire is necessary, badly necessary, but they don't think that one is in the cards any time soon, because they don't believe that's specifically the government of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is serious about one.

And I will say this, that when Kamala Harris announced her run just a few weeks ago, which is important to remember, I posted a video sharing some of our videos from the 2020 campaign, which I worked on as the influencer and surrogate strategist. It was a video in which she says she understands the responsibility of this office, the historic nature of her run, and that young people, particularly young women and girls of color are watching. And so, I think when we look at any issue, we have to remember that this is an election about policy, absolutely, but this is also an election about character.

And so, consequently, I think people, they knew that there was trouble in paradise. It was just a matter of when they were going to make the announcement. But her walking into a courthouse and, you know, basically filing for divorce on the second anniversary of their big, massive, beautiful wedding that they had at his estate here in the State of Georgia felt like a statement. It felt like she was saying, you know what? OK, enough. It's time for me to move on and I'm ready to let this go. And it's sad. You know, there are lots of people who are hopeless romantics and have infants, you know, on the hopeless part of it because it just felt like from the very beginning people were questioning like the reasons why you guys split up 20 years ago, how have those reasons changed? And it feels like from the piece that we just watched, the little segment that you saw, they did have some very serious differences. She is very much a person who enjoys being in the limelight. She loves her fan base. She gives them a lot of her personal life on social media. Ben Affleck could not be more different. He is a very private person. He has publicly spoken before about the fact that he loves what he does, but he does not love the celebrity part of it. So, that -- the whole conversation about, you know, her saying, well, he can't stop me from my creativity and from my art, and he understands, you know, maybe that gave us a little insight into the fact that maybe he was not as understanding as she may have thought, or maybe, you know, there are other reasons. We probably will never know why their relationship did not work. But it seems like a lot of people are taking it to heart.

So, it's pretty much a waiting game at this point.

And I thought, oh, that's weird because I didn't ask him about Jennifer Lopez. So -- and at the time she was engaged to Alex Rodriguez. But then, shortly thereafter, they broke up.
