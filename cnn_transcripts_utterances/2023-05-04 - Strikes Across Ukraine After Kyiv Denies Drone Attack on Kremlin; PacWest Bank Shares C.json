I'm Christine Romans.We begin with what could be retaliation for Wednesdays drone strikes against the Kremlin in the heart of Moscow. Russia accusing Kyiv of trying to kill President Vladimir Putin with two drones, although the damage appeared minor and Putin was not in the Kremlin at the time. Ukraine strongly denies any involvement. A short time ago, attacks on Ukrainian cities, including Odesa, Kherson and the capital of Kyiv. One of the drones shot down over Ukraine today had the words for the Kremlin and for Moscow written on them. CNN's Nic Robertson live in eastern Ukraine. Nick what are we learning about the strikes on the Kremlin and what has been the fallout this morning in Ukraine?",

We are struggling with ammunition. So, a flat-out denial coming from Ukrainians.Overnight, of course, concerns how would Moscow respond to essentially to the Ukrainians appears to be completely trumped up allegations that they tried to assassinate President Putin. Over Kyiv, according to one Ukrainian official, the biggest fly of UAVs, attract drones and missiles they've seen so far this year. All of them shot down, though to be falling in the city. In the south, Odessa, 15 attack drones fired or sent to that region, 12 shot down, three landing on educational facilities. As you mentioned, only tail fence of a couple of those drones, written from Moscow, from the Kremlin. So, is that the Kremlin's response? Is this all of it? But the place that really bore the biggest brunt of Russian attacks yesterday was Kherson, in the south and east of the country. A town that Russia fears Ukraine might be used as a launch pad to launch its counteroffensive, 539 artillery shells fired on the city, 82 of them landing near the station, 23 people killed, 46 wounded, two of them children. This is by far since the beginning of the whole war, the biggest attack on Kherson, biggest devastation, biggest number of fatalities and casualties. Was that a part of the Kremlin response for this alleged drone attack on the president? Perhaps not. Perhaps this looks more like Russia trying to head off what it sees as a coming Ukrainian counteroffensive -- Christine.",

So, just -- it makes it -- fog of war for sure.All right. Nic Robertson, thank you so much. Nice to see you see. All right. To the U.S. now, investors fear PacWest may be the next to fail. Its shares fell by half in after hours trading. It was down only 2 percent at close. You can see there. But this big plunge came overnight after Bloomberg reported the regional bank is looking to raise capital to break itself up or possibly find a buyer. Now, that last option is problematic because according to Bloomberg, potential buyers aren't many around the block. Like other regional banks, the value of PacWest loan and bond holdings have evaporated as interest rates surged. That's what led to the failure of three other regional banks, SVB, Signature and just this week, First Republic. All right. To Atlanta now where the chaotic manhunt is over for a Coast Guard veteran accused of killing one and wounding four others in a Midtown medical building. Police captured the suspect 11 miles away at a gated condo complex in Cobb County. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Just last week, he was personally sitting in to witness some of the testimony of former Vice President Mike Pence at a grand jury looking at Donald Trump and the aftermath the 2020 election for possible federal crimes.That is not a typical thing. There are many prosecutors that work for Smith that are in and out of the grand jury, out of the federal court house, almost daily. I don't believe anyone has ever spotted Smith there personally, and he was in the room for some of the Pence testimony to witness it himself. Just underlining how serious of an investigation, how substantial a witness Mike Pence, the former vice president, was bringing him in under court order, under subpoena, to testify to that grand jury, potentially about his former boss Donald Trump. And Smith like I said has been very, very busy. He is busy in the coming days. We're learning not just related to the January 6th inquiry, is bringing in many, many witnesses and also having major allies of Donald Trump, people from the Trump Organization at its high levels, handling security, the chief operating officer are set to testify to the federal grand jury in Washington on Thursday. Those men, their names are Matthew Calamari Sr., and Matthew Calamari Jr., father and son. They are the people that would be responsible for the handling of surveillance tapes by the Trump Organization. And they are of interest right now we know because the Justice Department, Jack Smith and his investigators, they are questioning them and others about the handling of surveillance footage that the Justice Department wanted to obtain last year. It ultimately was turned over and showed employees of Donald Trump moving boxes in Mar-a-Lago at the resort, out of a storage room. But now, the handling of that surveillance tape itself when it was requested by the Justice Department has become an area of inquiry into a possible obstruction case, as well, related to Smith and his many inquiries on that side, the Mar-a-Lago documents case.

But it also means that you end up paying more for things like a new mortgage. A 30-year fixed mortgage was 4.61 percent back when the rate hikesstarted over a year ago. Now, it's 6.34 percent. So, what does that mean? On a $500,000 loan with 20 percent down, that is an extra almost $600 a month. Now, a new car loan at about 4.5 percent last year was the interest rate, now almost 7 percent. And on a six-year auto loan, that's another 63 bucks a month. Credit cards averaged 14.5 percent before the rate hike campaign began. And now, they are record high above 20 percent. So, if you pay just the minimum on a $2,000 balance, it's going to take you 11 more months to pay it off all because the fed is raising interest rates to try to lower inflation. All right.

So that may be factored in there. Banks in Europe are pretty mixed today. There is still scrutiny on that sector because of the continuing turmoil we're seeing in the U.S. regional banks. PacWest, of course, shares afterhours falling by about a half on that report, that they could be considering strategic options.

KRISTIE LU STOUT, CNN ANCHOR &amp; CORRESPONDENT:  Yeah, for this day, traders appear to focus on the positive data, it was a mixed day in Asia, shares across China actually edged higher after the Fed raised interest rates as expected by a quarter of a percentage point and then signal a pause in its rate hike campaign. If you look at the Asian trading day, that mixed picture. I should add that the Nikkei 225 in Japan was closed for a public holiday, but you can see the Shanghai Composite edged up stronger, 0.8 percent after the midday holiday, got a lift from robust holiday, big holiday spending in China has surged past pre-pandemic levels for the first time in three years. That lift also reflected here in Hong Kong as well. Shares in Seoul, shares in Australia, earlier declines. On Wednesday, again, for the second time this year, the Fed raised rates right after a bank failure coming just two days after the collapse of First Republic Bank, second biggest bank failure in U.S. history and the Fed has been raising rates to fight inflation, now although inflation is cooling in the U.S., still, it's more than twice the target of 2 percent. So, analysts in Asia are expecting more choppy waters ahead. We have this from David Chao. He's the global market strategist at Invesco Asia Pacific, based out of Singapore. He said, we anticipate volatility in the near term helped by uncertainty around Fed policy, concerns about hitting the debt ceiling and fears of more issues with regional banks, unquote. So, so also weighing on investors here, people are also concerned about the softening U.S. labor market. So a lot of anxiety still even though a mixed trading picture this day -- Christine.",
