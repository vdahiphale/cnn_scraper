So, for example, if Turkey attacks the Kurds -- the Kurds are our best partner to fight ISIS. They would be distracted from that fight. The Kurds are the ones who are guarding the prisons where there are thousands of ISIS fighters and tens of thousands of ISIS radicalized family members currently being held in detention. If all those folks got out, you'd be talking about a serious threat to the United States and our friends. So our goal is to ensure that we support the SDF, the Kurds, and that we keep ISIS in check. And that's why President Biden, right after Assad fell, ordered airstrikes against ISIS positions, because we are determined not to let them reestablish the kind of position they had 10 years ago.",

And then three years later, the American military was grinding it out in the wheat fields of Manitoba, having suffered 600,000 dead and wounded. Inflation at 10 percent, interest rates at 21 percent, mortgaging the economic and technological future of the country. Having to rely on soldiers from other countries to fill the ranks.Would you be telling me America was stronger in that circumstance? No way. Russia failed to conquer Kyiv. It's bogged down in Ukraine. Its economy is under massive pressure, and it is essentially putting itself in a position where its economic growth is stimulated entirely by the continuation of a war that is sapping it of an entire generation of young Russians. So, in my view, Russia is in a weakened state, and there is no better evidence for that than the fact that they could not come to the aid of their main Middle Eastern ally, Bashar Assad. Assad called out for help. Russia couldn't answer that call because it's weakened and distracted, and Assad fell, shocking the Russians.

But we've also heard over a much longer timeframe Donald Trump's belief that he should get a good deal for America and a good deal for America means we need leverage. And that leverage is continued military support for Ukraine. So I think the most important thing is for Donald Trump to send a message to Putin, the United States will keep backing Ukraine, Europe will keep backing Ukraine, until and unless you accept fair terms for a just peace.Putin has shown in the past he's willing to do deals as long as he feels he's under enough pressure. So I think Trump's got to keep the pressure on. And then I do believe a deal is achievable. But if we pull the rug out from under Ukraine, if we say we're not giving them anymore, if we accept whatever terms Putin offers, I think that that would end up harming America's interests in the long term in a profound way.",

I'm personally skeptical of the idea of a grand bargain, because I think there are inherently competitive aspects of the relationship, and we need to continue to take steps to strengthen our competitive position, not sell China advanced technology that can be used against us or our allies.Push back against China's economic practices that hurt our workers, push back against China's military aggression that's pressuring our allies. I think we're going to have to do these things over the long term, and there's not some grand bargain that's going to alleviate that. But what I do think that diplomacy between the president of the United States and the leader of China can do is create more stability in the relationship and create space for us to work together on issues that are in our mutual interest. Stopping the flow of precursor chemicals for fentanyl into the United States from China is one example of that. President Biden has made big strides. I think President Trump could carry that forward. Reducing some of the economic frictions between our countries to the benefit of our workers. That's something you could put on the table and deal between Xi and Trump on. President Biden has taken good steps to protect our workers. President Trump could build on that. But at the end of the day, the right recipe for U.S.-China relations is compete vigorously, keep open lines of communication, and then try to work together where we can and not let competition veer into conflict. That is the charge that we have carried these four years. That's what we're passing off. And that's what I think the Trump administration needs to carry forward.",
