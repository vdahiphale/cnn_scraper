The U.S. are directly engaging in striking targets inside Yemen in the early hours of Thursday morning local time in Yemen.

The U.S. officials say that they were targeting weapons storage facilities, including underground facilities. We know, of course, that the Houthis in Yemen have been targeting the Red Sea shipping route, have been targeting commercial vessels as well. And many of these attacks have been characterized by the Houthis as being in direct response to what we're seeing in Gaza. Much like we've heard from Hezbollah, both saying that they will continue to target both Israeli assets but also international assets so long as the war in Gaza continues. And, of course, we've heard from the United States saying that they will continue to back their allies in the region, wherever that may be, so including targeting Iran's regional proxies, such as the Houthis in Yemen.
