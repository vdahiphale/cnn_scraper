She was just sentenced to 8.5 years in prison. Sentencing for the other member, Kenneth Harrelson, is happening this very hour. This all comes one day after the group's founder, Stewart Rhodes, was hit with the most severe sentence yet tied to the Capitol insurrection. With a judge describing him as an ongoing threat to democracy, the unrepentant Rhodes was sentenced to 18 years in prison. CNN's Evan Perez is covering this for us. We also have former federal prosecutor Shan Wu to break down the legal aspects of this. Evan, starting with you, how does this Watkins sentence measure up with what prosecutors were calling for? EVAN PEREZ, CNN SENIOR JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT:  Well, the prosecutors were asking for 18 years, and -- but it's very clear that certainly the judge believed that Jessica Watkins told a story that certainly maybe got a little bit of empathy from the judge, because of the fact that she struggled through a lot. She identifies as a transgender person and served in the military, described how difficult that was for her and, really, at least in the end, finally said that she believed she now realizes what happened that day was wrong and that she should be punished and was willing to accept that punishment. The prosecutors were not buying it. They're citing some of her communications, even from jail, where she was making fun of the police officer, saying, boo-hoo, and saying that they incited the riot by attacking innocent protesters. Of course, that's not what happened. So, the judge, though, did recognize, again, that this is a person who has gone through a lot and really called out -- called out her conduct and said, you know, this is somebody who went through all of this -- all of this personal struggle and should have shown more empathy to the people who were working in the Capitol that day.",

I think federal judges often don't have as much experience sentencing people who have committed violent crimes. And he's really taking a careful look at these circumstances to distinguish. Now, I was a little bit surprised. I thought Rhodes' sentence was a little bit light, given that the prosecutors were asking for 25 years and given Mehta's very stern rebuke to Rhodes, saying, you're still a danger and such. A lot of times, with violent criminals, part of the point of a long sentence is having them age out, so they're less violent when they get out. But, with Rhodes, he's really a leader. It's not that he's personally violent. He's inspiring. He's talking and such. And that's the danger. And I think the judge, appropriate -- appropriately, is recognizing the distinction between that kind of a leader, mastermind of these things, versus the people who were still more the foot soldiers in varying degrees.",

What this case is about from the beginning, the Justice Department has said, was willful retention of national security information, the mishandling of that, right? If you're showing it to people who are not cleared -- the former president was no longer president. He had no right to have those documents, had no right to be showing them to other people who were not cleared to see those documents. Again, we're talking about highly classified things. The second part is obviously the obstruction part. And I think what the dress rehearsal thing that \"The Post\" is talking about is just the idea that, before the subpoena was issued, they were doing these discussions with NARA, with the National Archives, and that that whole episode where they were holding back documents before finally providing some boxes, that that was a dress rehearsal for what they ended up doing, again, obstructing an investigation.",

Of course, during that time, they were in the midst of a three-decade- long campaign to try to terrorize the British population and the British government into reunifying Northern Ireland with the Republic of Ireland. So, this document that we're talking about is a memo to the FBI director, and it outlines a potential threat from a patron at a well- known Republican bar in San Francisco that had some sympathies to the Irish Republican Army. And it says that the man had a daughter who was killed, he said, with a rubber bullet in Northern Ireland and -- quote -- \"claimed that he was going to attempt to harm Queen Elizabeth\" and would do this either by dropping some object off the Golden Gate Bridge onto the royal yacht Britannia when it sails underneath, or would attempt to kill Queen Elizabeth when she visited Yosemite National Park. Now, it doesn't give any more detail than that, and it's not clear what kind of follow-up there was either. It's also important to keep in mind here that this memo was marked priority, rather than the more urgent classification of immediate. It's also, by the time it gets to the FBI, fifth-hand information. So the man allegedly launching this plot told the person who called San Francisco police, who told another police officer, who told the Secret Service, who then told the FBI. But, of course, the fears here were not necessarily unfounded on the part of the FBI and the royal family. Of course, in 1979, Louis Mountbatten, the queen's cousin, was killed when a bomb was planted on his fishing boat.
