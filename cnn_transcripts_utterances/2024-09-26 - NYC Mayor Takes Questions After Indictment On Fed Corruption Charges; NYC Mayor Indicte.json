Although it is 10-month investigation, the charges as you read through the indictment and as they build this case. Elie Honig, it goes back many years, nearly a decade.",

      "sentences": "Asians in the indictment go back to 2015, and if you're wondering how that is, because typically, there's a five-year statute of limitations on federal crimes. It's because, I think prosecutors will say it's all part of the narrative. We're allowed to go back beyond five years to explain where this all came from, so long as some of the conduct occurred within the five year statute, which is certainly does a lot of the conduct occurred in 2023, 2022. Also important to note, Pam in this indictment prosecutors, and Ithink we'll hear this from Damian Williams in a moment, make a point that Eric Adams was continuing to do this. He didn't just do this to win his election as mayor back in 2021 but according to prosecutors, he was engaged in the same kind of conduct, the same kind of accepting of straw donors illegally from Turkey, looking ahead to his 2025 mayoral reelection campaign. So I think we'll hear that theme sounded when Damian Williams takes the podium in a couple of minutes. I",

And in the indictment, from what I read, the Prosecutors allege that Mayor Adams created a fake paper trail to they say, hide the benefits, the perks that he was receiving from these Turkish officials.

      "sentences": "Thank you, Damian. Good morning. Today, for the first time in New York City's modern history, we announced criminal charges against the sitting mayor of New York City. As our highest elected official, the mayor should set the standard for all of city government and exemplify the integrity, transparency, and dedication to serving the public that all New Yorkers deserve.Instead, the indictment unsealed today alleges that Mayor Adams abused his power and position for nearly a decade as Brooklyn Borough President and as mayor to enrich himself and his mayoral campaigns. As charged, he sought and received illegal campaign contributions, luxury travel, and other personal benefits from foreign nationals as well as individuals and businesses. He allegedly took steps to conceal those illegal contributions and personal benefits, and involved city employees and campaign staff in that concealment. As the indictment explains, this kind of corruption has real costs to the city and to the public. As alleged, the mayor's 2021 campaign falsely certified compliance with campaign finance laws in order to conceal those illegal campaign contributions, and as a result of those false certifications, received over ten million in public matching funds. The mayor's alleged acceptance and concealment of illegal contributions and personal benefits gave overseas benefactors, wealthy individuals, and businesses undue influence over the mayor, influence that federal and local laws seek to prevent. And as charged, in exchange for certain personal benefits, the mayor pressured the New York City Fire Department to forgo a required fire safety inspection before the opening of the new Turkish Consulate building. As the city's inspector general, the Department of Investigation, a city agency conducts its investigations confidentially and wholly independent of City Hall. We handled this investigation as we would any other, following the facts and seeking to hold wrongdoers accountable no matter their role or title. Our unique access to city records and expertise in matters of city government make us a critical partner in the fight to root out corruption, working closely with our law enforcement colleagues at the FBI and the U.S. Attorney's Office. If you have information about this case or about illegal conduct by any New York City official or employee, I encourage you to contact DOI by email at tipline@doi.nyc.gov or by phone at 212-825-2828. I want to thank the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York and the FBI for their partnership on this investigation. And I want to recognize and thank the dedicated, hardworking DOI. Investigators who are handling this matter, Senior Inspector General Eleanor Rivkin, Inspector General Audrey Feldman, Deputy Inspectors General, Arturo Sanchez and Trenton Sweeney and their supervisors, Deputy Commissioners Christopher Ryan and Dominic Sorella, thank you.",

Elie, they claim he took official acts by pressuring the FDNY tell us about that.",

      "sentences": "Exactly. So the challenge the prosecutors will have here, and you just saw the U.S. Attorney grappling with this, is how to explain this simply and specifically. And I think the SDNYs theory this case is laid out in the indictment is like this. Eric Adams, when he was mayor, and before that, when he was Brooklyn Borough President, took two types of benefits from Turkish nationals.First of all, he accepted campaign donations from those foreign nationals which are not allowed to do, which were funneled through fake or straw donors. Second of all, the indictment alleges that Eric Adams sought and received free business travel, discounted business travel worth hundreds of thousands of dollars. So that's the quid part of it, and then the quo, what he delivered in exchange for that is essentially Turkish nationals wanted to get this skyscraper called the Turkish house. It had been built. It was a controversial issue in Turkey. It was extraordinarily expensive. They wanted to get it approved to open by the time a group of Turkish leaders, diplomats arrived in the United States, and so they asked Eric Adams to pressure the FDNY, the fire department here in New York, to approve of the building quicker than they would otherwise there's a whole really interesting passage in the indictment, where it lays out Eric Adams texting the FDNY commissioner, leaning on him, pressuring him to approve the building, and then Eric Adams tells the Turkish interest, hey, we're going to come through for you here. So that's the gist of the allegations here. I think part of what you'll hear from Eric Adams, and we heard this from him earlier, is that he was just doing his job. What's wrong with the mayor or a borough official trying to get the FDA why to act more quickly? I think the prosecution's response to that will be, yes, but you accepted thousands of dollars, hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of contributions and personal benefits for that, which is what makes it a crime.",

Shimon, we know that there have been other people in the administration and the mayor Adams's administration who have been under investigation as well.The question is, are they cooperating? And also, there have been several search warrants executed, including just this morning at Gracie Mansion, where prosecutors or the feds have been able to take electronics. And you see some of what they have pulled, some of that evidence they pulled from cell phones, for example, in this indictment to help prove their case.",
