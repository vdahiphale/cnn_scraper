Tonight, Ukraine carries out a dramatic droneattack on a key Russian Naval base, we'll have Russia's response, that's just ahead. Then another 19 years in jail for prominent Putin critic Alexei Navalny. We'll have all the reaction to his latest court appearance. Plus, a record-breaking week, but not the good kind. Ocean temperatures hit a new high, and scientists are ringing the alarm bells. We'll have more on that in a moment. But first tonight, just days after Ukraine's president vowed to return the war to Russia, a drone attack has carried out dramatic attack really on the warship at a major Russian Naval base in the Black Sea. This video appears to show sea drones, as you can see there, speeding towards a dark and silhouette of an amphibious Russian landing ship. A Ukrainian source tells CNN some 100 Russian servicemen were on board when the drone slammed into the ship with 450 kilograms of TNT. The video ends abruptly, apparently on impact. The ship was later seen tilting heavily as it was towed to port. We don't know the extent of the damage or whether there were any casualties. Russia's Defense Ministry hasn't acknowledged the strike, saying it repelled an attempted attack on the base instead. Let's bring in our Nick Paton Walsh for more, he's live for us in Zaporizhzhia, Ukraine, for the very latest. And Nick, you know, as we mentioned at the top of the show, we've heard just a few days ago President Zelenskyy warning of the war coming to Russia. What impact do you think this will have on Russian morale even if they are denying it like we said?",

In fact, call upon to leap by one Russian military analyst in terms of what Ukraine is capable of, because Novarasiski(ph) is really on the farther side of the Black Sea. Something which Moscow would never have dreamed could potentially be a Ukrainian target when this war began and even perhaps a matter of months ago. And now we've seen the Kremlin hit by drones, Moscow's expensive suburbs hit by drones, its glass towers in its financial districts. And now, a waterborne drone referred to by Ukrainian officials as an unidentified floating object seems to have caused extraordinary damage. Here's what we know. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) WALSH (voice-over):  The footage is grainy and dark, then the target comes into view. Russia Olenegorsky Gornyak, amphibious assault ship, an unmanned attack drone approaches its target 450 kilograms of TNT detonates and the feed cuts out. Russia claimed to have repelled this attack, but the video tells a different story. Ukraine's counteroffensive has in recent weeks reached further and further behind the frontlines, forcing the Russian military to spread its sea and air defenses. Hundreds of miles from Ukrainian-controlled territory, this was meant to be a safe anchorage -- no longer. It used to be safe here, says one prominent military blogger, but Kyiv's arm has grown longer, the rear no longer exists, he says. ANDRIY YUSOV, UKRAINIAN DEFENSE INTELLIGENCE (through translator):  The fact that such unfortunate incidents occur one after another will certainly be something for them to talk about today. For the political leadership of the Russian fascist regime, this is, of course, a serious slap in the face.",

It is able to project a new sort of power, frankly, with attacks like this, extract an extraordinary cost on the Kremlin, we don't know the number of deaths. But judging by what one Russian blogger said, a whole compartment was flooded there, and you can see the list on that boat as it tries to get away to potentially be repaired.

Now, to deepening fears that Russia's war in Ukraine could draw in other countries.Poland and Lithuania are sounding the alarm about Wagner forces on the move in Belarus, saying it's an attempt by Russia to destabilized NATO's eastern flank. The Russian mercenaries have been training the Belarus army after entering, if you remember, the country, following the aborted rebellion against Russia's ministry leadership. Poland says some 4,000 Wagner fighters are now in Belarus, some moving closer to the Polish border. Poland is taking no chances, deploying hundreds of soldiers to the border region. It is also accusing Belarusian helicopters of violating Polish airspace earlier this week, saying it informed NATO of that breach. Polish and Lithuanian leaders met yesterday in an area known as the Suwalki Gap to discuss the threat. I want to show you now the stretch of land along the shared border. To explain why it has a huge strategic significance, if Russia or its proxies were able to get a foothold in this Suwalki Gap, they would have a direct land bridge between Belarus, a close Russia ally as you know and Kaliningrad, part of Russia itself. They could also feckly cut off the Baltic states from NATO allies to the south. The Polish prime minister is warning what he calls hybrid attacks. Have a listen to this.

But the West is more concerned about what his strategy might be for another presidential election. U.S. officials are telling CNN that Mr. Putin is factoring in the race for the White House into his planning for the war in Ukraine. As you just heard me discuss there with the deputy foreign minister of Poland. They say he is hoping President Joe Biden will lose, and that Americans will cut back on spending, sending military aid, of course, to Ukraine. I want to take a closer look with U.S. security correspondent Kylie Atwood. KYLIE ATWOOD, CNN U.S. SECURITY CORRESPONDENT:  U.S. and European officials are concerned that President Putin is factoring the 2024 presidential election in the U.S. to his Ukraine war approach, banking on the possibility that if President Biden loses that election and Trump or another Republican candidate wins the presidency, that U.S. support for Ukraine would decrease, and of course, that would benefit Putin. Now, this isn't a concrete intelligence assessment of Putin's mindset. But U.S. and European officials are very clearly behind the scenes saying that they do think that Putin is taking this into consideration, and it is effectively encouraging him to draw out the war past November of next year, 15 months from now. And of course, that drives down even the remote possibility of any near-term resolution here if there's an incentive for Putin to continue playing out this war. Isa?",

Now, look, August 28th is when we're going to learn when the trial date will be set. So, both sides are going to have a chance to make their arguments and their different ones. Jack Smith; the prosecutor in this case, he's already said that he wants a speedy trial, he wants this to happen quickly, whereas Trump's legal team is suggesting that they want this to be drawn out. They've argued in the first hearing that there's too much evidence, they need time to go through it, and they're delaying this really does appear to be part of their strategy going forward. You mentioned that Donald Trump is already fuming publicly about this -- after this third indictment. He's claiming that he wants the Supreme Court to get involved because this is an example of election interference.

It does indicates to me, at least, that this coup has solidified completely. And in the meantime, ECOWAS; the regional bloc is piling on the pressure from the point of view of sanctions, possible trade embargoes, and as you say, the clock winding down on what they said was a week until they might consider sending in troops from that regional bloc into the country to reinstate President Bazoum.

That's an intelligence gathering and drone base that is critical to U.S. national security, and cost more than $100 million to build. It also speaks to the potential of they're not necessarily being every single soldier backing this coup. If the U.S. is still cooperating on some level, with the rank-and-file in that part of the country. The French, it's been more direct rhetoric coming from the coup leaders. They have severed military ties, they've thrown out the ambassador of France and several other western nations. And they are very frequently blaming the French on all sorts of their own issues. But not saying very much about the American forces. I think that's in part because it's hard to gauge a 100 percent, but broadly-speaking, there is less of public enmity that the coup leaders can tap into when it comes to the U.S. forces there, then the French, given the colonial history in their country.

Take a look at this, the ocean is so hot off the coast of Florida coral ismelting. The new record, two tenths of a degree higher. Might not seem huge, but given how much heat is needed to warm up our ocean, it's a massive amount of energy. And scientists are alarmed. This could mark the start of a concerning trend. The warmer oceans get, the more the planet will heat. Our Chief Climate Correspondent Bill Weir joins me now.

Barbie now holds the title for the largest opening of the year And the biggest ever debut for a film directed by a woman, Greta Gerwig. Warner Bros., which is part of the same parent company as CNN, now hopes the movie will fetch $1 billion worldwide. So what's the recipe for success? A star-studded cast, the most famous doll in the world, and catchy songs like this one, it seems. But there's also a secret source and you probably have seen the memes if you're on Insta. You know, give the marketing team a pay rise in this incredible marketing. I want to go to Variety Magazine Reporter Rebecca Rubin. I'm sure, Rebecca, you have probably seen the memes all over Insta as I have with the board saying, you know, give the Barbie marketing team a pay rise.

And so even on the streets and restaurants, you see a lot of stores are really cashing in on this pink craze. And so some of it was planned by Warner Bros. and Mattel who owns Barbie and then some of it is just these businesses seeing what a phenomenon it's come and really wanting to lean into that.",

And you don't normally see a movie that's targeted more at females getting this grand of a marketing push and so it's really exciting to see that they've really leaned into Barbie as this event movie and I think that's part of the reason why it's hitting a billion so quickly because it's really hitting all audiences. And I think a lot of people who might have seen Barbie coming out and thought this movie is not for me are now intrigued because it's really been everywhere in culture.

And so it shows they really had a lot of faith in this movie. They were putting a lot of money behind it. One of the executives I spoke to, I actually asked if he went over budget. I was just curious because this movie had been everywhere and he said that no, they didn't go over budget, but the reason it might seem that way is just because a lot of businesses, particularly in the fashion space, have really leaned into this pink Barbie color movement.
