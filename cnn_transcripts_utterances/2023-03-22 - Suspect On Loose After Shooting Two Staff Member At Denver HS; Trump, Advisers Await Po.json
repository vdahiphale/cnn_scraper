What we do know is that every day this student had to undergo a safety plan and Denver - or Denver Public Schools was reluctant to give any detail about why this particular student would undergo a safety plan every day.But what we know is that that was true, that every day the student would get a pat down. The student had never produced a firearm before, never - according to police produced a weapon before, but today was different. Today, the student produced a firearm and shot two members of the faculty. In this moment, it just so happened that there were paramedics who were responding to another incident inside the school, so fortunately, paramedics who were there just through happenstance were able to respond to the shooting, able to administer what officials hope and what we all hope are life saving measures for these two faculty members. Meanwhile, the suspect fled on foot. The weapon has not been recovered, the student has not been brought into custody. What we know about the faculty at this moment is that one of those faculty members as of at least a couple of hours ago was in surgery in critical condition. Another member of the faculty was injured but in stable condition and alert enough to give a description of what happened. Police know a lot about this student. They went to his home immediately. They executed a search warrant. We're still waiting to find out perhaps what that search warrant would have recovered. But the big questions moving forward are how did this student, who's under 18 years old, get a firearm. That's going to be the big question for law enforcement as they move forward. And then further, the other broader questions for the public school system is was the safety plan adequate to protect faculty and students. What we know about the safety plan, again, is that it was an everyday thing that it happened in an area away from students. And so at the time, apparently Denver Public Schools thought that that was a robust response enough for the student. Now they say that school will be canceled for the rest of the week and when the school resumes, two armed police officers will be on scene to protect those students. Back to you.",

So it's possible they could reconvene tomorrow.But what we've learned is that the prosecutors, according to sources, are taking their time. They're considering the weight of this case. They're also evaluating how the case has played out so far, particularly from Monday when they heard from Bob Costello. He was a witness who testified on behalf of the Trump team. He went into the grand jury and said that he contradicted Michael Cohen, the government's star witness - his testimony. And Cohen, of course, has said that he was directed by Trump to make these hush money payments, so Stormy Daniels wouldn't go public just days before the 2016 presidential election. Now a source tells us that the DA in the past 24 hours has been in touch with an attorney for one witness saying that that witness may be asked to come back and testify before the grand jury. So it certainly gives a sense that this process is still deliberative, that a decision has not yet been made on whether or not to charge the former president. But this is very much a situation that's in flux. So things are changing as we can see today, kind of on a dime. So we're still very much in a wait and see mode. Jess? Boris?",

So when we talk about what a media spectacle will look like, well, a lot of that is going to involve making sure that media outlets have access to the former president when I talked to several of his advisors who they told me that there's a lot that they can't control. But some of the stuff they can control is what he says, who he says it to and when he says it. So there is a huge messaging and media component to this. But when it comes to what the spectacle will look like in New York. There's also a huge security component, what exactly a Secret Service going to allow them to do. Again, this is an unprecedented situation.

So we are waiting for them to weigh in on Evan - whether Evan Corcoran is actually going to have to testify for grand jury, that could come at every time - at any time.   But this was really set into motion by the incredible ruling that wasunder sealed by a judge last week who determined that former President Donald Trump may have committed crimes, may have used his attorney in the furtherance of those crimes. And essentially, that was her ruling saying prosecutors provided enough evidence to potentially reach that conclusion and pierce attorney client privilege. Of course, normally, your attorney would not have to show up before a grand jury and answer questions about your conversations with him, but because of the evidence prosecutors put forward including surveillance tapes, the judge said this attorney-client privilege can't exist anymore. Corcoran should have to go before a grand jury and answer questions. Corcoran is a key witness if prosecutors can get him in front of that grand jury and can get answers out of him. He was someone who helped conduct the search at Mar-A-Lago for these classified documents who helped craft the attestation that ended up going to the justice department saying here are all the classified documents left when we later found out that was, of course, not the case.",

Now, Powell, during his press conference, he did point to some changes in the statement that do suggest the Fed could be nearing an end to this rate hiking campaign. And Fed officials in their projections, they did pencil in just one more quarter point rate hike. But listening to Powell, it's clear that there's a lot of uncertainty here. I mean, Powell himself said he just doesn't know yet how much this banking crisis is going to slow down the economy. He doesn't know how much it's going to hurt the availability of credit and make it more expensive for all of us to borrow.   So there is some uncertainty here.
