And, in fact, we know that obstruction is one of the crimes under investigation, which is what sort of compelled DOJ to go and do the search warrant.

That would fall to the Secret Service.So we have the White House counsel of the president saying that a personal home is personal, and that is being backed up by the Secret Service saying we do not maintain visitor logs at private homes, that they do -- they do make sure that the area is secure. They do screen people before they come over to a private residence. But that, ultimately, it is up to the president and the president's staff to make sure that the people who are coming to the property are allowed to be there. So there is no formal visitor log. Now, just speaking with a former official at the Secret Service who said that there may be some tidbits, there may be some information about people who did come and go, but that Republicans may eventually be able to get their hands on, but there is no formal visitor's log.

At least 40 people were killed in the Russian attack over the weekend, making it one of the deadliest attacks against Ukrainian civilians since Russia invaded nearly a year ago. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy calls it, quote, a war crime.And as Fred Pleitgen reports, Ukrainian officials say the death toll is likely to rise. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice- over):  While rescue crews are still sifting through the debris, the chance of finding any more survivors is virtually zero, a gaping hole where dozens of families once lived. As you can see here, this building was completely annihilated all the way down to the ground floor. The Ukrainians say the reason why the damage is so extensive is that the Russians used a cruise missile called the KH22. That is designed to destroy whole aircraft carrier strike groups, and when it hit the building, the building just completely collapsed and buried dozens of people underneath. A miracle that anyone survived at all, Ukrainian authorities say. Katerina Zelenska (ph) was pulled from the rubble by rescuers hours after the strike, but her husband and 1-year-old son remain unaccounted for. And this video shows happier times for the Koronofsky (ph) family. Father Mykola Koronofsky (ph) was killed in their apartment, the distinctive yellow kitchen, like their family, torn apart by the massive explosion. Fifteen-year-old Maria was also killed in the blast. Dozens of relatives, classmates and teachers coming to pay their final respects. She was an incredible child, her class teacher says, God is taking the best of ours. This is what happened. The Kremlin denies its forces were behind the strike, and instead claims a Ukrainian antiaircraft missile hit the building. The Ukrainians says that simply isn't true, and Dnipro's mayor tells me his city and the country need more Western air defense systems. Western countries give us air defense systems, he tells me, but unfortunately it's not enough, and it comes with delays. More air defense systems are the only thing that can save our civilians in our cities. And while they wait, these scenes repeat themselves again and again. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
