Republicans pound the pavement put on their best every man polos and look for votes between burgers, dogs and fireworks. July 4 provides a 2024 test. One, Donald Trump vets, he is fine just skipping.Plus, a First Amendment victory or a green light to conspiracy theorists. A judge calls a Biden effort to stop disinformation from running wild Orwellian, while telling top Biden officials to cut off contact with social media companies. And just in, cocaine at the White House. A positive lab test prompts an obvious question for the Secret Service. Whose was it? I am Dana Bash. Let's go behind the headlines at Inside Politics. Up first, a White House crime scene of source just confirmed to CNN that cocaine was discovered inside the West Wing. I want to go straight to the White House and CNN's Priscilla Alvarez. Priscilla, what are you hearing from your sources on this?",

Now initially, officials had described this as a powdery substance left in a zip lock bag in the West Wing in a common area. So not an office, and also an area accessible to group tours. In fact, it's a place where guests are asked to leave their cell phones as they take their tours.And so, now lab tests are confirming that it is cocaine. It was unclear as of earlier today, whether that would be the case field tests up to now had determined that it could possibly be cocaine. We now know from these tests that it is. But Dana, as you mentioned, this raises a lot of questions of how this could have entered the White House to begin with and who is the person responsible for it? Those are two questions that have not been answered yet. The Secret Service up until now, has said that this is an ongoing investigation, and that they themselves are trying to sort out how this happened. But when it did on Sunday evening, when there was this discovery, it led to a temporary evacuation because they just did not know what it is. So, this is an incident that the White House has taken seriously and one that the Secret Service is still getting many, many questions on. Dana?",

Now let's go to the campaign trail where Republican presidential candidates spent the July 4 holiday shaking hands and kissing babies.Noticeably missing, Donald Trump, the former president spent his day sharing digs at his predecessor and praise for himself online. But his opponents were in the states that have the first chance to choose the party's nominee, hoping to kickstart momentum. They need to overtake Trump, who of course is the clear frontrunner according to almost every -- not almost every single poll. CNN's Kyung Lah is in Le Mars, Iowa.

This targeted suppression of conservative ideas is a perfect example of viewpoint discrimination of political speech. American citizens have the right to engage in free debate about the significant issues affecting the country. The evidence produced thus far depicts an almost dystopian scenario.

Well, that's the whole question is, is it protected First Amendment speech or not?He also really gives himself away when he says that targets conservative viewpoints. If you're really going to talk about the government trying to influence social media, you wouldn't limit it to just conservative or liberal that gives away his viewpoint. I think it makes it very difficult to follow his order for the government to know when they're stepping over that line. And lastly, from a strictly technical standpoint, this is a preliminary injunction. You need to show irreparable harm. Where's the urgency? He engaged in months of discovery very helpful to conservative cause. And now he says, you need to preliminarily enjoined us. There's no reason why he needs a preliminary injunction.",
