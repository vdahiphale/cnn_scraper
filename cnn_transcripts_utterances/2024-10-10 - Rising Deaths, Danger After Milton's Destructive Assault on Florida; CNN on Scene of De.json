And the danger is ongoing this hour from the rampant flooding and the wreckage the storm left behind. We're following the urgent rescue and recovery operation that's now underway.And CNN is on the scene of a Florida community battered by at least nine tornadoes, nine tornadoes that were supercharged by the hurricane. Local authorities say the deadly barrage of twisters was unprecedented. Also breaking, former President Barack Obama is about to kick off a major campaign swing on behalf of Kamala Harris in the battleground state of Pennsylvania. Why did he wait until now? I'll ask the former Obama attorney general, Eric Holder, who's joining us live. Welcome to our viewers here in the United States and around the world. I'm Wolf Blitzer. You're in The Situation Room. And we begin with the breaking news out of Florida, the death toll from Hurricane Milton just went up to 13 and is expected to keep climbing as recovery crews move deeper and deeper into flood-ravaged and storm-ravaged areas.

They want them to apply separately because you can get different aid and possibly additional aid for both Hurricane Milton and Hurricane Helene if you show that you've been hit by these double damages.

But for many people, there will be no normal for a very long time, and you see that here in Fort Pierce.There's this tractor trailer, I mean, you can see just flipped over on the side. Luckily nobody was inside. We're told at the time this was a park tractor trailer on the side of the road. There's another one just on the other side of the road both flipped over. And as you remember, before the hurricane actually hit, the story on the on the east coast of Florida in the Atlantic side was dozens of tornadoes, more than they've ever seen in one single day here in the state of Florida. Two of them touched down in this area, flipping this these trucks, ripping the roof off a church just a little bit further down the road within eyesight from here. And then there's this community homes and one to three-bedroom homes. It's community for people 55 and older. Two tornadoes touched down within about 40 minutes. So, people there were hit by one tornado while they were still, you know, inside their homes. Another one came. There have been five fatalities in this county, in St. Lucy County, at least five fatalities that we know about, at least one of them was in that community just down the road. We talked to the sheriff, Keith Pearson. They have crews out. They are still very much trying to assess and account for a lot of people. Some people may have left, so they don't have the locations of where everybody was. They're trying to figure out how many people may still be missing and how many at this point have died.",

So, this is certainly an indication of the campaign and the former president viewing this as crunch time ahead of Election Day as they try to mobilize voters to the polls.Now, according to a source who spoke to our colleague, Kayla Tausche, the former president is expected to tell the values and experience that Vice President Kamala Harris and Governor Tim Walz would bring to the White House. Aides around former President Barack Obama have told CNN that he is clear-eyed about this race and also that it is, quote, an all-hands-on-deck moment. And, of course, where he's doing this is notable. It is in Pennsylvania, that crucial state for the Harris campaign as they look to those pathways to 270. And earlier today, the former president stopping by a Harris-Walz campaign office in Pittsburgh to also show his appreciation, you see the images there. Now, of course, it's worth reminding viewers that Obama and Harris do have a history together. They've been acquainted for 20 years. He was at the Democratic National Convention where he gave a rousing speech in support of the vice president. So, certainly, this is another opportunity both tonight and over the coming weeks as he embarks on this blitz to continue that message. We should also note that it's not just the top of the ticket.

But what I think you're referring to is when he started to criticize Detroit, the same city, of course, that he was giving remarks on.I will get to that in a moment, but I want to lay out some news that Donald Trump made. He did announce today for the first time that he plans to eliminate interest payments on car loans, or, excuse me, make interest payments on car loans fully tax deductible. That's the latest in a series of his tax cut offers that will be pretty costly but he says should help car makers as well as consumers dealing with high prices. He also then said he wanted to revisit his 2020 trade agreement with Mexico and Canada. He said he wanted to renegotiate that deal, particularly with Mexico, to talk about putting more imports on cars that are made in Mexico. But then, at one point during that roughly two hour speech, it was pretty meandering, he started to criticize Detroit itself. He said that it was a developing country. He said, quote, that it is more developing than most places in China, calling it a once great city. And then he also used the city to try and characterize what he argued would happen if Kamala Harris were to win in November. Take a listen to what he said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP (R), FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT, 2024 PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE:  I don't think anything that we're talking about today is high on our list. I mean, the whole country's going to be like, you want to know the truth? It'll be like Detroit. Our whole country will end up being like Detroit if she's your president. We're a developing nation too. Just take a look at Detroit. Detroit's a developing area, a hell of a lot more than most places in China. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

I've known Kamala for, you know, 20, 25 years. She's a person who, as a prosecutor, certainly looked out for the interests of people in the African-American community and has consistently done that in every position that she has had.
