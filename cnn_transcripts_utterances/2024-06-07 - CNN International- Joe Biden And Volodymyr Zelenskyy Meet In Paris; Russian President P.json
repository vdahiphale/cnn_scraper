But, we're talking about another 10 years that now investigators are going to go back, look at these missing persons' cases, and say, well, is there a link here as well that can be traced back to Rex Heuermann? So, certainly, there could be more to come from this case.KATE BOLDUAN, HOST, \"CONNECT THE WORLD\": Wow, wow, and wow. Thanks, Misty, for walking through it with me. Really appreciate it. A new hour of \"CNN News Central\" starts now. FREDRICKA WHITFIELD, HOST, \"CNN NEWSROOM\": Hello, and welcome to our viewers all around the world. I'm Fredricka Whitfield, and this is the CNN Newsroom. Just ahead, in the last hour, President Biden reassured President Zelenskyy that the United States is always standing with Ukraine. The two leaders are meeting in Paris after the D-Day anniversary events. And there are calls for an independent investigation in Gaza after an Israeli airstrike hit a UN-run school where displaced Palestinians were sheltering. Plus, drugs, a gun and a romantic relationship with his brother's widow, all coming to light in the Hunter Biden trial. We'll have details about who is in the court today. It's a day of diplomacy and reflection in France with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy taking center stage. It's all part of the D-Day commemoration events that began Thursday. Earlier, U.S. President Joe Biden met with President Zelenskyy in Paris. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

This is something we know that Ukraine is very keen on, undoubtedly want to talk about a sort of a further reach and further use of U.S. military equipment, that at the moment they've been given the green light to strike back at Russian targets that have really targeted them, counter fire is how Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin put it. Undoubtedly, President Zelenskyy is going to want more than that. He also said on that issue, he would be talking to President Biden about some battlefield details that have not been revealed publicly, potentially, about how offensive those strikes have already been back into Russian territory, particularly around Kharkiv. So, I think that -- those would be -- those would have been the important points for President Zelenskyy in that meeting, but knowing that support is enduring and bipartisan, that's going to be just a growing worry for the Ukrainians.",

So, I think that kind of gives you a little bit of a sense that if Russia was taking some action -- a back-up France for not being invited. You could maybe interpret it as that. We know that President Putin's spokesperson has said that France has too readily willing to, and President Macron is very ready and willing to engage French troops directly on the ground in Ukraine and get them involved in the battle.And I think this is perhaps a back reference to comments that President Macron has made in the past where he has been very keen to commit French military trainers potentially to go inside Ukraine to train Ukrainian forces and therefore have a have a firmer military presence than any other NATO nation at the moment in -- a declared presence, at least, inside of Ukraine.",

We expect and we understand that more aid to Ukraine is to be signed, namely in the shape of Mirage jet fighters, which will be the first time that France gives some to Ukraine. But, that will be an important addition to their arsenal and their air defenses, specifically part of what President Zelenskyy has been calling for.He'll then host the Ukrainian President up for a dinner at the Elysee Palace, and by tomorrow, all eyes will be very much on what happens here in Paris when President Biden returns to lay a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, the Arc de triomphe. So, really closing what has been a remarkable series of images, commemorative events, strong reminders of shared pasts and common causes today.

      "sentences": "Well, I think everybody is taking note of that. And I think it's one of the things that has really been symbolic here in Europe over the past couple of years. It's not the first year that Vladimir Putin wasn't invited to the D-Day commemoration events. I think he hasn't been there since 2014 since Russia's initial invasion of Ukraine down in the Crimea area after the Maidan protests, obviously, in Ukraine. So, this is not necessarily something that's new. But, of course, the whole trajectory of everything has changed a great deal since the full-on invasion of Ukraine. And now, of course, you have this very important commemoration with 80 years since the D-Day landings. That is just an extremely important date.And so, therefore, everybody obviously is taking note of this. I think that there is a lot of symbolism in a lot of the things that we're hearing from the world leaders say there on the beaches of Normandy, on the cemeteries, where they are saying, look, what we have in Europe right now is a situation where peace in Europe, fundamentally, is challenged and is under threat by this new full-on invasion that's going on by the Russian Federation. At the same time, by the way, that same kind of symbolism also playing out by Vladimir Putin's administration, where he is the one that's saying that he believes that it's the West that is fueling all of this. So, definitely, a lot of that symbolism is underway. And one of the other things that we also have to keep in mind is, of course, Vladimir Putin hasn't been invited to these commemorations now. There were also no world leaders who showed up on May 9 to the Russian commemoration of their Victory Day parade either. So, you do see on a full scale that the allies that fought against Nazi Germany in the 1940s definitely right now at least to an extent on opposite sides of the equation right now. And I think it is very important to hear. We heard from President Biden there at the beginning of our broadcast say that right now is the time for these Western European countries and the United States to step up once again to ensure that peace in Europe remains, Fredricka.",

We heard from John Kirby, the National Security Council spokesperson, speaking to CNN, saying that Israel does have the right to target Hamas but the way that it does it is significant, speaking to CNN. So, certainly, there has been condemnation. We've heard from the UN Secretary-General through a statement condemning what has happened. We understand from UNRWA itself that some 6,000 Palestinians were sheltering in that area at that time, and we have seen repeatedly UNRWA buildings, UNRWA institutions being targeted, more than -- at least 180, according to UNRWA itself.So, certainly, there are many questions being asked about this. From the Israeli military point of view, they say that they had identified 20 to 30 militants both from Hamas and Islamic Jihad. And as you say, they believe that they have killed nine of them, or at least they have been identified, without giving any evidence at this point. But, what we are also seeing as well overnight and into the early hours of today, there were more strikes. We know that another UN-linked school has been hit, this time up in Al-Shati camp. This is in the northern parts of Gaza, three killed there, dozens injured, according to medics. And we also know that there has been another strike in Khan Younis, just in the south of the Gaza Strip, a building housing the same family, at least eight killed there. And I want to talk a bit about central Gaza as well. This is an area that we know at least 12 have been killed overnight. And we're hearing from those on the ground that they believe that the intensity and the frequency of Israeli airstrikes just over the past week really takes them back to the beginning of the war. So, it's important to note that the intensification in this particular area is certainly being felt by those on the ground, Fred.",

So, this is the assessment of this report.Interesting that there is this -- the CIA assessment of the leader of one of U.S.'s key allies, and also interesting as well that it has been leaked, that it has been publicized in this way.

So, why does the defense think that these might be helpful witnesses? Well, they are there to talk about Hunter's attempts to get clean. The questions in this case are all about whether or not he was a drug user or a drug addict in October 2018 when he bought a handgun here in Delaware. And these defense witnesses, the members of the Biden family, are expected to tell the jury that he was trying to stay clean and that maybe even was a period of time where he was between his drug use.But, Fred, those are not the only Bidens that we're looking out for today. We are waiting for the First Lady to re-enter this courthouse. She was in France yesterday for the D-Day commemorations, back here in Wilmington today to support her son before returning to France for the state visit this weekend.

Now, this ruling or this decision to liquidate his assets, this does not mean that tomorrow these families are finally going to see some sort of monetary help in the form of this liquidation of the assets, but it is at least a step in the right direction.Now, as you noted, Alex Jones has been ordered to pay $1.5 billion to these families. This is a combination of rulings that he had been found for defamation, for emotional distress. Now, Alex Jones until now had been fighting against the liquidation of his assets. He tried to do other things in bankruptcy courts to have them reorganized, his assets reorganized, his company. But, this was a sort of surprise decision that came late yesterday where he did ask the court to help him start liquidating his personal assets. Now, the families had requested this, instead of to allow this reorganization, they requested that the court liquidate his assets, especially as there had been reporting by both the Associated Press and The New York Times that he was continuing to spend lavishly, and also that he was allegedly possibly trying to transfer some of his money to members of his families to keep it out of the hands of the creditors. But, it seems that the mounting pressure just got to the point that he recognized he needed to liquidate his assets. We saw hints of this last week on his InfoWars conspiracy show. He started to break down in sort of bizarre tears last week, saying that the feds were going to come to shut down his show. But now, we know that what this likely was pointing to was the fact that he was going to need to liquidate his assets.

President Biden is going to lean into the stories of heroism by those World War II Veterans, with a senior administration official telling me that he is going to say that we owe them and that we should take from the example that they set.And he is particularly going to mention one vet in particular. His name is John Wardell. He descended here at Pointe du Hoc with the army days after D-Day to help secure this position. And he is expected to be in the audience today as well as other officials from France who run museums, monument associations, schools and towns here to remember what happened in this very sacred and hallowed place. But, Biden is going to be making a broader point to about democracy, about how we owe it to the men who braved their lives here 80 years ago to continue defending the freedom of Europe with dictators ready to march through Europe again, and Vladimir Putin fighting yet another war on Europe's frontlines in Ukraine. That is going to be a very big theme of this speech that President Biden is expected to deliver in just a couple of hours' time with about 150 people here in the audience. Of course, it's sure to draw comparisons with the speech that Ronald Reagan gave 40 years ago, which at the time was intended to shore up support for what young voters at the time saw as an ill-conceived American interventionism overseas during the Cold War and after the war in Vietnam. There are some similar elements to the mood within the country today.

But, he is also going to give an implicit nod to the rise of populism and isolationist principles, not just in the U.S., but really across capitals in Europe, where there are populist forces that are again on the rise. But, of course, it's perhaps no more relevant than in the United States where Biden is up for reelection, just as Reagan was in 1984, and his opponent has suggested that perhaps he would stop providing support to NATO allies or stop providing support to Ukraine to end some of that support that has been critical to what Ukraine has been able to do on the battlefield. To that end, just today, Biden and Zelenskyy met face-to-face. They talked about a new aid package, $225 million that stems from a support package that the U.S. Congress passed in April. It took six months to get it across the finish line. Biden apologized for the delay.

So, Biden chose this site to make this speech based on its history and its imagery. How do you believe this will help underscore the case? TIM NAFTALI, CNN PRESIDENTIAL HISTORIAN, &amp; SR. RESEARCH DIR., COLUMBIA SCHOOL OF INTL. &amp; PUBLIC AFFAIRS: Well, first of all, the differences between 1984 and 2024 are stark. In 1984, Ronald Reagan talked about how there was a deep understanding in America of the importance of the contribution and the sacrifice of D-Day and that that sacrifice continued as America has committed itself to the ongoing security in Europe. It would have been inconceivable for Ronald Reagan to see the right wing of the U.S. political spectrum as a threat to American engagement with the world. If anything, in 1984, Ronald Reagan worried about how the American left was undermining the American commitment to what he considered to be a moral crusade against the Soviet Union. It would have been inconceivable for Ronald Reagan in 1984 that people in his own party would be on the verge of nominating someone who is using the rhetoric of the 1930s to talk about the importance of the presidency for using its power to punish those who didn't agree with the President. Ronald Reagan talked about how government needed to be smaller. It needed to get out of our lives. It didn't need to be the source of vindictiveness. So, the era of Reagan's Pointe du Hoc speech is quite different from the political climate that faces or confronts Joe Biden today, as he makes his speech at the same place, at the same time in a presidential election cycle. So, what's striking is, though, the backdrop is the same, the challenges to American democracy today are quite different from those that Ronald Reagan faced when he made a similar bid for moral leadership in 1984.",

      "sentences": "Well, Fredricka, this jobs market continues to look resilient, just when we thought it was really starting to slow down, it's speeding up again. The latest numbers show that U.S. economy added 272,000 jobs last month. That is well above the consensus estimate of about 180,000. You can see on that chart, hiring did slow down in April significantly, and we were waiting to see if that was the start of a new trend. Apparently, it's not because you can see hiring has bounced back in a big way. This is above the recent pace that we've seen.And really, there was a lot of evidence of strong demand for workers. Wages continue to go up significantly. They've actually heated up. We saw across the board strength in terms of hiring, a lot of jobs added for healthcare, 68,000 for government. Leisure and hospitality, those are bars and restaurants. So, all of that showing there is a lot of demand for workers. The unemployment rate, though, a one outlier, right? The unemployment rate is actually going up to four percent. Now, that's significant, because we haven't seen four percent unemployment since January of 2022. And this was almost an historic jobs report, because if the unemployment rate had stayed below four percent, which is what was expected, this would have been the longest streak of sub-four percent unemployment. Since the early 1950s under Dwight Eisenhower and Harry Truman, that did not happen. But, obviously, four percent is still very, very low, much lower than what we saw during COVID in 2020, and much lower than what would be considered a real slow down or even recession territory. So, I think when you zoom out, Fredricka, these jobs numbers show there is a lot of demand for workers, and the economy continues to be a lot more resilient than people expected.",

Balloons have been crossing the border for years, and some South Koreans are getting tired of it.Here is CNN's Mike Valerio. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MIKE VALERIO, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): In a place that blooms with life, a serene and stunning setting, 60-year-old farmer Kim Young-eun (ph) cares for his giant onions with water flowing from North Korea. It is part of a beautiful, and he says, inseparable bond between North and South, now fraught with tension once again. There used to be a time when we talked about peace, he says, but it's all changed now. We only hear difficult situations between the Koreas. So, we farmers are very uncomfortable. Kim tells us he has farmed this land in Cheorwon in South Korea for 36 years and he disagrees with this free.",

Park Sang-hak is the founder of the group behind this latest launch, \"Fighters for a Free North Korea\". He has s been doing this since 2006, and his latest balloon deployment is in direct response to about 1,000 trash-filled balloons sent from North Korea. PARK SANG-HAK, FOUNDER, FIGHTERS FOR A FREE NORTH KOREA (Interpreted): We send money, medicine, facts, truth and love, but to send filth and trash in return, that's an inhumane and barbaric act. VALERIO (voice-over): Park defected from North Korea in 2000, and he remembers in the early 90s when a balloon similar to one of these popped above him and he secretly collected a leaflet from South Korea. It told him of a better life. And I says it told him the truth. SANG-HAK (Interpreted): South Korea is not an American colony or a wasteland of humanity, like I learned in North Korea. North Koreans are filled with anger and hatred and only sing military songs. But, South Korea is a gentle country.

We're talking about way in the background, the DMZ, about four kilometers, two and a half miles away from where we're standing. Now, farmer Kim has told us that during moments of heightened tension in the past, the South Korean army has kept him from entering about half of his property because it is so close to the DMZ, in order to keep him and others safe.VALERIO (voice-over): The question now, how will North Korea respond, especially after a show of force by the United States, a B-1B bomber on Wednesday flying over the Korean Peninsula and for the first time in seven years engaging in land target practice with live munitions? We asked Kim if he wants to leave. His answer, I want to move to somewhere else but I can't afford it. We're very upset the balloons are making our daily lives inconvenient and our area is seen as a war zone. It's very unfortunate. There is nothing we can do. If I could, we would want to stop them, but it's difficult. So, for Kim, there is no choice, staying in his field surrounded by waters from the north, longing for a time before new heights for tensions in the sky. Mike Valeria, CNN, Cheorwon, South Korea.
