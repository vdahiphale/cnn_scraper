Officials from South Sudan also say both sides have agreed to send representatives to peace talks. But where and when those talks will happen is yet to be decided. Six ceasefire so far, at best bringing a lull in the conflict, but the sound of gunfire and explosions continues to be heard, especially in the capital Khartoum. More than 500 people are confirmed dead in more than two weeks of fighting. But with bodies left piling up in the streets, the real death toll is certain to be much higher.

The number of nationalities have so far ferried across from Port Sudan to Jeddah is now 102. The only tiny percentage of those are Saudis. Many of them are from nationalities from the U.S. and Canada and the U.K. and Sudan and Kenya, Burkina Faso, from really everywhere around the world.

The latest now from CNN's Hadas Gold reporting in from Jerusalem. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) HADAS GOLD, CNN CORRESPONDENT (on camera): At least 22 rockets were fired from Gaza into Israel on Tuesday by Palestinian militants who said that they were doing this in response to the death of Khader Adnan, a prominent Palestinian prisoner who was found dead in his cell Tuesday morning after a more than 86 day hunger strike. Now, at least three people were injured by this rocket fire, including 125-year-old man who was seriously injured by shrapnel. That's according to Israeli emergency medical authorities. And the militant factions in Gaza directly connecting these dozens of rockets to Khader Adnan's death, saying that these rockets were what they call just a preliminary response to what they said was a heinous crime. Now, Khader Adnan is a former spokesperson for the militant group Palestinian Islamic Jihad. He had been arrested at least 10 times by the Israeli authorities since 2004 and this was not his first hunger strike. He had been on at least five other hunger strikes in 2004. But this morning, the Israeli prison authorities saying that they found Adnan unconscious in his cell this morning and they said that he had been refusing medical treatment as a result of his hunger strike. Now, the Islamic Jihad group saying that as a result of what they said was Adnan's martyrdom, they had promoted him to be a commander in Islamic Jihad and aside from the reaction of the rockets that we saw from Gaza, there is also a general strike called across the entire West Bank and Gaza meaning that everything from shops to schools are closed down as a result of Adnan's death and he had really just become a symbol, the face of Palestinian resistance and especially for the thousands of Palestinian prisoners in Israeli prison. But what's interesting is Adnan's wife actually in a statement to the media said that she did not want to see rockets fired as a result of her husband's death. Take a listen. RANDA MUSA, MIFE OF KHADER ADNAN (through translator): Not a drop of blood was spilled during the previous prisoner's hunger strikes and today we say with the rise of the martyr and his accomplishment of what he wished for, we do not want a drop of blood to be spilled. We do not want someone to respond to his martyrdom. We do not want rockets to be launched and then for Gaza to be struck.",

From talking to both migrants and officials on both sides of the border, they tell me, because there's tens of thousands of migrants who are waiting in Northern Mexican cities, a lot of them have lost patience.

Single-use and disposable vapes will be banned. Colored, flavored packs that were appealing to younger users will also be restricted. Figures show that, in Australia, like many other countries, vapes are disproportionately used by young people. Still ahead, late-night television shows go dark.

This comes after weeks-long negotiations collapsed with production companies over pay and other issues like artificial intelligence and screenwriting. CNN's Brian Todd has details, reporting in now from Washington. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BRIAN TODD, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): NBC's late-night host Seth Meyers recently told his audience of the grim possibility. SETH MEYERS, HOST, NBC'S \"LATE NIGHT WITH SETH MEYERS\": It is something that is not done lightly, and that I will be heartbroken to miss you, as well. TODD (voice-over): CBS's Stephen Colbert spoke of how important the rioters are to his show. STEPHEN COLBERT, HOST, CBS'S \"THE LATE SHOW WITH STEPHEN COLBERT\": Without these people, this show would be called \"The Late Show with a Guy Rambling About 'The Lord Of The Rings' and Boats for an Hour.\" TODD (voice-over): But those late-night shows hosted by Colbert, Meyers, Jimmy Kimmel, and Jimmy Fallon are among the first casualties, as more than 11,000 movie and TV writers are now on strike. The Writers Guild of America voting to walk out after several weeks of negotiations with a group representing companies like Netflix, Amazon, Apple, Disney, NBC Universal, Paramount, and CNN's parent company, Warner Brothers Discovery. DOMINIC PATTEN, SENIOR EDITOR, \"DEADLINE HOLLYWOOD\": You're going to see that on films also currently in production with writers, that's going to stop. TODD (voice-over): The last time the writers went on strike, in 2007, they left for 100 days, leading to delays in production for months. Some of the late-night shows are the first to go into re-runs, because they're more dependent on writers, the shows written the same day they air. JIMMY FALLON, HOST, NBC'S \"THE TONIGHT SHOW STARRING JIMMY FALLON\": I'm actually in the Writers Guild, as well, so yes, I couldn't do the show without them.
