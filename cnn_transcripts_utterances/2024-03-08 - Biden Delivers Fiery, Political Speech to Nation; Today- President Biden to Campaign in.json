Clearly, there are people in your state of Michigan, other swing states.What do you think the president gave to those voters last night? REP. DEBBIE DINGELL (D-MI): Well, first of all, I agree with Evan. He did a great job. And -- as you know, I told you less night, I thought he would do a great job. That audience is his element. And I wasn't surprised at how long he stayed, because he -- you know, he lives in a bubble, and they don't let him talk to people. And he had all his friends there. So he was happier. But I think he also laid out a vision. He laid out his vision for the future. He did -- you know, I think one of things all of us have not done a good job about is talking about what we have gotten accomplished in the last three years. He reminded people of all the things that we've gotten done; called Republicans on some of it, like lowering prescription drugs and the infrastructure bill and the money out there. And hey, most of you didn't vote for it, but you're taking credit for it now. That was one of my favorite lines. But he laid out his vision. And I think it is a very stark choice between another four years of Joe Biden, what he wants to do, how he's going to support the middle class, how he's going to protect people's freedoms, starting with women's rights and women's freedoms and very much in that democracy was at stake. And made it -- wasn't afraid to call out. You're right. He didn't use Donald Trump's name, but he told people and reminded them they were proud that they overturned Roe versus Wade. They want a national abortion ban; that he wants to repeal the Affordable Care Act; that he's Putin's friend. And I could go so on. I think it was a very excellent speech.

And last night, what he said was for the Democratic base, but how he said it was for swing voters who needed to see that this guy was all there, that he could do the job. And I told you yesterday when I was on the show, the Republicans have made a mistake, because they set the bar at dementia. And that -- if look, if that's what dementia -- I hope that's how I have dementia when I'm older. Because he was on his game, the energy. And he did the thing that I think Joe Biden is particularly good at, where he sparred with the Republicans. He -- he somehow managed to have it be incredibly political. He managed to be going right at Republicans, but often was also, like, joking with them, smiling at them, egging them on a little bit. And it gave this balance to the speech that I think just worked really well for him. And it was offense. It was offense. He's been needing this shift, change the tone, and I think he nailed it.",

He said, I've known -- I know what it means to lose children. And you'll notice it was over in a matter of seconds. It was not ceding the ground to Marjorie Taylor Greene. It was not losing command of that space, which is really important. You know, in some ways, the measure of a moment like that is if you turned off the TV, turned off the sound on your TV and you were just watching the people in that room, who would you think came out of there confident and in control?

And I think the stunt that she was pulling, wearing a hat -- like what he did was he met her at her stunt, and he called her on it. And I think it was a little unclear what he was saying. And I think that actually, it like, matters less about sort of the specific words he used than the fact that he sort of got into it with Marjorie Taylor Greene.

You know, I talked to Gerry Connolly before this speech and after the speech, and he noted that he felt like going into last night. He was pretty nervous about the president's performance. And at the end of the night, he felt like this is the moment that Joe Biden needs to channel all of this energy that he threw out, and he needs to continue to do this on the campaign trail. Joe Manchin joked with me, it really felt like the president had a lot left in the tank to give after that speech. And he's hoping he's going to use it on the campaign trail.

The company was founded by the former British spy Christopher Steel. Trump also owes over half a billion dollars from recently lost lawsuits in New York. A United flight loses one of its wheels as it takes off from a San Francisco runway. You can see it falling off a Boeing jet just seconds after takeoff. According to United, the tire was one of 12 on the main landing gear. Debris from the tire landed in an airport parking lot. I'm glad my car wasn't parked there. The Federal Aviation Administration is investigating. And a little later this hour, we'll talk about aviation safety with Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg. I think he's there talking about the State of the Union. But here we go. We've got a tire falling off a plane. He'll join us live. And then there's this. George Santos spotted last night in the House chamber before the State of the Union. He now says he's running for Congress again. Santos made the announcement on social media during the president's address. He was expelled from the House last year and faces multiple federal charges. Excuse me. All right. Up next, collateral damage on the ground after, as we saw, a United flight loses a wheel. Plus, he served in the Trump administration, and he's backing the former president again.
