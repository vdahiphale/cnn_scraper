      "sentences": "At this hour on CNN, hostage negotiations continue as the clock ticks down to the end of a pause in fighting in Gaza. While clashes between Israeli forces and Palestinians in the West Bank escalate, the city of Jenin, the latest deadly flashpoint. And amid so much death and destruction, a search for memories. All that's left for a grandfather after his grandchildren were killed in their sleep as their home collapsed.Hello everyone, I'm John Vause. Great to have you with us. Gaza is now into its sixth and what could be the last day of relative calm with an agreement between Israel and Hamas for a temporary pause in the fighting set to end within 24 hours. The pause has already been extended for two days in exchange for the release of Israeli hostages in Gaza and Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails. Sources say Hamas has now given Israel another list of names of hostages who are expected to be released in the coming hours. Hostage negotiations in Doha are ongoing, with all sides agreeing to work towards extending the current truce. A senior official with Hamas told CNN it's pushing for a longer lasting ceasefire, which Israel has described as a non-starter. On Tuesday, the fifth day of the current pause, Hamas released 12 hostages, 10 of them Israelis, who were all women, one of 17-year-old girl. The handover took place at the Rafah crossing on Gaza's southern border with Egypt. Large crowds lined the streets, cheering as the women were paraded by Hamas before they were taken away by the Red Cross. In a separate deal with the government of Thailand, two Thai nationals were also released by Hamas on Tuesday. So far, 86 of an estimated nearly 250 hostages have been set free. For those who are either at home or on their way there, the return to normality will take time and will not be easy, especially for the children who've been held captive. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DR EFRAT BRON-HARLEV, CHIEF EXEC. SCHNEIDER CHILDRENS MEDICAL CENTER IN ISRAEL: They came from different places in Gaza and in different times, and of course, different ages. But in general, I can say that they all came very skinny, very pale, lost maybe 10 to 15% of their weight at some times. And not only them, but their mothers as well, the ones that came with them. Other than that, they have some minor wounds, but they will overcome all that. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "With the pause between Israel and Hamas expected to continue into Wednesday, a sixth day, the question is, what happens then? What does day seven look like? Could Israel start its military operations up in Gaza again, or will Hamas continue to release hostages? The hope by the Biden administration is that the pause does continue and more hostages continue to come out. The quiet goes on for a bit longer, they hope, and more aid goes in, to Gaza to deal with the really catastrophic humanitarian situation.Tuesday saw the CIA director, Bill Burns, in the Qatari capital, Doha, to work on just that. He has become President Biden's point man on all hostage issues, meeting in Doha with Qatari officials and his Israeli and Egyptian counterparts. Burns' goal was also to try to broaden the negotiations to more than just women and children, and to try to get men and Israeli women out, which everyone agrees will be much more difficult. The Biden administration is also urging Israel that if they start their operations up again militarily in Gaza, which they say they will, to be much more careful, to be more cautious, more surgical and precise, to try to minimize the often-deadly impact on Gazan civilians, most of whom are now displaced.

You know, a nuclear armed Iran would be an existential threat, or around backed Hezbollah based in Lebanon, which has 150,000 long range missiles pointed at Israel. It has its own air defense system and commando force. Does Hamas rise to that same threat level?Because it seems the answer to that question would seem to determine the scope of the rest of this Israeli military operation in Gaza and the chance of any kind of ceasefire. That is, before you add in the factor of Israeli domestic politics. So where do things stand right now? RAVID: Well, I think that obviously Hamas is not an existential threat to Israel. By the way, my personal opinion is that Israel does not face any existential threat at the moment. But I think what we saw on October 7th, that Hamas is a huge threat for Israelis and for Israel without it being an existential threat because it managed to conduct the most serious attack on the state of Israel, maybe since 1948 and the most serious invasion into Israeli territory and the most serious attack on Israeli civilians since 1948. And I think that's a big threat. And I think that when you ask the question, why does this war continue, it's not because Hamas is an existential threat to Israel. It's because no Israeli will be able to go back living in this area on the borders of Gaza if he knows that on the other side of the border this threat still remains. And that's what Israeli public opinion is telling the government. And this is why, don't think any politician right now in Israel will be able to stop this war without dismantling Hamas.",

So, it was much easier to operate.In southern Gaza right now, there are more than 2 million Palestinians in a very dense area. And any operation in southern Gaza, you know, will have to somehow take place without hitting those civilians. And honestly, I got to tell you, I just don't know if such a thing is even possible.",

And we know that, in order to achieve carbon neutrality, at best, a few drops of fossil fuels can be left in our fuel mix, drops that are fully removed from the atmosphere through expensive technologies like direct air capture.We need to transition as quickly as possible to phasing out fossil fuels as completely as possible, while also investing in the most vulnerable communities and countries, who are most impacted by these planet-warming emissions and investing and all kinds of solutions across the spectrum. Because it isn't just about renewable energy, although that's a big part of it, it's also investing efficiency, and climate smart agriculture and behavioral change. All the different pieces, put together, add up to the solution we need.",

And those costs just keep coming down and down and down, the more they're produced, the more they're bought, the more they're developed.It's now possible to get an electric vehicle made in the United States next year for under $30,000, with rebates around $20,000. Which just goes to prove that the more this technology is developed, the more wider it is used, the more the scale grows, the cheaper it becomes, the more reliable it becomes. And that seems to be extrapolated over every part of the -- you know, the economy here when it comes to renewable energy, when it comes to carbon -- net-carbon zero products, right?",
