We will have all of that, plenty of that to bring you the markets, the last hour of trade on business and with the sun being out, the market is up as well. We're seeing green not a huge amount, but there is green in the market. And besides Asbury Park and the markets, there is a lot of very serious news that we'll be bringing you over the course of the hour. In Maui in Hawaii, rescuers are searching for the missing in the wildfires that are still burning in the historic town of Lahaina almost completely gone. We'll report from there. San Francisco is approving driverless taxis that can now operate not only throughout the city, they can charge for their services. And the summer fight for tourists dollars. The beach town that forged rock and roll. We will have the mayor and the head of New Jersey Tourism -- the mayor of Asbury Park and the head of New Jersey Tourism -- is tourism a zero sum game? If you go here and spend the money, you don't spend it somewhere else. Live from Asbury Park in New Jersey, I'm Richard Quest. It is Friday, it is August the 11th. I am in New Jersey, you better believe, I mean business. Good evening. We start of course with the very serious and sad news of events taking place in Hawaii, and in Maui in particular, where the residents have woken up to scenes of not only devastation, but great worry and concern as the search for the missing continues. A massive operation is underway. We now know that at least 55 people died, but that number, bearing in mind the number of people who are still missing that number is expected to rise considerably. And worse, perhaps, four large fires are still burning in the historic town of Lahaina, beloved by tourists and locals alike. The mayor has said it has basically been burned to the ground. We are in Lahaina. Our chief climate correspondent, Bill Weir is there. He now takes us around the town or indeed what is left of it to show the scenes of devastation and misery. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

Right here, this is the first hotel in Hawaii, The Pioneer Hotel, Pioneer Theater. It's completely gone. Right over here was the library. It's just now a stone shell of scorched locks. Around Front Street there, Fleetwood's Mick Fleetwood of the band Fleetwood Mac, his place is gutted out with flames. It is just unrecognizable.

And the difference between the high and the low was the problem and the winds were 120 kilometers per hour, now we're down to about 30, and even there in that picture there the live shot with Veronica that looked like about 10 to 20 kilometers per hour. So they're getting a handle on the fires, 90 percent containment right now. That's good. So 10 percent still uncontained, still burning, but at least we now have a smaller fire line, can get more concentrated on where the firefighters are. This is the west side of Maui. There are two volcanoes and connecting in the middle with a little saddle road. This is where the fire began. Not here on the top, not in the rain forest on the east side because of the way the wind comes in and just rains for days here, but on the downside, on the downslope side, which means you are on the rain shadow effect, raining hundreds of inches, probably 500 centimeters of rain, six millimeters of rain at times here across parts of the rainforest. But then on the downslope side, that's where it's all dry. Something else that happened here, we have the canyons of the western side of Maui, those canyons may have funneled the wind down toward Lahaina. Lahaina right there, the town that really doesn't exist anymore. But why? Because there's a wildland interface, which means that all of the sugarcane that used to grow in Hawaii now isn't planted anymore, and now all of a sudden that was very, very flammable. You put 120-kilometer wind over a flammable area, you drop a few power lines, and you're going to get a wildfire that is completely out-of-control -- Richard.",

A pretty dramatic move.This is just seven weeks before Sam Bankman-Fried was expected to go on trial to face fraud and conspiracy charges. Remember, prosecutors have accused him of being involved in one of the largest financial frauds in history, taking customer funds and misusing it in a variety of ways. So, now, this had all come about because prosecutors had asked the judge to revoke Bankman-Fried's bail because of a number of different contacts he had had with witnesses. This goes back several months at this point. The breaking point appeared to be Bankman-Fried speaking with a reporter for \"The New York Times\" and providing some information about someone who had -- was the very senior at FTX, Caroline Ellison, she has pleaded guilty and is cooperating with prosecutors and is expected to testify at the trial of Bankman-Fried. So prosecutors arguing to the judge that that was just a step too far. They also pointed to other past ways that Bankman-Fried had worked around his bail conditions. He has been at his parents' home in Palo Alto, California. And he had used a VPN, a virtual private network to get around some of the monitoring that had been put in place because this was a crypto crime. This is a crime that involves the internet using encryption. And it was something that prosecutors and the judge have frankly struggled with this whole time. But the breaking point was his contact with a New York Times reporter. Now initially, prosecutors had suggested they could put in place a gag order to stop him from talking to anyone and his lawyers were really pressing for that, you know, they were saying he does have, Bankman-Fried does have a First Amendment right to defend himself in the media. But the judge finding today and this hearing is still ongoing. But the judge deciding that there was probable cause that Bankman-Fried did attempt to tempt -- tamper with witnesses, including those -- the one example I mentioned about talking to the New York Times reporter, which prosecutors had argued, could be an attempt to intimidate Caroline Ellison from testifying at the trial. Now, his parents are in court today. They have not appeared at a number of the past hearings that he's been there. So clearly, they were appreciating this could be the last time they see their son before he appears in court in October, seven weeks from now, to face these charges. But, you know, as the judge was still reading this, he -- according to my colleague, Lauren del Valle who is watching this proceeding, the judge is considering putting him in the Metropolitan Detention Center. That is the federal jail in Brooklyn, New York. That jail has a lot of issues and problems and it was one reason his lawyers were arguing so much for him not to be placed there. It is a tough place. It's not a place that someone wants to be. Now the real issue here too, is that Bankman-Fried, you know, we're waiting to see if he is actually cuffed and taken into custody because he is -- because the judge could do that today. And I'm sorry, I'm just looking to see here. Yes. It looks like he's -- he may be taken into custody. It's still underway. Richard?",

Cruise is calling it an historic industry and a milestone. Citizens aren't happy that was summoned. First responders are concerned. Currently the cars have frozen in traffic blocked in emergencies. Clare Duffy is in New York. Let's be clear on this. All -- so, the driverless taxi, is there a driver in there who just doesn't drive or is this a true driverless taxi?",

Now, obviously, you talked about some of the opposition. We'll get to that. But I also think I have some personal questions about this. I mean, surely people will use this as a novelty, but it's annoying to have to have multiple rideshare apps on your phone. And that's what this is going to be. It's going to compete with taxis and these traditional rideshare apps like Uber and Lyft. And I think some people will have some hesitations about getting into a car without a driver, Richard.",

But you had a lot of pushback to this decision from taxi drivers, from local activists, from city transportation officials, as well as from First Responders. I thought it was really striking. The San Francisco Fire Department told CNN that it's recorded 55 incidents just this year of these driverless cars interfering with emergency responses. The president of the San Francisco Police Officers Association also said in June, that when public safety employees have to try to interact with autonomous vehicles, it is at best frustrating, but when the cars cannot comprehend our demands to move to the side of the roadway, she says and are blocking emergency response units, then it rises to another level of danger. So again, I think this is something we'll be keeping a close eye on. This is something that other companies and other cities will be keeping a close eye on to see what happens in San Francisco now that these things are allowed free on the streets.",

And all those prices have gone up. And at the same time, consumers are spending so much more elsewhere. I mean, Moody's has this new analysis out where they calculate that the average U.S. household is spending more than $700 more per month than they were two years ago on the same goods and services.
