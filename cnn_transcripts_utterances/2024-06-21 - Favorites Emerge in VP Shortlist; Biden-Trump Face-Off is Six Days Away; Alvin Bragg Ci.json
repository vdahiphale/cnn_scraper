As we all witnessed, Trump saw the job of vice president as an ace in the hole for maintaining the presidency, no matter what the voters decided.(END VIDEO CLIP) This time around, Trump is likely applying a Pence-proof loyalty test before he picks a running mate, someone who won't let him down no matter what, and it appears Trump has maybe started to narrow down the shortlist. CNN is reporting that Senator Marco Rubio, Senator J.D. Vance, and North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum are considered the top contenders, at least for now. And behind the scenes, it turns out they each have a network of influential voices bending Trump's ear, trying to convince him to pick their guy for Senator Rubio. He has Fox News host Sean Hannity and Kellyanne Conway in his corner. Not bad. They argued he'd help Trump with Latino voters in key swing states. Rubio even recently won a straw poll at a high dollar dinner last month that Trump attended. J.D. Vance has some MAGA originals backing him. The president's son, Don Jr., Steve Bannon, and Tucker Carlson all pulling for the senator from Ohio, seeing him as a fighter for the MAGA cause. Governor Burgum, meanwhile, is getting backing from big business. The Rupert Murdoch news empire has been praising him with flattering editorials from \"The New York Post\" and \"The Wall Street Journal.\" Not flashy, but mature, they wrote of Burgum. The governor has something else going for him. He appeals to Trump's love of central casting, picking people who look the part. And according to Fox Business, Burgum really looks the part.
