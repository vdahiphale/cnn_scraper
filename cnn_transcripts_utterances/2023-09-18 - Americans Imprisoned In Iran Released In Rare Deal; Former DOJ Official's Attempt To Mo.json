But Secretary of State Antony Blinken, he said earlier in remarks that, look, this is not money that was ever prohibited from being used for humanitarian purposes.

But at the end of the day, it's wonderful that these five families will be reunited. There are two other U.S. nationals still being held in Iran, and that's heartbreaking. So it's just a huge mixed big for everybody[14:05:21] SCIUTTO: I'm sure. A little bit of survivor's guilt, if that's the right term. Siamak Namazi referred to that in his statement for those that are still held behind. Any hostage deal like this, and they are, in effect, hostages, as you were, involves an exchange. And this one involves not just releasing Iranians from US imprisonment, but also $6 billion. Now, you spoke to Brett McGurk, the State Department official responsible, in part, for these negotiations. He said that for any transactions, funds are used to pay vendors for the humanitarian goods. No funds whatsoever are going to Iran specifically. Are you confident the US can enforce the restrictions around the money involved in this trade? Rezaian: I think so. And I think the truth is that accounts like the one that was housed in South Korea and that has been moved to Qatar today have existed for several years. Under the Trump administration, there was very little oversight on those accounts. They were spent down to zero. So,  the mechanisms that are in place now are actually a lot stronger than the ones that had existed previously. At the same time, this idea of concessions for hostage taking, I understand that it's a controversial one, something that many people question. I would caution folks to think about it in those terms. We should be thinking about this in terms of what is the US government, what are our allies doing to prevent this kind of behavior? I don't think that Iran, Russia, China need any more incentives than they already have to take hostages. Because the truth is there's really nothing standing in our way.",

What is to stop it? What policy changes are necessary? Rezaian: I think you have to look at the motivations for each of the governments that do this. And some of the hostage takings, even by a government like Iran, whether it's a US national, British national, Canadian, some other European national, they take them for different reasons. So you really have to look at the motivations and develop deterrence mechanisms that respond to those motivations. Make it costlier than it is beneficial to them. So in the Iranian sense, it's driving up the financial costs of doing this, but also targeting the officials who are involved in what is really an organized crime.",

And what you've seen since is Donald Trump try to navigate his way through, as you noted, sort of focus more on a general election message, which he hasn't really landed on here, versus just playing primary politics. If you look at a poll from the summer, New York Times, Siena College had on this issue. You see that Republicans are supportive of a federal 15-week ban. Fifty-eight percent of likely primary voting Republicans support it. A six-week ban in a state, as Ron DeSantis did, which Donald Trump just said was a terrible mistake yesterday, 60% of Republican primary voters there support that. So it is trying to clearly, you see in the former president, you see with Nikki Haley perhaps navigating a position that is more about having longevity in a general election context than just the short-term appeal to the base in the Republican primary.",
