The storm clouds gather as the World Bank warns of a sharp and long lasting economic slowdown. It will be the developing world that will be hit the hardest. The bank is now projecting global economic growth of only 1.7 percent, down from a forecast of three percent only months ago, and the World Bank says, any further negative shocks could force the world into its second recession in a decade and that hasn't happened in 80 years. The World Bank lowered its growth forecast for nearly all advanced economies and 70 percent of emerging markets. It says the US will grow by barely half a percent, its weakest since 1970. The Eurozone won't grow at all, and Sub-Saharan Africa is expected to grow just over one percent. With the bank warning that growth will lead to rising poverty. Rahel Solomon is with me. We've had successive warnings from the World Bank, the IMF, the OECD, and the like, what makes this one more serious?",

The World Bank describingeconomic conditions as fragile, saying that we are perilously close to falling into a recession. The fact of the matter is the factors are not new. They are the factors that we talk about a lot on this program. Elevated inflation remaining with us for quite some time, higher interest rates, and more aggressive central bankers. Also Russia's invasion of Ukraine. So it's the same old factors, but essentially downgrading its forecast as inflation remains elevated for quite some time.",

Certainly, then you start to have capital inflows moving toward where youcan get a relatively safe investment, right? In the US, in the Eurozone, in a relatively decent rate. David Malpass, the President saying emerging and developing countries are facing a multiyear period of slow growth, driven by heavy debt burdens and weak investment, as global capital, as I said, is absorbed by advanced economies faced with extremely high government debt levels and rising interest rates. So the question of whether we experience a recession, of course, that is still debatable. Goldman Sachs, I should say, just putting out a new note today saying it actually expects the Eurozone to be able to avoid a recession, that coming after its forecast, that the US might also be able to avoid a recession. But the question about whether in fact, we experience a recession is one thing, Richard, but the second part of it is, how deeply will that be felt and that will change depending on what type of nation you are in.

MARK ZANDI, CHIEF ECONOMIST, MOODY'S ANALYTICS: Yes, I think we have a fighting chance, Richard. You know, under any scenario, it is going to be a tough year when you have high inflation and the Federal Reserve raising rates as fast as they are, recession risks are high. But having said that, you know, I think we have a lot of strength. The US economy has a lot of underlying strengths, leverage is low. Generally, across households, businesses, real estate markets are under built. Typically, before recessions they are over built. The banking system is in great shape. State and local governments are flush. You know, I can go on.

There is also the issue, which always happens during boom times and crypto is not the only industry that this takes place. You ramp up aggressively, because times are great and things look awesome. You put out Super Bowl ads, you spend a lot of money to attract talent, you don't think the good times will ever end. Guess what? They do, Richard. You and I both know that. And when they do, if you wound up hiring too many people, you unfortunately have to let some of them go.

He took on a number of other reforms, the famously rigid labor laws here in France, things that he managed to reform. The one sacred cow of the French economy, that social pact that binds France together, as the French see it, the pensions that was a thing he had announced back in 2017, that he still hasn't managed to tackle. Why? Because there was COVID, because there were the yellow vests, you'll remember, that took on those reforms, because when he tried to bring them back in at the end of 2019, they were met by such fierce resistance from the streets, that he had to put them on hold. This time, he has vowed, in fact, he said so at Year's Eve, this will be the year of France's pension reform. Hence, what Elisabeth Borne, the French Prime Minister announced in the Parliament today.

DONIE O'SULLIVAN, CNN TECH CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, so we are seeing the Seattle school district in Washington State, Richard, suing major social media platforms, all the big names -- TikTok, Meta, Facebook -- and saying that essentially they have designed these platforms to be addictive and they are harmful to children, to teenagers' mental health. Look, we have seen some previous cases like this before, with families and whatnot. It is notoriously difficult to prove because the research is going to take time. But certainly, this is going to create a national, international discussion.",

Look, not to speak too much of the ambitions or the intent of the people behind this, the school board. I certainly think what we have seen over the past few years, particularly if you remember that Facebook whistleblower about 1.5 years ago, Frances Haugen. She leaked those documents, internal documents at Facebook, that showed the research it had done itself into the harms of Instagram, particularly on young people. I think, if this goes through the legal process and goes to trial, some of that information coming out and discovering more of what these platforms are doing or what they are not doing and what they really know about the harm they may or may not be having on teenagers or young people. I think it would be illuminating.",

O'SULLIVAN:  Look, it depends on how you judge success here. I think there is clearly a mental health crisis in the U.S. and other parts of the world, by whatever metric you want to look at. Is social media playing a part in that? We have seen, yes. To what degree? I think it is arguable. Look, I don't feel great when I am doom scrolling through Instagram all day and seeing everybody else having a good time and I'm not. So just imagine the impact that might have on a young person's frame. But what we have heard from the experts and psychologists and others in this field, Richard, is that we don't really know the impact that this might have long term on kids yet, because it is still relatively new phenomena, that we are stuck onto our phones all day.",

Together let's have a dash to the closing bell, just over two minutes from now.The chairman of the Federal Reserve, Jay Powell, says it will take some unpopular measures to bring down inflation. The market shrugged off the comments. But the Dow is now over 194 points. If you look at the last few moments, it's roared up. Having been between red and green all morning long and, then in the afternoon, it's put on some real weight. The S&amp;P, the triple stack and the Nasdaq all struggled to stick to the trend. But as you can see, now the Nasdaq is up 1 percent. So the day is ending up to the good overall. Many people are joining gyms this year to make good on New Year's resolutions. Gym owners are happy with it. After working out at Orangetheory, I spoke to chief executive, Dave Long, on whether the fitness industry can handle a recession. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
