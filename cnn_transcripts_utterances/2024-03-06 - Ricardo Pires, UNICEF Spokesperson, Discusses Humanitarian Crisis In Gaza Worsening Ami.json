      "sentences": "Turning now to the latest in the Israel- Hamas war. Hamas saying it's, quote, \"shown flexibility and will continue negotiations to try to reach a ceasefire in Gaza.\"The U.S. and U.K. are among the countries pressuring for an end to the violence as the humanitarian crisis gets dramatically worse. At least 20 people, including newborn babies, have starved to death in northern Gaza according to Palestinian health officials. The real number may be even higher. But aid agencies have limited access in the region. One health worker telling CNN that thousands of babies could starve if Israel's severe restrictions on aid persist. Joining us now is a UNICEF spokesperson, Ricardo Pires. Ricardo, thank you so much for being with us. Obviously, the situation is very dire. And we do want to get a handle on what you have learned about what's going on, on the ground. Can you tell us the very latest?",

      "sentences": "Thanks for having me, Brianna.The situation is catastrophic. It's been terrifying for children in Gaza since the onset of this conflict. And then four months on now, it's just getting to a point nearly of no return. Because as you mentioned, children are dying of starvation when aid and the food and nutrition products that they need so badly to stay alive are only a few kilometers away and not able to get in. So we're really calling for that ceasefire as soon as possible so more humanitarian corridors are open, more aid can get through and the suffering of hundreds of thousands of children -- of children diminishes a little bit. Because right now, they are at severe risk, not only from bombardments and bullets on the ground, but also from disease spreading. And as you said, the lack of food and malnutrition spreading very rapidly.",

      "sentences": "That's a good question, Brianna. We have been alerting the international community and the world over and over since this conflict started, but especially in the last couple of months because we have seen cases of malnutrition increasing.And when it reaches the point of severe acute malnutrition, children are basically fighting for their lives every single minute. And without the proper treatment, without food and without a safe space to recover, they will die. So for us, for UNICEF, this is not surprising. It's tragic, but it's something we saw coming. And we can guarantee that if a ceasefire is not in place, if more aid doesn't get through, these numbers will, indeed, increase and might reach the thousands. Every estimate we put out now, it's very likely to be an underestimate. So what we need now is a ceasefire so we can get in, so humanitarian workers can assess the situation and make sure that the adequate response starts to get in place as soon as possible.",

In fact, over the weekend, we got our first truck to the north of Gaza, which hadn't happened in a while after the tragic incidents of last Thursday when lots of people died trying to access aid in an area that has been completely isolated.But that's correct. We have faced the same issues in terms of getting more supplies in, lengthy inspections, products that are actually really important right now being denied and also long queues to get in and too many sorts of checkpoints along the way. So just a very, very slow process, Brianna, that is preventing the necessary items and life-saving aid to get through. We have an example of wash products, as we call water, hygiene and sanitation products, being denied. That would be used to help rebuilding some of the infrastructure that has been destroyed, including desalination plants that are not fully operational. So it is, indeed, a problem. And it hasn't gotten -- gotten any better. It's actually pretty much the same as it was a couple of months ago, which is just unacceptable, given an acceptable given that children are dying every day for lack of supplies, but also violence on the ground.",

      "sentences": "Again, a very good question, Brianna. Maternal health is a huge concern for UNICEF and it has been again since the onset of this crisis, especially in areas where aid is not getting through, even in the minimum amount.So the main risks they face are, obviously, infections. Given that they're delivering babies without the proper infrastructure, without the proper health care. Most hospitals in Gaza have been destroyed or are not functional or at the brink of collapse. Health workers are stretched there. They're tired. They can no longer cope with the demand that is arriving. And women are sometimes delivering baby, having caesarians without anesthesia, which is, some doctors would think, unimaginable. But it is happening. And they face the threats of any women who would have to deliver a baby, which is a risky process in many cases, without the proper health care and without the infrastructure or the support they need in place in case something goes wrong, which it often happens. So babies and women in Gaza right now, pregnant women who are about to deliver, are high, high risk, Brianna. And were very concerned with the babies that are born and need support, premature babies that need incubators. UNICEF got 50 incubators in the last couple of days into -- into Rafah. But again, this is not enough, just given the sheer number and the huge demand for more support, more health care, more medication, more food, more water, and above all, an urgent ceasefire. KEILAR: Yes. And dehydration causing an issue with breastfeeding very broadly. And then there's a formula shortage and the water isn't clean. It's really a -- really a dire situation. Ricardo, thank you so much for being with us. We really appreciate it.",

And we are very excited to see this administration takes seriously the needs of young voters in this election cycle. But I will say what we have seen in North Carolina, in particular, this a margin that were looking at for the 88,000 voters is not any different than -- and it's actually smaller than what we saw in Barack Obama's reelection campaign. And in 2012 and North Carolina as well. But I do want to make sure that folks understand that people are speaking. And I'm proud honestly to say that folks are using the democratic process to do that rather than saying were just not going to vote.

It's won and lost on the margins.North Carolina has the second-highest rural population besides any state in the country other than Texas right now. And we're looking at an administration that's fundamentally said we believe in revitalizing rural economies again. This is the first federal administration I feel like in history that's invested money directly into communities. These communities need to hear that. The American Rescue Plan Act, the bipartisan infrastructure bill, the Inflation Reduction Act were three historic pieces of legislation that invested money directly into those communities. People and companies like Wolfspeed here in North Carolina, received millions of dollars of investment. Three guys that started a chip manufacturing plant when they graduated from N.C. State University, one of our flagship public universities here in North Carolina, a university system that was founded by Democrats in North Carolina, and really invested in their right and their ideas. And that's what this administration has done. And that's what we've got to tell people across this state this year. Joe Biden lost North Carolina by 20 -- or 74,000 votes in 2020. And we know that we have the ability to go after and chase every single person in this state this year to turn out for him.",
