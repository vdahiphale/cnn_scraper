That prospect is setting alarm bells ringing in the United States which is warning of a potential disaster if a ground operation happens without proper safeguards and planning for civilians. This is what Gaza's southern most city looks like right now. Rafah has effectively become a tent city, housing a million Palestinians or more forced to flee the fighting in northern and central Gaza. They are now bracing for Israeli offensive after Israel's prime minister warned ground troops will move into Rafah soon. Just getting new word about what Netanyahu's plans might be. We've got multiple angles to cover here. Nic Robertson back with us this hour monitoring the situation from Tel Aviv. Nada Bashir is in Cairo with the very latest on how will this impact negotiations for hostage release and any truce at this point. And Oren Liebermann is at the Pentagon with more on U.S. concerns about this expected Israeli offensive in Rafah. Nic, I just need to get to you quickly because we have just had word from Netanyahu who has directed as we understand the military to plan for the, and I quote here, \"evacuation of the population from Rafah alongside the defeat of Hamas in that southern Gaza city.\" He said that the Israeli Defense Forces would soon go into Rafah, Hamas' last bastion.

We know that the U.S. is extremely concerned. Biden, as Nic points out, suggesting -- Joe Biden suggesting that what is going on now is over the top. We know that there are more than a million people crammed up against that Egyptian border. You're in Cairo where the Egyptian government has said any Israeli military operations near the Egyptian border poses dangers to a great number of people in Rafah. It is not clear what Benjamin Netanyahu means when he says that he has directed the military to plan for the evacuation of those down in Rafah.

From the outset of the war in Gaza, we have hearing from the Israeli government warning civilians, ordering them to move south. We have seen the vast majority of Gaza's 2.3 million population now concentrated in that southern region. An estimated 1.3 million are concentrated, taking shelter in the city of Rafah. This has not only been a place for many taking shelter but also a vital gateway for aid to get in via Egypt. We've seen queues and queues of trucks for months now, lining up, trying to get what limited aid is able to get into Rafah through that crucial crossing. And of course we have seen limited evacuations as well via the Rafah Border Crossing. So this is a huge point of concern. We have been hearing those alarm bells being sounded by a number of internationalists and also aid agencies as well. We've heard from the Norwegian Refugee Council warning of the bloodshed that we could see in Rafah as a result of a ground operation with nowhere for civilians to escape, nowhere else for them to turn. And of course important to note that while we are hearing those warnings of ground forces approaching further towards Rafah, we have seen airstrikes being carried out by the Israeli military for some time now in and around the Rafah area. So of course there has already been a huge amount of devastation and suffering in Rafah. We've heard from UNICEF warning there is an estimated 600,000 children taking shelter in the city and of course there have warnings from the United Nations as well. Take a listen to this statement from the U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ANTONIO GUTERRES, U.N. SECRETARY-GENERAL: And I'm especially alarmed by reports that the Israeli military intends to focus next on Rafah, where hundreds of thousands of Palestinians have been squeezed in a desperate search for safety. Such an action would exponentially increase what is already a humanitarian nightmare with untold regional consequences. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

A number of the issues that Hamas had raised in that proposal, described as delusional as far as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is concerned. Oren, let me bring you in. I'm just looking at providing some context for our viewers here. Dallas and San Antonio each have populations of just more than of a million. I'm trying to give our viewers a sense of just how many people are crammed down in the south of the Gaza Strip now, on the Gaza enclave. Secretary of State Antony Blinken has just returned from a trip to the region. I think it's fair to say he left empty handed. I mean, you know, there was there were clearly no wins for Blinken either on the sort of foreign front or domestically where this is playing very badly, of course, for the Biden administration. We do understand while he was in the region, and that counter proposal was on the table from Hamas that he told the Israelis that they absolutely should not or certainly the U.S. does not support a push in to Rafah without significant planning.

Some 1.3 million people there. That's more than half of Gaza's population who have fled to the south looking for safety. And only after we see significant U.S. pressure and significant public statements from the Biden administration does Israel publicly say that the military needs to draw the plan for the civilians there. We heard President Joe Biden say yesterday that there is too much starvation, too much suffering, and too much risk to the Palestinian population in the south there, and it has to stop.

And that is, you know, obviously something we understand to be critical, a critical pillar for the Biden administration at present. I want to get your response to what we have heard just in the last half an hour or so. Benjamin Netanyahu has directed the IDF to draw up a plan for the evacuation of the population from raffling. And let's just be clear. There's a population the size of Dallas squeezed up against the border of Egypt at the bottom of the Gaza Strip at present. And there is a threat of a ground offensive, ground troops going after Hamas in Rafah where they alleged the main military heads are at present. And this has been described by everyone, including the U.S., as a disaster where there are not some planning to be had. Many described that threat of an offensive in Rafah as a negotiation tactic in any deal going forward from Netanyahu. What do you make of what we've heard in the last hour? And do you believe that was a negotiation tactic?",

There is noultimate military solution to release the hostages. The more we wait, the more hostages will be killed. Of the 136 hostages Israel has already document the death, the killing, the execution of 31 of them. Behind the scenes, the number is quite higher. If the Israelis were to encounter the Hamas military leadership and political leadership in the tunnels or bunkers underneath Gaza, they are most likely surrounded by hostages and a gunfight or an explosion could take place that would kill the soldiers, the Hamas leaders and the hostages. There is no military solution to get all the hostages home. There can only be a negotiated agreement with Hamas. There is a possibility, even with the Hamas response for a negotiation, there is some room there. Secretary Blinken was correct in stating that if it is possible to separate phases one, two and three in the agreement and to negotiate first phase one, and if Hamas were to reduce its demands in the kind of Palestinian prisoners it wants to free, there could be a 45-day pause in this war, which enable both sides to take a break. They're both fatigued. They both need to rethink their steps. And perhaps during that time, the United States and the Qataris and the Egyptians and others could come up with a plan that could avoid the attack of Rafah and the 20 percent of Gaza where 1.5 million people are located.",
