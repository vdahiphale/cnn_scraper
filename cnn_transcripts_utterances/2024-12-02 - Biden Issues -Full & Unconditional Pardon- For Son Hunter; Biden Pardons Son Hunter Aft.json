      "sentences": "Today on Inside Politics, family first. The mixed reaction from last night's surprise White House announcement that Joe Biden issued a quote, full and unconditional pardon for his son, Hunter, whom the president says one was unfairly targeted.Plus, he's a conspiracy theorist who openly talks about getting revenge against Donald Trump's perceived enemies. Will Senate Republicans stand in the way of Kash Patel becoming the FBI director? Or confirm the man who promises to dismantle the law enforcement agency and rebuild it exactly how Donald Trump wants it? And Democrats are looking for a new leader. I'll talk to someone who thinks he is best equipped for the job of DNC chair and guiding the party out of the wilderness. I'm Dana Bash. Let's go behind the headlines at Inside Politics. First up, a miscarriage of justice. Those are the exact words both Joe Biden and Donald Trump are using in statements, describing the current president's decision to give his son Hunter a sweeping pardon. Biden released a statement saying, in part quote, I believe in the justice system, but as I have wrestled with this, I also believe raw politics has infected this process and it led to a miscarriage of justice. Donald Trump responded on social media writing, quote, does the pardon given by Joe to Hunter include the J-6 hostages who have now been in prison for years? Such an abuse and miscarriage of justice. Very different context, of course, but noteworthy because Biden appears to be taking a page out of the Trump playbook. Call out your political opponents as you bend some norms. CNN's Arlette Saenz is in Luanda, the capital city of Angola, where Joe Biden just touched down. Arlette, I know you've been working your sources about what went on behind the scenes that led to this announcement last night. What are you learning?",

      "sentences": "Well, Dana, President Biden has said that he wrestled with this decision to pardon his son Hunter Biden. He said he ultimately made the decision as a father, but also as he firmly holds this belief that his son was maligned by Republicans and that many of these charges were politically motivated.Now President Biden landed on this decision over the Thanksgiving holiday in Nantucket, Massachusetts, and he informed his senior staff, I'm told, on Sunday -- on Saturday night when he returned to the White House. Now, just a short while ago, White House Press Secretary Karine Jean- Pierre spent about 25 minutes, fielding questions from reporters exactly on this topic. She stuck very closely to President Biden's statement. But at one point, she did offer one hint of what factored into this decision, saying that President Biden would not have pardoned his son if Vice President Kamala Harris had won the election before she backtracked on that. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (voiceover): Do you think this would have happened if Harris hadn't lost the election? KARINE JEAN-PIERRE, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY (voiceover): Look, I'm not going to -- I'm not going to get into the election. It is a no. I can answer that, it's a no. And what I can say. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (voiceover): It's a no. This would not have happened if Harris hadn't lost the election? The pardon would not have happened in Harris hadn't lost the election. JEAN-PIERRE (voiceover): I can speak to where we are today, and so I can't speak to hypotheticals here. Where we are today, the president made this decision over the weekend. He thought about it. He wrestled with it. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

I'm joined now here at the table with some terrific reporters to dig into all of this, CNN's Jeff Zeleny, The Wall Street Journal's Vivian Salama, CNN's Manu Raju, and CNN legal analyst and former federal prosecutor, Elliot Williams.Let's start with the sort of the legal part of this, and I mean, obviously it is legal. This is allowed under the constitution. Any president can give a pardon. But to kind of dig a little bit deeper, particularly into the question and the comments from the president that we've heard many times, which is that if his name was John Doe and not Hunter Biden. The guilty plea, and then the potential sentence would not be nearly as tough as it is, because he is the president's son. ELLIOT WILLIAMS, CNN LEGAL ANALYST &amp; FORMER FEDERAL PROSECUTOR: It's hard to say for certain. Now, let's look at the data of the number of people that are charged with that particular offense. And we're talking about lying on an application or being a drug user in possession of a firearm. It's certainly not a frequently charged crime, and certainly not charged by itself. Now, often that's the kind of charge that would be tacked on to something else, and you get the guy to plead guilty to that and make a bigger charge go away. It's really hard to look at these offenses and say that the fact that this was such a high-profile case didn't factor into the decision to charge him, right? And it's just a matter of common sense. Now, it's still unlawful conduct, and prosecutors brought it to a grand jury, looked at it and decided to bring the charges. But as a matter of commonsense, Dana, it's just hard to say that this charge would have been brought if this were just an average guy on the street. It's literally hundreds of thousands of applications are denied a year for the kind of firearm offense, and a couple dozen of them maybe are charged, just not common.",

We do not know how high on his list of accomplishments and other things this will be. But as of now, he is leaving with this as a key part of his legacy, and it is a stained part of his legacy. And what I'm just struck by when you think of the arc of Joe Biden, the long arc of Joe Biden elected in the era of Watergate right after that. And now taking his leave from Washington in some 49 days or so, in a very different era. It's a Trumpian era. And some people who admire Joe Biden tell me this is a Trumpian decision, so they don't blame him necessarily. But that does not excuse or change the fact that this may not be something that the Joe Biden, the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, would have done. This is may not be something that Joe Biden who argued for the rule of law, would have done, and it does have consequences many Democrats believe. Again, admirers of Joe Biden what Trump is trying to do to the justice system here. They believe that this sort of feeds into that and politicizes it. But when you sort of step back, I think one of the hypocritical acts is that repeatedly, President Biden and his aide said he wouldn't do this. He would not pardon, so it's not just the pardon the blanket 10- year of 2014 until 2024, that is doing more than pardoning the gun charges. So, look, there is a lot of this, but at the end of the day, he was acting as a father above all.",

I mean, when Bill Clinton did in giving a pardon to Marc Rich, of course, the donor to the Clintons, right in the eyes he was leaving office. That's also a stain on his legacy.What you mentioned there for Donald Trump also undoubtedly a stain going forward. The bigger problem for Biden is just, they were dishonest. He was dishonest with the American public about whether he would give a pardon. He said pretty flatly right before the election, when he was interviewed, when he was still in the race, a couple months out, that he would not give a party. He said that repeatedly they would set Karine Jean-Pierre repeatedly to the American public. So, that is also not only giving it to his son, and you know, pardons always look bad on a president, particularly if giving -- doing it for political favors or a family member. But what he said publicly, they were completely -- they were not straight with the American public. And people remember that.",

And they are now looking at this and saying, well, if Hunter Biden was subject to attack because of politicization. Why not the January 6 rioters? Why not other people?And so, this is something that is definitely fueling that argument. Certainly, Trump seized on that yesterday, after the announcement came out with a posting on his Truth Social, saying that it is a miscarriage -- if it's a miscarriage of justice, then the January 6 riot. You know, he calls them hostages. Need to be -- need to be indicated as well.",

DONALD TRUMP (R), FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT AND CURRENT PRESIDENTIAL-ELECT (voiceover): I wouldn't take it off the books.

It's in the United States, presidents have less power than, frankly, most world leaders. The one unchecked power presidents have is to pardon people unconditionally. And virtually every example that these folks have given today are examples of presidents that pardoned people that were unsavory figures in some way.One we all left out was George H. W. Bush pardoning Caspar Weinberger in the context of Iran-Contra literally selling American weapons to adversaries of the country. This is how the power works. If you don't like it, blame Alexander Hamilton, who wrote it into the constitution in the first place. So, you know, whether it's saber rattling from President Trump about potentially pardoning Hunter Biden, he had the power to do that and may very well have done so. I don't know. RAJU: But I do wonder how Republicans will react to the Charles Kushner pardon from over the weekend. As nominating him to be served as ambassador to France, even though he pleaded guilty to all these charges back in 2005, really only getting the job because of ties going to like the son-in-law's father and Donald Trump, of course, pardon him, which got overshadowed by everything else that happened at the end.",
