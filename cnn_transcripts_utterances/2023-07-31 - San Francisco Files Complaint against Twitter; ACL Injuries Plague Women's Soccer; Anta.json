You can't just come and erect a major sign with connectivity to electricity and not inform pedestrians crossing the street underneath it that there's construction going on. So, I could see where they are frustrated.And then, largely speaking, there have been issues with Twitter in San Francisco for months now. Whether it's Elon Musk refusing to pay rent, not being a very fair member of the city in trying to advocate for reforms. So, I can see why they are frustrated with Musk.",

And they put out a lot of research that shows how hate speech has evolved on the platform, and other platform, but particularly they've put out a lot of data about hate speech under Elon Musk on Twitter. And this has been something that has irked Elon Musk for a long time, in part because he doesn't believe that third-party researchers know what's happening on the platform better than he does. You know, my argument would be, Elon Musk just started to putTwitter's API behind a pay wall. So, if you want people to be able to research and get the access to the data in a fair way, why don't you make it free. But this is part of a larger problem for Elon Musk and Twitter, right? He's trying to go after people who are researching the platform for hate instead of trying to actually tackle the issues with hate speech.

So, what \"The New York Times\" reported is that the Pentagon is trying to buy some of these satellites from Starlink so that it can unilaterally ensure that the connectivity remains in Ukraine and that Elon Musk can't sort of pull the rug out from underneath them.

GUPTA (voice over): Holly Silvers-Granelli is the chair of Major League Soccer's Medical Assessment Research Committee, and this is a disparity she's been trying to draw attention to for decades. GUPTA (on camera): What is going on? SILVERS-GRANELLI: We started looking at this data literally 23 years ago. We had determined that there's anatomic risk factors, there's hormonal risk factors, there's environmental risk factors, which would take into consideration, are you playing on grass or turf or what type of cleat you're wearing. GUPTA (voice over): The anatomy is also pretty fascinating. For starters, women's ACLs, they're just smaller than men. But look over here. Women also have a greater Q-Angle, that's the ratio of hip width to thigh length, which basically means this can happen, the body can more easily go into a knock-kneed position, making the ligament more vulnerable. GUPTA (on camera): Just standing here, how are we different in terms of our biomechanics? SILVERS-GRANELLI: We know that women tend to be a little bit more quad dominant. We tend to be a little bit less underdeveloped on our back muscle groups. Also, when we tend to do things, we tend to do things more upright or erect than men do.",

Now, apparently, some of this heat that's in the ocean globally isstirring into this layer. And even a little bit of heat means it takes a longer time for that heat to come out during winter and freeze the top of the ocean. We think that's what's slowing it down.
