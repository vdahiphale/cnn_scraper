CNN is in Damascus. We'll bring you that report shortly. Plus, a last push for the outgoing Biden administration to negotiate a Gaza ceasefire. U.S. National Security adviser Jake Sullivan, who is in the region, says he is hopeful an agreement will be reached sooner than expected. And French President Emmanuel Macron names a new centrist prime minister. But will it be enough to break the political deadlock? In Syria, a day of celebration of freedom after years of oppression by a brutal regime. This is how it looked and sounded in Homs. Thousands of Syrians gathered there to hold Friday prayers for the first time since the fall of President Bashar al-Assad. And scenes like this are playing out across Syria as the country looks toward what the rebel leader who led the forces ousting Assad promises will be a peaceful transition to a new era. He also issued a warning, to avoid celebrating with guns after someone in Raqqa fired bullets into the air Thursday, sparking chaos that witnesses say left at least one person dead and 15 injured. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ABU MOHAMMAD AL-JOLANI, SYRIAN REBEL LEADER (through translator): I would like to congratulate the great Syrian people on the victory of the blessed revolution. I call upon them to take to the squares and express their joy over this achievement, but without firing bullets or causing fear among the people.

And so we are hearing from Sullivan when he's traveling the rhetoric of this, in essence, last ditch effort to bring these hostages home to get a deal and really putting a time stamp on this. It was notable yesterday after a meeting with Netanyahu, that Sullivan specifically said he hopes that a deal can get done this month. That interesting time stamp there. And he's also intimating that there's a new tone to the talks, a new sense of urgency and momentum. After he met with Netanyahu and some of the top security and policy aides there, he said that there's a renewed sense of momentum after the long impasse. He said the surround sound of these negotiations is different today than it has been in the past. And as you noted in the introduction there, Omar, that he is off to go to Cairo and Doha, the moderators, some of the moderators in these talks, to add to these negotiations that are happening behind closed doors, I should say that, although we hear from him in the White House, this newly optimistic tone, we don't know details of a deal. We don't know what the specifics are. And obviously we have to urge caution, as he did when he spoke to reporters in Israel yesterday that even though it feels good, the direction is heading in the right direction, that something certainly to note that these are sensitive negotiations and nothing certainly is final until it is -- Omar.",

Whether Francois Bayrou can stay longer, much depends, of course, now on what happens in parliament. He's going to have to name a new government that the three very different blocs in parliament can agree upon, or at least that none can vote down. But he is considered a centrist. He is well-respected in French politics. He's been further to the right at times under certain presence, closer to the left, at others forming his own middle party. The modem many years ago.

But what our reporting, our sources are telling us is that it just isn't clear who is going to be pardoned and how, among these January 6th rioters, will it be all of them? Will it be done in a blanket fashion? Will rioters or the defense attorneys have to apply to someone, or somehow within the Trump administration or the Trump transition to get individual names included in that list? And there's other questions about, do they draw a line somewhere on who is technically a nonviolent rioter? There are many, about 200, that have been convicted of assault. But those assaults range in the severity. Some of them are deeply violent assaults that some of these January 6th rioters had toward police, where they were beating police officers. There were others where the assault is much less aggressive, sort of pushing over a barrier, slamming a door in the face of someone. So there are a lot of questions. And the Trump transition, it appears that they just haven't figured it out yet. That's what our sources have been telling us, who are in touch with at least one Trump transition staffer. All at the same time there's this anticipation of the pardoning of January 6th rioters. But judges who have handled these 1500 or so cases in the D.C. district court, they are making clear that they believe that these people who are Capitol rioters are being brought to justice and should be even if the president wants to pardon them. Judge Royce Lamberth, on the bench in Washington, D.C., he said at a hearing I was at last Friday these people chose to trespass on restricted grounds, destroy public property, assault law enforcement officers and attempt to subvert the will of an electoral majority. Conduct such as this is light years outside the egis of the First Amendment. Every rioter is in the situation he or she is in because he or she broke the law and for no other reason. There's another judge, a Trump appointee, Carl Nichols, at a hearing for another January 6th defendant, he said that he believed blanket pardons would be beyond frustrating and disappointing. So a lot of questions exactly how this is going to play out, when Trump may or may not fulfill his campaign promise of pardoning the January 6th rioters. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

It's part of the Rolex Perpetual Planet Initiative, and today we join them as they seek to learn about the mysterious deep sea coral forests and everything that inhabits it in the hopes of protecting its future. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BILL WEIR, CNN CHIEF CLIMATE CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): The discovery of the Fourni marine animal forest is the result of years of planning, but it is also only the beginning. Now, Under the Pole will collaborate with Lorenzo Bramanti, a renowned coral ecologist, to collect as much data as possible to aid in the protection of this precious new discovery. LORENZO BRAMANTI, SCIENTIFIC CO-DIRECTOR, DEEPLIFE: For the first time, me and other colleagues are trying to really define this concept of forest and putting in a scientific quantification that makes it possible to use it in conservation. GHISLAIN BARDOUT, CO-FOUNDER, UNDER THE POLE: Gorgonians or black corals are like trees, let's say small trees. They can be that high, that high, that high. But they are really a shelter, a habitat for many other species.",

Originally used for military purposes, rebreathers absorb the carbondioxide from each exhale and recycles it back through a closed circuit as oxygen. This allows divers to stay underwater for far longer than scuba tanks and without bubbles, causing a lot less disruption to the sea life. G. BARDOUT: It's a revolution in underwater exploration to dive deeper, longer, safer, and that enables new scientific programs to get a better understanding of the ecology of the depths. E. BARDOUT: Every deep dive is very tiring physiologically. Sometimes we lose five kilograms during one dive. It's just water, but it's very dehydrating to dive like this.",

Exploration for exploration's sake is not enough. So we need this very strong collaboration with scientists. And this is what I love, is that we take very different person with very different specialty where different of working all together to work for one purpose. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
