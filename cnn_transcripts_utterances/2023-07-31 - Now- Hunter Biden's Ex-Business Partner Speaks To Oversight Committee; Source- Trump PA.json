And we're learning now, after one Democrat member of the House Oversight Committee emerged from this three-hour meeting now, which is still going on, connecting President Biden to the business dealings. The emergent said, look, this testimony has offered no proof connecting the president to his son's foreign dealings. Congressman Dan Goldman, the Democrat on the committee, did say that Archer testified that Hunter and his son -- Joe Biden, did speak every day, that, at times, Hunter Biden would be in a setting where there would be business partners present, but not once, according to Goldman, did the dealings ever come up. So, you know, Jim Jordan, a Republican member of the committee, has also left the interview. Republicans seems like they're done with their questioning. Jordan didn't have a lot to say. He called the meeting productive. But, you know, Goldman, my comparison, spoke to reporters at length. So we're really getting the first details of what Archer is saying in this interview. Democrats now have now returned to question the witness as well. But according to Goldman, there's nothing directly linking the president to his son's foreign business dealings, which is what Republicans set the standard as going in.",

The York Fire has consumed 75 acres and, right now, is zero percent contained. Also, the city of San Francisco, not a fan of Twitter's rebrand. City officials visited the company's headquarters twice regarding the new flashing \"X\" sign on top of the building. Owner Elon Musk changed Twitter's branding to \"X\" last week. The city appears to have issued a notice of violation for work done without a permit for the new sign. CNN has reached out to \"X\" and the city for comment. Meantime, in North Carolina, police are searching for a man they say intentionally hit six migrants with his car. All six victims were taken to a hospital with various injuries.
