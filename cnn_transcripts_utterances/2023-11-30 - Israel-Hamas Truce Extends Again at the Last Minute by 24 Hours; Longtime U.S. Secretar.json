I'm Rosemary Church.Well both sides have agreed to extend their temporary pause in fighting for a seventh day. The news came just minutes before the six- day truce was set to expire. Israel says it agreed to extend the deal in light of mediators' efforts to continue the process of releasing hostages. And we've now learned that Israel has received a list of people to be released today. A total of 16 hostages were set free by Hamas on Wednesday, including 10 Israelis under the terms of the truce. Four Thai nationals and two Russian-Israeli women were released under separate deals. Israeli-American Liot Benin is among those now free. U.S. President Joe Biden says he is gratified by her release. Israel freed another 30 Palestinian women and children from its prisons as part of its agreement with Hamas. Many of them were in administrative detention and never charged. Meanwhile, a group of Thai hostages is set to arrive back in Thailand soon. Many were working on Israeli farms when Hamas attacked back on October 7th. And U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken is in Israel where he met with President Isaac Herzog. Here's what Blinken had to say about the release of hostages on Wednesday. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ANTONY BLINKEN, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE: From day one, we have been focused relentlessly on trying to secure the release of hostages from Gaza and from Hamas. And we have seen over the last week the very positive development of hostages coming home, being reunited with their families. And that should continue today. It's also enabled an increase in humanitarian assistance to go to innocent civilians in Gaza who need it desperately. So this process is producing results. It's important, and we hope that it can continue. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And so I think, you know, any tactical benefit should be celebrated. But I think, you know, I'm concerned that the truce is fragile, that Hamas may be struggling to obtain hostages that are held by other militant and criminal groups, Palestinian Islamic Jihad, criminal elements from Gaza that were part of the October 7 attack.

Even if the emissions targets were met by countries that they are pledging, we would be way over where we need to be to limit global warming to around 1.5 degrees Celsius, which is what the Rome statutes, sorry, the Paris Agreement was calling for. So there is a sense that the backroom negotiations will be tough. One of the key issues, Rosemary, will be over this plan to try and have concrete steps to phase out fossil fuels with concrete timings without that say U.N. officials and others there will be no real a way to combat the climate crisis there'll be other issues on the table particularly financing poorer nations but this couple last for two weeks or so and we will only know in the coming days whether those aims will in fact be put down on paper and met.
