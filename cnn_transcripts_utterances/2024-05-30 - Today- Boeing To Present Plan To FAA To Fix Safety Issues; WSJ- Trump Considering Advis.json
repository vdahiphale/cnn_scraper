Boeing stresses that it has already laid out clear assembly line instructions for workers, as well as training improvements for the tools also on the factory floor.Notably, Boeing says it's now hounding suppliers to no longer ship defective parts. Remember, it was an issue with the fuselage built by the supplier called Spirit AeroSystems that caused Boeing workers to remove the door plug on the 737 that was ultimately delivered to Alaska Airlines. The door plug was put back but all of the bolts were not. Boeing in, in general, just trying to fix its safety culture. And a report found that Boeing had gaps in the safety culture there -- something underscored by whistleblowers -- that has led to delays in certification and deliveries of planes. We will be keeping an eye on what is in this new plan. Outgoing Boeing CEO Dave Calhoun also reportedly going to be in this meeting with the FAA administrator today, Kate.",

      "sentences": "All right. A new report in The Wall Street Journal says that Donald Trump is considering and advisory role for Elon Musk, the Tesla CEO and faltering social media mogul. That is, if Trump gets back to the White House.The Journal writes, \"...the two men are developing a friendly rapport and talk on the phone several times a month as the election nears, the people familiar with their talks said. The pair have held discussions on immigration, technology and science, including the U.S. Space Force. Their views and interests have grown more aligned, the people said, with Musk calling Trump directly on his cellphone.\" Joining me now is Cara Lombardo, deputy Wall Street bureau chief of The Wall Street Journal, who is one of many reporters on the byline of this story. Thanks so much for being with us. So just talk to me first about the nature of this relationship. CARA LOMBARDO, DEPUTY WALL STREET BUREAU CHIEF, THE WALL STREET JOURNAL (via Webex by Cisco):  Yeah, John, thanks for having me. And it's pretty striking. I mean, Trump and Musk historically, just a few years ago, were trading insults with each other. Now, as you said, they speak on the phone several times a month. Musk calls Trump up directly on his cellphone. It's kind of interesting but not that surprising if you think about Trump. I mean, he's someone who is obviously drawn to wealth and power. Musk is one of the world's richest people. He oversees a sprawling business empire not only of Tesla but Twitter and SpaceX, which is a rocket company. So it's not surprising that Trump would be interested in getting to know Musk. At the same time, Musk's politics have shifted rightward recently. He's tweeted about being frustrated with some of the directions in the Democratic Party. DEI initiatives, for example, are something he doesn't like. And migration, in particular, has really caught his attention as a major issue and has heavily criticized Biden about that.",

      "sentences": "It's interesting because we have blueprints for this actually. The advisory role -- our understanding -- and, of course the details aren't worked out -- this is all preliminary, but it would be something informal. That would be useful for Musk because it likely would not require him to walk away from his business dealings or wall them off.In Trump's other first term, he had several business moguls kind of in his ear informally advising him on a variety of topics -- one which was billionaire investor Carl Icahn. In Carl Icahn's case, this was not an official role. It didn't require confirmation and he didn't have to walk away from his business dealings. So we expect it will be something like that if it comes together.",

They've talked about Tesla on their calls.As we know, Trump, on the campaign trail, has been tough on EVs. Musk, himself, has even made comments -- you know, anti-EV tax credits. He's kind of been a mixed bag when it comes to that issue over the years. So we can't quite parse that out yet but that will be something that I think people will be deeply interested in given the humongous impact that has on Tesla's business.",

But there's a suggestion of a kind of behind-the-scenes dynamic, as you mentioned.So our understanding is so far, he's resisted endorsing. He's resisted giving large sums of money to any candidate. But he is not only talking about this advisory role but also planning two projects on the side with a friend of his that have the goal of helping Trump win a reelection. So one of those projects is a major data-driven project to lead out what they consider voter fraud -- obviously, an issue that Trump has talked about without evidence for a while. And another project is this series of salon-style dinner parties with influential business leaders that Trump and his -- sorry, that Musk and his friend Nelson Peltz, the investor, are arranging around the country. And the idea there will be to highlight what they see as shortcomings in Biden's administration rather than directly endorse Trump.",

The study looked at nearly 12,000 people in Sweden and it found that those who had tattoos had a 21 percent increased risk of malignant lymphoma compared with people who had no tattoos. And the researchers say that we do need more research in this area. It was just an associate that was found.But they also pointed out that there was no evidence that having more tattoos led to an even higher risk. And they also point out that this is just, again, a correlation. It does not imply causation. So if you have a tattoo and you see this study, there's no need to panic. The researchers say we need to look more into what could be possibly behind this association. They say maybe it's because the tattoo ink itself often contains carcinogenic chemicals. But again, more research is needed here, Kate. So the main takeaway is that we just need more study in this space, especially because we know that here in the United States, 32 percent of adults have a tattoo. So any research related to tattoos, of course, will get a lot of attention, Kate. And the researchers say we do need more research in this particular area.",

And if home prices drop, borrowers would instantly be underwater where they owe more than the home is worth. That's exactly what happened during the subprime meltdown 20 years ago.So imagine a scenario where you lose your job or run into financial trouble and you have to sell your home. Even if you're underwater you still owe that second mortgage. And if you don't have the cash to come up with it, you're at risk of foreclosure and damaging your credit.

It is the following. \"There's a steady drumbeat of speculation within Trump's orbit that the former president's flair for the dramatic will at some point take over. Many around the campaign believe the lack of secrecy surrounding the open audition raises the possibility Trump ultimately picks someone off the public's radar.\"A dramatic reveal would be, would do, could do I don't know, what to the race. I mean, do you think it's shaking things up? Is that what -- is that what Trump's campaign needs right now? JULIE ROGINSKY, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST, CO-FOUNDER, LIFT OUR VOICES:  I mean, have we not learned about Donald Trump after all these years? Of course, it's dramatic.

Donald Trump needs cash desperately, and Donald Trump doesn't want anybody with his own profile or her own profile to overshadow him, right?Mike Pence was perfect for him because Mike Pence walked behind him like a dutiful medieval wife and effectually, like, did nothing to overshadow him whatsoever. Doug Burgum is the guy because Doug Burgum has an unlimited amount of money he can put into a PAC for Trump if he wanted to and fund the campaign that Trump is having a hard time funding right now. And he's kid of a low-key guy. He's not somebody who is going to have his own profile, like J.D. Vance. He's not somebody who is going to be the first of anything, like a Tim Scott. He's going to be a Mike Pence with cash and that, I think, is something that is very appealing to Donald Trump. So it could be dramatic. It could be a whole \"APPRENTICE\" type selection process. But I think at the end of the day, Trump is going to revert back to what he needs, which is money and somebody who is going to do what he wants and not overshadow him.",
