Hostage taking is hostage taking. And it is -- I'm sure, many of our viewers would agree -- is psychological terror and a cynical use of Israeli citizens by Hamas. The fact is, this is a war and that is what's going on. We await to see whether we can get more information at this point. But certainly, you know, the expanded operations as having been described by the IDF as now ongoing, perhaps, obviously, changing the equation somewhat in what was very hopeful signs for the release of some of these hostages.

I'm not suggesting for a moment that all 229 were discussed. I don't know that. Certainly, there were numbers floating around as many as 50 or possibly more. So I think you could possibly suggest that those Qatar-led negotiations including Egypt this week and last Friday was a test case for what might happened next. At this stage, obviously, we wait to see what happens in the hours to come.",

He said, \"Regarding the rumors circulating, over 200 hostages held in Gaza and a deal,\" he said \"I will answer it this way. I suggest you disregard rumors. This is psychological terror and a cynical use of Israeli civilians by Hamas. \"We will reach and present any credible information whether civilian, intelligence or operational, any relevant information will be given to the families first once confirmed and then we'll notify the public. \"Until then, don't surrender to Hamas' manipulations\" of what he described as \"psychological terror.\" I want to check in with Nic Robertson in Sderot right now.

And they said it was also kind of looking for any kind of munitions that might be there, eliminating any reconnaissance towers or observation posts that might be there. They called it a prelude to any other force that would come across. Do we know how frequent that has been taking place?",

And it was an incursion south of there and that seemed to be a single incursion. To locate that precisely, that's right on the northern edge of Gaza, not far from and a few miles from the sea. The IDF this morning talked ability, spoke about incursions last night and they spoke about incursions that were further south towards Harmunis. We're talking about 10, 12, 15 miles south of where we are, the central and southern central Gaza area. So those incursions there, it's not clear how many, but the indication was that a couple of different locations. We're not getting entire specifics because, obviously, that's operational detail that the IDF doesn't want to put in the public domain. As you say, it will be used for the follow-on incursions of other troops to come in, in a safer manager. As you were discussing with General Wesley Clark earlier, to rush others in quickly can lead to casualties on your own side. That's something that IDF will have great concern about because that is politically very sensitive. The higher the casualty toll on the IDF side, on the Israeli side, the greater the political pressure would be on the government to change course and try a different approach. That's not the intent of this government. They really do want to see this through to the end, the end being the destruction of Hamas -- Anderson?",

We've been watching both the skies over Gaza and listening as well with our correspondents all along the border. Sara Sidner is with me in Tel Aviv. There has been a lot of waiting for an operation to begin, a lot of questions about why a larger operation has not begun. There were a lot of Israeli officials talking about an imminent ground operation weeks ago. What are you hearing? SARA SIDNER, CNN ANCHOR &amp; SENIOR NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: I think there is a little bit of a dissension between some in the military, some in the government trying to figure out what they can do. Because they're worried about three different things. One is a long war where they're on the ground in urban warfare that can be deadly and dangerous and very deadly not only for Israeli troops but civilians as well. Two is the wider war. They're concerned whether or not Hezbollah is going to get involved in a much larger way if they go in full scale on the ground. You can see thousands of Israeli troops on the ground in Gaza. Three really is what they do if they go in with the full thousands of troops inside of Gaza. Do they stay, try to govern Gaza? This has happened before and they left. So there are these three things sort of hanging over them. You have one more that is different from times past when they have taken, for example, one soldier. They have more than 200 people who are hostages, innocent people taken by Hamas, that are still there in those tunnels. And so they also have to make that a calculation, never mind the civilian casualties that they are racking up at this point inside of Gaza.",

And already, there are some nations asking for a ceasefire. And as that cry grows, with the number of civilians killed, Israel is going to, at some point, respond to that. They cannot keep going at this pace. So something has to give. We'll wait and see. But the reservists -- and we've been talking to a few of them -- they're ready whenever they're asked at this point because of what happened on October 7th, because they all know someone who was killed or kidnapped.",

Anderson, and a short while ago, the White House national security spokesperson briefed reporters and was very quite careful and deliberate in not weighing in specifically on the tactics being used by Israel right now when it comes to a possible ground operation.The White House saying it would not be appropriate at this time to weigh in on those matters, that ultimately these decisions are up to the Israeli Defense Forces. In addition to that, the White House has also talked about the need to continue the talks when it comes to trying to free the hostages, which includes several Americans. John Kirby, the National Security Council spokesperson, says the U.S. does support a pause if there would be an opportunity get these hostages out. That is something the U.S. is in active conversations with Israel about this moment. It comes at a delicate time, as we're seeing Israel pick up their operations, whether strikes or this ground operation, against Hamas. And it comes as President Biden, just on Wednesday, had said that he believes that Israel does have the responsibility to go after Hamas, but they also need to ensure the protection of civilians is top of mind in this moment. Now the president earlier today was briefed by his national security team, including national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin. The White House wouldn't detail whether it involved discussions about the ground operations. But it does come as the White House has been watching this with much concern when it comes to the civilian lives and the efforts to get hostages out from Hamas.",

Of course, also Hamas, backed by Iran.And in particular, a greater alert as they've expanded operations now no Gaza. Today, up here, we saw two Hezbollah strikes towards Israel. One falling in Israel. Another one that seemed to go off course and go into northern Syria. Israel responding to those. And as we've been up here, we've heard outgoing Israeli artillery. At this point, though, it has maintained sort of what you might call a low simmer of tensions between Hezbollah and Israel. The real concern is, as those operations expand into Gaza, that Hezbollah would amp up its reaction and attempt to attack more aggressively. And I can tell you, having spoken to IDF forces up here over the last several days, they have tens of thousands of them. A raid on the northern border, they are watching very closely for exactly that scenario. There is also the concern, of course, looking to Israel's northern border with Syria, where there are also Iranian-backed militias. And that's exactly where the U.S. carried out strikes today because those Iranian-backed militias, over the last several days, have been taking shots at U.S. forces in the region, both in Syria and in Iraq. And those strikes today from the U.S. on those Syrian bases seems to be a message: Don't even think about attacking U.S. forces or, if you do, the U.S. is going to take that very seriously. That was clear in Secretary Austin's statement on those strikes, saying it's separate from Israel's operations against Hamas in Gaza. But if Iran is thinking about further expanding those attacks, that the U.S. is going to respond accordingly.",

Because it's two carrier groups in the eastern Mediterranean with all the military capabilities that they carry as well as other forces coming into the region for forced protection, increased missile defense.We saw a case already of a U.S. destroyer off the coast of Yemen shooting down missiles fired by Iranian-backed Houthis, the U.S. believes, toward Iran (sic), that that is a substantive military presence in the region that gives them the capability to defend Israel, defend U.S. bases in the region. But also to react if Iran attempts to expand this war either through its own forces or through its proxies. And as you say, Anderson, there were a lot of folks here in Israel who give some credit to that deployment for helping to deter an expansion, at least so far.",
