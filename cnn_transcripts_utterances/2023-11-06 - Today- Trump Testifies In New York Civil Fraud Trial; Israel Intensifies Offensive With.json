      "sentences": "Good morning. Thank you for being up early with us. I'm Kasie Hunt. It is 5And in only a few hours, former President Trump takes the stand in the New York attorney general's civil fraud lawsuit. Trump and his company are on trial for repeatedly inflating the value of his properties to get better terms on real estate loans and deflating them for insurance purposes. Attorney General Letitia James is seeking to bar Trump from doing business in his commercial home base of New York, along with getting $250 million, potentially, in damages. Joining us now, CNN legal analyst and criminal defense attorney, Joey Jackson. Joey, it's always good to see. Thanks for being here. The stakes today for Trump are incredibly high. The business -- his whole business is on the line. I mean, Trump is obviously now known for being faithful to the truth on the regular but he is going to be under oath today. And we know things are going -- he can get touchy when things don't go his way. What should we be looking for today? JOEY JACKSON, CNN LEGAL ANALYST, CRIMINAL DEFENSE ATTORNEY (via Webex by Cisco):  Yeah, Kasie, good morning to you. So, to me, it's all about knowledge, direction, and control, right? And that, to the extent that we're talking about that -- to what extent was he knowledgeable as to the affairs of his company? By the way, I'm running the free world. To what extent was he directing the operations of the company? And to what extent was he controlling it? And in doing that, Kasie, what I'm really looking to see is whether he's testifying or campaigning. Remember, he always embraces the narrative that this is a witch hunt. That the attorney general indicated during her campaign that she would get him, and here she is doing so. But in doing that and in having that narrative, and in campaigning, that's something that could play to a jury. There is no jury here. And so, to that extent, you have to really answer questions. The judge is going to be focused in on the facts of the case -- not so much the grievances but the facts. So I want to know how he embraces it, how he spins. Is he going to say he runs a perfect company? The Trump brand is very significant, valuations are subjective, and how dare you challenge the fact that I'm not worth the billions of dollars that we indicated that we are worth? So I'm looking for all of those things as he testifies today, Kasie.",

And in sending that message, this is a judge who has held him essentially in contempt inasmuch as finding him not to be credible and fining him, right, twice already.In addition to those fines that were imposed and him saying that the former president was incredible, there was some issue prior to trial because the Trump team wouldn't hand over discovery, right? That's information that's needed for a case to move forward that has evidentiary value and it needs to be seen, scrutinized, and analyzed even before a trial continues. So there's some concern leading up to the trial. So certainly, the dynamic is tense and will the judge and will Mr. Trump be able to coexist in that regard? Will Mr. Trump be able to answer the questions directly posed? Will he be spinning and campaigning or will he be answering specific things about his property -- the knowledge he had as to its value and the control and direction that he was engaged in? And so, I think the judge has to be and will be in every effort, right, to be impartial and listen to the testimony. But I think he'll have Mr. Trump on a short string and want him to answer the questions and not be really giving a narrative to the seats and people who are not in the courtroom, and that of the voters who will be deciding the campaign.",

One, the poll -- the polls are concerning. Yes, they're all -- it's hard to say the sky is red when it's blue, right? It's a bad poll. But polls are a report card, right? They're a report card for this moment in time. The grade you get today does not mean it's the grade you're going to get next week or next year. So, we should be organizing and putting their heads down. They're raising a ton of money. If the election were held today -- one thing that I would say is that voters in the last three national elections have always proven the polls wrong. And if the election were to be held today -- based on voting behavior in recent years and the hard data that we have on Independents, if the election were held today between Donald Trump and Joe Biden, Joe Biden would win.

Another reason why more people in the region, especially Arab leaders that have been meeting with U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, keep asking for a ceasefire. The U.S. and Blinken insist that a ceasefire would give Hamas an opportunity to regroup and they -- the U.S. would rather see a pause in the offensive. But Israel says that pause or any break into the offensive will not happen unless all the hostages are being released.
