And for this one, the setting is the message. Harris will speak from The Ellipse, the very spot that Donald Trump told his supporters on January 6th to fight like hell, setting in motion the attack on the U.S. Capitol that followed.Now, almost four years later, the Harris campaign says they expect a crowd of 20,000 people at that same spot. The split screen, entirely intentional. As for Donald Trump, he's headed to Allentown, Pennsylvania today, a majority Latino city with a sizable Puerto Rican population, noteworthy because his campaign is struggling to contain the anger sparked by so-called jokes about Puerto Ricans told by a warm up act at his rally Sunday. And last night, he had this new message for his supporters. Quote, I'm the opposite of a Nazi. Let's start with Kevin Liptak, who's at The Ellipse for us this morning. Kevin, what are you hearing from the Harris campaign about what's going to happen there today?",

This morning, Donald Trump will speak at Mar-a- Lago before heading to Pennsylvania, but the campaign still trying to clean up the potential political mess after the racist, vulgar, misogynistic rally in Madison Square Garden. His allies worrying that the comments made at the rally could hurt them in key battleground states, such as Pennsylvania, where he's heading today.CNN's Steve Contorno joins me now. Steve, what do we expect to hear from Trump when he speaks from Mar-a-Lago today?",

      "sentences": "Well, Sara, this was a last minute schedule edition from Donald Trump. And we are told that the purpose of this is to sort of preempt Vice President Harris' remarks later today in Washington, D.C. We saw him do something similar last week when she held her rally in Houston. He decided at the last minute to hold a remarks to the press is what they called it in the city of Austin, and that's what we are expecting today.So, we're not necessarily anticipating any questions, him taking any questions, so we might not even get him addressing the elephant in the room, what happened at Madison Square Garden. But we do know that there are people behind the scenes within his orbit who are very concerned about what transpired on Sunday, mostly because they think that it might overshadow his campaign's closing message to voters. And there could be potentially political fallouts in a key battleground state like Pennsylvania. It has a sizable Puerto Rican population and then there is concern that Democrats could mobilize even just a fraction of that support to help Vice President Harris and hurt Donald Trump. Now, I will say, I cover Florida politics. Democrats have tried this here before. Donald Trump has had a long record of disparaging Puerto Rico. You remember the videos of him tossing paper towels to Hurricane Maria survivors. They tried to use that to mobilize voters, Puerto Rican voters, in 2020. And it did not go necessarily as planned. In fact, in the county with the highest Puerto Rican population, Donald Trump won -- or, excuse me, performed seven points better than he did in 2016. So, you know, there's a lot of conventional wisdom about how this could hurt Donald Trump. That might not actually come to pass despite what happened on Sunday night. Now, Trump also continues to push back against this rhetoric that he is a fascist. We saw him do that yesterday in Georgia. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP (R), FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT, 2024 PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: The newest line from Kamala and her campaign is that everyone who isn't voting for her is a Nazi. I had a great father. He's a tough guy. He used to always say, never use the word, Nazi, never used that word. And he said, never used the word Hitler. Don't use that word. And yet they use that word freely, both words. They use it. He's Hitler. And then they say, he's a Nazi. I'm not a Nazi. I'm the opposite of a Nazi. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Now, he's not filed that many cases. He said that he's betting each and every one. Now, to that point, prosecutors are definitely looking at the new allegations and to the extent there's more to pursue from an investigation standpoint, they're absolutely going to do that.
