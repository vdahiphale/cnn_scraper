Former finance minister Rishi Sunak in House of Commons leader Penny Mordaunt are in the running. While former leader Boris Johnson announce he'd be bowing out. Mordaunt has said she's in it to win it. While Sunak says he wants to fix the economy and unite the party. CNN Scott McLean is following developments from outside 10 Downing Street and I'm joined here in London by John Rentoul, chief political commentator with \"The Independent\" and visiting professor at King's College London. Well, let's begin by going to our Scott outside Downing Street, not far from here. Scott, Johnson has said when he announced that he was backing out yesterday that he had the votes but not the unity. I mean, I guess we'll never know whether or not he was telling the truth, but the reality is that this could help Penny Mordaunt with that 100 vote count even though we know Sunak is the clear front-runner this morning.",

      "sentences": "Yes, so what we know From the British Press Association, Christina, is that in terms of public declarations of support, Rishi Sunak has more than 140. Penny Mordaunt has less than 30. At least publicly Boris Johnson had more than 50 but still well short of the 100 he would have needed. Now it is entirely possible that he did, in fact, have the 102 MPs that he says he did behind him, but good chunk of them were unwilling to come out publicly with that declaration given the political sensitivity around picking a -- backing a horse this late in a race.But you're right. Penny Mordaunt now is trying desperately to pick up some of those supporters from the Boris Johnson camp as is Rishi Sunak as well. And if there are indeed 102 of them, Mordaunt will have her work cut out to get the lion's share. She has sort of built herself as the unity candidate between the warring camps of Boris Johnson Rishi Sunak who is credited with perhaps being the man who caused the down fall of Boris Johnson in the first place when he resigned as his position chancellor. So, Mordaunt will have to pick up some of those votes. And both of these candidates have been rather conciliatory when it comes to the news that Boris Johnson was dropping out of the race. Rishi Sunak for his part said, that although he has decided not to run for Prime Minister again, I truly hope he continues to contribute to public life. While Penny Mordaunt said: In taking this difficult decision last night, Boris Johnson has put country before party and party before self. He worked to secure the mandate and the majority we now enjoy. We should put it to good use and I know he will work with us to do so -- Christina.",

And you're right, he will have some serious decisions ahead of him. The current Chancellor, Jeremy Hunt has already called them eye watering and that is after they reversed virtually everything that was in that now disastrous mini budget.There is still a lot more to do to fill the black hole in public finances and whether or not you're going to trim back from the promises on defense spending or health care or any number of other areas. Or try to kind of trim the fat from all the government departments. These are all the decisions Rishi Sunak will have. Now he is well positioned that in the fact that he was sort of the architect of the massive public spending that we saw throughout the course of the pandemic. And clearly, he had a plan in mind to actually pay it back afterwards. Whether or not that plan can go ahead as he originally envisioned it given inflation at this point is another thing. But he'll have also not only this but he'll also have to contend with, of course, the war in Ukraine, which Britain continues to be a huge supporter of the Ukrainian government, plus a number of looming public sector strikes over the winter. There's no shortage of things for Rishi Sunak to get to work on and this on top of winning back public favor for his own party if he has any chance of actually remaining Prime Minister beyond the next two years.",

But he was the best candidate to unite the party as much as possible because -- rather than the alternatives which is Boris Johnson and Penny Mordaunt. And he's also going to be helped in his initial days and weeks in office by the fact that Liz Truss has made such a mess of the economy and such a mess of the premiership that he can blame a lot of the chaos on her. He can say, well at least interest rates gone up, it's most unfortunate because my predecessor blew up the government. Whereas if he'd won in September, he would have faced -- I mean, he wouldn't have faced quite such bad problems, but he would have faced rising interest rates and rising inflation.",

Thankfully there were no injuries and all 162 passengers safely evacuated. The airline said the flight which originated in South Korea had attempted to land twice in poor weather before overshooting the runway on the third attempt. Goodness me.Well, the U.S., U.K. and France are joining Ukraine in rejecting an unsupported claim from Russia that Kyiv may be using or about to use a dirty bomb. Russia's defense minister made the claim during calls with his Western counterparts including the U.S. defense secretary. But Ukraine says it's an attempt by Moscow to escalate the war. Meantime, Russia appears to be losing more ground in the Kherson region. Ukraine says some Russian troops are pulling back from their positions near strategic river there and Ukrainian officials say Russia is increasingly targeting critical infrastructure, cutting off access to power, water and the internet for thousands. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said last week around one third of Ukraine's power grid has been knocked out. Another official says at least 90 percent of the country's wind power is destroyed. Let's get more now from CNN's Nic Robertson who is live for us in Kyiv and Clare Sebastian who is in London.

The assessment is 1.5 million people without electricity on Friday. The effort to sort of repair and reconstitute what's damaged is ongoing. President Zelenskyy praised those workers.But there's a real understanding here that Russia is strategically targeting the weaker points on the energy infrastructure and particularly those that have knock on effects for example in the center of Ukraine an energy installation hit there, supplies electricity to a coal mine. There are very few coal mines actually operational in Ukraine and of course, the coal that comes from them goes to power stations to generate electricity. So, it's a double whammy taking out that power station, putting the mine out of action, denying all these power plants their fuel. You have hospitals that are without water. You have air raid systems that are without electricity. So, police have to drive around with loud speakers to tell people when there's an air raid. So, all of this is having an attritional and accumulative effect. It's things like big transformers, big generators, the power lines of  -- big switching structures rather, the big power lines that you see outside of the big generating plants. Russia is going for those it seems potentially because there just easier to knock out, on the outside of the buildings, not like the big generators on the inside. But this is strategic and uncareful. And the air defenses have been stepped up. They're much more effective in the capital in Lviv in the west, Odessa in the south. So, Russia is also now looking for the holes in that and targeting the areas where the air defenses are less strong.",
