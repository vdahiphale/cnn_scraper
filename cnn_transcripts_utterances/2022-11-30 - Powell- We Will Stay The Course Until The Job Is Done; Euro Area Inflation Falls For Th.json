It is likely that restoring price stability will require holding policy at a restrictive level for some time. History cautions strongly against prematurely loosening policy, and I`ll close by saying that we will stay the course until the job is done. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

It wasthe 1970s, the first half of the 70s when inflation, as you can see on the chart seemed to be subsiding, but by the end of that decade, it had returned with a vengeance after the Middle East energy shock. Paul Volcker was at the head of the Fed and responded by nearly doubling interest rates from their peak earlier -- they`ve been around eight percent. Now this swift move triggered high unemployment and two recessions over three years. But Paul Volcker did not budge. He kept rates elevated until it was clear inflation was going down. You see it clearly on the chart, and he said, a repeat -- Jay Powell today said a repeat of that era would make the Fed`s job difficult. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

There is this concern that because workers are seeing a real pay terms decrease, we`re seeing an increase in union activity, where you see increasing tensions in the workplace with people aiming to bid up their wages completely understandably. When that happens, it can be much harder to get inflation out of the system, because every firm is facing a higher payroll, and they`re going to tend to push that back out in next year`s prices.

But Ihope, viewers can understand the basic intuition of this jargon that economists talk about, which is so-called base effects. So essentially, what happens when prices go, a big jump in prices, let`s say more or less 10 percent that we`ve seen. We`ve got this 10 percent inflation rate. As long as prices don`t keep going up and keep going up and keep going up, once we`ve got a year away from that step up in prices, we get this automatic thing called a base effect where the inflation rate will come down because it was more than a year ago, and we only look at prices over the course of a year. So we`re going to see these big reductions, I think in inflation midway through next year, as things like the big jumps that we saw because of war in Ukraine, and because of the global supply chain shocks as those come out of the system. That was the supply side inflation that will come out.

And if you can get some of that into the ether, into people`s expectations, into the expectations of firms that are setting prices, then you can actually get almost like a free lunch as a Central Banker and this was something that they didn`t have in the 1970s because expectations got out of control there for what inflation was going to be and that can help you bring inflation down.

The currency exchange firm, Travelex says its third quarter revenue was down 17 percent from two years ago. That`s perhaps understandable, bearing in mind, the way we continue -- traveling is just getting underway. It is hope for a company that`s been through a rough couple of years.
