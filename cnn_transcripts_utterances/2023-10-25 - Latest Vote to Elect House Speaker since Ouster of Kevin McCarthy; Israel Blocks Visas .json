There are 376 days until Election Day. And on Capitol Hill, it's been 21 days since the House had a Speaker. This is today's \"State of the Race\". All right, right now the latest Republican nominee for House Speaker some absurdity in that sentence is about to take his bid to the House floor the vote to elect or reject Mike Johnson expected to happen in the next hour. This time, Johnson says Republicans are unified and that he'll have enough votes to win the gavel. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. MIKE JOHNSON (R-LA): Democracy is messy sometimes, but it is our system.

He voted against certifying the resultsof the 2020 presidential election and filed a legal brief for Republicans who supported that Texas lawsuit that tried to invalidate election results in four key swing states. One possible sign Republicans are feeling optimistic today about the vote, Kevin McCarthy's nameplate outside the Speaker's office. It had previously he had been in there and it had been sitting at the top of that arch. It is gone. It is not there. I want to bring in Congressional Correspondent Lauren Fox. Lauren thanks very much for starting us off today. It does seem like I mean that happened late last night. They haven't taken that step so far. Just kind of that atmosphere of it felt like relief and cheering in the sound bites that we saw there from Mike Johnson late last night. This seems on track.",

Now theRepublicans Speaker designee that in part is because some members are just exhausted, frustrated, exasperated and ready to move on from this chapter these three weeks in which Republicans time and time again failed to rally around three other Speaker designees. Now there were some members who behind closed doors voted present meaning they did not support Johnson in a closed door meeting. But I have now talked to one of those members Representative Mark Amodei, who told me that he had a very pleasant conversation about 30 minutes last night with Mike Johnson after he voted present in that meeting. He said at the end of the day, he just didn't know Mike Johnson very well. They hadn't run in similar circles. He wanted to make sure that Johnson understood some very specific issues that were important to him related to lands issues in the State of Nevada that he represents. And he said after that he made a commitment to Johnson, he was going to support him on the floor. We also heard from Thomas Massie on Twitter earlier today, he was another one of those President votes, who said he is now committed after talking to Johnson this morning to vote for him on the House floor. So this certainly seems to be on track at the moment. And obviously there is just a lot of concern for Republicans now moving forward whether or not they're going to continue to be able to keep this spirit of unity as they move ahead toward a government funding deadline coming up in just a couple of weeks on November 17. I think one thing to point out is that Representative Johnson, he's a rank and file member, right? He's not someone who's the Chairman of a Committee. He doesn't have a huge extensive staff that most people who are in leadership would have. And so he's going to have to really ramp things up in short order in order to try and address these massive issues that are looming, for House Republicans. Funding the government also how are they going to deal with $105 billion supplemental requests from the White House for aid, Israel, Ukraine, the border, Taiwan, those are all pressing issues that Representative Johnson is going to have to address if he wins the gavel today, Kasie.",

MILES TAYLOR, FORMER CHIEF OF STAFF AT U.S. DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY: Well, I was going to say the proximate cause here is not just the U.N. Secretary General's comments. I mean, for years, the Israelis had been very frustrated at what they perceive to be a United Nations that's not neutral. A United Nations that's often putting its thumb on the scales for the Palestinian cause, in some ways in Israeli views in ways that are favorable towards Hamas. And even in forums where geopolitics should not be factor environmental forums and others sort of snubbing the Israelis and taking an attitude that's built up over time into a pretty serious grievance on their part. So I think you saw that break open with this comment. But again, it's not the proximate cause, although what I think this does show us right now is that as the military situation escalates, the diplomatic situation is going to be doing the same thing.

Beyond Gaza, beyond the detail on the ground, the Biden Administration has two kinds of geopolitical, post-World War Two, architecture goals and wants to keep the U.N. together and useful, and the others to keep NATO together and useful. And the trouble with all this is that if somehow the Chief of the U.N. was forced out. It wouldn't change all the U.N. nation's attitudes and opinions and treatment of Israel or the Palestinians or any of this stuff. It would be a political move, that wouldn't change the reality.

Because, you know, as we were getting set up here, you're talking about the fact that there doesn't seem to be a leader of the wing of the party that is not inside the pro Trump wing. And Mike Johnson clearly has kind of a public persona that is one that is not as aggressive as Jim Jordan. It's not as pugnacious so to speak, he's kind of warm, affable smiley guy, right? He had pleasant expression on his face. But the value system is there. He was the person who that it's the New York Times that labeled him as like the architect of this strategy. He led the amicus brief that ultimately went to the Supreme Court, the Texas case to try to overturn the election. What do you make of that moment there where the entire House Republican conference starts booing when he's pressed about a perfectly valid thing to ask them about? CHARLIE DENT, FORMER U.S. HOUSE REPUBLICAN: Well, I think what's going to happen, is it Mike Johnson is going to have to channel that earlier speech, that collegiality, speech he gave in order to be a successful speaker. But he's going to have to answer for his role during the 2020 election. And a particular interest will be those 17 House Republicans who represent Biden districts where overturning the election was a big deal. And at least politically for them, it's a very big deal. So I think he's, he's at some point, he's going to have to address that because now he is going to have to leave the institutional wing of the party, he is the one who is going to have to cut the deals, like on funding and in a few weeks, he must do that. That has not been where he is. Politically, he has been part of that hard right faction, I would put him in that Trump populist wing, not the establishment, pragmatist wing, governing wing. And now he is going to have to straddle this. And this will not be easy for him. So I don't know how but he's going to have to answer for the 2020 election business where he was very involved. And he's not going to be able to ignore that question.",

Obviously, we're on a shorter timeline and we'll see if a stopgap funding effort is needed for, you know, a temporary mechanism, given the short timeline we have, I think that there probably be a significant amount of sport in the conference board. REP. SCOTT PERRY (R-PA): It's a different situation. Now, there was a trust factor with leadership last time that was using the CR to get to the omnibus and it was pretty clear, right? If you're using the CR to deal with the appropriations, the spending bills that you have to get past, I think people will be forgiving of that. And as you know, we're kind of in the, we're in overtime right now, right? So you don't blame the backup quarterback for the failures of the guy that just came out of the game. So --",

And then finally, big open question, 2024 election comes up. House is going to play a role in certifying that election, that's a big question mark for me is you have someone who appeals to the populous wing, who's now the speaker.

So what I'm watching and see how quickly Mr. Jeffries leader, Jeffrey's in the Democratic Party go up with ads in the 17 Republican districts that Biden won, really hammering the current potentially new speaker on this on being an election denier. We know based on the polls that are the one issue that really galvanizes independents, Democrats and Republicans who are trying to find a home.",
