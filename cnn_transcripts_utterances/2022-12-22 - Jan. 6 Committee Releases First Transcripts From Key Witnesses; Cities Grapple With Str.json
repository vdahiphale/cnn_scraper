Any person, of course, is entitled to take the fifth if they believe their testimony might incriminate them, that`s what it`s there for. And it`s an important constitutional protection.Now, as you noted, some of these people took the fifth in extraordinarily broad ways not, you know, how could your age possibly incriminate you? And I agree with Margaret, I think part of that is just a symbol of defiance. But the other part is, people when they take the fifth want to take it very broadly, so they`re not ever accused of having wave given away their fifth amendment, right? Now I think it was excessive here. Now, the different calculation when DOJ, if DOJ subpoenas and interrogates questions these people, they can still take the fifth. But DOJ then has a counter move, which is called immunity. So if DOJ wants to, they can say to, let`s say, Jeffrey Clark, OK, we`re going to force you to testify, but we`re not going to use your testimony against you. And as a practical matter, we`re not going to prosecute you. So that`s a really important strategic decision that prosecutors are thinking about right now.",

You`re talking about $600 million. And as you can imagine, a spokesperson for the city council released a statement they strongly oppose that proposal. And that`s putting it lightly saying that that would actually take away resources from some of those nonprofits that we have seen at some of these scenes at Port -- New York`s Port Authority receiving these buses of migrants since this summer. However, as you mentioned, there is some assistance that is on the way in that omnibus bill that`s currently in the hands of lawmakers in Congress.

And what`s really concerning for many of Israel`s even allies around the world as who some of these ministers are going to be.Now, most of the top positions, foreign ministry, defense, justice are expected to go to members of Netanyahu`s own Likud party. But there are other ministers that are causing concern. And that`s because some of these people were once considered the far-right fringe of Israeli politics. And now they will be in positions of power that could potentially help set policies in places like the West Bank and in some of Jerusalem`s holiest sites and as well as there`s some efforts to change Israel`s judiciary and the Supreme Court. This is causing some of Israel`s even most staunchest allies, especially in the Jewish diaspora to express concern. I`ll give you one example, the one that most people now recognize as Itamar Ben- Gvir. He`s the leader of Jewish power. He himself was once convicted of anti-Arab racism and supporting a Jewish terrorist group. He will now become National Security Minister with power over the Israeli police. There`s Bezalel Smotrich, he`s an Israeli settler, lawyer turned politician. He is expected to become Minister of Finance, but will have a hand in helping to determine the Israeli military body, who will be in charge of the military body that helps determine border crossings and permits for Palestinian. Smotrich is somebody who wants to abolish the Palestinian Authority. Now, Benjamin Netanyahu said that ultimately, he is the one in charge, that he will be the one that will set policy. But there`s a lot of concerns out there that he is building a government that he will ultimately not be able to control. Jim?",
