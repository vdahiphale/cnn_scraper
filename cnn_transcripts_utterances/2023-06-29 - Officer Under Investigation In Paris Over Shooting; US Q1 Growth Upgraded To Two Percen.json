It is up over half a percent, good 200 points to the better. The triple stack shows underneath. You've really got a bit of a weakness in technology stocks, which are under a bit of pressure in the Dow, that is lower. We'll try and put some flesh on those bones in just a moment. The main events of the day: Protesters and police are clashing in Northern France as they brace for a third night of violence over the fatal police shooting of a teenager. The role of corporate greed as it drives inflation. An economist whose research was initially derided is now getting a lot of attention on the idea of strategic price controls. And Virgin Galactic takes its first paying passengers into space. We will talk about that over the course of the program. We are live in New York. It's Thursday. It is June the 29th. I'm Richard Quest and I mean business. Good evening. It's just after nine o'clock in the evening in France, and around 40,000 police officers are on the streets trying to prevent a third night of violent unrest over a deadly traffic stop. There were more clashes earlier in the day in the outskirts of Paris, where a teenager was shot. The local prosecutor announced the officer involved is being investigated for voluntary homicide. President Emmanuel Macron is battling to contain this crisis. The region which is just north of Paris has halted bus and tram services until tomorrow morning. Another suburb has imposed an overnight curfew, all of which follows the chaos. On Wednesday, 150 people were arrested and 24 officers injured. There were at least 40 cars set alight and the protests were not just in Paris, they were in several cities as well. Melissa Bell is our correspondent. She is in Paris this evening, and have the authorities got this under control.",

The sense that there is that if you are a young, Black Frenchman, you are much more likely to find yourself on the receiving end of police controls, than say I am. These things are impossible to quantify, and yet they are very keenly felt, and it is something that these communities have been trying to bring to public attention now for many years every time there is this sort of incident, there is this sort of killing, there is this sort of tragedy, Richard, they come out to say this is what we live all the time.

The US economy is on a much firmer footing than many economists have predicted. A new revision puts Q1 at two percent on an annual basis. The previous estimate was just 1.3 percent. And now, the markets are mixed on the news that could help temper expectations, but the US sees it is stronger, so Rahel, this is the way I look at it: If a number is stronger, then it's more likely that rates go higher for longer because it has got to be tempered down to bring down inflation.

So this GDP growth for Q1 coming in at two percent as you pointed out, lower than the previous two quarters, but higher than previous estimates, also higher than economists were expecting. The expectation had been closer to 1.4 percent. Even more encouraging, perhaps is that the increase here for the revision was largely due to consumer spending, the all-American consumer continues to shop, that being supported, of course Richard, by the US labor market and excess pandemic savings. What is not, however, encouraging perhaps is some new research from the Fed which suggests that excess pandemic savings in the US has pretty much run out. I mean, this quote, take a listen to this. It says -- this from that research note: \"We know that the US' path differs slightly from other countries as its stock of excess savings increased more rapidly, peaking in 2021 Q3, and then decreased more quickly.\" It goes on to say that: \"As a result, its excess savings stock (the US) at least computed according to our method.\" get this Richard, \". is currently completely depleted.\" So that is not encouraging for the larger picture, but perhaps that could help slow things down for the Fed.",

You talk to economists like Diane Swonk, for example, she had been sounding the alarm that if you actually looked under the hood of excess savings, you could see that it was starting to be depleted among income spectrums, right? Of course, it was being depleted first among lower-income Americans and then middle-income Americans. And so we had been seeing this trend, and so, it seems that we are at now a critical juncture where excess savings appear to be depleted, and so will Americans continue to spend with inflation still being what it is and interest rates still being high, and perhaps getting even higher?",

Now two of Europe's largest economies appear to be moving in different directions. Spain has reached a major milestone in its fight against inflation, where prices rose just 1.9 percent in June. It is the first EU economy to see inflation dip, if you will to below ECB's target. A different story in Germany where inflation rose last month to 6.8 percent from 6.3 a month earlier. Now Germany is offering a stark reminder that the war on inflation is far from over. Isabella Weber says policymakers need to shift strategy to focus on the role of corporations in accelerating the pace of price raises. Greedflation, sellers' inflation, as she likes to call it, a controversial measure that she puts forward is price controls, as all strategic price controls. The professor, Isabella Weber is with me now, professor of economics at University of Massachusetts. Good to have you, Professor. Look, when you came out with your article, everybody said you were barking mad, and were probably dangerous. Now, people are sort of saying, well, you might have a point, actually. Strategic price controls could work, but they've been used in Germany, and arguably, the latest numbers don't suggest that they have or at least, if they've been effective, they've not been that effective.",

I think the contrast between Spain andGermany is actually a really interesting one, because we see in Spain a very ambitious approach to fighting inflation that has included a whole range of measures, so this is kind of an all-out, all cards on deck approach to fighting inflation. Last year, Spain had higher than European average inflation and now as you said, it is the first country that managed to even undershoot the two percent target. So what have they done? They have done things like capping the gas price on the power market to bring down power prices, expanding the grip of households that can get government regulated prices for gas, and bringing down the cost of public transportation, making all trains in Spain free throughout this year, introducing a measure that limits the degree by which rents can be increased. So that overall, these are targeted measures that try to target some of the most important prices in the CPI, that are the most important prices for consumers, and also the most important prices for many firms, being creative and coming up with measures that are starting from the specific institutional structures that they have, rather than coming with some sort of abstractly derived package.",

They already have a disinflationary effect. But last year, when the massive shock hit as a result of the Russian war in Ukraine, these kinds of measures did have a positive impact. In fact, there had just been a study coming out from the IMF, that is also suggesting that such targeted measures in the energy sector in Europe were rather a successful way in contributing to price stability.

This isn't just a matter of human rights; it's an economic issue. Anti-gay laws are bad for business. As they say, a coalition of global companies called Open for Business has looked at exactly this and found that Uganda's neighbor, Kenya, where LGBTQ discrimination cost the country 1.7 percent of GDP per year. Lost storage amid inefficient allocation of human capital. Jon Miller is the founder of Open for Business and a partner at Brunswick Group in London. Jon, look, the problem I have with this relationship between business and anti-LGBT is that it shows up in your statistics but it never seems to show up in reality. The reality is that companies continue to do business in these places. And when I've been there, there is a disconnect. People don't seem to realize it is costing them. JON MILLER, FOUNDER, OPEN FOR BUSINESS; PARTNER, BRUNSWICK GROUP LONDON:  Well, companies are doing business in these countries as well, absolutely right. And so they should. We're not advocating that companies should be coming out of these countries. But how are they using their influence, as major investors, you know, as major employees, as major parts of the supply chain in these countries like Uganda? And so, they are actually doing that. So you take -- one of the first major companies to speak out when the bill was passed in Uganda was Total Energies, a major investor in Uganda, a major energy company. And its CEO -- (CROSSTALK)",

First of all, all the companies and many other companies that we work with at Open forBusiness have operations in Uganda, offices in Uganda. They are all asking themselves now, how do we take care of our employees there? But of course, changing the law is a long process. And one of the major concerns at the moment is, for want of a better expressions, contagion. Obviously in Nairobi, a couple of weeks ago, with the community in Kenya, actually, there's extremely high levels of anxiety about similar bills being passed, you know, in Kenya, in Tanzania, in Burundi, in Rwanda. So there is still a lot for business to do to (INAUDIBLE) put the economic case, that this kind of law is not in the interest of the economies in these countries.",
