Tonight, on \"Laura Coates Live.\" I mean, can you even begin to imagine how agonizing it has been for the families of the hostages that were taken on October 7th? And it has been 45 days, 45 days, 45 days of not knowing where they are, how they are, and whether they will ever, ever see them again. Now with the entire world watching and waiting, Israel has signed off on the deal to release some of the estimated 240 people being held hostage. The deal would free at least 50 women and children. Sources telling CNN that there are as many as 40 children in the group. Now, there will be a four-day pause in fighting with an extra day to be added for each 10 additional hostages, three Palestinian prisoners will be released every, uh -- for every single hostage, and the Red Cross will get access to hostages that are still in Gaza. Now, Barak Ravid, one of the best-informed correspondents on this story who will be here in a moment, says that Israeli officials tell him the pause in fighting will start -- when? Well, when the first child crosses the border back into Israel. But even with this news tonight, the wait for these families is not over. Now, there's also a legally mandated 24-hour waiting period to allow Israelis to appeal the decision to the country's Supreme Court. But still, even then, the wait will not be over. All of these 50 or so hostages are not expected to be released at once on a single day. Instead, it will be staggered, maybe day by day. And the families will likely learn shortly before it happens whether their loved one will be released soon after. Now imagine what it would be like for them. I mean, every day waiting for your loved one, your child's name to come up. Imagine what it's like for the family of nearly four-year-old Abigail. Senior U.S. officials say that she could soon be released along with two American women. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) LIZ HIRSH NAFTALI, GREAT AUNT OF 3-YEAR-OLD HOSTAGE ABIGAIL EDAN: But, you know, when I think about that on Friday is Abigail's fourth birthday, and that she should be home with her family and with her sister and brother, and she isn't right now.

It's not likely to be an obstacle, but it is a legal hurdle that has to be overcome. And so, we're expecting the first of the hostages to be released on Thursday local time, so in about 24 hours, just under 24 hours from now. But I mean, we're speculating a bit because no time frame has been given.I can tell you, listening to some of those relatives of the loved ones, of the people that are being held in Gaza, I mean, all day, I've been speaking to members of families here in Tel Aviv who have got family members inside Gaza, and there's mixed feelings among them about this deal. On the one side, I met a woman, I think it was the mother of Gali, the grandmother whose soundbite you showed there, and she was very optimistic actually at this point that perhaps her 13-year-old daughter, who is being held as a hostage inside Gaza, would be released. She was very upbeat by the prospects for that given this deal. But other people I spoke to were much less so, much more upset. I mean, one woman from kibbutz Be'eri was despondent. She said -- look, she's happy for those people, they're going to be included in this deal, but her nephew is a 38-year-old man, not in the army, nothing like that. He was just abducted from his Kibbutz and there's very little chance at this point of him being released. And, of course, as you mentioned, there are about 200 people who are not going to be included in this hostage deal. That's one of the reasons, Laura, why doing this deal for the Israelis has been so controversial. They are concerned that the pause in the fighting could allow Hamas to rebuild and to, you know, kind of gain back some military initiative. But more than anything else, it's about all the people it leaves behind, and that's really hard for Israelis to grapple with.",

I mean, some of them, we know, are dead, but others, we're not sure about. And so, the ICRC will be able to give the families and all of us some clarity on that.",

It's going to start sometime on Thursday and it is going to start, again, when the first hostages come back from Gaza to Israel.So, I think we are really looking at something between 24 to 36 hours before this thing will start to be implemented, before we'll see the buses coming out of Israeli prisons with 150 Palestinian prisoners, and when we see the Red Cross bringing those Israeli hostages to the border with Egypt and from there to Israel.

And in this deal, at least in phase one, 150 of them are going to be released.Most of them are people that did not kill Israelis but were involved in attacks like, you know, trying to stab a soldier or a policeman or throwing a Molotov cocktail. That's just an example. There are many others. Each case, it's a case by case issue.

It's pretty unclear. And again, I'm not even sure that by now, there's total clarity about who those people are.

You know, Hamas and Israel did not sit across the table. This negotiation was done through third-party intermediaries, U.S. officials, diplomats from around the world, sheikhs, NGOs like the Red Cross, the Red Crescent, and just networks and upwards into the Qatari family that has been instrumental in this ongoing process. Again, Qatar has become the Switzerland of the Middle East in this. But this deal could go pear-shaped overnight, and all this media exposure and the emphasis by the president to make statements raises the stakes that anything could go wrong. I'm just -- I dealt with over 400 (INAUDIBLE) in Iraq, and I can count on one hand the number of successful endings we had. So, I don't believe anything is going to happen until it happens for real.

So, will a significant pause make that harder?O'SHEA: Well, again, Hamas is going to have the chance to refit, retrograde. They're going to pull back, retreat probably. They're going to resupply. They've been out of communications from what we understand. There's no media, cell phone, Wi-Fi. So, it's going to give Hamas a chance to regroup, which is why they were striving for the ceasefire and why they agreed to those terms. But again, the IDF, they're under tremendous pressure and this thing is going to be dragging out. So, we could foresee another stalemate in another day, a week or two, maybe longer for another hostage exchange. There are 200 plus hostages being left behind.

You know, what Hamas is doing right now is suing for a pause. They took these people out of their homes in order to use them as bartering chips to reduce the pressure on them that they knew Israel would execute through a military onslaught. At the same time, these people must come home.So, it is bittersweet. Gilad Shalit, when he was returned 10 years ago in exchange for over a thousand Hamas fighters, it was also bittersweet, but it was a moment of rejoice because in Israel and in Judaism, every individual is the universe. And so, every individual matter. And that at the end of the day is the ethical difference between Israel and Hamas. What Israel is doing is retrieving their people who are in harm's way, understanding there is a risk, but it's worth that risk.",

He was imprisoned for 544 days in Iran after being detained there back in 2014. He's now a global opinions writer for \"The Washington Post\" and author of the book, \"Prisoner.\" Jason, I'm so glad that you're here. I mean, you must be thinking all sorts of things as you watch the hostage situation in places like Gaza and beyond.

We're actually watching right now the moment you were returned with your family following your release.Walk us through -- you said that the road ahead can be still fraught.

Some people take the government up on it. Some people don't. I did. I spent about five days at Landstuhl, medical facility of the U.S. military in Germany. Frankly, looking back, I wish I'd stayed a few days longer.You're raring to go, you want to get back into the world, you want to see the people that you've been missing. But you're not ready for it. You know, you have been conditioned to be in captivity and it takes a long time to get used to freedom again. And I think, you know, when people who haven't been through it hear that, they think to themselves, well, that sounds sort of odd. It is odd. The whole -- the whole experience is not like anything that we're raised and educated and ever ready for. So, once you've had that experience, just the process of mentally slowing down of your shoulders, kind of easing the tension, the elevated tension that has persisted constantly, waking hours and sleeping hours for so long, it's not something that's easy to describe and it's not something that's easy to come down from.",

I say that you have to decide to free your innocent civilians, especially in a case like this when so many of them are children.You know, it is really not that difficult a choice when you think about it in those terms. Do these people deserve to be held in a prolonged way and potentially die in captivity or reunited with their loved ones? I understand these are hard choices for any government to make. I don't put a lot of stock into the argument that making these deals encourages more hostage taking. What encourages more hostage taking is that there's nothing standing in the hostage taker's way at the moment. So, I think, you know, for the time being, we're going to see more of these deals, whether it's in this situation in Gaza, whether it's with Iran, Russia, China, Venezuela, and a host of other countries that do this, including friends of ours like Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Turkey. But ultimately, we have to be thinking about what is it that we're going to do to make this behavior costlier than beneficial to those who take part in it. You know, I think we'll see the phenomenon continue until those deterrence mechanisms are really in place and the effects of which are being felt by the bad guys.",
