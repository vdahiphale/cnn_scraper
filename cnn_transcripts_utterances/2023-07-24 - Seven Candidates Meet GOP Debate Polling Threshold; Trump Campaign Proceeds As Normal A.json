If you take a look at polling from Fox News from yesterday, this is a key -- this is in key battleground states, Iowa -- or key early states, Iowa, South Carolina.And when you look at that, in Iowa, Trump is at 46 percent. DeSantis is in second at 16 percent. He's the next closest. And you just see how wide that gap is. And in South Carolina, it's a similar story. It's Trump at 48 percent. Haley -- Nikki Haley at 14 percent. DeSantis at 13. Tim Scott at 10 percent. He is just running so far ahead of all of these other candidates right now that all of them are trying to find some traction. And, of course, when Florida Governor Ron DeSantis got into this race, there was hope among a lot of Republicans that he could be the most viable alternative to the former president. But we have seen him not be able to really catch fire in these polls that he is definitely the second place -- coming in second place in Iowa, let's say, in South Carolina, and not so much according to that poll. But he hasn't been able to really convert this him getting into the race into really big numbers, big polling. And so, what we're hearing now from his campaign, they are doing a bit of a reset. We know they had a donor event over the weekend out west. They talked to their donors. They talked to their supporters. They admitted that they are going to be making some changes both in how they're spending their money, how they're allocating their money, what the messaging might be. They want to lean in now to this insurgent idea that he's the insurgent candidate. And they want to be more aggressive. And to that end, we're going to be seeing more of Governor DeSantis in Iowa. Thus far, we have seen him there. I've been there with him. Covered him there several times. But this has been kind of coming in for a day or two dipping out. We had heard from even people -- Iowa Republicans in the Des Moines Register that they want to see him there all -- a lot.",

Some of these being his biggest most staunch supporters on Capitol Hill that includes Senator J.D. Vance, as well as Congressman Max Miller, and Jim Jordan. But as Trump himself seems to pretend that all of this is normal, or they believe that this is all working towards normal, the people who he's running against are having a very difficult time trying to navigate this fine line. The fine line between the base. The Trump base that in the third indictment would just rile them up that would just give them more money, and also trying to push back on the former president.

Probably closely. We, the select committee, turned over all of our materials, all of our transcripts, all of the documents we had obtained well beyond just the official committee report to the special counsel. The intent was for them to take those faxes as part of their calculus as to whether or not criminal charges were appropriate. We also referred directly to the special counsel the consideration of specific criminal charges. We cited 1512 C, the tampering or the obstruction of an official proceeding statute conspiracy to defraud the United States, obstruct the lawful function of government, false statements for the submission of the fake electors, and then aid and comfort to an insurrection. Those were the criminal statutes that the select committee cited as we developed evidence of the potential violation. So, my guess is the special counsel has taken that gone beyond it.

And those buoys also have anchors that are at the bottom of the water bed there. And now, there are nets below the buoys as well. So, it's unclear exactly what all that is. But at the moment, what's really dusting up here is a court battle between the U.S. DOJ and the state of Texas over these border buoys. Boris.",

In essence, let me show you exactly what happens.You can see that these border buoys only stretch for so long and then they end. Well, what migrants do is they simply skirt the buoy and then cross over toward the U.S. side of the border. Now, the international line is in the middle of the Rio Grande so as you might imagine, that moves as the water levels also move. And what we've seen is that the migrants simply walk along the water by that lower-level concertina wire. And normally, Boris, what they would do is they would walk on this path that's along the banks of the Rio Grande. Well, because of the concertina wire now, what we see are women and children walking on the water being told by Texas National Guard members and members of the Texas Department of Public Safety to continue walking until south of this property where then they are taken for processing. So, that's a long answer to your -- to your question. But the short answer is no. It is not stopping illegal immigration, Boris.",

      "sentences": "Well, let's look at the numbers of people coming across the border or attempting to come across the border so far this year. According to U.S. Customs and Border Protection, encounters along the southwest border are actually down this year. You see they peaked last December above 250,000. Now, they're below 150,000. This is per month.In fact, those numbers continue to decline even after Title 42 was lifted in May. Title 42, you'll remember dates back to the Trump administration pandemic regulation that allowed the government to turn folks back because of pandemic concerns. At the time when it was lifted, there were concerns numbers were going to jump up, or surge as a result of that move, they haven't. Look. They've come down from above 200,000 a month, again to below 150,000 a month. Overall from May to June, that's down a third. 30 percent. Big picture, let's look longer term. If you compare June 2023 back to February 2021, border encounters are actually at their lowest level since February 2021. Up 144,000 versus 101,000. But this is the lowest level in well, just over two years, Boris, so the numbers trending in fact downward.",
