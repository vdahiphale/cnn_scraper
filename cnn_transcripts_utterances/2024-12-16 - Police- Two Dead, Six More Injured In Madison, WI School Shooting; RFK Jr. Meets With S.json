And we're expecting law enforcement officials to hold another briefing around 09:30 p.m. Eastern Time, 08:30 in Madison. That's when we could learn the identity of the shooter, who killed a teacher and a teenage student, at the Abundant Life Christian School, and injured six others, including two students who, tonight, are in life-threatening condition. We're also waiting for word, tonight, about a possible motive, as CNN has learned from a law enforcement source, this evening, that the 17- year-old female shooter apparently planned this attack in advance. We've learned that investigators have gathered information that suggests the shooter had been dealing with certain problems, and expressed some of them in writing that are in the hands of investigators tonight. The shooter's parents, I should note, are cooperating with authorities. And earlier today, there was a police presence at a home on the north side of Madison that we are told is related to this investigation. We're getting firsthand accounts tonight from young survivors of what it was like inside that school, this morning, when the shooting began. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Former Boston Police Commissioner, Ed Davis. As well as the Creator of the FBI's Active Shooter Program, Katherine Schweit. It's great to have you all here. And Katherine, let me start with you. Because we're learning new information tonight, from my colleague, Shimon Prokupecz, about what investigators are looking at tonight. And they were saying that at this press conference that's coming up, they're hoping they can reveal a lot more information about this shooter, about what they've learned here. And what Shimon is hearing is that this person planned the attack in advance, and that they indicated the information that was gathered by investigators suggested that the shooter had been dealing with problems. What exactly kind of material, and what kind of clues, are investigators looking for in something like this? KATHERINE SCHWEIT, CREATOR OF THE FBI ACTIVE SHOOTER PROGRAM, AUTHOR, \"STOP THE KILLING\": Hi. Good evening. In some ways, that's not -- none of that is a surprise. And we kind of -- we kind of know the framework of what we'll see. This is targeted violence that occurs in schools, is generally an individual who attends that school. Almost in every instance, they attend the school or they just got kicked out or just left the school. So, what they do is they plan and prepare to do this kind of violence, because they can't find any other solution. And so, their other solution is, OK, I'm going to -- I'm going to do this. We saw the same thing that happened up at Oxford High School, where the shooter indicated in writing that he had tried to tell his parents he needed mental health care, and he didn't get it. So, I think that's the kind of things that we'll see. A student who is having trouble. Remember, we're about at exam week for finals in some -- in many of these schools. And break -- and Mondays are a very common day to see this, because students, especially in schools, in middle schools and high schools, they are stressed out over the weekend. And they formulate this plan, and then they moxie up, they get the courage to execute it on Monday.",

But there's all sorts of pieces of information that could shed light on that question of motive, to help us better-understand the sorts of things, the process, that this person went through before they decided to make this decision, the sort of planning they went through. What sort of flags or things should we have seen and should have been noticed along the way. And so, seizing that evidence of computer devices, internet-connected devices, writings, all that stuff is very important. And as a part of that, they're no doubt talking to the parents. And those questions are probably pushing in the same direction, Kaitlan. They're trying to find out, Let's build a timeline of where your, in this case, daughter has been over, the last 48, maybe 72 hours. And what did you see? What did you observe?

Another 115 live with the physical injuries of that day at their school. The number of those who carry the emotional scars is incalculable, and each of those numbers is a person, a name, someone that did not deserve this, a person that lived what has unfortunately become all too American of a reality.

And we did. As a group of students, with teachers, with parents like Fred Guttenberg, Manuel Oliver, and so many others, and my classmates, we raised the age to buy gun to 21 and passed a red flag law, with Republicans, that has been used over 19,000 times since the shooting, to disarm people that are a risk to themselves and -- or others.

Once again, when people said that nothing would change. But it did, in a minor way. We put billions of dollars into fighting school safety, community gun violence that happens on a daily basis that doesn't make it on the news, and on expanding background checks for people under the age of 21. Democrats and Republicans worked to pass that. And part of what made it possible was it wasn't a win for either side. It wasn't a huge win for Democrats, as it wasn't a huge win for Republicans. But it was a win for the American people. Because over a 1,000 people have been prevented from purchasing weapons like the AR-15 that previously would not have been, had we not had that expanded background check process.

When they say, Well, the reason why we don't have those school shootings is because we have a strong system of laws in place to protect people.

Obviously, we need to focus on that. But we also need to simultaneously focus, on why does somebody want to kill somebody else in the first place? That means addressing joblessness. That means addressing homelessness and hopelessness that many people have, that caused them to pick up a gun, even if it's here in D.C., and it doesn't make it on the news because it's a shooting that happens all -- you know, there are shootings that happen all the time in this city, unfortunately.",

KEVIN MADDEN, ADVISER, MITT ROMNEY'S 2008 &amp; 2012 CAMPAIGNS: Well, I think their skepticism is also a product of a lot of the information and the perspectives that they get from their constituents. I think, look, not all vaccines and not all mandates are the same. And I think that's a reflection of what people -- there's a lot of people around the country that believe that. And I think when they communicate that to their senators, and their senators communicate that to incoming Cabinet Secretaries, as well as an incoming President at the White House? I mean, that's part of the process. I think you're going to see more of that. I know there's been a lot of skepticism about -- from critics of the Republicans, that everybody's going to fall in line and sort of move with whatever Trump does, or whatever his Cabinet Secretaries say. And I just don't think that's the case. I think Markwayne Mullin, Senator Kennedy from Louisiana, who has a background as a physician, these are folks that are going to have a lot of things to say. They recognize their role in the process. Senators like their jobs. They want to keep them. And they also want to be -- make sure that people know they're important. And so, I think they're going to use this process to establish all three of those credentials, and make it very clear that that this is not something that is going to -- that the process of talking about all these issues is going to be one that they're very involved in.",

That student called at 10:57. By 11:05, police were on the scene, and the shooter was down. We have now learned, from authorities, for the first time, confirming the name of that school shooter, that was 15-years-old. Her name was Samantha Rupnow -- Natalie Rupnow, but she went by Samantha. She was 15-years-old, not 17, as previously reported. She died of a self- inflicted gunshot wound at the scene. So of course, two others were also killed at that shooting today, earlier. We have heard that police searched her home, earlier tonight. They are still working to determine a motive, and said a document that has been circulating online that has been attributed to her has not yet been verified by the authorities. I'm joined now by the former Deputy FBI Director, Andrew McCabe. As well as the creator of the FBI's active shooter program, Katherine Schweit. It's great to have you both back with me.
