At this time tomorrow, we will be just one hour away from the very first polls closing in the 2024 election. Right now you're listening, of course, to the sweet, sweet CNN election jam.It took a lot for us to get here in a truly unprecedented election and by unprecedented, I mean we saw Donald Trump criminally convicted in New York. A stunning presidential debate. A sitting president dropping out of the race. The first black woman is a major party nominee. Two failed assassination attempts. Thank God they failed. A Supreme Court ruling on presidential immunity. Brat summer, need I remind you. A campaign stop at McDonald's where the candidate worked there. A lot of Elon Musk. Billions of dollars in campaign ads. Hundreds of rallies. Plenty of endorsements and a few notable non-endorsements. And that's just the last six months. But now we're here in the final day of campaigning and that means both Harris and Trump are spending all day on the trail. Let's get straight to CNN's Priscilla Alvarez covering the Harris campaign in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. CNN's Kristen Holmes covering the Trump campaign in Grand Rapids, Michigan where he will hold his final event this evening. Priscilla, to you first, how does the Harris campaign feel about their chances in Pennsylvania, which has been razor thin this whole time?",

But there is no doubt that Pennsylvania is crucial to those pathways. And the vice president in her final hours on the campaign trail has been projecting confidence, but also saying or not saying, former President Donald Trump's name, instead trying to mobilize voters by outlining her own vision.Now, in talking to campaign officials about why they chose the different stops today, one official telling me, look, they want to cover the gamut of voters that Pennsylvania covers. That includes, for example, Latino voters, those voters in the rural areas, and also those in the cities and suburbs. And just moments ago, we heard from the vice president in Allentown, where she reiterated her support for Puerto Rico, notably in an area with a sizable portion of Puerto Rican voters. Take a listen.

Campaign officials telling me that they're spending the day knocking on doors and they're really banking on this infrastructure that they built out over the last year to help them mobilize voters.Another way that the campaign will be mobilizing voters, Jake, is with the vice president tomorrow joining radio interviews as she awaits to go to her election night event tomorrow in Washington, D.C.

Negative works better than positive. She's choosing to be positive. I think that that's important. But what we're discovering at the grassroots level is that there are some arguments against Trump that haven't yet been made. If you're trying to get young black guys in the streets of Philadelphia to vote, tell them that Donald Trump is going to make every cop do stop and frisk, which he's committed to do, wants complete immunity and amnesty for every cop no matter what they do, and that he's going to federalize petty street crime. The Trump crackdown, that argument is a tough argument against Trump. She's not making it, but grassroots people are making it. There are arguments that can be made to move Jewish voters that are tough arguments on Trump for having picked J.D. Vance, who actually voted against aid for Israel. Those arguments are resonating in the Philly suburbs. These are tough arguments against Trump that the grassroots is making even though Kamala Harris has decided to be above it all.

They're net numbers.

You know, you can answer me this question, Jake. Is Kamala Harris more popular than Barack Obama was in '08? Is she more popular than Joe Biden was in '20? Philadelphia's own son, kind of Scranton Joe? I don't think so. So they're going to have to get big numbers out of Philly. So I'd look at Philly, then I'd look at the other end of the state.

We're joined by Republican Congressman Dan Crenshaw of Texas, also a member of the Select House Intelligence Committee. And I want to ask you some intelligence questions in its second, but first a couple political ones.\"The Bulwark's\" Marc Caputo is one of the best source people covering the Trump campaign. He had a piece today about Trump's rally yesterday in Pennsylvania. He writes that for 96 minutes, Trump barely looked at his teleprompter, quote, \"He darkly obsessed about election fraud, railed against polls showing him down, and savaged the bloodsuckers in the news media, adding he wouldn't mind if the fake news took an assassin's bullet for him. The crowd laughed, but privately campaign staffers groaned. Trump sounded as if he were losing,\" unquote. What are your thoughts about how Trump is closing here on the stump? REP. DAN CRENSHAW (R-TX):  Yeah, I've been looking. It's easy to find an off-the-cuff remark that's not likeable, and I learned a long time ago not to obsess over all of them. I don't even obsess over all of my political opponents like Biden. I just don't. I think that the general theme of the closing arguments has been pretty cut and dry from Trump. It's been, look, we're going to fix the border again. We're going to get the economy back on track. In a sense of normalcy, we're going to lead on the world stage with a peace through strength. We had the Abraham Accords. They had October 7th. No invasions of Ukraine under my presidency. There was an invasion under Ukraine by Russia under Biden-Harris presidency. Those are the closing remarks. It's back to a better future. I think that's the general vibe and I think that's what people are getting. I wouldn't understand actually why Trump would be frustrated. The polling I see and I'm sure you see in the aggregate when it's systemically reviewed, it looks pretty good for Trump. I mean at this time on the last election against Biden, you know, Trump was down like eight points in favorability ratings against Biden. Right now only down one point that's nationally and then when you look at the swing states, you know, he looks like he's up by a point or so in places that he needs to win in like Pennsylvania, Arizona and Georgia.

So the first example he talked about was kind of a run-of-the-mill Russian disinformation campaign. They do it all the time. This one is a hack through our major telecom companies. Like that's how they got to these campaign devices, I believe on both campaigns.Putting that aside, how dangerous it is for them to be meddling in our elections, looking for dirt, looking for something, maybe they don't know what they're looking for, but they're looking for something to embarrass either political candidate, that's pretty dangerous. But it also gets to a much bigger danger, which is their ability to kind of go in the back door of our major telecom companies and screw with our private companies. This is why under President Trump, CISO was created and DHS. This is an agency that is meant to develop an ecosystem of cyber defense with the private sector because this is something that the Chinese have no limits on what they're willing to do. We do, but they don't. They'll go after civilian infrastructure. They'll go after civilians. They don't care. They view it as all fair game. And so the lesson Americans need to learn is one, be careful what you're reading, right? It's a high likelihood that somebody is lying to you if it just seems too sensational to be true. And two, and I mean, my message to CEOs constantly, especially those who run critical infrastructure or major telecom companies is you have to be extra, extra careful. You have to be looking for this -- for these kinds of attacks constantly because the Chinese truly have no limits on what they're willing to do to the American people.",
