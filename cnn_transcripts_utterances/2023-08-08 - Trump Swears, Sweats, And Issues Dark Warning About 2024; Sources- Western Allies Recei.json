The future of abortion on the ballot in Ohio tonight, results expected anytime now in a special election that could also signal which way the swing state might go next year for president. Also, the brutal fight for Ukraine and a tough reality check on the losses Ukraine has suffered in their counteroffensive. And later tonight, how the US Coast Guard hid a damning investigation on sexual assault from public view. The newest developments in the story CNN was first to bring you. Good evening. Thanks so much for joining us. Late today, Judge Tanya Chutkan rejected the former president's attorneys attempts to delay hearing about how evidence should be handled in the January 6th case. She set 10 o'clock Friday morning for both sides to make their arguments. A short time earlier, the former president was in New Hampshire cursing in front of a crowd, continuing to lie about the 2020 election and seemingly suggesting he'll likely do it again in 2024.

Now on Friday, both sides will have the opportunity to make their arguments about what they think the rules should look like in this case for handling and publicly sharing any sensitive information. Prosecutors want pretty broad protections or defense attorneys are seeking something more narrow, protections only for really sensitive information, which they argue would be more in line with what has happened in other January 6 cases. Judge Chutkan has overseen dozens of cases related to January 6. She is an experienced judge, been on the bench for about a decade, and it appears, Anderson based on her scheduling order so far, she is looking to move this along pretty quickly.",

Now, their long game, Anderson, is to try to push this trial untilafter the 2024 election. It's the same strategy that they're applying down in Florida. It's unclear, though if they will be successful in either case, but here, they are arguing that this, just like the Mar- a-Lago documents case is complex, and they should be afforded much more time to prepare for trial.

He said that it was everything within his right to ask questions, to question the results of the 2020 election in Georgia and that's all he was doing.

John McCain was tortured and he never complained. This guy is powerful, he is privileged, he's wealthy, and all he does is whine and God help them, the Republicans seem to love that.

Now, I think DeSantis is in better shape in the state polls in Iowa, for instance, than he is in some of the national polls right now, but there is no path to victory for DeSantis or anyone else as long as Donald Trump is sitting around 50 percent. I mean, he can win it with 40 percent, and the Trump team will tell you, they feel very comfortable with his position in these states because he's well above the above the floor that they think they need to be to capture the nomination.

And look, there's so much headlines and so much palace intrigue, and policy conversations about the shuffling of the deck in the DeSantis campaign. I can tell you this, if you're ever going to change your staff, now is the time to do so. And I know James, the person that has just been moved as campaign manager, he is a trusted person in the DeSantis world. He also can handle the organizational aspects of this. David Polyansky, the deputy campaign manager, I've worked with him on two campaigns. He knows how to win an Iowa caucus. He knows how to deal with the policy and the strategy. So in my view, from a reorganization standpoint, he's in good shape. He's got the people in place and he is really traveling the state of Iowa.

They've encountered staggering losses, I'm told both in terms of killed in action and wounded in action. And Ukrainian commanders in response to that, understandably have pulled back some of those units to save some of those casualties, and while even a few weeks ago, the hope was that over time, they'd be able to break through, more recently, the assessments both on this side of the Atlantic, but also in Europe had been that they don't quite see the opportunity.

The concern is that the unity of the Alliance, both among Western partners and NATO, but also with their Ukrainian partners, a blame game emerges as one official described it to me, and that's a problem, right?

They hope they can do the breakthrough. By the way, General Hertling is exactly right. The line from Washington to Boston, that's the line. And the Ukrainians only have to find one place along that line to break through. Whereas the Russians have to defend everywhere along that line. So the Ukrainians know what they need to do, they know it's hard. They also know that there are more weapons coming. They know that aircrafts are coming. They don't have their air right now.

They're trying to raise the threshold to make any state amendment of the constitution a 60 percent requirement, which is obviously a much higher hurdle. So the vote today is simply on that question.
