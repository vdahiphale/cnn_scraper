      "sentences": "Yes. I mean, when you look at screening studies overall, it's really interested -- really interesting in how they sort of figure out who to screen and when to screen. How long to wait in between screenings. How they look at this data.First of all, to set the table, colon cancer, the third leading cause of cancer deaths. Some 50,000 people, roughly, die of colon cancer every year. But screenings have made a difference. We know that. Let's show, for starters, what is the recommended screening. It starts as young as 45 now. We've known for a while 50 to 75 -- that was really the sweet spot, but they lowered it to 45 a few years ago. That's what we know. If you're older than 75, they say talk to your doctor and understand if the screening will still be valuable for you. But the question has been you got a negative test in that first screening. How long should you be waiting until you get screened again? And that's what this study is really about. And again, I find it very interesting. What they did -- this study came out of Germany. They looked at 120,000 people who had a negative test the first time and got screened again 10 years later, and said how many subsequent cancers did we find? And what they found when they separated this by -- for men and women -- they found for women, 3.6 percent of the time did they find something. For men, 5.2 percent of the time. If they waited an additional four years, it went up a little bit, but not significantly. And I think this is the sort of data now these task forces will be looking at and saying OK, what is the ideal, sort of, interval of screening time? And should it change, for example, based on whether you're a woman or a man, and how old you are. They found that women were less likely, as you saw, to find a cancer 10 years later. Younger people, the same thing. So this is how they start to look at the data. Nothing's changed right now, to be clear, but this is the sort of data they're looking at to determine that crucial interval period.",

This is a new study that's come out that's basically looked at a large amount of data on that interval period.The advice, I think, is very much still the same because the primary screening -- that first screening still makes a big difference. And I can show you quickly. I pulled some of these numbers. If you say, look, what is the impact overall of colonoscopies what you find is that in terms of reducing overall cancer deaths, 40 percent reduction overall, and 68 percent reduction in risk of dying from cancer. That's not the right full-screen here but we can't put those numbers up that show you basically, what the impact of that primary screening is. There it is. And that you should keep in your mind. That's probably the most important set of data when you look at colon cancer screening overall. But, Kaitlan, to your question, based on this new data, the interval of how long you should wait and whether that should be different for men and women -- that's something we'll wait and see.

The decision, in particular, was the big thing that jumped out to people. After there was such a backlash, there was a move to say that this was an idea of empowerment. That this is players taking a troll of what's going on. Well, what happened was LeBron was playing for Cleveland and the management was not very good, and he realized that he wasn't going to win with bad management. So he goes and calls Dwyane Wade and says hey, how about I come to Miami and maybe we can get somebody else down here? And then, the Miami franchise is like wow, that sounds like a great idea. We can build around that. How much of that is actually power, though, right? He worked out a contract. He got to the end of the contract. He went to go sign somewhere else to play. Good for him. But in the midst of the backlash, I think on the other side, there was a need for a lot of people to then come up and try to make that into more of a revolutionary act than it actually was.

The NFL didn't achieve true free agency, for example, until the 1990s.So the idea for so many people had been you get to the end of the deal and then you wind up staying with the team that you were always with. There's a loyalty argument and everything else. But in the NBA, there was a previous set of incentives that allowed them to pay players more to stay with those teams. Then they put in a max salary that said OK, teams can only pay you but so much. Well, then that made staying feel a lot less important because you could not break the bank by doing that. That's the thing that people weren't used to. So a dude from Ohio who played for the team Ohio, looking up and chucking Ohio the deuce of plays where, by the way, they tend to be really big on you staying home. And even if you leave, you come back. It hit people like on those basic levels there. But prior to this, I do think, yes, a lot of people were inclined to stay with the teams that they were on.
