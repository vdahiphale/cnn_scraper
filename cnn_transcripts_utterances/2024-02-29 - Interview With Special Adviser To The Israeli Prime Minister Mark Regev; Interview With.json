Here's what's coming up.Israeli forces open fire in Gaza as hungry Palestinians rush towards rare aid trucks and a deadly stampede ensues. I speak to Mark Regev, senior adviser to the Israeli prime minister. And I get an American perspective from a former State Department official. Then, \"Burn Book.\" Long time tech journalist Kara Swisher tells me about lifting the veil on Silicon Valley and its most powerful players in her new memoir. Plus, Michel Martin. Marie Arana about the significance of the Latino vote in this year's presidential election, which is unpacked in her new book, \"LatinoLand.\" Welcome to the program, everyone. I'm Christiane Amanpour in London. Life is draining out of Gaza at a terrifying speed, the words of U.N. Humanitarian Chief Martin Griffiths, as more than a hundred people have been killed whilst gathered around food aid trucks in Gaza City, according to the Ministry of Health there. The IDF released these drone pictures earlier, and despite disputed timelines, Israeli forces said they did open fire. A local journalist who witnessed the incident told CNN that the Israeli fire prompted a deadly stampede, which left hundreds of others injured as aid trucks and people tried to leave the scene. An Israeli official confirmed, as I said, that the IDF did use live fire, but said that the crowd \"posed a threat to troops.\" This comes in the context of a dire humanitarian situation in Gaza, where the U.N. says over half a million people are \"one step away from famine.\" Take a listen to someone waiting for aid earlier. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator):  I am not ashamed to say It's become normal because we have reached the level of famine. Tens of children have become martyrs because of the famine. I cannot wait until my child is martyred because of the famine. We all have reached the stage that we are not ashamed to go and get a bag of flour. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Unfortunately, we saw a situation where there was a mass casualty -- tragedy where it looked like the civilians were storming the trucks, trying to take the food out of desperation. And people -- a crowd was pushing and shoving and people were killed. I can't tell you the exact numbers. I don't -- as you know, I don't trust the numbers put out by the Hamas controlled Ministry of Health in Gaza. There were reports that maybe their drivers were driving over parts of the crowd.

Now, it's quite possible. As you know, Hamas has been stealing aid, that's been documented. We've heard people in Gaza complain about this.

They have been bombed into inaction, and therefore they say, and the U.S. and others are saying, that this is causing chaos, anarchy, and a complete breakdown of civil order. So, they're not there to help with any security, should they be so, inclined. And secondly, and this is really important, you, Israel, according to all the U.N. and all the NGOs like the Norwegian Refugee Council, are preventing timely and sufficient aid from getting in, which is causing famine, starvation, hunger, desperation, and presumably can also lead to this kind of chaos around a rare aid truck. So, why are you preventing the timely insertion of aid into Gaza for the humanitarian population? And let's just say, the U.N. says it's halved since, you know, in the last month.",

There are problems on the ground. I think -- of course we've got to focus on getting the aid into Gaza. But as today's incident shows, we have to work to make sure that that aid is effectively, distributed. There's no point to have aid coming to Gaza. It's just going to cause problems.

You could see, oh, they could move into cars. They could move into Hollywood. They could move into music. And a lot of people in those industries, including media and especially media, didn't see it coming. And I kind of did. I was like, when I was at \"The Washington Post,\" I would -- you know, I grabbed Don Graham, who was the publisher at the time, and I'd say, classifieds are doomed because of Craigslist. We had this classified business that was very lucrative, but it was static. It was expensive and customer service was terrible and it didn't sell things, right? It didn't work. And so, this was free classifieds when news started to be free all over the internet. And I thought, what's going to happen with subscriptions if you don't have something that people really want, you're going to be in trouble. Same thing with display advertising, that it started to get taken over by tech companies. And that was the heart and soul of the revenues of \"The Washington Post.\" And so, I just started -- I kept telling him it's about to flood and we got to get on higher ground.

So, this was a huge, massive space that basically the American administration, the U.S. administration in the Westward Ho movement, the Manifest Destiny movement said, go, take your family. Put us to -- carry a stick, put the stick down. It'll be your land. Without any consideration of the fact that they were poaching, that they were invading. This was an invasion and incursion of sorts. And, you know, families went happily off and created farms and ranches and whatnot, and pushing the Mexican population off of their land. After that, we had -- of course, the Puerto Ricans, because America took over Puerto Rico, it -- in the Mexican War, in the Cuban War, also with Cuba, the island of Puerto Rico became an American territory. So, Puerto Ricans came streaming into the United States. So, the second largest group here. Of course, the Cubans came after the Castro revolution got rid of the very corrupt system that the United States was supporting in Cuba under the Batista regime. And so, the Cubans came in in 1960s and became a large group.

And returning now to our top story today, more than a hundred people dead in Gaza, according to the healthministry there after Israeli forces opened fire as they were crowding around a rare aid convoy. We heard earlier from the adviser to the Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu, Mark Regev. Now, let's bring in former State Department official, Josh Paul, who resigned from the State Department soon after October 7th in protest. And he's joining us now from Washington, D.C. Josh Paul, welcome back to the program. Look, I first want to just say that there are two disputed versions of this. Now, I don't know whether you heard it, but the fact is, there needs to be -- you know, we're not on the ground. Journalists are not allowed in, and it's very hard, you know, to be able to distinguish. But we know something awful happened and that Israeli forces were involved. So, the question to you, as a State Department official, how much -- what does the U.S. believe is Israel's responsibility inside Gaza now? Is it -- does the State Department or the administration believe like what Colin Powell said way back in the Iraq War, the Pottery Barn Rule, you break it, you own it? JOSH PAUL, FORMER U.S. STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL AND RESIGNED FROM U.S. STATE DEPARTMENT OVER ARMS TRANSFER TO ISRAEL:  Yes, and thank you very much, indeed, for having me on. So, look, I'm talking to you today on a day where the official count, which of course the U.S. government has publicly said it believes is an undercount of deaths in Gaza has crossed 30,000. I think the U.S. -- oh, sorry, rather Israel has an immense amount of responsibility here, right? Israel is the occupying power, both in Gaza and the West Bank. That is the case today. That was the case prior to October 7th. And as the occupying power, it has the responsibility for the health and welfare of the people of Gaza. I don't know exactly what happened this morning. It seems certainly to be a tragedy that was completely avoidable. I don't know how many were killed by the IDF machine gun fire versus how many were run over or trampled. But let's be clear on the context. A U.N. expert has said this week that Israel is using starvation as a weapon of war, that is a war crime. We've seen children starve to death in just the past few days, and we know that the population of Gaza is increasingly desperate. When you compound that with the destruction of infrastructure, and of course, linked to that, the complete destruction and collapse of society and the social contract in North Gaza, the breakdown of order, and as you noted to Mark Regev, the notion of the IDF providing human security in that context, in Gaza right now, is just an absurdity, and it's also not what they are trained for, even setting aside the inherent questions about the intentions of a number of IDF soldiers, as we've seen on social media.",

So, you heard, presumably, maybe, Mark Regevsay to me, you don't think we're trying to, you know -- you know, I think he may have said starve or whatever, a deny them food. We're trying to get more aid in. Why do you say deliberate starvation?",

We know that countries, including France, Egypt, Jordan, the UAE, and Qatar have had to resort to airdrops to provide humanitarian assistance to Gaza. You know, really, the answer, I think, has to be a seaborne delivery. And this is a proposal that the Geneva International Peace Research Institute has put forward, in recent days. But, of course, Israel has not only withheld food, it has also struck, Gaza's water processing plants. It has struck Gaza's electricity infrastructure. So, I think it is very clear right now that the obstacle to the humanitarian assistance here, despite, you know, a handful of trucks passing once or twice, you know, at the various checkpoints, is Israel.",

It's going to take many, manyyears, if at all, frankly, for Gaza to get back on its feet. And so, there's certainly a need for an international response there. But as you say, I don't know how feasible that is while the bombs continue to drop in the absence of a ceasefire. You know, in the last few weeks we've also seen food convoys struck by, for example, IDF tank shells and by naval bombardment. So, we need to see a resumption -- a real ceasefire. And I think it's also important to ask, you know, as people say, well, is this really time for a ceasefire? A ceasefire from what, eight? Context is important here. If it were the case that the IDF, as they are fully capable of doing, was precisely targeting Hamas, you know, senior military officials, as they've shown they're capable of doing in Lebanon, for example, that would be one thing. Ut in fact, what we've seen is, as Secretary of Defense Austin told Congress today, 25,000 women and children killed in Gaza in the past four months. And in that context, you know, to say, well, if Hamas just gave up, you know, the hostages and surrendered, there'll be a ceasefire, I think is a misunderstanding of what a ceasefire is. What it's actually saying, those who say that, is well, if Hamas just gave up the hostages and surrendered itself, we would stop killing women and children. And that's just an absolutely depraved position to take.",

You know, Prime Minister Netanyahu is like I mean really saying pretty much no in public to everything the U.S. says just about. Again, leverage on weapons. There's a lot of questioning now amongst young Americans, amongst the voters, not to mention overseas, about why doesn't the U.S. use its leverage, the only leverage it really has, which is continuing to supply these weapons that are being used, certainly at this time.",

So, there's a clear impact that the U.S. is having here, a clear complicity and a clear leverage. Look, I think the Biden administration has done two things. It has changed its tone, which I think is nice, but ultimately ineffective. And in recent days, there has been an executive order on settlement of violence. There has been a national security memorandum on compliance with international law. There has been a U.N. resolution the U.S. has floated, saying that this is not the right circumstances for Israel to go into Rafah. None of that is the same as action, and what we need here is action. But at the same time, I do think that the Biden administration is establishing at least a framework for escalation. It is signaling to Israel that it has options available. Whether it will use those options, I think we need to be deeply skeptical until it happens.",

There is a disconnect here between the expertise of our civil servants, the policies, and the policy understanding of our civil servants and our institutions, on the one hand, and the politics and the politicians and the direction they are setting. And I think we need to recognize that gap, which is unique, in my experience, and pay attention to those voices.",
