And it's been 11 weeks of war in Gaza with no end in sight and the humanitarian crisis is getting worse by the day. By all accounts from people who have been there and experienced that who are living there. The U.N. says the entire population of more than two million people is facing acute hunger now and warns a full-scale famine is not far off. According to the Hamas-controlled health ministry, more than 20,000 Palestinians have been killed in the war since October 7 when Hamas went into Israel killing 1200 and taking 200 more. That is in Gaza. 10 times more than any Israeli-Palestinian conflict in the last 15 years that have been killed. And CNN is investigating why that death toll is so high.

Here, the aftermath of another Israeli airstrike, this time in late October at the Jabalia refugee camp, one of the most densely populated residential areas in Gaza. The bomb that caused this damage is a 2000-pound bomb, likely made in the USA dropped by the Israeli Air Force.

In coordination with artificial intelligence company, Synthetic, CNN was able to locate over 1900 crises left behind by bombardment in just the first month of the war. Using AI, we analyze the diameter of these craters. Over 500 of which were greater than 40 feet in diameter, consistent with American-made 2000-pound bombs used by the Israeli Air Force. Our analysis covers the one-month period to November 6, in which case, a staggering 10,000 people are believed to have died.

So, you may want to consider driving. 111 million people planning to travel 50 miles or more according to TSA -- or AAA rather, 103 million of them driving. And so, you may want to play with the days a little bit because if the holiday falls on a Monday, New Year's falls on a Monday. So, the message from AAA is that Saturday is going to be bad.
