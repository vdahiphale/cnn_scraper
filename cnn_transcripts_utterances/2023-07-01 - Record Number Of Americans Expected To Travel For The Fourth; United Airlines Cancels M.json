      "sentences": "Well, Victor, Amara, so far, the Coast appears to be clear as far as we can tell here at Newark Airport, one of the busiest in the country and United Airlines hub. That airline has had a very hard time bouncing back from delays last week. We'll talk about that in just one minute. But first, let's talk about what we are expecting to see this busy holiday weekend. At least 50 million people are expected to travel by car or by air according to AAA. And this Transportation Security Administration says they are expecting to screen more than 17 million passengers this holiday weekend.Now let's talk about the airlines because that is where a lot of the travel headaches have been focused. There were major disruptions across all of the country's major airports last week, a mix of bad weather and staffing shortages that left thousands of passengers stranded. Now you United Airlines on their particular scrutiny here because they've had a really hard time bouncing back. In fact, as of yesterday, they still had 979, delays and 234 cancellations. Now sort of adding insult to injury here is the CEO of United Airlines, Scott Kirby, forced to apologize after it was revealed that he took a private jet not far from here actually out of Teterboro Airport as this meltdown of his airline was unfolding right here at Newark Airport. Here's what Scott Kirby had to say about that. He issued a statement saying, \"Taking a private jet was the wrong decision because it was insensitive to our customers who were waiting to get home. I sincerely apologize to our customers and our team members who have been working around the clock for several days often through severe weather to take care of our customers.\" [08:05:03] PAZMINO: So certainly not what you want in terms of optics when your airline is melting down and your customers are unable to get to their final destination. This is causing a lot of criticism for both United Airlines, not just from their customers but also from their employees. So United Airlines under scrutiny this travel holiday weekend, as what is expected to be a record-breaking weekend gets underway. Amara, Victor",

      "sentences": "Right. So we've already got some storms underway across portions of the Midwest. This large cluster of storms here, making its way from Illinois into Indiana and eventually over towards Ohio, West Virginia, and Kentucky. But that's the first of two rounds that we're going to go through today. And we have the potential for severe storms in both of them.This entire area that you see here has the potential for damaging winds, large hail, and even some isolated tornadoes as well as the secondary cluster here in portions of Western Texas. And we talked about the first area, that's the first round this morning. Then the same areas are likely to pick up a secondary round this afternoon and into the evening hours. Then as we transition into Sunday, that system begins to push farther into the Northeast, the Mid-Atlantic, but we also have additional showers and thunderstorms developing across the southeast. So a lot of areas here, if you've got some travel plans that may be dealing with some delays, not only in the air but also on the roads. Temperatures are still hot across the south. But we're starting to see it shift a little farther east. So you're starting to see temperatures coming back down across areas, say like Dallas, Texas, finally getting back down only into double digits over the next few days. We'll also see the same thing for other places like New Orleans and Mobile. It's just going to take it a few more days before we start to see those temperatures come back down to more reasonable numbers. Out west, it's the opposite story. You're going to start to see these numbers continue to go up in the coming days and they're going to go up quite high. Palm Springs topping out at 116 the next few days. Bakersfield around 110 for the highest even Vegas likely topping out at 113 on Monday. That's 10 degrees above average for them this time of year and potentially could be a record. That's one of at least a dozen cities that could end up having some record-breaking temperatures, not just today but also potentially into tomorrow as well. And the other thing too is that heat really doesn't go away anytime soon. If you look at Vegas, notice all of the next few days likely looking at those temperatures above average. I would like to point out Victor and Amara one thing too, that Vegas just hit a hundred degrees, triple digits for the first time this season yesterday. That's the latest they've ever made it into the year before hitting triple digits. The problem there is people are not yet acclimated to this extreme heat. So a lot of heat-related illnesses likely will hit people a little bit sooner than they normally would be.",

The newer aircraft already have the shielding and equipment in place. And only one airline has -- has fessed up. Delta said -- Delta Airlines it has a few older planes, narrow-bodied planes that --that won't be ready, but they have already adjusted their system in their schedule to account for it.And so far they're out the airline posting the -- the delays or the problem. So airlines have known about this for a long time. And I guess in terms of passengers, I worry more about their expectation because remember, just a few months ago, the administration now in sweeping new rights for passengers. They said you're going to have rights for rebooking and rights for hotels and amenities if you get dumped, bumped, or stranded. But those rules did not go into place ye. Those are only proposed rules. And I am afraid that travelers will be expecting a lot more amenities than they have in the past because of this big announcement, you know, a couple of months ago.

And remember air traffic controllers, you have to be under 35 to get hired says the FAA and you have to retire says the FAA, and 56.

The ruling comes as a blow to the millions of Americans who had been counting on it.Joining us now is Gloria Browne-Marshall, a Professor of Constitutional Law at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice. Good morning to you. Thank you so much for joining us, Gloria. I'm sure you've heard the accusations of the Supreme Court practicing judicial activism. Biden has said it's not a normal court after these decisions were handed down yesterday, starting with the overturning of Roe v. Wade last year to the last 48 hours, Gloria, up where we saw the limiting of LGBTQ protections, among other things. And the votes were all along ideological lines, right? 6 to 3, 6 to 3. Is this how the Founding Fathers intended for the Supreme Court to operate? GLORIA BROWNE-MARSHALL, PROFESSOR, JOHN JAY COLLEGE, CRIMINAL JUSTICE: Well, that's the concern, because under the Constitution, the U.S. Supreme Court, the judiciary powers generally were given a short shrift. So when you read the constitution, the first two branches, the Legislative and Executive branches have all types of very specific authority set out. But the Article III, the Judicial Branch has very little. And so it says that there will be a Supreme Court but it doesn't give a lot of direction as to what the powers of that Supreme Court would be. So it's only after the -- the country is in motions, so to speak that the Supreme Court then begins to carve out his powers. And it takes nearly 100 years for the Supreme Court to truly get its footing as to what its purpose is supposed to be and how expansive the powers are. It doesn't even state in the Constitution how many Supreme Court Justices should be on the court. So the number has changed over time but we've set nine and I think that's where we were until FDR, Franklin Delano Roosevelt wanted to expand the Court. And now we're looking at expanding the Court again. So the problem I think most people are having is that the one thing the Court was supposed to be was credible and trustworthy. That's where we're having a problem. So the procedural issues and other issues are debatable. That issue about credibility is the one that's at the forefront of people's minds right now, with this super-majority of conservatives.",

I mean, they were scathing, and on the rejection of Biden's student loan program, Justice Elena Kagan accused the court of acting as an arbiter of political and policy disputes rather than of cases. And then, on the Supreme Court's decision to gut affirmative action, Justice Sonia Sotomayor and her dissent wrote this, \"The results of today's decision is that a person's skin color may play a role in assessing interval individualized suspicion, but it cannot play a role in assessing that person's individualized contributions to a diverse learning environment.\" Have you ever seen this kind of raging dissension and an acrimony really?BROWNE-MARSHALL: Well, think about the acrimony that I read in Justice Clarence Thomas's concurrence. He called Justice Jackson's dissent and her logic cancerous. He used the word cancerous. I -- I wondered when a black woman Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson rose to the Court, how she would be treated by the other black Justice, Clarence Thomas and now we see. I don't know how they get along personally. But just call her logic cancerous. I think that the acrimony is -- is that we have these conservatives who are trying to carve out what they believe is where the country should go based on their ideological beliefs that they claim they weren't going to do you during the vetting process and the judicial hearings. And many of them are carrying grudges into this -- these decisions. We know Clarence Thomas has a grudge against affirmative action because, you know, he has his personal issues that he believed that he was not treated as his intellectual prowess should have been because, you know, he was black and he believed he was affirmative action hire, which of course people responded. Why did you take the job? But there are also people who were hired who African Americans in many positions are not hired before affirmative action policies ever took place. My major concern is this.

But coast guard officials have kept the investigation secret since 2019 and never released the report, only approaching congress this month after CNN asked about it. During the investigation, the Coast Guard found evidence of dozens of cases of sexual assault, even though they only looked into a specific timeframe from the late 80s to 2006, overlooking many years when other assaults had been reported. A report on the investigation found suspected attackers were not criminally investigated. Punishments if they happen were sometimes as minor as extra homework.
