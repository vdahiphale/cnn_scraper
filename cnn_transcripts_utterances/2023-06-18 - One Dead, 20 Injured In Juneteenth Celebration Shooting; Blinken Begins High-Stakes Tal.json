In the Chicago suburb of Willowbrook, one person is dead and at least 20 others injured after gunfire erupted overnight during what witnesses described as a Juneteenth celebration.

Now, what they're saying is that this took place at around 12:30 in the morning. This was in Willowbrook, which is about 21 miles west of Chicago. And officials gave essentially a range of the conditions of the victims. They say some had very minor injuries and at least two were in critical condition last we heard. Of course, we're waiting for more details, but they have been limited from police. They say, as of now, they do not have a motive, and we also don't necessarily have the ages of the victims. We do know from witnesses that this was a Juneteenth celebration, that this happened in a parking lot. But again, police not giving very many details, so we have to rely on what these witnesses are saying. Here's one of those witnesses. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "Secretary of State Antony Blinken wrapping up his first day of a two-day visit here in Beijing, his first trip to Beijing as secretary of state. The first Biden cabinet official to visit the country.The meeting today lasted for more than five hours, followed by a working dinner. When we talked to U.S. officials, the primary goal of this trip is to establish regular communications between the U.S. And China, particularly military-to-military channels. Just in recent weeks, there were two incidents between the U.S. and China in the South China Sea in international air space and in international waters due to aggressive Chinese military maneuvers. So of course, that is one of the issues that lays the backdrop of the tension between the two countries right now. Blinken also said that he is going to raise U.S. concerns on a number of fronts with China, globally of course, when it comes to war in Ukraine; locally, in the region here when it comes to Taiwan. And bilaterally, the issues between the U.S. and China. Those three Americans who are wrongfully detained in the country. The issue of the opioid crisis back in the United States because fentanyl, the inputs for fentanyl largely come from China. So that is something that the secretary is saying that he is going to raise with his counterparts. Now, the U.S. is also hoping that there are issues where the two countries can potentially work together. We have heard this from the Biden administration before on climate, on macro economic global stability. And for China's part, they had a rather aggressive tone leading into this meeting, with the foreign minister telling Secretary Blinken that he expects there to be respect while he's here. He does not want the United States interfering in internal affairs in China. So we'll have to see if that aggressive tone translates into how these meetings occur over the course of the next day or so here in Beijing. And one more thing that U.S. officials are looking ahead to is the potential for further meetings between U.S. officials and Chinese officials. They want that to become more regular over the course of the next few months. Of course, in addition to the possibility of President Biden and President Xi sitting down on the sidelines of some meetings between world leaders in the coming months. Kylie Atwood, CNN -- Beijing.

Ivan, going into this, as Kylie just mentioned, the Chinese really set the tone. Blinken was told that in a phone call before the trip that the U.S. should stop meddling in Chinese internal affairs. That of course, a reference to Taiwan. But why was Beijing eager to have Blinken visit?",

One thing that appears to not have been mentioned is whether the top defense officials will be speaking to each other anytime soon.Ivan Watson in Hong Kong, thank you very much for that report. Now for more on this important trip by Blinken to Beijing, let's bring in \"Washington Post\" columnist Josh Rogin. He's also the author of the \"Chaos under Heaven: Trump, Xi, and the Battle for the 21st Century\". Josh, great to have you back. The Biden administration, the White House has been saying -- the Biden administration, the State Department -- they have been saying this trip is all about getting tensions between the U.S. and China to thaw as much as they can. But you just heard there that the Chinese foreign minister Qin Gang saying today that the relations between Washington and Beijing are at their lowest point since the establishment of formal diplomatic ties in 1979. Do you agree with that assessment? And what are the risks that come with that? JOSH ROGIN, COLUMNIST, \"WASHINGTON POST\": Right, Alex. I think it's clear that foreign minister Qin Gang is absolutely correct, this is the worst that U.S./China relations have been in since 1979. But he doesn't answer the question as to why it is. And I think that's what the Biden administration is grappling with. And that's because the Chinese government has changed its approach to the bilateral relationship. And now they're changing their propaganda, changing their policy, and changing their actions. And they want the United States to go along with it. And we can point to any number of those policies -- Taiwan, related to Hong Kong, the Uighurs, the Tibetans, how they view their position in the region and the world, and what rules of the world order that they choose to follow and not follow. So I think the Biden administration quite rightly recognizes that, and what you've heard from all of these officials in the days leading up to this visit is that they have low expectations. That it's good to meet and to be sure it's good to meet, but they don't expect any real substantive progress, at least not coming out of this first meeting.",

Well, I think if Blinken gets to meet with Xi Jinping, that will pave the way for a meeting between Xi and Biden at the APEC summer this November in San Francisco.And that's the goal. That's what President Biden personally wants. He thinks that if he can get back into the room with his good friend Xi, that they can solve a lot of this stuff. I don't know whether that's true, but at least that's what President Biden thinks. This would also unlock a lot of coming meeting, including invited trips by Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo, Secretary of Treasury Janet Yellen, John Kerry wants to go. There's a whole line of U.S. officials waiting to go to Beijing. And if the Blinken trip goes well or at least doesn't have any real calamities in it, then you'll see a steady stream. And again this is kind of a low bar for good relations, which is that we go there. It doesn't really address any of the structural problems. It doesn't really address the fact that China is getting more aggressive in Taiwan. It doesn't really address that their genocide is ongoing, that their unfair trade practices persist. But at least it stops it from getting worse, and that's not nothing. And I think that's a meager but somewhat achievable definition of success in this instance.",

We heard China urge the U.S. to truly deliver on its commitment to not support Taiwanese independence. The U.S. does not officially support Taiwanese independence, but it certainly does support Taiwan in many ways, including with military aid. So how do you think the Biden administration is going to walk this line of supporting Taiwan, while China is also demanding that the U.S., quote, \"mind its own business\"?",

Relatively, we're becoming less powerful vis-a-vis China. Now that is only a problem if we don't figure out a way to responsibly manage the relationship. And that is what the Biden administration is trying to do. But it takes two to tango. And until Beijing represents that it wants to manage the responsibility, manage the relationship responsibly, by not doing every aggressive thing that Mark Esper does mention and telling us to just go pound sand, then the problems are going to continue. If China wants the U.S. out of the region and the U.S. doesn't want to go out of the region, well, that's a real big fundamental problem in the U.S./China relationship. So I think the Biden administration is ready to compromise, but it's not clear that we see that similar readiness on Beijing's side. And to be sure there's a debate inside Xi's leadership as to what to do with the United States, but right now the hardliners are winning, and that's a problem for them to solve, not us.",

And with that, you typically get strong winds. And there it is, the severe thunderstorm warning associated with that cell likely to expire as the storm moves offshore. But several strong storms behind it back in southern Alabama. We'll watch these very closely. On top of that, the threat for flooding, because these storms are dropping quite a bit of rain in an hour's time, one to two inches. We're expecting 2 to 4 more inches on top of it, hence the flood watch that's in effect for parts of the Florida Panhandle and back into Alabama. Sunday's risk and Monday's risk -- yes, this is not just today, it goes into Monday as well. It lessens a bit, but still some of the same areas, like Pensacola back into Jackson up in Savannah, holding on to that threat tomorrow. Wind, hail, and even tornadoes a possibility. Let's go ahead and take a time out for it. FutureCast showing you the storms reamplifying this evening in places that have already dealt with severe weather late last night and early this morning. So the Mississippi River Valley, the southern Mississippi River Valley, really dealing with that around 9:00, 10:00 Eastern time. That rolls into the southeast. See how it starts to bow out. That's more of a wind threat. That's why we say less of a tornado threat, but holding on to still strong winds, which you know can do just as much damage. And that goes into Monday morning and throughout the afternoon hours. And again, the heat. One of the big influences with this as well as the jet stream and the lift from the boundary itself, but the heat helping to influence it.

And so, there's lots of things that people can do.The number one thing is if you've got high interest debt, to put that money towards that debt, because we already know that the Federal Reserve has already signaled that there may be more rate increases in the future, which means if you have variable interest rate debt, it's going to be more expensive. So first, attack debt, at the same time, try to build some emergency funds and then, you know, put it towards your retirement, if you got kids, put it towards their college fund.
