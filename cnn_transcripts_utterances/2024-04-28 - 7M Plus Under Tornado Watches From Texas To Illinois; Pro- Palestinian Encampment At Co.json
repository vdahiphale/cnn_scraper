This is the garage of a home that was not completely flattened by this twister that touchdown on Friday. But you can see it ripped the roof straight off. Almost nothing in here. Not just because the tornado, the family was here yesterday trying to load and salvage what they could, load it in the truck, take it out of here, but it just shows you the strength of these twisters. And this is the worst case scenario for so many Americans right now who are under these weather threats. Over there as the sun is slowly, slowly starting to come up, you see a car that's destroyed. That was another problem. A lot of the people that were hiding in the basements, when they emerged, there was no vehicle to take them to safety. Again, they had to rely on the community to come here to get help to take them to shelters, to take them to a community shelter that was opened up here to place them with family with friends, other places where they can live while the reconstruction efforts will begin. They haven't yet right now. It's about salvaging what people can. It's about trying to get a sense of the full scale of this disaster. I will say that the Nebraska Governor Jim Pillen, he spoke yesterday along with several agencies. He said it is absolutely a miracle that there was no casualties. At this point, just two people lightly injured. No one was killed, homes destroyed, things destroyed. But families still very much grateful to be together. One of the lifesaving parts of, you know, surviving this tornado is having a strong basement. That's where most people hid. We did talk to one family yesterday whose foam (ph) was coming -- home was completely flattened. They got out, nothing remained. Guys?",

Look at this, 118 total tornado reports in just the last 48 hours, 85 damaging wind reports and nearly 150 hail reports. Some of those the size of baseballs. Again, huge. You can also see the large swath. This is a lot of states that have been affected by this. This is where the ongoing line is. You can see essentially from Chicago all the way back well down through Dallas, extending basically to the Mexican-Texas border. So again, you've got a lot of lightning here, a lot of very heavy rainfall. So if you've got some travel plans in some of these cities, keep in mind, especially airlines, you may have some delays this morning. You also still have where you see these red boxes here. Still some counties remain under a tornado watch for at least about the next 45 minutes to an hour. More of those are likely going to pop up though as we go through the rest of the day because especially this afternoon, once that sun comes out, you get the heating of the day, that will really help ramp up a lot of the storms. So by this afternoon, you're talking Wisconsin down to the Gulf Coast, strong tornadoes, damaging winds and large hail especially the tornado is being the focus down here run that Ark-La-Tex area could be EF 2 size or even larger.",

Mahmoud Khalil telling CNN on Friday that though there was some sign of progress late last week in terms of trying to find some common ground, they say at least, he said that at this point, they have not been able to successfully reach an agreement that would lead to clearing out the student encampment.

The vice president of communications there saying that this was part of clearing out the campus for those who don't have any association with the university.

And most of the teachers there, you know, it was -- their arguments centered around how much they care for their children and how concerned they are that if something were to happen, they wouldn't be able to defend them. And that's why they want to go through this program, often at cost to themselves. And, you know, obviously, at a large time cost as well to finish the training that's required in order to do this.And then also often to advocate for these policies in their schools, because a lot of these programs are based locally. So, you have to get approval from your local school district, your local law enforcement before you can even do something like this. So, a lot of the teachers that I spoke with, their schools didn't even allow this. They were just trying to get training, trying to be advocates for it.",

We're still continuing to see that main line, it's essentially stretching from Chicago all the way back down to the Texaco -- Texas-Mexico border. You've got some very strong storms in eastern Dallas right now. Starting to spread into portions of Arkansas, Northwestern Illinois. This line is going to continue to spread east as it does. It's going to take the threat for severe storms with it. Now, once that sun comes out, really starts to heat things up, you're really going to see more of those strong to severe thunderstorms begin to fire up. The main target today basically stretches from Southern Wisconsin all the way down to the Gulf Coast. Places like Houston, Dallas, Shreveport, even up through Kansas City in those western Chicago suburbs. Strong tornadoes, damaging winds and the potential for some large hail golf ball size or even larger as we go through the day today. Here you can see this afternoon. Again, starting to see more of those discreet cells out ahead of the system beginning to fire back up. By tonight, still looking at that main line continuing to make its way east. This does also mean, again, overnight tonight some more of those evening and overnight storms. So, make sure you have a way to get some of those emergency alerts, whether that's on your phone, a weather radio, something like that, because we've had the last few nights of having those evening and overnight severe thunderstorms. Tonight is going to be the same thing yet again tonight. Also, flooding threat. This is a very slow-moving system, which means it has a lot of time to dump a tremendous amount of rain.
