It`s the start of one of the longest military missions in the world, a nonstop 33-hour flight by this B-52 strategic bomber group to the other side of the world, flying near Russia, China, North Korea and back. LIEBERMANN (on camera):  As you can see, it`s dark outside. The cockpit has red light once again for the night vision here. LIEBERMANN (voice-over):  CNN is the first news crew ever allowed on one of these extensive B-52 missions. CAPT. BO \"NATO\" CAIN, WEAPON SYSTEM OFFICER:  Not only are we one of the most visible and flexible legs of the nuclear triad, we can have a B-52 where you need it, when you need it, within 48 hours. LIEBERMANN (voice-over):  These flights are intentionally high profile. Two years into the war in Ukraine, as Russia challenges the U.S. and NATO, the Kremlin is meant to know about our bomber flight. So is China with Beijing pressuring Taiwan, and Chinese coast guard vessels harassing ships of the Philippines, a U.S. ally. MAJ. GEN. JASON ARMAGOST, COMMANDER, EIGHTH AIR FORCE:  Both the national leadership of Russia and the national leadership of China, what do they react to? We see that they publicly comment about our bomber task force missions, particularly when it involves others in very joint and public ways.",

REBECCA \"VULCAN\" MOORE, ELECTRONIC WARFARE OFFICER:  It`s important that we communicate to our partners that we mean what we say, when we say that we`re committed to our alliances. That`s an example of what the B-52 does. We show up when we`re asked. LIEBERMANN (voice-over):  This 63-year-old Boeing B-52 Stratofortress, decades older than its crew shows its age but it remains the Air Force`s primary bomber, taking part in every U.S. war since Vietnam with planned upgrades to its antiquated systems, it will see nearly a century of service. This year, the U.S. began producing its next generation B-21 Bomber. China is close behind promising their H-20 strategic stealth bomber will be unveiled soon.",

Their mission is not to attack but to prevent attack, to deter. But this is a bomber of course. If we were carrying nuclear weapons, the Air Force would monitor the flight and the joint nuclear operations center back in Louisiana. Seen here on news camera for the first time.

It`s the middle of the day here in Japan where we`re overflying at the moment, en route to the mission area where we`ll meet up with fighters from several other countries here, and carry out an exercise. LIEBERMANN (voice-over):  Here on the edge of the East China Sea, fighter jets from Japan and South Korea take up formation off our wings. Hours earlier during our flight, North Korea testified a mid- range ballistic missile, a reminder of the threats in the Pacific.

By number of ships, China has the world`s largest Navy, soon have the world`s largest Air Force according to the commander of U.S. Indo-Pacific Command. Beijing is rapidly modernizing its military including its strategic forces and they`re not part of any non- proliferation treaty obscuring their nuclear assets.
