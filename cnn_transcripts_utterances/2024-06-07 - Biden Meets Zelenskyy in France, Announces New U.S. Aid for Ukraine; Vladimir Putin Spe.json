That will be the theme of Joe Biden`s speech there in France. The president will be speaking at Pointe du Hoc, site of one of the most daring American assaults on German forces on D-Day 80 years ago when army rangers scaled a cliff to destroy German artillery. Democracy on the mind of Mr. Biden earlier when he sat down in Paris with the Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy announced a new aid package for Ukraine, and Biden apologized for Congress taking so long to help send more.

So a number of things. There as well as, of course, trying to sort of land a political message back home as we were just hearing to win over wavering, if you will, Republicans of the old school Reagan type. And of course President Reagan 40 years ago standing in the same place saying isolationism doesn`t work. A theme I`m sure we`ll hear again today from President Biden.",

      "sentences": "What we heard for the Ukrainian president when he got in front of the -- from the Frenchlawmakers, Becky, a standing ovation was a reflection also of what we`ve been hearing President Biden throughout this week. The parallels between World War II and what`s happening in Ukraine. A very clear comparison made by the Ukrainian president between Vladimir Putin and Adolf Hitler, both he says crossed red line after red line. And at the heart of the message, I think that line that we`ve heard from Biden so eloquently in Normandy yesterday, that unchecked tyranny is paid with the blood of the young and the brave. That`s what`s been at the heart of all these messages and we`re likely to hear again from the American president there in Pointe du Hoc. I think in terms of what Zelenskyy can hope to achieve, of course there are the optics of these meetings, the firm backing, the pledges, as we know President Biden has announced a sixth aid package for President Zelenskyy, $225 million additionally that will head to Ukraine. But more than that, when President Zelenskyy has received by the French president tonight at the Elysee Palace, not just for meetings but for dinner, we expect to hear more about what there`s been murmurs about for several weeks now, the French idea that they want allies to consider sending in trainers. Not troops on the ground, not boots on the ground in Ukraine, but military trainers that can help to form Ukrainian troops. This is extremely controversial, definitely considered a red line by Moscow, but something Emmanuel Macron has been pushing firmly for, and I think we`re likely to hear more once these meetings are finished with President Zelenskyy about what progress has been made and what firm commitments there may be about that. The French very clear that they want to be able to train up what they described as a French brigade, 4,500 Ukrainian soldiers who`d be trained by the French military in order to make them more efficient fighters. But again, the red line that was the use of Western weapons against Russian military targets that target Ukraine had been a red line. That changed. The next question is whether this red line changes as well -- Becky.",

Let me bring in Marc Favreau, who is a -- he`s an historian and author of the book, \"Attacked: Pearl Harbor and the Day War Came to America.\" He joins me from New York. We are talking as we await Joe Biden, of course, and this speech, and it`s where it`s being given that being one too steeped in symbolism, of course and this speech we are told will echo one given by Ronald Reagan in the same spot. It`s taking place in that --you know, this is a place of great historic significance. What message do you believe Biden and those you`ve helped him score out this speech? What are they trying to get across in this situation? MARC FAVREAU, AUTHOR/HISTORIAN: Thank you, Becky. Glad to be here. And I think it is a historic speech. And for any number of reasons, I think first and foremost, where it`s taken place, when it`s taking place, one of the most sort of high-intensity moments in the allied assault on the Normandy beaches where number of army rangers scale to 100 foot cliff and overcame the Nazi defenders. Reminding Americans and our allies that the commemoration of D-Day, which is such an important event for all Americans, is directly connected to our commitment to an alliance of allies in defense of democracy, reminding us that (INAUDIBLE) is kind inextricably connected to this past. That although of course the NATO alliance is a product of the post-war era, its roots are on this day. It is written in the blood of thousands of Americans. And so our commitment to it is tied to that history one way or another. So it`s not something that can be lightly brushed aside. I think also in a domestic sense, in the United States, reminding us in an election year that our commitment to democracy is at stake. Biden, of course, as many Americans as well aware of the resurgence of a right-wing populism overseas and at home. Lastly, I would say that he will doubtlessly focus on the veterans, many of whom are 100 years old or older and the question of age is always present with Biden of course, and, you know, these veterans are older still. But what comes out for me in 2024 is -- as a historical question is that these men were 20 years old in 1944. This is really a question of youth, I think, in 2024. This sends a subtle message to young people in the United States, many of whom are questioning their relationship to electoral politics generally, but also to the president.",

And I think it will be a reminder that these, that there is an arc of history at work here, and that whatever you think about this or that policy, if we can agree, as I think we showed that, you know, a phrase that many people have used that democracy on the ballot is on the ballot in 2024, there is work to be done here. There is a decision to be made separate and apart from your agreement with or disagreement with any particular point of view.

I have to say what a spectacular day it is there. This speech and its backdrop steeped in symbolism as we remember those who lost their lives on D-Day this week of course 18 years ago. Nic Robertson is still with us as is the author and historian Marc Favreau. Couldn`t do this without, you too. Your wisdom and insights so important here. Marc, let`s just get your take on a moment that we saw yesterday. President Zelenskyy having a moment with a World War II veteran, the international ceremony in Normandy, which I think speaks to the reality that we are living in today. Wars raging, not just Russia`s war in Ukraine. Of course we are in constant sort of rolling coverage here about the conflict in Gaza but back to this sort of, you know, Russia in Ukraine and the expansionist autocratic leader there.

I think the commitment to -- of NATO to the defense of Ukrainereflects a historical understanding of the need to defend independent nation states, to defend democracy. I think it is very much in the tradition of the NATO alliance. Obviously the recent delay in defense authorization for Ukraine reflects a kind of historical amnesia or else a willingness to set aside that history. So I think the historical awareness is definitely there. The question is, how well can it be maintained and on a day like yesterday and today, that`s where it really comes to the forefront when it`s so poignant to see Zelenskyy who is wartime leader sitting next to men who fought a very similar battle beginning on June 6th, 1944.",

They`re weighty issues and they are issues that Joe Biden hopes is going to win the U.S. election and be aroundto have an influence on, of course, he came into office and his first big speech here in terms of foreign policy, he talked about being at an inflection point in history and the importance of democracies. And there being, you know, a challenge from autocracies and he`s lived to witness it. And the coming electoral season in the United States will tell many of his European listeners as they sit there listening to what is expected to be this very, very strong speech wondering what -- wondering if he will be the new president again next year, and what the speech might be like if it`s not him and recognizing that Europe actually may be on a trajectory now to be much more alone in terms of its security than it has been with the United States. So I think whatever he delivers here, this is going to be a strong message. It`s going to have the right resonance for so many different audiences. It`s going to be one that people hope will be the enduring message coming from the United States. But the reality is that it won`t be and you have presidents like President Macron not there today, of course, for this particular speech, but very present yesterday, who will realize that the burden for security in Europe, the burden of helping Ukraine can fall squarely on their shoulders. And already hearing the threats from Russia aimed at France for being too forward-leaning to be -- towards thinking about having troops on the ground if only to train Ukrainian forces and not to go into combat. But it will be a very different world in six months` time if President Biden doesn`t win. It will be a world of uncertainty. It will be a world of potential change. And I think, you know, as much as we`re talking about the here and now today and the importance of the history and how that ripples through for the future. It`s a very uncertain future at the moment. And the closer we get to the U.S. election, I think that that theme is going to dominate and until there is a moment of certainty, a new precedent setting out a very clear message that uncertainty right now is probably most keenly felt by President Zelenskyy. And certainly when he was talking behind closed doors where President Biden undoubtedly as we saw in publicly, thanking him for the support, thanking him for the bipartisan support.

Remember that President Zelenskyy hasspoken to them by video conference in the first few months after the war. This time he was there in person and he got a standing ovation. It was a very clear parallel that he was drawing between animals, Hitler and Vladimir Putin, both he explained had broken, had crossed red line after red line, and really this has been what`s at heart of President Zelenskyy`s presence is to remind the world why the ongoing support for Ukraine is rooted in the self-interests of all Europeans. But he is also here, Becky, beyond the symbolism and the optics of his speaking in front of the national assembly or indeed his standing alongside the leaders of the allied nations yesterday on Omaha Beach. It is about concretely as ever what he can get back to his home country with remember that as we speak and even as these commemorations have been going on, Ukrainian troops are struggling to fend off Russian advances on that northeastern front above Kharkiv, the one that Moscow opened last month. They`re under huge pressure on their frontlines. They`re under huge pressure for their civilian populations. There have been tens of thousands of people who`ve had to evacuate from their villages and towns. And it is not very real contexts a part of which of course is down to the fact that there have been so many delays and the Ukrainians getting the kind of equipment they want that`s what`s allowed these Russian advances that we`re seeing. In that context, he is also here, Becky, very clearly to come and find out what more can be done both in terms of extra pledges of equipment, hence the extra $225 million that we heard from President Biden announced, we`re likely to hear up fresh measures for France. We understand that it is Mirage fighter jets that are now being gifted by Paris to Kyiv. And that`s likely to signed today when President Zelenskyy sits down for his bilateral meeting with President Macron. But perhaps most importantly it is what comes out after that meeting and what we hear from both presidents and specifically the French president who you`ll remember has been championing not just what we`ve already seen now acknowledged by a number of Western allies of Ukraine that their weapons can be used on targets inside Russia that have targeted Ukrainian positions, but also President Macron has been going much further for much longer ever since February. He`s been calling for Western allies to be, for instance, present in Ukraine training operations and this is something that we understand France and Ukraine have been speaking think about behind the scenes. Frace`s defense minister confirming only last week that negotiations were going on to try and figure out exactly what Kyiv needs would be. Now, this is for Vladimir Putin, Becky, of course, yet another red line and I expect we`ll hear more tonight, not just on specific extra pledges of aids of which we`ve heard so many of the last couple of weeks, some 14 or 15 multilateral pledges that were announced. Bilateral pledges, I`m sorry, from individual countries towards Ukraine. Now, what we expect to hear much more in terms of the way that Europeans or NATO allies like France believe they can help, not with boots on the ground but certainly with trainers, people who can be there in Ukraine train Ukrainian soldiers. And that would be an important extra step and something that President Zelenskyy has been quoting for, for a longtime -- Becky.",
