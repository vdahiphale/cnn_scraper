You know, at this point, we know that we have three people in custody, and thanks to the good work of some good Samaritans who got involved and tried to, you know, help law enforcement, actually, pin some of those folks down. That's a great start, but it's a long way from having a witness who can actually tell you that the person who you have in custody is also a person who was firing a weapon. So that's the connection they're trying to make with video and -- and photographic evidence. You'll remember it was after the Boston bombing that we -- we tried this approach for the first time, really, on a large scale, and it's essentially crowdsourcing the collection of crime scene evidence. In the case of the Boston bombing, of course, we -- the response was so overwhelming that it actually brought down from the FBI's servers. We had to augment our -- our computer systems to be able to tolerate the amount of material were taking in. That, of course, creates a massive burden of reviewing that material.

The al-Nasser hospital in the Western part of Khan Yunis has been the focus of IDF military operations on and off for about the past three weeks or so.That Western part of Khan Yunis has been the focus for IDF actions against Hamas. And what the IDF says now is that they have -- they're conducting this precise, focused operation because they say that they have, from sources and from hostages who've been released, information that says hostages were held at the hospital and that their bodies may be buried there. And this isn't the first time where we've seen the IDF go into hospitals, dig up compounds where bodies have been buried by hospital staff, because they can't get out. It's not safe to get out to go to cemeteries. And the IDF will then take those bodies and check them to see if there are hostages among them. That's what we've seen before. But what we saw this morning, in video that was recorded by journalists inside the hospital, is smoke and dust and debris and doctors trying to treat patients in what appears to be a partially collapsed room. This is the orthopedic room. We're told at the hospital there's a hissing sound. We're told that that is the sound of the oxygen supply there being ruptured. According to Palestinian health officials, one person was killed. They're worried now about the oxygen supply for -- for patients in the ICU, intensive care unit in the hospital. And hospital officials are saying that it's been unsafe for people to leave the hospital. They say that snipers, Israeli Defense Force snipers, have been shooting at people as they've tried to leave the hospital. Yesterday, hundreds of people were seen lining up to leave. And typically, what the IDF does in these situations is come and tell the hospital and its staff to evacuate, and then try to filter those people who evacuate out, because they're looking for Hamas operatives. The IDF says they want the hospital to keep functioning. It's very clear from the Palestinian perspective, it is not in a state of functioning properly right now.",

This was a very weird day on Capitol Hill yesterday, for sure.So U.S. and -- U.S. officials who have seen this intelligence described it to us as a -- as a piece of intelligence showing a Russian effort to develop a new nuclear anti-satellite system for use in space. This is the kind of system that, as you mentioned, has the potential to imperil Russia -- or America's vast network of both military and commercial satellites, to include even potentially the satellites that are vital to the command and control that America has over its own nuclear arsenal. But Phil and Poppy, it's really important to emphasize kind of right off the bat that it's not clear whether or not this is a nuclear armed anti-satellite system. So think like a warhead. Or a nuclear-powered anti-satellite system. So think like a nuclear submarine. Also really important to note, that officials emphasized to us that this system, according to the intelligence that they were briefed on, is still under development and has not yet been deployed into orbit. And in fact, there's some questions about how far along the technology actually is. So one of the big questions surrounding Turner's sort of urgency yesterday is that officials were describing this as a longer-term strategic threat, right?

These other two criminal cases, the two federal cases, those are moving forward, as well.

But also on Friday, we're going to have a big decision from Judge Arthur Engoron on how much penalties Trump should face for the Trump Organization inflating their financial records.

The appeals court opinion, that's also been a loss for him. The Founding Fathers, nobody who wrote the Constitution or the Federalist Papers was for presidential immunity.
