      "sentences": "Oh, there's no question that time has been good to the Carter legacy. Keep in mind that for the first couple of decades after he left office, and he left office at the age of 56 and kept himself in very good health.He only wanted to talk about his post-presidency. He himself didn't want to talk about his presidency. He didn't really care much about the museum at his library. He cared about the library, but not the museum. He focused all his energy on the Carter Center, and that's all he wanted to talk about. Well, when a president himself doesn't want to talk about his presidency, you can understand how he thinks about it. The very fact that in the last, I would say, five to eight years, a number of biographies have come out. Stu Eizenstat, who was a major domestic adviser to President Carter, has written two important books. The fact that people are looking at his domestic achievements and finding that he laid the basis for some of Ronald Reagan's achievements, and indeed that Ronald Reagan himself recognized that, and Bob Gates recognized it, is giving people a pause. They're thinking maybe we should reconsider how much of a failure his presidency was. And what's interesting here is that, you know, Jimmy Carter thought his presidency was a failure because Jimmy Carter was very ambitious. In fact, Rosalynn Carter said to him, don't try to do so much. So, he set the bar very high and he didn't meet the bar. But when you look at what achievements he had domestically -- his foreign policy legacy is a different story. You see that he had a lot of them. And, of course, that raises the question of how will people view Biden's legislative victories and successes in the first two years of his term, will that change the entire narrative for him later on?",

But when you do look at the four years that he did have, to Tim's point, there is -- it's a complicated picture and I think some people look back on it and say -- and the discreet things that he wanted to do and that he tried to do he -- it wasn't as bad as I think the political view of it is.And, Scott, I know that you're getting ready to disagree with me, but there is a political view of history and then there is a view of history that takes it into context.",

He forgot sometimes that he still wasn't president. But that alone shouldn't mar the record of global humanitarian good that he did.Let me tell you a story. I only met -- I only had the privilege of meeting President Carter once, and it was because I was with a group of presidential library directors, and he had changed his mind, he had decided, he had been pushed a little bit, to revitalize the museum, and he and Rosalynn Carter gave us a personalized tour of the museum. And he talked about the his political career, and he talked about his presidency, and he showed some satisfaction. But when he lit up was when he was talking about guinea worm, and talking about what the Carter Center had done, and wanted to be sure that the folks in the global south or the developing world would be without this scourge. And he was 86 at the time. And I saw that what animated this man, was pure humanitarianism. For all the meddlesome behavior as a post president, which is well documented, I don't think that it outweighs the contribution that he made as a global citizen after he left.",

And when he ran in 1976, he said, the fact that inflation is at 6.5 percent isn't what matters, that's just a number. This is about people paying their mortgage and making their lives work on a day-to-day basis. Hello Biden campaign, hello Harris campaign. You should have learned from Jimmy Carter.

That was -- no, but it was Newt Gingrich's fault because he, the point was, President Bush, the first President Bush, knew he had to do it. That largely cost him the election. Jimmy Carter brings in an independent Fed chief in Paul Volcker, and Volcker makes clear he's going to lift interest rates to -- the U.S. had double digit inflation. Well, that certainly cost Carter the election. But as he wrote somewhat, you know, unhappily, but truthfully in his diary, he understood that there was no way he was going to tell the Fed chair what to do.
