And a paralyzing snowstorm underway right now near the Great Lakes. We're talking feet, not inches in some spots before it's all over. All right. Welcome to our viewers in the United States and around the world. I'm Christine Romans. We begin with President Biden congratulating House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy last night with Republicans now projected to win control of the House of Representatives. The president saying in a statement he's ready to work with House Republicans to deliver results, but warm feelings at the White House are bound to evaporate as soon as Republicans launch their promised slew of investigations into this administration. Joy on the GOP side also likely short lived with turmoil building inside the party in its moment of triumph. More on that now from CNN's Jeff Zeleny. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JEFF ZELENY, CNN CHIEF NATIONAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Republicans winning control of the House after a midterm election that will change the balance of power in Washington. But far less change than they envisioned. With turmoil inside the GOP dampening the party's mood and complicating its future. SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL (R-KY): I'm not going anywhere.",

Snowstorm from today right through the course of the weekend. But there's a major caveat to that statement. Not everyone is going to receive the feet of snow. That's because this is the lake-effect snow machine that is going to kick into high gear. Let me explain. Here it is, already starting. We've had snow reports of over 10 inches downwind of Lake Erie and Lake Ontario. You can see that snow band thanks to the westerly wind but you travel a little further to the north by five miles or so or five miles to the south of that, you get literally no snow. But if you're set up right here within that sweet spot like Lake Erie is currently, that is the crosshairs where the heaviest of snow will take place. And we anticipate the scene to be set here for multiple feet of snow especially near Buffalo, New York, and into the water town area. The stage is set with cold air rushing over the relatively warm lake waters of Lake Erie and Lake Ontario, and that is the recipe for the lake-effect snow machine to kick into high gear. It doesn't take much to produce the instability. Clouds condensing into snowfall and snow will be measured again not in inches but in feet. Already picking up on that on our forecast radar, downwind from Lake Michigan, downwind from Lake Erie and Lake Ontario. How much snow are we talking? Well, a wide swath of eight to 12 inches for places like Grand Rapids, Muskegon, Michigan, but into Buffalo as well as Watertown just north of Syracuse. And that's where we have the potential for 36 to upwards of 48 inches of snow. We've already had double digit snowfall totals in place for portions of the New York area. This is, again, downwind from the lakes. And if you look at the wind direction, this is so important and so crucial within these lake-effect snow machines. It is that southwesterly winds that will put Buffalo within that bull's eye for heavy snowfall starting tonight -- Christine.",
