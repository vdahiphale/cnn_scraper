This is actually his second time facing corruption related charges in ten years.Just like the first time, he's not backing down, even though this case includes incriminating photos it seems of gold bars, huge sums of cash. Menendez says he has done nothing wrong. He's confident as well he'll be vindicated. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. BOB MENENDEZ (D-NJ):  I understand how deeply concerning this can be. However, the allegations leveled against me are just that, allegations. I recognize this will be the biggest fight yet, but as I have stated throughout this whole process, I firmly believe that when all the facts are presented, not only will I be exonerated, but I still will be the New Jersey's senior senator.

So he has been accused of taking cash, hundreds of thousands of dollars, of gold bars, and a Mercedes-Benz convertible in exchange for helping three New Jersey businessmen and aiding the government of Egypt. So the senator saying that this cash that the FBI found when they searched his home last year, that was an envelope stuffed in a jacket of his, he said that that was old-fashioned and that he just withdrew money from his savings account and stored it like that in his home.But he didn't address the gold bars, and he didn't address the Mercedes. And on the issue of Egypt, he -- rattled off a list of accomplishments and positions that he has taken as a senator, saying that he has been tough on Egypt, that he's not aided Egypt, and that he's tried to hold them accountable for their human rights abuses. Now he also spoke a bit to these calls, increasing number of calls from Democrats for his resignation, saying that sometimes prosecutors get it wrong, nodding to that 2015 indictment where he was facing similar corruption-related charges, and he ultimately survived that politically and through the justice system. But he also was saying that, you know, he wants people to not rush to judgment. Here's more of what he said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

If this seat becomes a vulnerable seat, something that could flip to the Republican side, already there's a huge map that they have to battle out here.But Chuck Schumer has dealt with this same way indictments pass, like the last time Bob Menendez was indicted. He didn't call for him to resign. He simply said that he should step aside as chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, which Menendez did last time he was indicted. But later there was a hung jury and he was not convicted. This time, also stepping aside as Senate Foreign Relations Committee chairman. We'll see again when he's pressed and when he faces more questions about whether he'll back Bob Menendez for his re-election, how he responds to those questions.

One thing that will be interrupted is and you talked about this a little bit, is nutrition and health assistant -- assistance a to women, infants and children. The WIC program. You said the contingency funds run out after a day or two after the government shuts down. What happens then to this vulnerable population if a state does not have extra funds to go beyond that?

We went to great lengths to avoid the debt ceiling by striking this deal, which cuts spending. Certainly my department will see a cut.
