The breaking news, there is an agreement, a truce, it's being called, to soon see dozens of hostages free from captivity. Now, they have been held by Hamas for some seven weeks, meaning, right now, there are families, including American families, waiting, hoping, praying that their loved ones are among the group that will be coming out in the coming days. As part of this truce, here is what we are told, a four-day pause in fighting will begin roughly 17 hours from now. Hamas is then expected to begin releasing 50 women and children held captive in Gaza. In return, Hamas says Israel will release 150 Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails.",

It shouldn't be interpreted as the pause and this agreement falling apart, not at all. As far as we know and all the indications are these -- the pause will go into effect and the war will be put on hold effectively starting 10:00 tomorrow. But until then, it is very much on.

We actually got a follow-up statement from the IDF that one of their fighter jets intercepted a cruise missile following that alert in Elat.Now, they haven't attributed that to the Houthis in Yemen but it follow the attacks we've seen coming from there, in which they have claimed in recent weeks. The same question goes, as you pointed out, for Hezbollah in Lebanon. Do they abide by this pause? They have no reason to. They're not a party to this agreement. It just depends on how closely aligned they are with Hamas and what messages have gone back and forth on that front. We haven't gotten a window into that. But it could very much be that as we see a four-day pause in fighting in Gaza and thousands, if not tens of thousands of Israeli troops simply waiting in Gaza in defensive position for the fighting to resume, we see Israel's southern border and northern border continue to see fighting.

As I said, we still don't know which 50 hostages are on that list that are set to be released by Hamas, when and if this agreement is carried out in the coming days. So many of them are still waiting to find out. Of course, there are many who don't believe their family members, if they are going to be released, will be in that initial list of 50.

So, there will be a period of doubt here, and they'll have to keep their guard up and they'll consolidate their positions.They're inside Gaza, but they don't control Gaza. There are tunnel entrances that are being shot at from behind on some occasions, so they don't really have any security in there. Maybe they'll rotate some troops in and out. On the Hamas side, they're going to use it to consolidate, replenish, resupply, reorganize, try to re-establish communications, and be ready for the next wave of the Israeli fighting. So, this is a humanitarian effort. There will be some humanitarian assistance that comes in, unless there are some really strange, strong controls here. Hamas is going to get what it needs out of that humanitarian assistance and replenish its own fuel stocks or whatever. So, this is a -- let's get the hostages out, that will be a great thing, but this is far from over, Omar, and it's very dynamic. It's really hard to predict where it's going to go.",

But also they've left the door open to continue these pauses by an additional day for every 10 hostages who are released.

And it's a really tough political call on Netanyahu and his war cabinet, because the military knows that Hamas is -- Hamas -- to win, a victory for Hamas is they've used the hostages and they've survived this. And then they emerge as heroes among their followers and supporters, the Iranians, the Hezbollah, and these other Palestinian Jihadi groups. They will use the hostages.Eventually, they hope Israel will lose its appetite for continuing the fight. And then Hamas will say, aha, we made it. It was a successful operation. Israel knows this. Israel knows that if they don't eliminate Hamas, that it will set the stage for future operations like this, perhaps by Hezbollah coming out of Lebanon. So, this is a really, really tough call. In the past, Israel has turned loose a thousand prisoners to get one Israeli soldier back. So, the weight on Israel is human life, Israeli human life is the most important overriding factor. But this is the first time that Israel has declared an existential threat. According to Prime Minister Netanyahu, this is Hamas, is an existential threat. Maybe that changes the calculus.

The hope is that this temporary pause, this truce, whether it be four days or potentially even longer, will allow for crucial aid convoys to access the Gaza Strip safely and securely to provide that crucial, much needed humanitarian aid to people inside Gaza, and, of course, also to allow aid agencies to get into Gaza. Now, according to sources who are familiar with the ongoing negotiations, the terms of that agreement are working towards some 400 aid trucks being allowed into the Gaza Strip each day of this truce. That wouldn't be too far off from the pre-war level of aid we were seeing getting into Gaza, some 455 trucks before the war. So, this will certainly be a welcome development for those in need. As we know, Gaza has been facing a debilitating shortage in fuel inside Gaza. We saw over the weekend, the Israeli government then allowing some fuel to get into support, water and sewage systems. But, crucially, what is needed now is fuel to allow hospitals to keep running, to allow people to power their generators. That is what is so desperately needed. And, of course, there will be aid delivered on other fronts as well, safe drinking water, food as well as crucially medical supplies, medication, to allow those hospitals to keep treating patients. And as we know, the vast majority of hospitals, strictly in Northern and Central Gaza, are now in operational. And we have seen doctors working under the most challenging and difficult circumstances, trying to continue to provide care for the so many patients that are coming in wounded as a result of this war, but unable to do so. And, in fact, we've been speaking to people on the ground. We managed to speak to some families with young children who have had to have amputations as a result of the ongoing airstrikes. And what they are facing is difficult, to say the least. Take a look. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BASHIR (voice over):  I was walking with my friends and then suddenly the missile fell, Asef says. I found myself on the ground lying on my right side. I kept trying to stand up, but there was rubble on top of my leg. When they removed the rubble, I saw that my foot had been ripped off. I've been watching and playing soccer since I was a little boy. It's still my favorite sport, Asef tells us. Now, the Israeli occupation has destroyed my dreams. (END VIDEO CLIP) BASHIR (on camera):  Now, for so many children inside Gaza, for so many families inside Gaza, their lives have been completely changed forever. As we know, according to the U.N., some 1.7 million people now internally displaced, and that death toll continues to rise with each passing day. Kate?",
