      "sentences": "The places and the person who will likely decide the most consequential election of our time. That's tonight on NEWSNIGHTGood evening. I'm Abby Phillip in New York. And welcome to the official start of the general election. It's shaping up to be a rematch for the history books. In the red corner is Donald Trump, twice impeached, indicted, insurrectionist, depending on who you ask, and in the blue corner, Joe Biden, older, unpopular, and beset by questions about his ability to do the job for four more years. But there is a third man in the ring too, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., more on him in a moment. But, first, a reminder, this election will be close and it will be decided by a few thousand votes in roughly a handful of states, six to be exact. So, here is where it could all come to a head this November. Six states where, let's face it, each ballot might make a bigger impact than in the rest of the country, Nevada, Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. These are the swingiest of swing states. They are the very same states where Biden flipped the map in 2020. And it all starts with Georgia, where Biden was the first Democrat to turn that state blue in 28 years, and where activists are now warning that he's at risk of seeing his 11,000-vote margin disappear. There's also Nevada, Biden won there by 33,000 votes, but Trump consistently a polling favorite in 2024. Arizona, Joe Biden beat Donald Trump there by only 10,457 votes. Michigan, Biden's margin of victory there, 154,000, bigger, but back in the primary, the uncommitted campaign caused some loud problems for him there. Pennsylvania, another Trump 2016 state that Biden turned blue in 2020, and, of course, Wisconsin, where the president was just this week and where he hopes that his blue wall just doesn't crumble. But here is another factor in all of this. Whether or not this man makes the ballot in six of those states, that could decide who ends up sitting behind the Resolute Desk in January. Robert F. Kennedy Jr. says that he is very close to picking a vice presidential running mate, and he might settle on Aaron Rodgers. That's the Jets quarterback who believes in a lot of conspiracies, conspiracies that include that vaccines don't work, or as CNN has reported this week, that the Sandy Hook shooting was an inside job, that the victims, families were crisis actors. Yes, that is the same conspiracy that cost Alex Jones millions of dollars, because it's a lie, it's defamatory. Rodgers responding to CNN saying that he doesn't believe in those things, not then, not now. And today, Kennedy's campaign stated the truth. Sandy Hook was horrific. They affirmed that children did in fact die. But if that's the case, why even float Rodgers' name? Here is what their candidate said just last night about the man he's considering putting a heartbeat away from the presidency. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ROBERT F. KENNEDY JR. (I), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  Aaron Rodgers is battle-tested, he's stood up, he's been hammered by the press, stood up for things we believe. And I like that part of his character, he's a critical thinker. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

He's entitled all of those protections. One of them is the effective assistance of counsel. We don't know what's in those documents. I presume they relate to Michael Cohen, who it could be have what we lawyers call Brady material, exculpatory. It certainly is going to deal with information that they can use to cross-examine him.

The United States has vetoed almost every call for a ceasefire in the United Nations. It's been often the lone vote supporting Israel. It could change that. It also could condition the aid that it gives the military aid and say these weapons cannot be used, for example, in any further offensive such as an invasion of Rafah.

And I'll add one other thing. Donald Trump doesn't care about briefings. He doesn't listen to them. He doesn't pay attention to them. So, it's not like anything will be lost by not giving him briefings that he won't pay attention to and that he won't understand anyway. And it's better to, I think, to just wall off that possible problem until the very last moment. PHILLIP:  That's really interesting. These are the kinds of things we've got to think through as a country in these unprecedented times. Tom Nichols, thank you very much.",

And what she talked to us primarily about was that this is a really critical moment in our history because reproductive rights and bodily autonomy are something that we should care deeply about in this country.

Prince William honoring the late Princess Diana in London today at the 25th anniversary of the charity that was formed in her honor. Meanwhile, Harry joining virtually after the Prince of Wales left the event. The separate appearances for the estranged brothers come as public speculation about Kate, the Princess of Wales, grows worldwide.And Kensington Palace, they've been dodging questions after distributing a manipulated Mother's Day photo on Sunday. But the ongoing controversy has also now ignited a conversation about the disparate coverage and treatment by the British press of another former royal, Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex. Joining me now is Vanity Fair's Erin Vanderhoof and CNN Contributor Cari Champion. Erin, the tabloids were so eager to say to Meghan, please don't talk, don't say anything, right? Were you silent or silenced, as Oprah said. But now they want her to use her voice to defend Kate or to say something. I mean, damned if she does, damned if she doesn't. ERIN VANDERHOOF, STAFF WRITER, \"VANITY FAIR\":  I think the idea is just that if you can get Meghan's name into a headline, like you're guaranteeing clicks. And so I feel like you've been seeing a lot of British tabloids. You know, they don't want Meghan to speak, but they do want to be able to use her name. And so that's, you know, one of the things, the first thing that happened, you know, in a couple of days of shock. And then, you know, you started seeing tabloids bring up the picture of -- that they claimed was manipulated that Meghan and Harry did to the point where the photographer, Misan Harriman, shared the original, you know, image and was like, nope, there was no manipulation. All I did was put a black and white filter on it. And there's a sense in which, you know, even if they -- even if the brothers weren't, you know, fighting there, I think that there is, that people would still want to kind of fuel that rift because that's just like, it's what we will follow the rails for.",
