      "sentences": "Hello everyone. AT THIS HOUR, the mass is not in his favor. Kevin McCarthy has failed now 11 times to become House Speaker. Negotiations among Republicans resume this morning. Plus, new audio captures the critical moments when medics on the scene on the field were fighting to save Damar Hamlin's life.We'll bring that to you. And it's also a stunning increase. That's how it's being described. That is how the White House is describing the rise in a new COVID sub variant. The White House joins us to talk about it. This is what we're watching At This Hour. Thank you so much for being here, everybody. I'm Kate Bolduan. The House remains deadlock, deadlock. The historic battle to elect a speaker drags on for another day in a fight not seen in more than a century. And that is not hyperbole, a century. Next hour, they will be heading back into that chamber for a fourth straight day of voting in an exercise that, let's be honest, has become Groundhog Day. Kevin McCarthy has now failed on 11 consecutive ballots. The path ahead, very uncertain. The big difference at this hour is a conference call. This morning among the Republican conference all getting on the phone to talk about what Kevin has and what Kevin's negotiating and what Kevin is going to do. McCarthy is fighting to win over more support, making some pretty extreme concessions to get there. Still right now though, he doesn't have the numbers to win the gavel. All of this comes on the two-year mark of the insurrection on the Capitol. We're going to get to all of it. Let's begin with Manu Raju on Capitol Hill. Manu, what are you hearing at this hour?",

      "sentences": "Well, Kevin McCarthy is on a conference call with Republican members talking about this emerging agreement, but he does not have an agreement yet with these hold ups. So people have been denying him his path to the speakership. In fact, he said that we don't have an agreement yet. But he said, quote, we are in a good position and are having meetings.Now, in this call, he and his top allies detailed this agreement which would allow some of these members on the far right to have more power, more sway. He said they'd have re-equal representation of our key committees. He also detailed some of the concessions that he has made. One of those issues is the issue of allowing one single member the power to call for a vote to oust a sitting speaker. That is a very significant issue, one that McCarthy had resisted for some time, but he gave into, but also could create some instability in the speakership. McCarthy on this call downplayed that so that this rules package that they have negotiated overall is pretty much the same other than this issue. He said he's not afraid of it. That is the same message that he reiterated to me last night when I asked him if he is concerned that this issue could make him a weaker speaker if he gets the votes. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

You know, as somebody who has served in the state legislature in New York, where they have recklessly spent and I have voted against multiple budgets, I'm happy to see that we will be pushing to vote on individual budget bills as opposed to an omnibus package. That's the way it should be.So I don't have a problem with many of the rules, requests and budgetary changes that have been requested. The bottom line here is that we need a speaker, and if it brings the conference together so that we can get about the business of the American people, that is most important to me. That is why I ran for office. I didn't run for office to fight about rules. I didn't run for office to worry about process. I ran to get something done. And that, to me, is fundamental.
