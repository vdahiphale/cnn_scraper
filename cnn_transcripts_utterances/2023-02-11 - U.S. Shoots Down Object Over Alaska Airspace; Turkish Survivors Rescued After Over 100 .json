The latest one was shot down Friday over Alaska's coast on Joe Biden's orders.It was smaller and not as well equipped as that Chinese surveillance balloon. Another difference:  this object was an altitude of 40,000 feet and posed a risk to civilian aircraft. The reaction to this object comes after Republicans, like Alaska senator Lisa Murkowski, blasted the Biden administration for waiting until the Chinese surveillance balloon was safely off the East Coast to shoot it down. Here she is. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. LISA MURKOWSKI (R-AK):  At what point do we say a surveillance balloon, a spy balloon coming from China, is a threat to our sovereignty? It should be the minute, the minute it crosses the line. And that line is Alaska. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

That is at the upper end of where commercial air traffic basically resides to some degree.And U.S. officials decided it posed a real threat at that point; the Chinese spy balloon, that was up about 65,000-70,000 feet. That's a clear difference here. But there was also the political implications of what has happened over the course of the last 1.5 weeks, officials saying that had no impact. It will be interesting to see whether or not that's the case in the days and weeks ahead. But the critical element of the days and weeks ahead, the recovery of this object, to glean more information about what it is; perhaps most importantly, its origin. U.S. officials at this point in time saying they don't know what it's from, whether it's from a nation state, whether it's from a private entity, a commercial entity. There are not a lot of answers, no attribution at this point. Again, all this coming at the same time it was announced the president will be traveling to Poland, a critical visit, to continue to send a message to try and rally the Western coalition to support Ukraine.

(END VIDEOTAPE) BRUNHUBER:  Turning now to the investigation into the classified documents the FBI found at Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate last August. A source tells CNN that Trump attorney Evan Corcoran testified for four hours last month before a federal grand jury in Washington. The panel is looking into Trump's handling of national security records at Mar-a-Lago. Meanwhile, Trump's legal team has turned over more classified materials and laptops to federal prosecutors. And the FBI is expected to search the Washington office of Trump's former vice president, Mike Pence, in the coming days. CNN's Jessica Schneider has more on a classified document found at Pence's house and the latest on the Trump case. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

First, we've learned the former president's legal team has actually turned over more classified documents to federal prosecutors in recent months.And it really suggests that these efforts to get classified material back from the former president still continues, all as the special counsel investigation, which is a criminal investigation, is ongoing. So we learned that this turnover of material happened in December and January. It included not only classified documents but also a laptop belonging to an aide plus an empty folder marked classified evening briefing. We're told that Trump's attorneys discovered these documents in December while they were searching through boxes at Mar-a-Lago. They then turned them over to DOJ. But of course, that discovery was two months after the FBI search at Mar-a-Lago in August that yielded hundreds of classified documents. We also learned that a Trump aide had even copied some of these documents onto a thumb drive, not realizing they were classified. We know that the thumb drive and the laptop have also been handed over to investigators. Then on top of that, on Friday, the FBI conducted a five-hour search of former vice president Pence's home. They uncovered one classified document, plus six additional pages that weren't marked classified but were still taken by the FBI for review. Now this search was done in cooperation with Pence. He was actually in California visiting his family when the search happened. But now the question really is, what comes next for the former vice president? We know the FBI is expected to search his Washington, D.C., office in the coming days. But the question is, will there be other searches? Also what will the Justice Department do now? Will they ultimately have to name a special counsel to look into this issue with the former vice president? Especially because we know that Mike Pence is considering announcing a run for 2024, the presidential run -- Jessica Schneider, CNN, Washington. (END VIDEOTAPE) (MUSIC PLAYING)",

We got a glimpse of how that might look in the last hours, when a false rumor was started amongst the crowds here that a dam nearby had broken and we're about to be flooded. That caused people to pile into any car they could and just try and drive out as quickly as possible. Of course the roads were jammed and that was impossible. It turned out to be false information. But shortly afterwards, some local men chased down other local men, who they say were trying to rob an abandoned building.

Many, of course, have lost their homes, are struggling in what is freezing temperatures in parts of southeast Turkiye and northwest Syria.There's a real focus now on getting aid to those who are so desperately vulnerable right now. There has been a real push by the Turkish government. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has been focusing on visiting the quake zone. He says the government is dedicating and focusing all of its departments on those efforts to support those impacted as well as, of course, on the rescue effort. More than 140,000 people working on that effort, according to the Turkish government. We've seen here in Istanbul aid distribution centers being set up in large warehouses and hangars, even a ship now being sent from Istanbul this morning toward the earthquake zone in order to offer support there. Housing, people have lost their homes as well as providing a medical facility on board. So a real effort, of course, not only by the international community but by the Turkish government itself. There is, of course, still concern, though, for those in northwest Syria, where it has proven hugely difficult to get aid across the border. There is that one border crossing used by the United Nations and other aid organizes to get that aid across. The U.N. says it has now successfully sent a second batch of aid across the border. But so much more needs to be done, so much more needs to get across. And, of course, this is coming days later. And there are so many in need, in northwestern Syria. More than 4 million heavily dependent on humanitarian assistance. You can imagine the struggle that they are facing now. The Syrian state government for its part says it is permitting aid coming through Damascus to travel through the government-controlled areas to rebel-held territory. Of course, that was a real sticking point before. And the government has been accused of playing politics as opposed to prioritizing the humanitarian effort. We've heard from aid groups, including the White Helmets, the World Food Programme, both saying that more needs to be done to broaden the access to aid. There needs to be a clear and transparent path for aid to come through Damascus to those rebel-held territories in the northwest. They're not seeing it just yet, despite comments from the Syrian government. And, of course, this is a race against time, because those who weren't killed or injured by the earthquake directly are now facing the very real threat of a secondary humanitarian crisis. Many now made homeless not for the first time but multiple times after years of war and conflict, now struggling in freezing temperatures. Of course, many young children as well left without family members, without parents. So there is a real sense of urgency and concern there. The consensus from aid groups is that more needs to be done to put pressure on the Syrian government to allow for that aid to come through. There is a focus, of course, on getting the aid across the border from Turkiye into Syria but it has proven logistically very challenging. While the actual crossing is structurally intact, the roads leading up to the crossing have, of course, been damaged and proven difficult for those aid groups to get across. That is the focus and that will continue to be the focus now for many weeks ahead. Kim.",

And our -- we really wanted to do that on behalf of our store associates. That's when we got in touch with Debbie and her team, to really make that happen. And we just couldn't be more excited and proud, on behalf of our associates, to make this presentation to them, to benefit so many.",

And you're still processing and you're trying to figure out, who are they really? Are they really calling me? And, of course, for us, one of her questions was, will you accept it?

And then coming out of COVID- 19, you kind of thought everything was going to go back to normal and we'd all be fine.But the stores were still struggling to get their shelves filled. And when they don't have it on their shelf, I can't buy it, either. This money will help us continue to buy food. And right now the biggest thing we've been down on has been fresh produce. So that will be definitely one of the first purchases that we turn around and try to make and try to keep some fresh stuff in the store. BRUNHUBER:  Listen, it's a small example of giving back but it makes a big difference. Really glad to share this happy story with our viewers. Todd Kammeyer, president of the Fred Meyer Stores, and Debbie Christian, executive director of the Auburn Food Bank. Thanks so much for being with us.",
