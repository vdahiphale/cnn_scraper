He will take questions from the gathered press there. We expect to hear about what was discussed in the meeting today and also where Blinken is going next, which is hugely significant in many ways. He will, at one point during this trip, go to Qatar, which is the one nation that may have the most influence over Hamas other than Iran. So, that will be a very interesting meeting as well.

That is one of the views of American foreign policy especially has gone downhill. I adamantly believe Ukraine started because of the vacuum that was seen in Afghanistan. And now, we've seen other things that have gone off worldwide because of the incompetency, I believe of the Biden administration in foreign affairs. You know, six billion dollars was given just a few weeks ago to Iran for \"humanitarian person -- purposes.\" We all know that that money is fungible and can be used for whatever. It's just a different thing. You know, it's one thing to have an outlook that everybody should be happy and getting along, wouldn't would -- wouldn't it be wonderful to live in a world like that?

This one certainly was not because this is such a -- this is such an important -- such a fluid situation with Israel on the cusp of an invasion of Gaza. We all only learned a couple of days ago that Blinken would be going to Israel and Jordan. And then only today that he will be going on to Qatar. And it really does speak to the fact that the Biden administration and Blinken in particular, are reaching out to really anybody who can help and help with a variety of issues that both Israel and the U.S. are now facing.When it comes to Qatar, you're absolutely right. The focus there is Hamas. Hamas leaders have been hosted by Qatar for years. They live in the capital, Doha. Ismail Haniyeh is one of the top Hamas leaders. He's been living in Qatar for a very long time. We reported several days ago that Qatar has been helping specifically when it comes to speaking with Hamas about those hostages. We know from the Israelis around 150 hostages. So, that is something that the U.S. hopes Qatar can help with.
