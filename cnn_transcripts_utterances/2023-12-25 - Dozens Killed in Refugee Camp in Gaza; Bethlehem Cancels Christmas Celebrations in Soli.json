The IDF says its troops located a Hamas weapons compound inside what they called a civilian structure it said is near schools, a mosque and a clinic. It all comes as the IDF disclosed new information on what they said was an underground tunnel network believed to be used by Hamas. The Israeli military claims the tunnel served as the Northern headquarters for Hamas. At least 70 people were killed at the al-Maghazi refugee camp in central Gaza. That's according to the Hamas-run Ministry of Health. Several others were said to be wounded. Many others, according to the Palestinian Red Crescent. CNN's Will Ripley joins me now from Tel Aviv with more details. Will, Gazans are being told by Israel to move from one place to another, but it seems that all of the enclave is a target.

Our journalists on the ground there, working so hard, having to get up on rooftops, you know, just to find a signal, to feed the stuff back. But what we are seeing is just wounded people being piled into ambulances. And what is being alleged by the Palestinian Red Crescent, on the ground in Gaza, is that this residential square was targeted. Now what the Israel Defense Force has claimed is that Hamas will embed itself in these tunnels, or in these areas where civilians are sheltering, undisturbed by the piling number of civilian deaths, well over 20,000 now, according to that Health Ministry in Gaza. But in this case, CNN reached out, wanting a comment about this accusation by the Palestinian Red Crescent that they were targeting a residential square specifically. IDF saying that they are, quote, \"reviewing the incident,\" and then saying that, despite what they call the challenges posed by Hamas, they say they will continue to follow international law and try to take feasible steps to minimize the harm of civilians. Because again, they claim that Hamas is deliberately trying to operate and -- and conceal itself within these civilian areas, putting innocent children, innocent people at risk. And of course, as you know, Michael, thousands and thousands of them have died since the start of this conflict on October 7th.",
