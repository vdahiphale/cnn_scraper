The Israeli Supreme Court has issued a temporary injunction that will let a group of about two dozen Palestinian hospital patients, being treated in Israel, including infants and their moms, as well as cancer patients, remain where they are in Israel. Jeremy Diamond brought us the story, last night, and spoke to several of the moms, who were, at that point, days away, from being forced along with their newborns, to head back into war zone in Gaza. Here's a clip from that report. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JEREMY DIAMOND, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): I might go back and they invade Rafah, her mother Nima says. I'll be the one responsible for anything that harms them. NIMA ABU GARRARA, PALESTINIAN MOTHER (through translator): If I go back with the twins, where do I go with them? Where would I get diapers and milk? Gaza is not the same anymore. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

KAITLAN COLLINS, CNN HOST: Straight from THE SOURCE, tonight. Hurdling toward nearly a half a billion dollar deadline, the Attorney General, who sued Trump, is now warning an appeals court, not to let him off the hook. And Hunter Biden didn't show up to today's impeachment hearing, on Capitol Hill. But a whole bunch of crazy did, including a Congressman disguised as Vladimir Putin, and a witness who testified from prison. Yes, really. Also, the big dance is finally here. So is one of basketball's greatest players, Charles Barkley. We're about to go head-to-head about my bracket. We'll see what he thinks. I'm Kaitlan Collins. And this is THE SOURCE. Everywhere Donald Trump looks, tonight, he is running short on cash, both personally and politically. New numbers, just in tonight, from the Trump campaign, and his joint fundraising committees, show that together they brought in $20.3 million, last month, and entered this month with a combined $41.9 million cash on hand. That puts them far behind the $53 million that President Biden and Democrats raised, in February, and the massive $155 million that he and his committees have in cash on hand. There's a high-dollar fundraiser, I should note, for Trump, next month, with some of his party's wealthiest backers. But he doesn't have nearly that kind of time, when it comes to his personal financial problems. There are just five days to go, before Trump could have his prized assets seized, his bank accounts frozen, or potentially both, if he can't put up his $464 million bond, in his civil fraud case. Panic is not just setting in, privately, as I reported here last night. It's on full display today, on Trump's Truth Social account, where he has furiously been accusing the Attorney General, who sued him, of quote, stealing his money. Right now, he is still counting on an appeals court to help save him here. But Letitia James, that Attorney General, is pushing back, casting doubt, on his claims, this week, that he can't find anyone to underwrite that bond. She's suggesting that the court should disregard those claims, about insurance companies telling him no, and instead suggesting that he should try to get smaller bonds, a $100 million or $200 million apiece. She's also questioning why Trump is unable to use his real estate assets as collateral. That has prompted a fiery response, from Trump's attorney, today, who claimed that James is quote, misrepresenting the facts, and accused her of a brazen abuse of power. Though this judgment, I should note, was issued by a judge and a court, not by the Attorney General. Trump has lashed out at that judge as well. What's clear tonight is that Trump is in a real bind, something that his own allies are acknowledging, tonight, privately, as they're wondering what exactly he's going to do. We do know what James has said she'll do. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

The 30-day period is because the Attorney General said, as a matter of grace, I am giving you 30 days. Now, Donald Trump has his right, has asked the court, the appellate courts, to somehow give him relief. And we'll see what happens there. But I think that is sort of one of his only legal options, at this point, just to see whether the Court of Appeals is going to give him relief.

He was at the International Criminal Court.And one of the things that we do write about in this book is that we think of this as something that's so unique in America. And it is. We've never been in a situation, with a former President being charged, and being -- trying to be held to account. But as we pointed out, this is not unique in the country, here. But it's in the world, it happens all the time. France, Argentina, Italy, have -- they have figured out how to hold corrupt leaders to account.

For example, you showed a clip of her, saying she's looking at 40 Wall Street, every day. Really, she should stop talking about this.

BOLTON: Well, I'm certainly no expert, on New York procedure, in a case like this. But I think it's a lot less -- she could protect New York's legitimate interest here, in ways, a lot less intrusive than going up and trying to seize the properties.

So, it's not like we're so out of whack right now at 6 percent. It's just what it is. But people are just spoiled from what we had for the last four or five years. But it will come down.
