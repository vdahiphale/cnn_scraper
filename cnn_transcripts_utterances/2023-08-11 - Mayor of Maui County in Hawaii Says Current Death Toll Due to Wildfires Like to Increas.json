But defense attorneys, they are advocating for something more limited. They're saying, look, you only need these rules for the most sensitive information here, and they also point out that that would be more in line with what has been imposed in other January 6th cases. So it's going to be fascinating. I am going to be in the courtroom today. I am just watching to see how Judge Tanya Chutkan handles both sides. So far, one thing we've observed from the scheduling and the paperwork is that she is trying to move this along as quickly as possible. So I'll be in the courtroom.

But prosecutors, they pointed at a unique situation we are in, and they say that that schedule would serve the public interest in moving this case along quickly before the election. Now, I will point out that these would be the first two months of an election year. That's a time when primary voting would be underway for Republicans. And if they were to have the trial then, it would mean that candidate Trump would be in a courtroom, a federal courtroom for most of his weekdays. Now, defense attorneys are also going to get to have their say. They have another week to put in their request for a possible time to do this trial. But one thing we have seen down in Florida is they are really keen to try to push any criminal trials until after the 2024 election.
