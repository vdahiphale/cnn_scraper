Davidson says, as he comes to believe, that Cohen did not have the authority to spend the money, even though Cohen had promised he was going to pay. There's no money, there's no money, there's no money. And you're reaching this point where, you know, she says she's going to walk.",

You were in the courtroom when Cohen's banker was testifying about the urgency that Cohen came to him with when he set up that second shell company, how he took out a line of credit against his home and put that into a shell company, which was almost, that money was almost immediately sent to Mr. Davidson. Now we have another update.It says, I think you can tell by these emails I was sending him, Cohen, there was a great level of frustration by me and my client. So that's Davidson talking about the frustration that he and Stormy Daniels felt with Michael Cohen, believing that they were not going to get paid, which is why they started to raise the possibility that she was going to renege on this whole agreement and possibly go public with her story. So as prosecutors here setting up why Cohen had to move so quickly and reminding everyone why there was such a concern right now about Stormy Daniels' story getting out. The Access Hollywood tape had just come out about a week prior. The election is just a few weeks away. Suddenly there is a lot of incentive for Cohen and possibly for Trump to suppress Daniels' story. So that's what they're getting Mr. Davidson to talk about right now, that specific point in time.",

Talking about then-candidate Trump, and we all remember those last weeks of the campaign, or at least I do, was being on that campaign, covering it, was all over the place, and was quite literally hitting three, four, five states a day. And that was when Davidson comes back and says, this is what he tells the prosecutors, this is when he concluded that Cohen did not have the authority to actually spend the money.And I think one of the big questions, as we get another update, says, asked if he thought Daniels would ever see the money, Davidson says, never prior to the funding, no. And I think that underscores that the skepticism that had just continued to build after missing deadline, after deadline, after deadline, and that Cohen didn't have the authority. But also underscoring what we see the other side of that, which is the testimony when you were in the courtroom earlier, the urgency that Cohen was feeling as the real possibility of them turning away from this agreement was rising.",

She's out of this agreement. No longer are you having rights to her story because she hasn't received payment. And by the way, I don't represent her anymore, so don't call me.

It seemed to be a very tough line that the judge today is undertaken. That stood out a lot. Also, history will be looking at this kind of split screen of Columbia University and then another part of New York, this trial. And it's seeming to feel like an unraveling of America. And third takeaway, Erin, was not talked about a lot on CNN, but Ken Paxton being there on the front row with Eric Trump. That is the -- that Texas attorney general who is constantly suing the Biden administration, is being charged for fraud and security improprieties, is always in the eye of the law and warring with the FBI, and is the single biggest voice that champions the abolishing of Roe v.

But I do believe that if he does really squawk one more time, he's allowed to go after the judge, but he cannot go after Cohen or Stormy Daniels, that Trump's really playing with fire.So I think today he's been pacified a little. He's doing his sort of routine of half asleep, half awake. This is a waste of time. But what one feels is the anger in Donald Trump and not angry at himself, but angry at what he feels is a witch hunt. And I just can't imagine Melania Trump dealing with McDougal and Daniels. How many others are out there? Is my husband a serial philanderer? And I don't know how that works in a domestic environment at Mar-a- Lago.
