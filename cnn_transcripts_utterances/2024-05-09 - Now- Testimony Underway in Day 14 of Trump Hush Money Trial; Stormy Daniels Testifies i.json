And right now, Trump's former personal assistant at the White House, Madeleine Westerhout, is on the witness stand. She was one of the chief gatekeepers for Trump, and her desk was located directly outside of the Oval Office.Before that, we heard from a bookkeeper for The Trump Organization testifying about how she handled Trump's personal checks, how she would mail them to Trump to be signed while he was in the White House. She also confirmed her understanding that Trump is the only person who can sign his personal checks. We also heard from an SVP at HarperCollins testifying basically just to the validity of a book that Trump had written, and specifically a passage about loyalty, Phil.",

She held her ground, pushed back as Trump's defense attacked her credibility, her motivation, and at some points, appeared to be her line of work as well.I'm here with CNN Chief Legal Affairs Correspondent Paula Reid, CNN National Correspondent Kristen Holmes. Kristen, I want to start with you. Basically, what's happening right now, basically we've kind of connected the dots through people that maybe people who are watching might not know, right? You had the controller, you had the senior bookkeeper, the junior bookkeeper from the White House side, you had Hope Hicks earlier on. People are probably familiar with her. Madeleine Westerhout was as close as you could get to the former president in the White House while she was there, both literally and I think on a personal basis before she departed. What does she bring?",

She's also probably going to talk about those checks, right?They were talking earlier, the person who sent the checks said that she would communicate with Madeleine. That was one of her touch points in getting those to the White House. She's also testified, though, about the impact of the Access Hollywood tape. And that is key because in the timeline, there are two key events in and around this original hush money payment. The Access Hollywood tape comes out, suddenly Trump's candidacy is in doubt, and you just have a few weeks before Election Day, and it's the Access Hollywood tape that suddenly makes Stormy Daniels' story worth $130,000 and puts enormous pressure on then-candidate Trump and Michael Cohen just suppressed that story, concerned about any story about illicit sexual activity. So she's also been able to testify to the impact that that had on the RNC.",

Reince Priebus, who was the chair, she was working very closely with Katie Walsh, who was one of his top advisors at that time. She was there for all of that, because remember, RNC was kind of running the campaign on some level because there wasn't really a normal Trump apparatus when that all came out.You mentioned an interesting point. She's never flipped or attacked Trump in any way. She wrote a book kind of about how she left the White House on rather bad terms, where she doesn't say a bad thing about the former president at all. When you talk to Trump officials in terms of witnesses they're concerned about versus witnesses they feel totally comfortable with, where does she land?",

I mean, look, she - one of the things that she's testifying to right now, she's talking about how Donald Trump did not have email. He did not have any sort of phone that he used on a regular basis.Meaning, sure we're going to get here, that she was often the one doing the communicating on his behalf. These are the people who at a different White House would not have had that same kind of access level that they had in a Trump White House. I mean, they were literally arranging calls with foreign dignitaries, and I'm not saying that about Madeleine Westerhout in particular, but these kind of low- level employees were doing these enormous jobs, I would consider enormous in any other White House. What we're getting at here and the reason why she would be a concerning witness is just the fact that she is the one who saw everything, was arranging everything, was probably on the line or in the room when he was having some of these phone conversations.",

She connected him with foreign dignitaries at times, it was a very interesting arrangement. All right, Paula, Kristen, stay with us, we've got a lot more to get to. Brianna? KEILAR: Yes. And she's testifying now, Phil, to the fact that he liked to use Sharpies, which of course we all know if we've seen how he signs things or how he writes, he likes to use Sharpies.

One, the chain of custody on those checks, as we talked about. The checks come down to the White House. She would get them signed, send it back.Two, there was a quick mention of the Access Hollywood tape. She said when that tape dropped, there was panic, at least inside the RNC. And that connects up with some of the earlier testimony we heard about. Why would they be incentivized to pay Stormy Daniels. Number three, and I think this is the most important point, the attention to detail, right? The extent to which Donald Trump knew what these invoices were for, knew what these checks were for, would read them, would sign them with the Sharpie. That links up. A prior witness, I think maybe it was McConney or somebody who said the same thing. He would use the Sharpie to sign things. And then fourth, they may be getting into the substance of some of his tweets now. They're getting into how this process worked. And this witness is saying, well, I would - he would say something to me. I would jot it down. Then I would show him. And he liked to, as we know, capitalize certain words and use all caps and that kind of thing. So maybe they're going to use her as a vehicle to introduce some of his tweets as well. We know that they do want to do that eventually. So sometimes you have a witness like this who isn't just sort of a one topic witness but hitting on multiple levels.",

They wanted to pick apart her story. And as Paula and I had reported, originally there were conversations among legal team, legal advisors, that they were going to keep it brief with Stormy Daniels because they didn't want to really dive into any of the salacious nature of any of this. But because of the fact that she went into all this detail, because of the fact that she kind of walked this line on consent, they had recalibrated how they were going to do some of the questioning to, one, pick apart, to go through what she actually said on the stand and then go through these various interviews that she had given really back since I think 2011 was one of the first ones, going through line by line. And then also trying to build up Donald Trump's reputation while tearing Stormy Daniels' down. Now, if you talk to the people who are close to the former president, they feel like she did her job there on the stand, that she was the aggressive, that she did pick apart the story. But I think the question still remains, and one thing that's harder for us, not being in the courtroom, is how it was interpreted by the jury. Did it feel like at points she was ganging up on her or being too aggressive. And one of the things we've talked about, there's a reason they chose a woman ...",
