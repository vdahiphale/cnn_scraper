He says just taking it one day at time.Doesn't want to look too far into the future because the hardest thing is the mental aspect, he said. He's riding a roller coaster of emotions, he said. He's trusting God, riding by faith. And I had a titanium plate and four screws put in my neck and I didn't think I was ever going to play again. But I did get the opportunity to do so. And the night before training camp, I mean, I was lying in bed. I did not fall asleep. I was thinking, man, one hit and I could be paralyzed, you know, and all these emotions are going through my head. I actually packed my bags and was going to head home and not continue playing after that. So he's going to be feeling that, you know, and he mentioned that that meant mental and emotional roller coaster. That first time he steps on that field and goes to have contact, he will replay and relive some of what he's been through. But look, as I mentioned before, it's incredible. His heart stopping really caused the hearts of many around the world to beat as one. It's been incredible the show of empathy and grace and compassion and the love, the charity work that $9 million people raised for his foundation. Again, he's not taking this opportunity for granted. He's going to go on and pay the blessings forward, as he said.",

Now the fighting spreading beyond the capital of Khartoum to more surrounding areas.Hospitals overwhelmed with the wounded. Some of those hospitals have even come under attack themselves. Rival military generals fighting for control of the country. And there is now a desperate international scramble to try to get both sides to agree to a ceasefire. CNN's Nima Elbagir has been covering this very closely. Some talk on both sides of a ceasefire today. But I wonder, given the motivations are the folks packing both sides in this, do you see a ceasefire as realistic and can it be lasting?",

So far, we've heard of specific violations.But I think it's important to state that nothing at the level of how intense the fighting got in the lead up to the ceasefire, which, of course, Jim, as you know, often happens where there's a jockeying for position so that they can claim territory and then you know the music stops. The issue here is just how much is at stake. Just before I came on air, I was speaking to someone who, even though the ceasefire is not what people were hoping it would be, is going to risk it. He's going to venture further afield from his house because there is no running water. There is no clean water anywhere near the home, and he has three young children. And I think that's the story that's playing out across the capital. That people are growing so incredibly desperate. So even though the ceasefire is not what people hoped for, the hope is that somehow this can be built on. But we need the concern, on the other side, is what leverage does the international community have. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said he spoke to both sides to urge for this. But the problem seems that that we don't really know what the stick is that they're waving at either side. Is it sanctions? The U.N. Security Council is divided. What else can be leveraged against them? And the problem is that while that's figured out the people of Sudan are growing increasingly desperate -- Jim?",

If you walk out on the streets, you risk death. There doesn't seem to be a way through this for anyone in Sudan.

JONATHAN REINER, CNN MEDICAL ANALYST: Well, the first thing that stands out is that there was a very big response. There are a lot of first responders on -- on the scene. And what this really highlights is maybe the most important aspect of his survival was that he was not alone when this happened. Because if he was alone, he would have just died in the snow. But his nephew was there and his neighbors were around, and they rapidly called for not just EMS, they called for an air flight to take him to a trauma center and that generated this kind of massive professional response to stabilize him and then get him to the trauma center.",

He survived because none of those injuries punctured one of the highly pressurized blood vessels in his chest or abdomen.And because you don't see much in the way of blood on the snow, there's a little bit of blood on the snow, but not a catastrophic amount. And he apparently did not have much in the way of internal bleeding. That's why he had the time to survive. Every mammal protects their major organs with protective cage and it's the rib cage. And although his ribs were shattered, think about what that -- what that really did for him, it protected his heart and largely his lungs and most and most of his liver.
