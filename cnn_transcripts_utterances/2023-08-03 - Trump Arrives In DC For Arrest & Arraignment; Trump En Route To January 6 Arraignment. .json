He clearly has an attitude about this indictment, saying that, one more indictment and I'd be elected into office, talking about how it's an honor for him to be indicted, because he's doing it for his voters, that they're coming after them, but he's just standing in the way, the kind of thing that he say - that we hear him say on a regular basis.So it's unclear whether or not we'll hear from him now. But we are, again, expecting him to come down with some of those aides and advisors, with those lawyers and head over to the courthouse. I am told by a number of advisors, they do not believe this is going to be a long. There he is. There's the former president right there coming out, stepping down. We'll see if he walks over here. We can get any questions with him. Closer. Okay, it doesn't look like he's going to take questions, guys. So we'll wait on the other end there. We are going to go get in the motorcade, so I'm going to drop off here, so I can check in back with you guys from the courthouse.",

They're about what he and the others did. And so I think the indictment is clear that it's not about speech. It's not about, even if he - whether he believed or not, the things he said, what matters in terms of the charge conduct is that then they took actions to try to pressure different instruments of government at the state level, at the federal level, at the Justice Department and the vice president himself. They tried to actually do things to overturn the election. And so that's why if we want to put this indictment in the context of the overall rule of law and the justice system, trying to hold people accountable for the events of January 6th, then we look to all of the cases and we look to the hundreds of people who have been prosecuted for storming the Capitol and engaging in crimes there. We look to the prosecutions of the Oath Keepers and the Proud Boys who were involved in coordinating that violence. And now we have this other piece, which was the conspiracy to try to actually use instruments of government to overturn the rightful outcome.",

I mean, that's just the reality, because there are a lot of factors, including whether or not these independent voters want Joe Biden to have a second term. That is - it's a big open question when you look at the general election. In the short term, though, talk to Republican consultants, people who are involved in other candidates' campaigns. They are shrugging their shoulders and giving big sighs because he sucks up all the oxygen in a way that should be in any regular campaign, a very negative thing has become a very, in the short term, positive thing for him when it comes to fundraising and when it comes to trying to get the narrative.

You would have your mugshot taken. It appears they're not going to do that here. He'll then appear in front of the magistrate judge, not the judge who ultimately will hear this case, who will preside over the trial, that's District Judge Tanya Chutkan. She will hear the trial, but today is a magistrate judge who tend to handle the more clerical aspects of this type of proceeding. He'll be advised of the charges against him. He'll likely be given a chance to enter a plea, surely he will plead not guilty. The judge will make sure he has counsel, which we know he has his attorneys with him. And then the judge will set bail, which almost certainly will be what we call release on his own recognizance, meaning there's no bail conditions, they'll just trust him to come back when told to come back.

But you can't then ask people to violate their oath of office and, for example, pressured Mike Pence to not certify the election or to ask the states to find votes that don't exist to make it up or to ask fake slates of electors to come out and forge documents saying we're the real ones. And in one state they said, I'm sitting in the Capitol as opposed to in the basement of the Republican National Committee.Those are lies on documents on behalf of Donald Trump. So even if he believed it to be true, it doesn't give you a right to use that belief to commit a crime. So I think this indictment will still stand regardless of whether you can prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he - I mean, he believes - how many lies does he tell in a day, right? I think there was a New York Times study that it's at least 21 per day. When they look at the 30 - they analyze 30 - they fact check 30,000 lies during his administration, which is 21 per day. So even - his brain, I think, is different than the rest of our brains. He believes things to be true that aren't. He lies pathologically. And I think that - so maybe you're not going to be able to prove that his particular brain works that way. It doesn't matter.

But if he is acquitted or a hung jury results, which I think would be understood by most people as being the equivalent of acquittal, I think he would get the Republican nomination, and he could quite possibly win the election on the back of that.
