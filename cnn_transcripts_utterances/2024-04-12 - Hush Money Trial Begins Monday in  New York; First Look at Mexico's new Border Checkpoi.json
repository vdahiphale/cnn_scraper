I'm Becky Anderson in Abu Dhabi, where it is 5 pm in the evening.Coming up this hour Israel convenes its war cabinet as it readies itself for Iran to retaliate. Donald Trump is preparing for an unprecedented criminal trial after multiple failed attempts to have it delayed. And CNN gets an exclusive look at the Mexican government's efforts to stop illegal immigration into the United States. We begin this hour with this region once again facing the threat of war, this time between Iran and Israel. Now most of our regular viewers of this show will know that these two countries have been at one another for decades through covert assassinations, proxy strikes and cyber warfare. Right now this hour, we are talking about the possibility of Iranian retaliation against Israel possibly inside Israel in response to last week's deadly strike by Israel in Damascus or allegedly so. And that threat is why foreign ministers from London to Riyadh to Canberra have been reaching out to Tehran to try to bring the temperature down. Let's join our Nic Robertson who is live for us in Jerusalem. And Nic, the top U.S. Commander for the Middle East Erik Kurilla is in Israel right now as we speak. What do you understand to be the thinking?",

      "sentences": "The thinking was to get him here quicker than was originally planned. He was planned to be visitingthe region. But the decision to bring him here sooner was because of this potential imminent threat posed by Iran saying that it will respond to Israel strike on their conduit killing senior IRGC officials on the first of April a little over a week ago now. So the understanding here is and the way that it's being interpreted by the IDF is that this is the United States showing very visibly, the ironclad support for Israel in defense of any possible counter move by Iran to that strike in Damascus. Of course, people here are jittery for two reasons. They're concerned about how Iran might strike back and could it be on Israel? And if it were on Israel, how would that be? How big would it be? The IDF here says that if Iran struck back in Israel that would show that they were willing to escalate the situation. And of course, there's a concern here as well, that Prime Minister Netanyahu has a deepening and growing rift with President Biden. And that puts in people's minds here the question of how much and how deep can Israel be rely on the United States? How much of a response could they have? So those are the concerns, and those will be the conversations that are being had? And the question, really on most people's minds is how will Iran respond direct into Israel through proxy and to Israel, direct to other of Israel's interests in the region or outside the region or through proxy at Israel's interests in the region? None of that is clear. And we hear from different sources, different analysis, but I think the fact that the Prime Minister is calling an emergency war cabinet this afternoon to discuss the preparedness and the readiness for the threat from Iran speaks volumes. This comes just right on the eve of course, Shabbat calling this very important meeting to test the readiness.",

Eventually, the Justice Department forced him to turn over notes and audio recordings he made of himself memorializing what had happened with Donald Trump, as the federal government was trying to get national security records back. And this lawyer Evan Corcoran didn't find them all because Trump didn't let him allegedly, find them all hid some from him when he was turning them back over. That is important because Evan Corcoran, this lawyer for Donald Trump is going to be very likely a key witness in this case, unless Trump's team finds a way to have parts of the obstruction case against Donald Trump cut out of the charges. That is the issue that's going to be talked about today at 2 pm. So it's not necessarily about Evan Corcoran himself, though, he's a key piece of the obstruction case. What this 2 pm hearing is about is these co- defendants the man who moved boxes at Donald Trump's alleged direction to try and hide those classified records from his lawyer Evan Corcoran and from the federal government. So there's going to be legal arguments around what these two men knew and if how they're charged in the case, if that's enough for them to face these criminal charges alongside Donald Trump.",

But what begins on Monday is not the bulk of the trial, like you would see on TV, what begins on Monday is jury selection. It's when jurors whose names are going to remain anonymous from public disclosure. We're not going to know who these jurors are, potentially, many dozens of potential jurors are going to come to court, they're going to answer questions that the court asked them about how strongly their political biases are? Not necessarily how they feel or if they even voted for Donald Trump in the past. That doesn't mean that someone's going to be removed from the jury, but they are going to start feeling out if people can set aside their preconceived notions there biases and look at facts and evidence in the case. And some of the things people are going to be asked are how engaged they've been in political rallies in fringe political movements in the U.S. both right wing and left wing in the past and what their feelings are about Donald Trump being treated in a way where he is now on criminal trial. So all of that process may take days before 12 jurors plus some alternates are seated, but that begins Monday with Donald Trump, a criminal defendant seated in court before this jury at the kickoff to the trial.",

Lately, he's been showing up at some of his rallies with an empty podium, suggesting that he would debate Joe Biden anytime, anyplace, anywhere. The Biden campaign isn't getting involved in this.

The Ural River actually in Orenburg topped off at 11.37 meters or roughly 37 feet today. And is expected to stay steady over the next coming days and then start to slowly recede as the water moves further and further downstream towards the Caspian Sea. Let's give you a little bit of a geographical reference point. Here's Kazakhstan and Russia to the north. And here's your Ural River. It's the Ural Mountains that were the problem. We had a flip of the switch and seasons we went from winter and almost instantaneously to a very warm spring where temperatures topped 17, 18 degrees Celsius. And of course, when you get that type of warmth and that type of speed of warming, we get a rapid snow melt and that snow melt trickles down into the surrounding rivers streams and estuaries as well eventually overwhelming some of the local dams as well. This is a look at Orenburg, Russia, just look at the communities that have been completely inundated by water further downstream across Kazakhstan impacted by this flooding as well. But what a stark difference between some of these communities just lining the coastal areas in extreme Southern Russia and we just talk about how warm has actually been. These are more like late spring temperatures for this region. So to see them pop up this quickly is very concerning. And we don't see any real cooling trend in this forecast to help slow the snow melt anytime soon, Becky.",
