But again, you know, who knows what's going to happen. We have heard the leader of the opposition, Keir Starmer, already say that the country has had enough in his words, of 12 years of revolving door Tory chaos. And what people need is some stability and certainty. Again, Becky, you know, this has been portrayed and framed by the Tory Party as whether their leader can hang on as prime minister as well as their party can hang on in a credible way, rather than about how it's affecting people, ordinary people, who are hurting very, very badly and very suddenly after that mini-budget. They were already facing inflation, cost of living. Obviously the Putin- inspired -- the energy crisis, the fallout from two years of COVID-19, the austerity that now looks like it's going to be coming into place to fill a massive multibillion pound budget hole. You know, the people are hurting. We've seen polls from the people of the U.K., including Conservatives, where the majority says there needs to be -- the Conservatives don't have faith in her -- but the majority of people in this country say there should be an election. And so far, that does not seem to be in the offing at this. Moment but we now know things change, as you know, hour by hour, in this crisis.",

That's because this morning of the backbench committee who set the rules on Conservative leadership contests to oust the PM went to visit her inside Downing Street at the prime minister's behest we understand to try and, quote, take the temperature of things. I think it's blindingly obvious to everybody that the pressure cooker was boiling at that point. That was followed then by the party chairman, so another influential person when it comes to the, rules. And Therese Coffee (ph), who is a close confidant of the prime minister, both deputy prime minister and health secretary. It was after those meetings that the prime minister suddenly announced the statement that came from Downing Street and she gave this very rapid -- and understandably so; she doesn't have much of a legacy -- declaration that she was resigning because she did have the mandate to continue. In terms of what happens now, the reason I just mentioned the gentleman that have stewardship over the, rules is because we don't really know exactly. One of the things that was keeping Liz Truss in power, was the fact that the process to, A, oust her and, B, replace her was unclear.

That's why it's so important in Britain, for the next Conservative leader to call a general election, because our constitution has never had experience of successive change of leaders without a general election. The second point to make is what do people want? Businesses, families, the markets, they want certainty. They want calm. They want leadership which have a clear plan. The Labour Party with Keir Starmer as the leader, Rachel Reeves as the shadow chancellor, showed that the Labour Party conference, our convention, how we could have a combination of policies that could both economic competence but also social justice. Actually, what this government needs is to -- because they are tired, they've run out of steam, they've run out of energy, they've run out of road, is to make way for a general election to give the British public a chance of a fresh start. What Keir and Rachel have done with the shadow cabinet is firstly, transform the Labour Party. So we show them a different party to the one that got the worst results since the 1930s, in 2019. Secondly, we've exposed the limitations of this government by being an effective opposition party. But thirdly and as importantly, we have set out a positive vision for our country, to have a green future created, well paid jobs going for British energy, for British people, raising sustainable energy to make sure we create good well paid, jobs living wage jobs going forward, to build more homes. Affordable homes that are energy efficient, that save energy bills, but address the cost of living crisis.

And that is what markets wanted to see. And we have seen the pound rise considerably in the last hour. So actually, I think the prime minister resigned more than one hour ago. I think that's because Jeremy Hunt said he would not be running for prime minister. That is really interesting. He will not be running as leader of the party; he has run many times before. I think that is what markets want to see. Hopefully that means he will remain a chancellor and we will have some sort of stability and continuity here. Yes, the pound is still weak against the dollar, mortgage rates have not recovered from what has been a very chaotic few weeks. Bond deals are down, where they were incredibly high a few weeks ago. As Richard said, in many ways, this was a market story. When the mini- budget was first announced, we saw financial chaos, frankly. The Bank of England had to intervene. We see some easing of that. But Becky, I do question whether or not investors, the public, will have confidence in this government, given the public have not had a vote on the current prime minister and they currently will not have a vote on the next prime minister. That will be decided by Conservative MPs. So confidence is in short supply here in the U.K. And as Richard says, just anecdotally, being a Brit, I came out to Dubai last week. My pound did not go very far. As Richard mentioned, I do have to renegotiate my mortgage, it will cost me thousands of pounds more. And people's home sales are all falling through, in terms of my friends and colleagues. So this has been something we have all really felt here in the U.K.",

But the point is, that is not how the U.K. system works. There is a process. The process is that they will now be a ballot, it seems, a poll for a new leader of the Conservative Party. And it is that party, at present which leads as a majority in Parliament and therefore that leader of the Conservative Party will be the next British prime minister. So that begs the question, who might that be, Scott? At this point, whose name or which names are being thrown around for her replacement?",

      "sentences": "Well, Becky, it will be a pretty quick process to find this new person. There are some allies of the previousprime minister, Boris Johnson, who think he might actually throw his name into the ring. That seems quite remarkable, because he only left office seven weeks ago or so after his own series of scandals. For him to be able to come back that quickly after something like that would seem absolutely remarkable. And perhaps not what Conservatives are thinking is the best solution right now. Certainly, in the broader public, not the best solution, considering Boris Johnson's popularity ratings were quite low on his way out of office. And obviously, time did help heal some of those things, perhaps not as quickly as just six weeks. Obviously, many competitors from the leadership race, those names are starting to come up:  Penny Mordaunt, who just narrowly got beat by Liz Truss; and then Rishi Sunak, the most popular choice among MPs. But not all of that popular amongst the party members. Becky, perhaps Rishi Sunak will get a second life, because all of the things he seemed to predict about Liz Truss' policies, the tax cuts would make inflation worse and make the economic situation worse, seemed to come true. Now a lot of Rishi Sunak's policies that he campaigned on are now attempted to be implemented by the new chancellor, Jeremy Hunt. So it will be absolutely fascinating to see how all of this plays out. Graham Brady, quickly, the chair of the 1922 committee, he says his expectation is that party members will get a chance to have their vote, have their votes passed. So how exactly will this work precisely, still a pretty open question.",

Liz Truss says she is stepping downas Britain's prime minister after only 45 days in office. The U.K.'s main opposition, the Labour Party, now calling for an immediate general election. The head of the Conservative 1992 committee which oversees Tory leadership contests says the new prime minister should be in place before the end of the month. What it means is a new leader of the party, which, of course, will mean a new prime minister. Sources now say Boris Johnson's allies believe that he will stand again for prime minister even though he left Number 10 in disgrace. U.S. President Joe Biden thanked prime minister Truss. In a statement issued after her resignation he says, \"The United States and United Kingdom are strong allies and enduring friends. That fact will never change. I thank prime minister Liz Truss for her partnership on a range of issues, including holding Russia accountable for its war against Ukraine.\" Let's bring in Freddy Gray, the deputy editor of \"The Spectator\" magazine. And I guess if Liz Truss has a legacy or whether she will be remembered for anything aside being the shortest British prime minister ever, it will be for her position on Ukraine. So let's start there. FREDDY GRAY, \"THE SPECTATOR\":  Well, yes. I mean, of course, she was very much following on from Boris Johnson's position on Ukraine. It is probably the one thing the Tory policy could agree on, actually, at the moment, its commitment to supporting Ukraine.",

He knew Liz Truss wouldbe a disaster, the human hand grenade, as she is known. He and others knew she would blow up. I don't think anybody anticipated for it to be quite this quick. And I think Cummings thought you would need a superior Labour government before Boris Johnson was ready to come back. But it seems to be happening in hyper speed at the moment in British politics. And so Liz Truss blew up. The human hand grenade exploded very quickly. And now, in a sort of mood of desperation, the party is turning back to Boris Johnson because he is at least a proven election winner. He has some popular appeal and he did win a mandate. It is easy to forget that. He has, you know, if the Tory Party wants to install another leader without a general election, there will be a huge pressure to now call a general election, the one person who could answer that in a way, will be Boris Johnson, because he was the person who was elected.

That's the refrain we are hearing from thosesupporters of Boris Johnson's campaign back in 2019. They think he is someone who can unite both the membership and the parliamentary party. Becky, you and I have our own thoughts and discussions about that time period, where Boris Johnson was just mired in scandal. And all the crises and pressure that precipitated his political downfall. So really, it is a symptom of the depths of the crisis the Conservative Party finds itself in. It could merely be a conversation to bring back a prime minister, only ousted just a matter of months ago and was seen to have done quite a lot of reputational damage to their own party. I think the sense that we get this afternoon in Parliament and from Conservatives, is though most of them desperately want this to be a very short and sweet leadership contest, that can essentially coronate a new candidate, who can bring the party together, reestablish discipline and give them a fighting chance in the next election. It is already starting to take on those signs of quite a fractious contest with those developing and people jostling for power, making moves behind the scenes as they all started to declare themselves going forward in what will be a really critical 24 to 48 hours.",
