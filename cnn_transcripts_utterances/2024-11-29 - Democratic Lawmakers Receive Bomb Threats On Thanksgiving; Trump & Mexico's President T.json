Now, Murphy's spokesperson didn't point to anything specific that would indicate that these are all connected. But at the same time did note that several of several -- several other members of the Connecticut delegation experienced something similar on Thanksgiving morning. That includes four members of -- that -- that represent Connecticut in the House of Representatives. That John -- people like Joe Courtney, Jim Himes, John Larson, Jahana Hayes, all of them describing how law enforcement notified them of a bomb threat, ultimately investigated and didn't find any evidence of an actual bomb. But it speaks to this disturbing trend that law enforcement officials have been taking note of, one that could be an attempt to disrupt government operations like the voting process we saw back on Election Day or to intimidate government officials, people as high up as potential cabinet candidates, which we did see a similar incident on Wednesday with Donald Trump's Cabinet candidates.",

I mean, Mexico is our number one trade partner at about 16 percent. And then Canada, what are we doing here? And but he did this when they renegotiated NAFTA, which ended up basically being almost the same as before, but he renamed it and marketed it in a way that made it look like he was doing something new. What's happening with Mexico right now? I'm -- I'm glad to see that Mexico's new female president, which love that and I'm sure Donald Trump doesn't like having to deal with a tough woman. She's pushing back and saying not so fast because Mexico does have some economic leverage over us given the amount of economics -- economic reliability that both countries rely on each other. And it's just smart economics for us to have that good relationship. So Trump is using -- used fear as currency to get a lot of people in this country to vote against their economic interests.

He's going to take credit for all the border crossings that are already way down in the last year by 75 percent according to our own statistics.He's going to say we solved the problem on day one by threatening to -- threatening to have these tariffs and I got everything I wanted, no more fentanyl coming into the country. No more undocumented immigrants coming into the country. I stood up to Mexico. I stood up to Canada. So we don't need tariffs. Because he knows full well that the minute he puts these tariffs into place, the economy is going to tank. And that's the last thing that he wants. So this is the same kind of bluster. I'm -- I'm putting a marker down now before he comes into office, because that's exactly what's going to happen.

I mean, just this week he has been targeting federal employees on X. He has been going after people like Colonel Alexander Vindman, accusing him of treason the other day on X. And -- and he's being given this very big platform with the government, according to Donald Trump, he's going to be finding areas to cut in -- in the federal government.

Vindman's not -- Vindman's brother, just got elected. But Vindman himself is not really in the news much these days. Why is he suddenly going after Vindman?And the question is, I would hope to Elon Musk is, is that something that Vladimir Putin told you to do? Is there something going on with our foreign policy?

You get these really strong winds, typically 35 miles per hour or stronger. The Great Lakes right now have to be warm and at the moment they are at record levels. Then you've got the drop in temperatures and that's just starting to now slide into these areas. And that's what creates not just lake effect in general, but these very big lake effect bands. Now a lot of these areas widespread, you're looking at 6 to 12 inches. But some of these very narrow corridors, especially off of Lake Erie and Lake Ontario, could end up producing tremendously large amounts of snow. The weather service forecasting between 3 to 5 feet is possible in some of these areas. And again, that is very dangerous for road travel. And we've got a lot of people expecting to be on the roads this weekend. Now talking about that cold air that's in place, look at some of these temperatures and the windchills that we're getting in the Northern Plains right now. Fargo, the current temperature, 1, but the feels like temperature that windchill, minus 15, minus 5 is what it feels like in Sioux Falls. But that cold air is not going to stay up north. It's going to start to spread east and south in the coming days. As far south, actually as the Gulf Coast, look at some of these areas under these freeze watches and warnings over the next few days, those temperatures are expected to get cold. In fact, nearly 70 percent of the U.S. population is expected to have temperatures at or below freezing in the coming days. And for some, Jim, it's going to stay there a while.
