But the weekend strike was the first to claim the lives of U.S. military personnel. Three soldiers were killed. It was also the first on us forces in Jordan. The strike hit a us outpost called Tower 22, not far from the border with Syria. U.S. officials say Iran backed militants were behind the attack, but Iran denies any involvement. The White House says any military action would be aimed at degrading the militant's capability while also sending a message of deterrence. Here's what President Biden told CNN. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

President Joe Biden said on Tuesday he had decided about the strike.Now, of course, the question what will that strike look like? The White House and the Pentagon being careful not to telegraph exactly what they intend to do, but every expectation from the officials we've spoken with is that this will be more powerful than the U.S. strikes we've seen in Iraq and Syria to this point. Now, that could mean more targets across more locations. Officials say this could also be multi-tiered and not occurring just one night. The U.S. also has the option of going after the leadership of some of these Iranian backed militias in Iraq and Syria that they hold responsible for attacks on U.S. forces. But again, the administration has made it clear there will be a U.S. response, even if they're not exactly saying the timing or the exact form. Now, the administration hasn't pointed to a specific group and said it holds that group responsible, but it has hinted that it sees the fingerprints of Kata'ib Hezbollah on the strike that killed American service members. Kata'ib Hezbollah is one of the strongest Iranian proxies in the region. Meanwhile, that organization issued a statement on Tuesday, quite a shocking statement, saying that they had ordered their groups not to continue attacks on U.S. forces in the region in order not to embarrass the Iraqi government. Asked about that statement, the Pentagon said actions speak louder than words and pointed to more than 160 attacks on U.S. forces in Iraq and Syria since the beginning of the Gaza war, including at least three after the attack that killed three us service members on Sunday. So again, the Pentagon making it clear there will be a us response regardless of that Kata'ib Hezbollah statement. Meanwhile, the three U.S. service members who were killed in that attack are expected to have their remains flown back to the United States on Friday. President Joe Biden and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin expected to be at that dignified transfer of remains. Two of those killed, specialist Kennedy Sanders and specialist Brianna Moffat, have been posthumously promoted to sergeant. They will join Sergeant William Rivers on Friday at that dignified transfer of remains at Dover Air Force Base. Oren Liebermann, CNN at the Pentagon. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Netanyahu politically can't do that, given the fact that he and his cabinet and his war cabinet have promised the destruction of Hamas. And indeed, that is what the Israeli public is demanding. Obviously, whatever deal will fall short of both of these positions. But I think the larger issue is how many hostages are alive, how many can be traded.

Already we're seeing Hamas reorganize itself in the northern Gaza Strip weeks after the Israelis have said that they had ceased to be a significant threat in the north.

It has just gone 1The Republican controlled Homeland Security Committee has voted to bring two articles of impeachment to a vote in the lower House, which means for the first time in nearly 150 years, a cabinet secretary could be charged with high crimes and misdemeanors by Congress. Republican lawmakers accused Secretary of Mayorkas of failing to enforce U.S. immigration policies at the southern border. Two articles of impeachment allege the willful and systematic refusal to comply with the law and breaching public trust. Republicans have offered little evidence of wrongdoing by Mayorkas and constitutional experts, (INAUDIBLE) Democrats have argued this is an abuse of the impeachment process. Let's get more on this. Raul Reyes is attorney, immigration analyst and CNN opinion writer. He joins us now live from New York. Staying up late Raul, thank you so much. So, the thing about what is happening right now on Capitol Hill, and they're all working back late, if this gets to an impeachment trial, the verdict. Right. Is a foregone conclusion.",

President Biden would simply appoint another person to carry out his immigration policies. So that's the farce, the political theater of what we're seeing here, because all of this, it will have zero impact on our border crisis, the humanitarian crisis, and certainly the leadership crisis in Washington. And the fact that we haven't done this as a country since nearly 150 years really says something about what a serious move the impeachment of a cabinet official is. I mean, it would be setting a very dangerous precedent, in my view, worth this to go through, because we could see in the future with politicians from both parties going ahead with attempted impeachments or impeachments based on similar grounds as here, which is basically policy differences, not actual high crimes and misdemeanors.",

As long as they have the attention of the country and the media here, they want to exploit this issue right now as primaries are coming, as we're seeing some polls for Joe Biden showing that he has -- a majority of Americans are not happy with his immigration policies. So, Republicans want to keep this in the media, in the public eye, and make as much, I guess, political hay out of the issue while they can. And meanwhile, as we've talked about here, the true potential deal on immigration that might actually turn into something significant that seems, with each passing day to sort of be slipping away. So we're just stuck in the same status quo. And that gives Republicans and conservatives a contentious issue, a chaotic border and a sense that, false sense that we have open borders, that gives them something to run on and make the case that Joe Biden cannot handle immigration. And remember where they do go after Alejandro Mayorkas for these supposed high crimes and misdemeanors. All Mayorkas is doing is executing President Biden's policies. That's his job. He's not making these policies. He's not accused of any type of extrajudicial activities. He's simply carrying out the policies as a cabinet member of the president who appointed him.",

So first this is so occasionally there will be dictators who basically miscalculate and are not able to manipulate systems. So they will lose the polls then he might refuse to back down.But, but that's a very clear signal to different opposition groups, different parts of the citizenry, different organizations and opposition parties to basically rally around and coordinate. So this is why elections are so dangerous even if there's this clear evidence, also of fraud. Then that's also very clear signal to the different groups in the country that now is the time to challenge the regime. So this is the risk, this is the short-term risking while we see that the probability of defeat should be breaking down, it's actually harder in election years than other years. But if they are able to ride out the storm, there are three basically mechanisms that work more longer, longer term. So one is its legitimacy. So even if we can see that these elections are fraud or at least some people, (INAUDIBLE) realized these are fraudulent elections. There is some kind of legitimacy benefit, at least in certain groups to be able to claim that you're having elections and so uncertainly about the popularity of the regime. So Putin is a good, good example. I think he's been deemed us as very popular within Russia and there's probably good reason to believe that. So that's, one aspect. The other one is basically that you use show of force, you signal to the opposition that you're able to organize, kind of mobilize the troops if you like, mobilize your supporters and pull off a fraudulent election. So it's kind of a signal of force. And then the third one is information. So if you hold elections, you can basically -- and there's a lot of good research on this autographs, being able to see where in the country are we more and less popular kind of what are the issues to be able to use this to gain information about what's going on the ground because that's often difficult in autocracies to figure out what people truly, truly mean.",

And his PTI Party is now challenging -- well they say will challenge those verdicts, with both happening in a closed court a little more than a week before the next elections there in Pakistan. Despite his verdict (ph), Khan remains very popular with his voters. A Thai court will rule soon on whether an opposition party plan to amend a law against insulting the monarchy is unconstitutional. That's according to the news agency, Reuters. The court also expected to decide whether the plan is equivalent to an attempt to overthrow the government with the king as head of state. Move Forward argues that changing the law would make the constitutional monarchy stronger and stop the law for being misused by lawmakers against their political opponents. The penalty for insulting Thai royalty right now is up to 15 years in jail and they use it a lot. Well, when we come back, Paris under siege with highways and roads into the French capital blocked by protesting farmers angry over surging costs and falling incomes. (COMMERCIAL BREAK)",

Farmers in Belgium used their tractors to block a highway on Tuesday. They've joined Germany, Italy, Romania, and France as part of these strikes. And in France, tens of thousands of farmers have staged nationwide protests including throwing manure on government buildings and blocking roads into Paris. And now pressure is growing on the French President Emmanuel Macron to try and resolve it. Mr. Macron set to discuss the issue with European Commission president on Thursday. Farmers used tractors to block key roadways outside Paris to protest cheap imports, low wages, government policies. They're not happy.

So it's a number of different issues that they say have driven them to this, to trying to put a stranglehold around the French capital in order to bring it to a halt. It is a siege that they're threatening. For now just a few of these main roads into Paris are being blocked. Their threat though is that this will get (INAUDIBLE) now. As you can see, well, just behind me where they have set up a little while ago, a big screen. They were listening to Gabriel Atal, the French prime minister make a serious (ph) announcement to French farmers. For now, I have to say it was a very broad speech. A very fiery, he's new to his job, he's very young. And it was his job to try and show that he was determined to change the way the French state worked. In terms of specifics for farmers, it was fairly short on those, but we expect more measures to be announced today. Much more crucial, though likely to be this meeting on Thursday, E.U. leaders will meet. Remember that this is now a European-wide problem. Each set of farmers from the particular countries has their own set of grievances. But all together, European-wide farmers are feeling the brunt of European regulations that are making their jobs harder, European attempts to import cheap food both grain and meat, milk from outside the European Union where they say the measures, the request, the demands being made, of farmers there are far less stringent. So there is an injustice they say at the heart of the system that they are no longer willing to tolerate and they say very much like you'll remember, the Yellow Vest protests of a few years ago here in France. They were kicked off by that straw that broke the camel's back. It was a rise in fuel taxes. Similarly, the drop really here that caused all of this to explode here in front France was the announcement that there would no longer be subsidies on the crucial diesel that many of these farmers use to run their farm. So all of this combined now a major headache for the French government and not only for European governments and for Brussels by the time they meet on Thursday. They're going to figure out how they can bring this sort of disruption to an end. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

And this month, \"Africa Insider\" meets GetFundedAfrica and Nigerian digital marketplace that uses artificial intelligence to help match suitable investors with startups on the continent.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JOSHUA MURIMA, HEAD OF ENGAGEMENT &amp; INVESTMENT RELATIONS, BRITER BRIDGES: The African tax scene has grown in leaps and bounds over the past ten years. So far, $21 billion has been deployed over the course of ten years. This has created a new hub of a presence of a digital economy that attracts stakeholders and investors and (INAUDIBLE) across the globe. DEBO OMOLOLU; CO-FOUNDER, GETFUNDEDAFRICA: For African businesses and African people, they typically have to find a way to leap frog existing infrastructure deficits. And so fintech comes as a way for that leap frog to happen in a digital way, thereby bringing in efficiency and growth and economic impact. My name is Debo Omololu, and I am the co-founder and CEO of GetFundedAfrica. GetFundedAfrica is a cloud-based company that provides solutions that helps African companies to grow, tell their stories, and to raise funds. The whole essence of GetFundedAfrica was really more about how can we influence and make it easier for people around the world to invest in African companies. And those African companies to be able to solve social problems. But beyond just fundraising, it also even recommends leveraging A.I., several sets of investors that have a higher probability of investing in companies. So you could think of it, you know, as a Tinder sort of with investors and so you can swipe left if need be. It makes it a lot easier to get matched to you know, an equity investor or debt investor. Just do what I am, follow all the steps and I'm matched with somebody that is, you know, like-minded. All right, now, we have interests of around $300,000. GetFundedAfrica has helped over 500 companies raise $400 million over the last few years. And we now have companies in 34 of Africa's 55 countries and territories. Weve been involved in fintech naturally, which is one of the biggest platforms -- biggest industries from an African perspective out there, supply chain and logistics, agriculture, even space tech as well, and education technology firms. Fintech and technology as a whole is going to be the way that Africa moves from an emerging economy into a top economy in the world. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Musk announced his startup company Neuralink that installed a brain implant in its first human patient.Don't know a lot about the patient, Musk says he's recovering well -- or he or she is recovering well. Neuralink is far from the only company working on this type of technology, but ultimately Musk says he wants to commercialize a product called Telepathy, and someday help people who have lost the use of their limbs. So does this mean there's now reason for hope for thousands of people with debilitating conditions such as quadriplegia?

So on the top here, this is a part of the brain that's responsible for movement. This chip or this device actually sits on that top, that part of the brain. And when you think about movement, can't move. These are patients who are quadriplegic or have ALS, but just thinking about movement, that releases a characteristic firing of neurons. And this device says, oh, ok, that's the firing of neurons that looks like when someone wants to move a cursor this way or move a mouse this way. And eventually the device learns what those -- those electrical patterns look like. And after it learns it well enough and that can take weeks, if not months to learn it connects to a Bluetooth device, which can then control things in your environment, your smartphone, your mouse on your computer, things like that. The person is not moving, but they're just thinking about moving and that's what's causing this change in the devices around them.",

So that's not new to necessarily have a foreign body that sits in the brain or on top of the brain as, as is the case here but. But a lot of things have to happen for this to become a reality. I mean, you know, the idea, first of all, all we know is they've implanted it. Does it actually work? There has been videos of monkeys, for example, primates that have had these devices that have been able to control a cursor and even play a game like pong for example. I think we have some video of that. Is it going to be able to do the same thing in humans, will it get even better so that I could have a text chain with you without ever having to actually touch a device, just doing it all with my mind. I think that they're pretty confident they're going to get to that point. But that's years away still, John. They have to go through all this regulatory approval.
