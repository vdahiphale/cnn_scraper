Details on the mostly peaceful but tense day ahead. And the U.S. state of South Carolina is cracking down on a woman's right to choose. We'll hear from one Republican lawmaker standing firm against her party's six-week abortion ban. Plus, confusion and concern in Colombia after the president has to retract a statement that four children were rescued from the jungle. The very latest on the search. But first, a tense day in Jerusalem as thousands of Israeli nationalists march through the streets in a provocative annual flag parade. Far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir joined the crowds just a few hours ago, you can see him there. He's been convicted of supporting anti- Palestinian terrorism, but was greeted here like a rock star with some marchers chanting, the prime minister is here. Well, the march was mostly peaceful, but some demonstrators threw rocks at journalists, including two of our own. They also taunted journalists in hijabs, some shouting, may your village burn. Two people have been arrested. The annual march celebrates Israel's capture of East Jerusalem during the 1967 war. Israel later annexed the territory in a move not recognized under international law. Well, let's bring in our CNN Hadas Gold who is live in Jerusalem, has been today. Hadas, clearly, a day of tension in Jerusalem. Tell us what you have been seeing, witnessing in the last few hours, and the type of people who have been turning out for this rally.",

But it is happening as you noticed, a few days after a ceasefire was reached between Islamic Jihad militants and the Israeli military after that several-day long conflict there. And in a way, I actually think that probably helped cool the situation, having a ceasefire a few days before it helped cool the situation on the ground. Because of course, if the -- if the conflict was ongoing with the militants in Gaza and the Israeli military while this march was going on, I think we could have definitely expected some sort of major response from the militants there towards Jerusalem, towards this march. But that was a major focus and a major push by those who were trying to get that ceasefire by the Egyptians, by others, knowing that this date was coming very quickly. They wanted that ceasefire done before today's march, Christina.",

Now, Ukrainian forces are fighting with momentum in Bakhmut, claiming more progress in and around the city each day. Still, they're coming under heavy fire from Russian fighters. As the battle intensifies, so are Russian airstrikes on Ukraine's capital. Officials in Kyiv say Moscow launched an assault notable for its power, intensity and variety. But air defenses are holding strong, intercepting 29 of 30 missiles fired towards the city. And it comes just two days after Russia's last attack damaged a U.S.-made Patriot air defense system. Sam Kiley is joining us now from the southeastern area of Ukraine. And Sam, so more strikes overnight, the strongest yet from Moscow, and presumably, all of this a preemptive effort from Russia as we continue to wait for the counteroffensive to begin in earnest.",

Theseairstrikes, I have to say, have become -- or air attacks, have become completely routine, they've been conducted on an almost nightly basis, on a variety of scales, we've had much more heavy in terms of numbers of missiles, particularly, the Shahed drones fired in the past now. The focus is to focus the attacks particularly on Kyiv, but last night, they were much more widely disposed across the whole country. There was a death in Odessa, reportedly as a result of falling debris after a Russian cruise missile was downed by Ukrainian defenses. But they are clearly trying to test the ability of the Ukrainians to defend themselves, but also to soak up that ability. So that if there is a ground offensive put in by the Ukrainians, then they -- this is the Russian idea, they will hope that a lot of the air defenses already been spent, and they could get some aircraft in the air to attack ground troops. But that's all looking forward, what's going on in the present now is intensive fighting in Bakhmut with a weird situation in which there are advances being reported by the Wagner mercenary group in the center of the town. Well, it's simultaneously being flanked to the north and south by Ukrainian advances. Ukrainians are throwing more into that battle than we've seen recently. They've thrown more into it over the last week or so, and enjoyed some degree of success on the outskirts of the town, even while the mercenary organization has been continuing to fight house-to-house. They'll be looking there for vulnerabilities, possibly to open up as part of the future Summer offensive. But I think in all probability, that will be a surprise attack, and we simply have no idea where that would be, Christina.",

The Ukrainians, as is typical, and you kind of hinted that with your chuckle there, I've got slightly tongue-in-cheek response to these source of activities. We've seen it in the past when there was attacks on airfields, for example, or an airfield in Crimea, they said that would be an accident caused by somebody smoking a cigarette on an airfield. This they say is a result, tongue-in-cheek of a lack of repairs and maintenance. But ultimately, these should be seen as part of two things, really. The ongoing effort to undermine the ability of the Russians to supply their troops in the present.

They include U.S. President Joe Biden, who is in Japan despite a looming debt-ceiling crisis back home. He is due back in the U.S. on Sunday to resume those debt talks. But for now, he is meeting with leaders like Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida. The prime mister represents Hiroshima in Japan's parliament, and the U.S. nuclear attack on his city in World War II is relevant whenever dignitaries come to town. But it's taken on new significance this year amid Russia's war in Ukraine, threats from North Korea, and an increasingly aggressive China. For the latest, CNN's Marc Stewart is live from Hiroshima tonight. And Marc, what - - if anything, can we expect to see come out of this G7 talks?

      "sentences": "Hi, Christina, it's good to you. I should point out that President Biden's domestic troubles with the debt ceiling in theU.S. certainly are being felt and talked about here in Hiroshima. When we look at this potential debt ceiling default in the U.S., it could have worldwide implications. G7 nations could distinctly be impacted. If there is economic default in the U.S., it could certainly cause global markets to act in erratic ways, it could impact the value of the U.S. dollar, that could impact trade and exports, and not only for the U.S., but for so many of these G7 nations, and the broader fear is that it would perhaps trigger a global recession. That is why the president is expected to be confronted by world leaders tomorrow or I should say, this morning here in Japan, about the status of these debt ceiling talks. It's something that these leaders have very good reason to be concerned about. It will be interesting to see what kind of questions he faces, but they certainly want to know about the risk. With that issue aside, the hope is that these G7 leaders will be able to confront and discuss other big issues. You mentioned, certainly, the war in Ukraine. We are expecting President Zelenskyy to appear in front of G7 leaders in some kind of video set-up to discuss about the future. Obviously, diplomatic discussions will be talked about, defense strategy will not be a surprise. But also economic ways that this can be -- can be solved. Europe still exports items to Russia, and Japan, where I am now, still imports energy from Russia. That's going to be talked about. And of course, we cannot forget the broader discussion on China. And it's really interesting, Christina, because so many of these G7 nations each have unique relationships with China. And a lot of these nations depend on China, especially for a supply chain and for economic manufacturing. So there is going to have to be a reckoning, if you will, with these G7 leaders as to what their stance will be towards China. That's a communique, I think a lot of people in this region are very anxious to see in the hours and days ahead. Christina.",

State lawmakers there have now voted in favor of a six-week abortion ban that would prevent women from terminating pregnanciesin most cases, once early cardiac activity is detected. Many women don't even know that they're pregnant at that point. And there are some exceptions including when the mother's health and life are at risk, as well as cases of rape, incest or under-aged pregnancy. The bill now heads back to the state's Senate. Amara Walker breaks it all down for us. AMARA WALKER, CNN ANCHOR &amp; CORRESPONDENT: So it took the South Carolina house chamber more than 20 hours of debate over two days to finally pass a six-week abortion ban. Now, this bill heads to the Republican-controlled Senate, an it's going to be very interesting to see what happens there with this bill because there have been several amendments made to this bill by the house that further restrict abortion. Now, just three weeks ago, the South Carolina State Senate actually blocked a near-total abortion ban. That would have basically banned abortion from conception with a few exceptions. And that happened because five women and a senator, only five women in the South Carolina State Senate, they banded together. So we're talking about three Republicans, one Democrat, one independent, they were able to come together with a filibuster to block that bill. Now, prior to that, in February, the same Senate passed a less restrictive abortion bill, in effect, it was a six-week abortion ban. And now, the state house has passed a similar bill. I want you to listen to Republican state Senator Sandy Senn. She spoke with CNN this morning. She was one of the five women who blocked that bill in April, and she told us how she and her sister senators will vote. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Thepresident presented this message, a presidential tweet is almost like a message to the nation, a message to public opinion, saying the children have been located and rescued alive. This morning, from the early hours of the morning, we understood that the situation was maybe not exactly like that. We understand the whereabouts of the children have been located but that does not mean that the kids have been safely rescued and not in the safe hands of Colombian authorities. This region, the Colombian Amazon, is one of the most remote and sparsely populated regions in South America, let alone Colombia. It is a region where you move around either by plane, like the small single engine Cessna, like the one that fatally crashed on May the 1st, which originated this whole story. It crashed with seven people on board. Three are understood to have died in the collision. Or you move around with canoes. Right now, it is in the middle of the rainy season. So communication and transportation is not easy in that part of the country. More than 100 people are working around the clock to try to bring these four kids home, hopefully to locate them and stay with them and reach them as soon as possible. It is interesting to see the techniques. I am thinking we can show them on our screen. One technique they used to locate these kids is to play out from the helicopters messages, audio messages from their grandmother, in their local indigenous language, telling them to quiet them down, to show some support, because we can only imagine the mental state they find themselves in. At this point, unfortunately, Christina, we are still not able to give everyone the news that we are all hoping for here in Colombia, that these four children have been safely rescued.

Prince Harry, Meghan and her mother, Doria Ragland, attended the Women of Vision Awards at the Ziegfeld Ballroom in New York City. Meghan was honored for her global advocacy to empower women and girls. But it wasn't until they left the event that things allegedly escalated. A local law enforcement source tells CNN that, quote, \"swarm\" of paparazzi followed them in cars, motorcycles and scooters. The convoy eventually went to the 19th precinct, where the couple waited until they could safely leave. Chris Sanchez, a member of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex's security detail, says they switched cars more than once during the chase. They were first seen in a black car and then a Yellow cab. The driver of that cab says he noticed the paparazzi before, as the couple's security guards started to tell him the address to drive to.",

For instance, the cab driver, as Max pointed out, was only there for a couple of minutes of it, which was relatively calm. But this was not a high-speed chase; it was a long chase. It went from 96th Street on the Upper East Side, the Upper West Side across, down to 23rd Street and then back up again through the streets. But there were moments -- and I think this is what their spokesman means by catastrophic, Christina, is there were moments when the paparazzi vehicles, whether they were scooters or mopeds, where in one case a black car with tinted windows, actually mounted the sidewalk, where pedestrians were and came across in order to run a red light because the motorcade had made a turn and they were being left behind. So that is the near catastrophic. They could've hit someone with a car. But as the police pointed out, that didn't actually happen. No one was injured.",

Their job was to be part of the protection team in case police action was required. In this case, it was a slow-moving chase that unfolded. And if you are assigned to the protection piece, you don't leave that to deal with the traffic violations. At one point, they saw a police car that had pulled someone over. They said to the police officer, can you deal with these people as the motorcade went further. And the police officer went to stop the car that the photographers were in. The guy held up a video camera and said something about Meghan Markle, and literally backed up and went around the police officer and kept going. So I would suspect, in the next trip that they make here, there is going to be a couple of added elements to ensure they are not just being protected from physical threats but that there is a traffic enforcement piece here that will be added because it sounds like it is needed.",
