The former Trump White House chief of staff and the Georgia secretary of state offering conflicting testimony.This comes as Donald Trump is now vowing to appeal his new trial date in the federal election interference case, the judge ordering the proceedings to begin on March 4th, 2024 on the eve of the critical Super Tuesday presidential contest. And breaking news, new video of the Jacksonville gunman entering the store where he unleashed his deadly racist rampage. We're also learning more about his past before he opened fire with a swastika- emblazoned assault rifle. Welcome to our viewers here in the United States and all around the world. Wolf Blitzer is off today. I'm Alex Marquardt and you're in The Situation Room. And we begin with a very significant day in two of the criminal cases against Donald Trump, first, in Georgia, where former Trump White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows, took the stand today. The hearing amounting to a sort of mini-trial of the election interference case against Trump and his 18 co-defendants. CNN's Sara Murray has all the new details.",

So, she did say, look, we're not going to give you that. Special counsel, we'll also not going to give you what you want, January 2024. She gave the special counsel certainly more than Trump's team by making it March 2024.But she said this. She said, in setting a trial date, it does not depend on the defendant's personal or professional obligation. She said that, really, Trump was already being given more than the average criminal defendant. She said that he had many resources at his disposal. Trump's attorney, John Lauro, he really pushed back on this. He said, look, I only started the representation recently. I haven't had a lot of time to get into this case. There are 12.8 million pages of discovery here. And then John Lauro even told the judge, he said, look, because you are making this trial to start date in just six months from now, I'm going to tell you right now, I'm not going to be able to give adequate representation to the former president. That sort of sets the stage for any possible future appeal that the president might make on ineffective assistance of counsel claims. I mean, putting this start date in March 2024, this adds to an already incredibly crowded calendar here between October of this year and May of 2024. You're talking about the start to all four criminal cases against the former president. So, his legal team is going to be really working overtime here. The prosecution said, look, Trump legal team, this actually isn't that big of a hill to climb. All of these documents that we've handed over in discovery, 12.8 million pages, but they say most of it you've already been privy to. This comes from Trump's White House, Trump's political action committee. These are documents that were before the January 6th committee. So, they said, really, there's not a lot of new evidence for you to sift through. And, plus, they said there's about 47,000 pages of those that will really be key to the prosecution that the defense team can really zero in on. But this is barreling forward to a very fast trial just about six months from now. And it's not likely the date will slide at all, or if it does, that it will slide very much at, Alex.",

You're a lawyer for the January 6th select committee. You know the ins and outs of Mark Meadows' actions in Georgia. So, what do you make of his arguments today that everything that he did fell within that scope of his role as the president's chief of staff? TEMIDAYO AGANGA-WILLIAMS, FORMER JAN. 6 COMMITTEE LAWYER: So, I think that just is not based in fact. I think the idea that he was chief of staff 24/7, I think that's just not supported. I think what we saw was a clear delineation between the political actors and the White House actors. And with any campaign, there's a forward-looking aspect. Mark Meadows here was acting in a capacity to support former President Trump's future bid for the White House. So, I think this idea that he was acting in an official capacity is not supported. And we saw that he was often interfacing with individuals on the campaign, not on the political side, not on the White House side. He was talking to campaign lawyers, often, talking to folks outside the White House. So, I think once you get deep into facts here, you'll find the support that he was acting in a political capacity and not in official government capacity.",

There's really no other plausible way to do that. And I think the fact that he chose to take that risk tells me how important it is that Mark Meadows thinks he gets his case moved over to federal court.I do think this was a rough day for Mark Meadows. I think it's one thing to assert generally, well, as chief of staff, I had very broad duties, but it's another thing to be cross-examined, as he was today, about very specific actions and phone calls and to sort of justify that within the scope of the chief of staff's job.",

Trump himself is saying that he was going to appeal this.Now, talking to actual legal experts, they say that this is unlikely to slide. You heard Jessica say that, as well as that this is not something that he can appeal. But that is really where their mindset is right now. However, I have talked to a number of advisers who do believe that there is a possibility, given this calendar, and as these trial dates mount, that this could have some overlap. And I do want to pull up that calendar one more time because there're two specific things that they're talking about. One being in January, when you look at the first Iowa caucus, that is the same date as that E. Jean Carroll civil trial. The other one they're pointing to, of course, is March. When you look at the 4th, that is the federal 2020 election subversion trial that we've just gotten today, and the fifth is Super Tuesday. Now, they believe that they can paint this as election interference when you specifically look at these dates. And I'm not talking about just a legal argument, but the argument in the court of public opinion, which is how we know that Donald Trump likes to do things. They can say that this is directly impacting his campaign. But, again, how this actually plays out, it still remains to be seen. We are in unprecedented times.

Why wasn't Pat Cipollone involved? Why wasn't that team involved? Why wasn't DOJ involved?

So, it could get even stronger than that in between what we call these points where you see all the circles there on the cone. But hurricane warnings in Tampa all the way up to Apalachicola.My concern is that this map looks an awful lot like what Ian looked like at just about 36 hours before arrival. Now Ian missed Tampa and ended up way down here of Fort Myers Beach. I don't want you to take this lightly, Tampa, because the track is up here this time, not toward you, but if it takes that typical right- hand turn, you are right in the middle of what could be a catastrophic hurricane. The area that it's going to hit is called the big bend area, at least for right now until any models change. They haven't changed today. Right now we are at a 70-mile-per-hour storm. Another hurricane hunter aircraft is on its way to check to see if that went down or up over the past couple of hours. But there's that Category 3 to the west of about New Port Richey, Tampa Bay, and, again, not that far west of Tampa Bay. So, if this thing decides to pull a Charlie or pull an Ian, we are all going to be watching this so closely that you need to be paying attention at this point in time, even with a four to seven-foot surge in Tampa. Winds are going to be 70 to 80. Trees are going to be down. Power lines are going to be down. Tomorrow is the day to evacuate if they tell you to, because after that, it won't be possible. Trees will be down, power lines will be down. This water is very warm. This storm is going to explode in intensity as soon as it gets over Cuba and into the Gulf Stream. The new forecast for 8 to 12-foot storm surge. Now there aren't many towns in here. You've got Steinhatchee, Cedar Key, and the like. And those are very low. Many places there don't even have 12 feet of elevation, if that's what the surge is. It will be over washing the entire town. So, that's the real threat here. But also the rain. It's going to rain in the Carolinas. It's going to rain into parts of Georgia, also into Florida. And there will be tornadoes on the west coast of Florida for tomorrow. Every storm that comes in will already be spinning because it's going around a center top. And so as these storms come in, they could be water spouts coming on shore. They could be real tornadoes right on land, and not just zeros and ones. These could be EF-2s and 3s tomorrow. Maybe not a 3, but certainly a 2 as these super cells stay on land and spin for quite some time. Alex, there's your arrival time probably for Tampa, the worst of it, somewhere around 8:00 P.M. tomorrow night. That's the beginning of it. And then all of a sudden, as the core goes by, maybe another 12 hours, and it gets better from there. But this is going to be a difficult storm. You cannot let your guard down if you're in the Tampa, New Port Richey, even towards Sarasota, Pinellas County, Pasco County. This is going to be a big event for you one way or the other.",

One of them, in fact, is under the control in some fashion of the head of the ministry of defense.So you could move some of them over. Then already they've taken the heavy weapons from them, and some will go into the military themselves. But it's not -- you know, the group is actually not that large. So you're dealing with a few thousand people. It was 20,000, 25,000. Now, maybe fewer. So I think they can kind of move them over. But the actual businesses, Alex, the ones that are really lucrative and really important, you can bet that the Kremlin is going to have them continue in some fashion, but under Kremlin control.",

And that is because there is a number of vulnerable and moderate Republicans who think they haven't shown enough evidence to directly link Biden with his son's foreign business deals. And I think the White House response is really telling here. I want to read you the statement from Ian Sams. He is the White House spokesperson. He said, instead of continuing their extreme far-right political warfare to tie -- to lie and try to politically damage the president, house Republicans should work with him on the issues that really matter to the American people, like lowering costs and creating jobs or strengthening healthcare and education. And so, you can see Democrats already trying to use this as a political liability against Republicans. And McCarthy knows that.
