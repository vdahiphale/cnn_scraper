GARCIA-NAVARROYork Times,\" my paper, because this is about the great resorting of America, how people are moving to places where they want to have likeminded people live next to them. They profiled a company called Conservative Move where real estate agents have gotten into the business of trying to get people who are in liberal states to move to conservative states. South Carolina is the fastest growing state in the United States right now. And so I just found it fascinating, and actually, frankly, quite troubling that this is now moving into the commercial sphere and trying to encourage people to not be with people who might disagree with them.",

That's both because this administration is fighting for a Saudi-Israel accord, but also because he's depending on the Saudis to hold down energy prices.
