I'm Rahel Solomon, in for Richard Quest and I too mean business. Tonight, as temperatures in Kyiv dropped below freezing and officials warn of a painful winter ahead, former UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson is drawing a historical parallel. He tells CNN that Ukraine's resolve reminds him of Britain's during World War Two in the Blitz. We'll bring you his exclusive interview with Richard Quest in just a moment. But first to Ukraine where the head of the country's energy grid says that Russian strikes caused extensive damage last week. He says almost every power plant in the country was targeted, and the disruption isn't likely to end anytime soon. The head of a major Ukrainian energy provider warning that blackouts could last until next March. Matthew Chance with us now in Odesa. So Matthew, we know for folks in Kherson, for residents in Kherson, they had been told if they are without power to evacuate and to leave to other parts of the country who have better energy.

There aresome generators that are running and people are, you know, kind of paring their own lighting when possible, but the streetlights are basically all out and there are a few cars obviously going through the streets as well, giving some light. But it is extraordinary to be in a city of this size, with really none of the lighting on and that's because there are such power shortages, there are power cuts taking place across the country because particularly over the past couple of weeks, Russia has been pounding energy infrastructure facilities across the country in a bid to deprive Ukrainians, as many of them as possible, have as much power as possible at this time. And of course, it comes as the weather really starts to turn for the worst. Temperatures have been plunging over the course of the past couple of days. In particular, the first snowfall came here within the past week and it is settled in many parts of the country. And of course, that's when demand for power, for heating, for cooking, for energy, for lighting is at its highest and the latest estimate coming from the Ukrainian government is that millions of people, as many as 10 million people across the country are without power for at least some of the day in Ukraine, and that situation is not going to get better soon. First of all, the missile strikes still continuing. Secondly, it is an uphill task for engineers in this country to repair the infrastructure, the energy infrastructure in time and authorities are now warning that it could be March next year until power is restored to something approaching normal levels -- Rahel.",

Within the next few weeks, there are plans to set up heating centers where people in the big cities can come and congregate and get hot, food get an internet connection, get some heating because remember, it's not just the lighting and the food, and you know, things like that that are affected, the power outages means that communication systems are also down for many people across the country. And so people are having to go to these special government centers where as they get set up, to try and communicate with their loved ones, their families, make telephone calls and things like that.

I mean, just see how easy that penalty was for him, Argentina into a very early lead. And they then went on to have three goals disallowed in the first half, all for outside. They could have been fawning at the halftime, but they weren't and the Saudis hit back in the second half. A really well taking goal for Saleh Al-Shehri there.

We might just have seen the best goal of the tournament scored on the third day, and this arguably is the greatest World Cup upset of all time. As you heard in Becky's report, Argentina came into this tournament as one of the favorites. They haven't lost in 36 games.

Oil and gas rose after OPEC denied reports that it would increase output. The FTSE finished up more than a percent followed by the French CAC 40 and the Germany DAX. The European Commission has a new plan to cap the price of natural gas. It is designed to curb price spikes for European households by introducing an upper limit on a specific part of the futures market for gas derivatives. The E.U. energy ministers plan to debate the measure on Thursday. If approved, the proposal will take effect January 1st. Francesco Starace is the CEO of the multinational energy company, the Enel Group. He joins me from Milan. Francesco, thank you. It is good to have you today. I want to get to the price cap in just a moment. It was also announced that you will be exiting some markets in South America and Europe as you are trying to reduce debt.

The price we are paying in Europe for gas has nothing to do with actual prices of gas worldwide.Actually, I think that this logic should be challenged at every possible step.

I'm concerned about the fact that we don't even try to do that.
