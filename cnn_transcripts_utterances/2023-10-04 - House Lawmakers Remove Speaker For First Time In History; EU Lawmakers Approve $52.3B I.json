This vote coming after eight Republicans sided with all Democrats to kick him out.Kevin McCarthy could only afford to lose four Republicans, so he was unable to convince some of those members, on the hard right in particular, who are unhappy about some of his deal making. Really, only two deals in particular. One, to raise the national debt limit to avoid a debt default. He had to get a deal with the White House and Senate Democrats in order to get that through. Also the other one, to avoid a government shutdown, that's something that he had cut over the weekend and allowed Democrats to help push that through to avoid a potentially disastrous government shutdown and just to keep the government open for another 45 days. That was enough for Matt Gaetz, the counselor from Florida, to lead the charge to seek Kevin McCarthy's ousting. He got the support of seven other Republican colleagues, enough to kick out McCarthy. In a startling move that really caught many of his own colleagues by surprise, announcing that he would not be a candidate for speaker again. Kevin McCarthy said that he would step aside, he told me that he could potentially get behind a successor but he said he wouldn't disclose who because he didn't know who would possibly run.
