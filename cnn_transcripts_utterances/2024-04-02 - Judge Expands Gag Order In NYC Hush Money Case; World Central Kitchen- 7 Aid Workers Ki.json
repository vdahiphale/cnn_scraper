I'm Kasie Hunt.Donald Trump is supposed to watch what he says when he leaves for a campaign stop in the Midwest today. We'll see how that goes. But it's because the judge in his civil fraud case has expanded a gag order to include family members of court personnel and the D.A. The ruling comes after Trump posted social media attacks against Judge Juan Merchan's daughter last week. Merchan not holding back in his ruling, writing, \"This pattern of attacking family members of presiding jurists and attorneys assigned to his cases serves no legitimate purpose. It merely injects fear in those assigned or called to participate in the proceedings, that not only they, but their family members as well, are 'fair game' for defendant's vitriol. It is no longer just a mere possibility or a reasonable likelihood that there exists a threat to the integrity of the judicial proceedings. The threat is very real.\" Joining me now to discuss, Farnoush Amiri. She's congressional reporter for the Associated Press. And, Andrew Desiderio, senior congressional reporter for Punchbowl News. Good morning to both of you. Thank you so much for being here. We really are, Farnoush, in unprecedented territory here with the former president attacking, honestly, the daughter of the judge in this case -- someone who is not actually even related to the proceeding directly but is really kind of an innocent victim in many ways. Trump hits the campaign trail today out in, sort of, the Wisconsin and Michigan blue wall so to speak where President Biden really won the election in 2020. How do you view how these two things are interacting with each other? And do you think that the former president is actually going to abide by this order?",

It had been in place for two generations and it felt unimaginable to many voters that such a thing could fall. Even though, of course, politicians warned about Roe for decades, people just didn't believe it.And so, when the decision -- when the leak of the decision came down and then, of course, the decision a month and a half -- or a month or so later, it really woke up the country and people were -- all of a sudden say what was happening and were -- they didn't like it. Abortion rights were always popular in some form basically since -- pretty much since Roe was decided by the court back in '73. And when that changed you saw this new coalition of abortion rights voters who really became a political force. Now, that being said, there's effectively no way to restore federal abortion rights in the way that they were here before unless Democrats can upend the filibuster and get 60 votes in the Senate -- which you know, of course, Kasie, is a very, very high margin to reach and an unlikely one.

Clark ready from the jump. She hit a three to open scoring right out of the gate. And you just knew that she was completely locked into this game. Iowa and LSU tied at the half.
