Just a few hours before midnight, the deadline to shut down the government, the U.S. Senate overwhelmingly passed a bipartisan bill to keep the nation's government open until mid-November. The breakthrough came after House Speaker Kevin McCarthy surprised everyone by pushing a short-term spending bill through the House with Democratic help. It is a deal that may cost McCarthy his speakership. Republican hardliners are vowing to bring a motion to the floor to oust the leader for ignoring the spending cuts conservatives were demanding in a package. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. MATT GAETZ (R-FL): I do intend to file a motion to vacate against Speaker McCarthy this week. I think we need to rip off the band aid. I think we need to move on with new leadership that could be trustworthy. Look, the one thing everybody has in common is that nobody trusts Kevin McCarthy. He lied to Biden, he lied to House conservatives. The only way Kevin McCarthy is speaker of the House at the end of this coming week is if Democrats bail him out. Now, they probably will. I actually think that when you believe in nothing as Kevin McCarthy does, everything is negotiable. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

The other thing that President Biden wants to see in the coming weeks is a vote on aid for Ukraine. That is something that was stripped of this proposal and the president wants to see House Speaker McCarthy bring it up for a stand-alone vote. That is something the Democratic leaders up on the Hill have said that they believe McCarthy will do. But so far, McCarthy has not committed to doing so. Just this morning on one of the Sunday shows he suggested linking Ukraine aid with border security funding. The president said that there is still time but it is starting to run short.

The House Freedom Caucus chairman Scott Perry told me this isn't really his fight when it comes to ousting the leadership. I've heard that from several other members. I talked to Congressman Perry Moore today who said he's not surprised but hasn't made a decision himself. So I think this is very much a focus on Gaetz and some of these other hardliners.

They haven't said which way they are leaning but they have said that it will very likely remain together as a block as we saw for this government funding bill over the weekend, as we saw during the speaker's race back in January. But look, this is the nature of again, the very slim majority that House Republicans have this Congress. So if just about five Republicans decide that they want to oust McCarthy, if all Democrats side with them, that could be enough, that would likely be enough to confiscate his gavel. But again some Democrats are saying that well if they decide to support him, they would have to extract some concessions from it. One Democratic lawmaker told me that if Kevin McCarthy wants her vote, he should come ask for it and be aware that he's going to have to pay a big price. So a lot of focus this week is going to be on Democrats to see what way they are going to lean for the moment that Matt Gaetz, as he said he's going to do, brings this motion to vacate.",

Over the next few days, all of that extreme heat is going to make its way off to the east really focusing more over the Great Lakes and the northeast by the time we get to the middle portion of this week and cooler air beings to settle in across the central U.S. And you can clearly see that drop here. Looking at Sioux Falls that's going from 92 on Monday down to only 69 on Wednesday. Similar for Minneapolis, going from 87 on Monday down to only 68 by Wednesday. Even farther south in Dallas, you have got several days of 90-degree temperatures before we start to see those drop back below normal for a change as we finish out the upcoming week.

And it goes of course all the way to tanks and surface-to-air missile systems. And that's definitely something that the Ukrainians are very concerned about. They understand the United States is their most important partner in giving them weapons and that is something that's not only keeping them in the fight but allowing them to advance as well. But there is a second facet also and that is the possible chilling effect that something like that could have on the U.S. NATO partners for instance, who are also giving weapons but many of them only doing so because the U.S. is also giving weapons to Ukraine. So certainly it could have large reverberations. Again, the Ukrainians hoping that they'll be able to get these weapons in the future.
