Earlier here in the CNN NEWSROOM, I spoke with a pediatric infectious disease specialist about whether the surge could have anything to do with kids being physically isolated during much of the past two years. But she says look more closely at grown-ups as the possible source. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DR. AMY EDWARDS, PEDIATRIC INFECTION CONTROL, UNIVERSITY HOSPITALS RAINBOW BABIES &amp; CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL: RSV does not induce what we call sterile immunity. So if I get RSV, I will get it again. But what we do know is that kids who get RSV, then when they get it again the next year or two years later, tend to have milder cases. So there's some protection from getting multiple RSV infections, back-to- back-to-back. And of course, we're missing that.

And, secondly, the fact that we don't really have much immunity. This is the first time that we're going out there as Americans traveling, going to school, without wearing a mask. And a lot of people are not vaccinated. So if you don't have immunity from the last two years, when you're exposed to the virus, the virus really acts up. And I think what's most concerning is, not that RSV is surging. It's how it's surging.

Now when we need that mandate, especially at airports, on, trains, and congested spaces, we are fighting a blizzard of viruses, and it's not even winter yet.\" Look, nobody's talking about restoring mandates. So will it make a difference if someone chooses to wear a mask right now, even if no one else is? As they travel, as they attend school events? Can you be the difference for yourself if no one else is doing it? MATHEW: It's better than nothing, Paula. Obviously, when I wear a mask and somebody else wears a mask, then we protect each other much better. If you're on a plane, 99 percent of people are unmasked. So absolutely wearing a KN-95 mask will be key, washing your hands, and also making wise decisions. A lot of people listen to me and are like, there goes Dr. Mathew again about the masks. But I'm not saying masks in of itself will take care of the problem. It's about a layered approach. Why not wear a mask if you're in crowded spaces, make sure you are careful. Secondly, if you're sick, stay at home so you don't spread the virus. And get vaccinated. You know, the COVID-19 vaccine and the influenza vaccine this year, I think, Paula, is going to work.

It helped deliver the White House, frankly, to President Joe Biden. It was key to Democrats in 2018. But as recently as 2012, this county voted for a presidential nominee -- Republican presidential nominee in Mitt Romney. That is why Fetterman is here. He and his campaign aides know they need big turnout here in Chester County to beat Oz in November.And as we've noted, this race is tightening, polls over the summer showed Fetterman with a pretty big lead. But as we've gotten closer to November, those polls have tightened. This race is really coming down to the wire, Paula.",

Now, the county's top election official a judge who's a Democrat suggests the goal here may be to sow distrust. So is this just something that's going to happen everywhere? Is it in the playbook?",

The issue, I think, if you're Katie Hobbs is Kari Lake is a very polished personality. She spent decades doing what we do talking on television, it's a skill, it's an acquired skill that she has. And I actually think Katie Hobbs made a mistake by not debating her. Her explanation was, I'm not going to debate someone who's an election denier, why would I give her that platform? The problem is, you look like you're running from that. You look like you don't feel like you can stand on the stage with Kari Lake. And I don't think that's working Katie Hobbs is favored.

We have had two years now of former President Donald Trump and his allies. Lake, Finchem, Mark Finchem, who's running for secretary of state, Blake Masters, who's at the top of the ticket. The Republican primary for the U.S. Senate, every single one of them has played a critical role for the last two years, denigrating the system sowing mistrust, distrust in the system. And people are going to respond to that. We have voter turnout, especially on the Republican side that is pretty low right now. The ballot returns are not as high as they have been in previous years.

If you don't want people like Evan being able to figure out your password. I guess I probably go change my passwords. That not great. R. TOBAC: it's not. O'SULLIVAN: So, what are the tips for people not to be like me? R. TOBAC: Well, first and foremost, it is on the companies to avoid getting hacked and prevent breaches like this. Many companies do not use MFA internally, that second step when they're logging in. We need them to use that. O'SULLIVAN: MFA is multi-factor authentication, which is when they text you code or whatever after putting your password. R. TOBAC: Text you a code, you look at an app, you have a prompt on your phone. That's your second step. So, if I get your password, I still can't log into your account because I don't have that code. Don't reuse your passwords. If you reuse your passwords across multiple sites, even for sites that you deem silly or kind of a throwaway site, I can take that password and I can use it against you. So, you have to use long, random, and unique passwords for every single site. I recommend storing it in a password manager which keeps all of your passwords safe and encrypted and can generate good passwords for you. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
