But again, this morning the commander of the land forces here Oleksandr Syrskyi saying that there is continued progress around Bakhmut.Now we were hearing from Russian state media suggestions that 3,000 Chechen rebel fighters or Chechen mercenary fighters working for Russia may have been redeployed to help defend Moscow. They may have come from that Bakhmut area. But I think Ukrainian officials are still digesting exactly what the changes in Russian forces after this weekend may mean for the front lines themselves. No obvious signs have changed, but Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy what a weekend he must have had spent the back part of it talking to President Biden other allies. Here's what he had say about what we've just witnessed. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, PRESIDENT OF UKRAINE (through translation): The longer Russian aggression lasts the more degradation it causes in Russia itself, one of the manifestations of this degradation is that Russian aggression is gradually returning to its home harbor.

Right? So, if you're naturally paranoid, he must now be wondering what it is he does to reassert control and that is essentially the biggest worry that the administration has right now.

So, I think there's a certain amount of hands on your enemies making mistake, let that happen.But this issue about Prigozhin, you know, being the charge is still there, that can be nothing more than a signal to him also that you better keep the deal that we made. It's still -- it's not necessarily they're going to take him down.

And the President spoke with several world leaders in the hours after the rebellion including Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy.CNN's Arlette Saenz is live from the North Lawn at the White House. And Arlette, what was the message President Biden was trying to convey to allies in this very fluid moment. ARLETTE SAENZ, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Well, Phil, President Biden spent the weekend working the phones with allies as the White House tried to get a handle on the impact of this seemingly short- lived rebellion in Russia. The President huddled with his national security adviser Jake Sullivan, over the weekend and officials I spoke with said that one of the President's priorities was trying to consult with these allies who have been central to the Western response to Russia's war in Ukraine. That is why he placed these phone calls to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. And also, the leaders of France, Germany, the United Kingdom, and Canada. And one of the messages in those conversations was essentially to lay low, allow the situation in Russia to play out. They've also talked about the U.S. and the West long standing support for Ukraine throughout this war. And it really speaks to this deliberately quiet and cautious strategy that we've seen from the White House over the weekend. We have yet to hear from President Biden. And officials say that part of the reason is because they don't want to give Vladimir Putin any pretense, any reason to suggest that the West was trying to interfere in this matter. Now, the first reaction did come from Secretary of State Antony Blinken yesterday when he told our colleague Dana Bash, that these events were extraordinary and that he did not believe they were yet completely resolved, describing it as a moving picture. But Blinken did note that the events, the rebellion show that there are some cracks in Vladimir Putin's hold on power in Russia. One of the big questions this White House will be facing today and, in the days, to come is how exactly this will impact the larger war in Ukraine? And also, broader the impact it has on Putin's power in Russia as they are now beginning to see some fissures amidst this rebellion.",
