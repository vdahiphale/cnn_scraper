What we know about what they are calling a near catastrophic car chase. Then Ukraine's air defense is in action. How they're successfully defending against Russia's stepped-up bombardment. And then later, scientists are sounding a new climate warming, saying we will likely see global temperatures top at least, briefly the 1.5 degree threshold in the next five years, but all is not lost, yet. Well, we begin this hour with what's being called a near-catastrophic car chase involving the duke and the duchess of Sussex. Prince Harry and his wife, Meghan, say they were hounded by a ring of highly aggressive paparazzi for  more than two hours in New York City on Tuesday. And it happened after an award show. This was a couple -- as you can see there, leaving that event. They were traveling with Meghan's mother Doria Ragland. New York's mayor says the incident brings back memories of the horrendous death of Harry's mother, Diana. Have a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

They said that it was because of a ring of highly aggressive paparazzi that the couple were forced to go on these detours, in what is described as a very dangerous journey. We're informed that the traffic violations that these paparazzi were accused of include driving on the sidewalk, running red lights, using phones and cameras when they're also driving, and illegally blocking moving vehicles, going the wrong way down a street. They felt that not only were the couple at risk, but also pedestrians, and there were many accounts of near close collisions as well, Isa. So, naturally, you know, In this country, as well as internationally, that memory of what happened to Princess Diana and her fatal car crash is indelibly imprinted on the national consciousness. And naturally, this incident could potentially have strong echoes about it if the couple didn't indeed feel that it was a near catastrophic event, Isa. Plus, they have been at pains to try and address media intrusion and illegal press practices with Prince Harry just the other day in fact, launching another attack on the British home office and trying to secure security for himself and his family in this country. This has been a recurring theme for the couple. And this for them will just be further proof for the fact that they do require security, and they are in a very different position. Even though, we understand that the couple fully appreciate that because of the public interest in them, they would accept a certain amount of press interest. But they don't believe anyone's safety should ever be violated because of that.",

We will get to that in just a moment. First, we want to dive into some of the news impact fueled by climate change. In northern Italy, flooding and mudslides have claimed at least eight lives and forced 13,000 people to evacuate. That is according to Italian authorities. Rivers have burst their banks amid torrential rainfall. And More rain is in the forecast. We have also learned Formula 1 has been forced to cancel this weekend's Emilia Romagna Grand Prix due to the flooding. Our contributor, Barbie Nadeau, reports on the deluge wreaking havoc across the region. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BARBIE NADEAU, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Roads turned to rivers as rain many hoped would alleviate drought conditions, now a serious threat in the central Italian region of Emilia Romagna. There are already victims and rescuers are searching for the missing. Hundreds of people were rescued from flooded homes, many brought to safety in rubber dinghies on flooded streets. More than 5,000 people are under evacuation, according to the civil protection; among them a four-month-old baby and an elderly handicapped man. The region had been undergoing severe drought. In 2022, low rainfall and extreme heat depleted the river Po, a crucial waterway for transport and irrigation. A winter with very little snow did little to help. And as bad as these floods are, they are only a drop in the bucket for what is needed to reverse the drought. Earlier this month a downpour swelled the Po by five feet. This deluge of water will raise it even more. But it is still well below average. Extreme weather events are threatening other Italian regions, from Venice, where the MOSE floodgates have been raised to protect the city from high water, to Sicily, where heavy storms downed trees and flooded homes -- Barbie Latza Nadeau, CNN, Rome.

Myanmar's shadow government says at least 400 people have been killed. It is urgently asking for help, saying around 1 million people need emergency food as well as drinking water. These extreme weather events are becoming more common. Scientists say this will be the new normal as temperatures continue to rise. The trends show no sign of slowing down. On the contrary, the World Meteorological Organization now says fossil fuel pollution and a potential El Nino are likely to push global temperatures past the warming threshold, set out, if you remember, by the Paris agreement. That limit was 1.5 degrees Celsius. And the WMO says it could happen within the next five years. I want to bring in Professor Petteri Taalas, the head of the World Meteorological Organization, and our chief climate correspondent, Bill Weir. Professor, thank you for taking the time to speak with us. The chances of this happening are 66 percent. This is a pretty bleak assessment, almost a certainty we are going to exceed it. Your thoughts here? PETTERI TAALAS, SECRETARY-GENERAL, WORLD METEOROLOGICAL ORGANIZATION: So we estimate it will happen in the coming five years since this so-called (INAUDIBLE) phase, which is calling the Pacific temperatures over and beyond the what's El Nino phase of (INAUDIBLE) temperatures higher. It is very likely that in the coming five years we are going to be very close (INAUDIBLE) Paris agreement, 1.5 degrees, at least on a temporary basis. There is 66 percent (ph) of (INAUDIBLE) before that. And it's virtually certain that we will break all (INAUDIBLE) to record (ph) in the coming five years.",

Two years later now, so much of Alberta is on fire as a result of that heat and drying out. Four times as much acreage has been burned there so far this early summer than all of last year in California. So there is a myriad of effects from this, every degree of warming that goes up. And I find sort of most chilling, no pun intended, from the professor's words there, is that we've -- if the -- if the last seven years have been the warmest ever and the next five will be the yet warmest ever, we've seen the coolest years of the rest of our lives. But what's interesting is they are also saying it is not too late to turn down the global thermostat. When you consider that methane, which is a natural gas, is at 80 times more powerful than carbon dioxide at trapping heat and is much easier to turn off at the source, that could be the most immediate fix.
