This was the scene in Kherson this morning, Russian shelling killing at least five people. And, this time, it was a market that was targeted, people killed in the middle of the street as they shopped. CNN's Alex Marquardt is in Dnipro, Ukraine, for us. But, first, let's get to Kaitlan Collins. She is traveling with President Biden in Poland. Kaitlan, this was very much a triumphant speech on the part of President Biden nearly a year to the day of the start of this war. And his message seemed to be very clearly Ukraine will prevail. What more did he say today?",

      "sentences": "Yes, he said Ukraine will prevail that Putin has been wrong.Basically, everything he said that the Russian leader believed was going to happen a year ago when he first invaded Ukraine has proven not to happen, talking about how united NATO is, and saying the United States will not falter in its support for Ukraine, also saying that, a year ago, Putin thought that autocracies would get stronger, and, instead, they have gotten weaker and that democracies have been the ones that have grown in that year, as you have seen this coalition come together and build to support Ukraine. That was really a main part of his speech, saying, essentially, this support is not going to go away, and what Putin thought was going to happen just has not materialized. It was a very forceful speech. But I think what is the most remarkable about what we have seen today is these dramatically two different world views from two very different world leaders, with Putin going first. Obviously, in his speech, he spent a considerable amount of time blaming the West, saying that they started the war in Ukraine, that they essentially want to destroy Russia. And even though aid said President Biden wasn't going to go tit for tat and directly rebut Putin in his speech, he kind of did, saying that the Russian leader is wrong when he says the West is to blame for this, speaking directly to the Russian people at one point and saying, this is a war of choice, that it is not of necessity, it is a tragedy that Putin has chosen here, and saying Putin can really make it all go away with just one simple word, and noting, obviously, that he has not done that. Also giving a shout-out to Poland, talking about what they have done since Russia invaded Ukraine, not only when it comes to serving as this logistics hub for so many of the weapons that are going into Ukraine, but also taking in over a million refugees, and praising President Duda and the Polish first lady there for that. But, really, his main message was saying that autocrats and people like President Putin only understand one word, and that is no, Abby, saying that, no, they are not going to take away people's freedoms or redraw borders like they are trying to do with Ukraine. And I think that's really the overarching message, is saying that everything that Putin was saying in his speech about who was responsible for this is wrong, and that U.S. support for it, NATO support for Ukraine is not going to change or go away.",

Not all of them stayed, but a million-and-a-half stayed. A lot of them stay here in Warsaw. I spoke with the Warsaw mayor earlier, talking about what that's like, how people have welcomed them into their homes. But, obviously, it's not easy to absorb that many people and talking about when it comes to the health care system and teaching and what that has been like for Poland. And to see President Biden and President Duda, as they were, across from the table at each other earlier, gushing, essentially, talking about their support, with Duda saying that America is so critical to keeping the world order and maintaining it as it is, is remarkable, in and of itself, because, remember, back on the campaign trail, before President Biden was President Biden, when he was candidate Biden, he was essentially warning that Poland was going down a road of potentially totalitarian regime. And now this war in Ukraine has completely changed that dynamic. And now President Biden has visited here twice in Warsaw in just a year, given two forceful speeches, pushing back on Putin, all with the support of the Polish president behind him.",

In a long speech, Putin also said that Russia is suspending its participation in the nuclear START Treaty with the United States. Here's that moment.

And let's continue this conversation with former U.S. Ambassador to NATO Kurt Volker. He was also the U.S. special representative for Ukraine negotiations. Ambassador Volker, what is your reaction to President Biden's speech today? What stood out to you? KURT VOLKER, FORMER U.S. SPECIAL REPRESENTATIVE FOR UKRAINE:  Well, several things. First off, I'm very pleased that he went to Ukraine and then went to Poland to deliver this speech, because what he's doing is laying out the case why Ukraine's fight for freedom is America's fight as well, that it is important to the United States that Ukraine be victorious in this war. Now, the follow-on from this should be that we accelerate our support for Ukraine. We have been a bit slow in the way we have provided support over the past year. We need to help the Ukrainians actually win more quickly. So it's too early for a victory lap, but it's great that he's out there saying that we are committed.",

CFE Treaty, they pulled out of a long time ago. So there's no surprise here. It doesn't mean that we're embarking on a new arms race, because Russia doesn't necessarily have the means and the desire to invest in more nuclear weapons anyway. I think what they are trying to do is get the attention of the Biden administration and get people worried, so that maybe we won't support Ukraine so much. But that's certainly not going to work.",

The Russian forces are having massive casualties, and they are gradually getting pushed back. So, the last thing Russia wants to do is expand the war to go to other countries that would draw them in, especially not to go after NATO countries. And even nuclear weapons, I think he knows that, if he did that, it would draw a direct response against the Russian military, something that they would not withstand. So, I don't -- I think he's bluffing when he says that he would escalate elsewhere.",

And, if you remember, one year ago, in March of last year, when President Biden was in Warsaw, when he was in Poland, there was talk about providing MiG-29 aircraft, ones that Ukrainians already knew how to fly. And we didn't do that then. We didn't start the training on pilots then. We didn't get a decision forward on F-16s then, so we're a year late now. But we should still do it and get started now, so that, at some point, when it's possible, we will be able to give them aircraft that will help them protect their skies and protect their people.",

That means Russia is going to be defeated here, because Putin is not going to stop fighting. You heard his speech today. He's making things up. He's claiming a false history. And he's justifying continued attacks against Ukraine. So, he has to be defeated. And then, once Russia -- Russian forces are defeated -- no one's talking about attacking Russia or going into Moscow or into Russia at all -- but once the Russian forces are defeated trying to take Ukraine, we need two things from Russia. We need an acknowledgement of responsibility for the crimes that they committed, aggression and crimes against humanity, and we need Russia to agree in the future to live within its own borders. Right now, they occupy not only parts of Ukraine, but parts of Georgia and even part of Moldova. So, Russia needs to stop trying to be an empire and be a normal country, like everybody else.",

But his producers were on Capitol Hill last week. They're digging through this trove of footage, more than 41,000 hours of footage from the Capitol grounds, multiple camera angles showing what happened that day on January 6, and some of that footage is expected to air in the coming weeks. And former Democratic -- or former committee member of the January 6 Committee Zoe Lofgren, a Democrat, told CNN that they're really concerned about some of these security concerns. They had an agreement with the U.S. Capitol Police on what footage they could release when they had shown some of this footage during their hearings over the past year. But much of that was really debated and agreed to upon what they thought was safe for members of the Capitol, including not showing them evacuating the U.S. Capitol or things like that that they think could really be damaging to future security concerns and future lawmakers here.",
