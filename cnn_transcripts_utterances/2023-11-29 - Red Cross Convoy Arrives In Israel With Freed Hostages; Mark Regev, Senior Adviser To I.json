All we have to do is extend the existing one for another day, another two days.According to our numbers, there's something like 25 women and children still on the list. That's the deal, for women and children. We've said publicly -- it was the decision of our government last week -- that we will extend a day of this humanitarian pause to get the hostages out. We'll extend it out for 10 hostages to be released. Because, as I said, there are over 20 women and children left in Gaza, they can be released and we can extend this special humanitarian pause.

We saw the manipulations they do. We saw their behavior. We see the way they treat their own people. So confident is a strong word, maybe too strong. We said publicly we're willing for this extension. And all those people who want to see the humanitarian pause continue, they have to put pressure on Hamas. The key to that is releasing more hostages. You know, President Reagan famously said \"trust, but verify.\" We don't trust. We only verify. Ten hostages are released, we extend the ceasefire.

For Hamas, a 9-month-old baby is a legitimate military target. It shows you exactly who we're dealing with. If I called them brutal fanatics, I don't think I was exaggerating in any way. This is the sign -- this is the clearest demonstration of what we're dealing with. But they said they're killed. We're trying to verify that. Because in the past, there have been statements by Hamas about people being killed and we saw, in the end, that they were alive and they came home. So we have to check this out. Of course, we worry. We worry about all the hostages. There are still 159 hostages held by the terrorists in Gaza and we worry about each and every one. That's why we're willing to make the extra effort and extend the special pause to get the hostages out to try to save these people. It's an integral part of our war aims, get the hostages home.",

It's because this administration has been negligent in providing Congress real answers, reliable answers, and data showing that the dollars that Americans are sending overseas are going to the right purpose. The administration absolutely needs to do a better job, not in the quantity, not in more briefings or more reports, but in the quality to ensure that when we send money to Ukraine, which has a history of internal corruption, that it's going to the right places.",

It's tallow, fat from restaurant waste and other sources. It is the first of several tests we saw in recent weeks of aviation proving this could be done. Right now, there's a rule against you can't have more than 50 percent of the sustainable stuff in the mix as systems go over. But this is their plan, aviation's plan to get greener over time. It's a drop in the bucket right now. But Richard Branson, who is a showman and an aviator from way back, knows the power of these moments to inspire people.

None of the three leaders from those countries will be there. Nearly 200 other world leaders will be there. But the big cloud right now is who's hosting this. The CEO of Abu Dhabi's National Oil Company is also hosting COP, which one diplomate said is like putting the CEO of a tobacco company in charge of a global conference on cancer cures. And there were recent leaks, memos, internal documents that a British investigative journalist turned up that seemed to indicate that the sultan -- this is the man we're talking about right now. Sultan Ahmed Al Jaber was going to try to use these opportunities, these meetings to try to sell Abu Dhabi oil and gas, to try to expand their future fossil fuel plans, which is a blatant conflict of interest when the world needs to come together around burning a lot less oil very fast. And trust. So many of the vulnerable countries that depend on this conference for their very salvation and their existence hope that that sort of trust can be re-won. The sultan denies these reports. He says they are completely erroneous, he has no intention of doing business dealings in the backrooms right now. But we'll see. Actions these days go a lot farther than words.",
