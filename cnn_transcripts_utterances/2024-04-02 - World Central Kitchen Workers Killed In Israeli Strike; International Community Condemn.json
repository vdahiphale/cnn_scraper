Tackling tensions, U.S. Presidents Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping speak for the first time since November last year. Tesla's wrong turn, car deliveries disappoint, and annual sales drop for the first time since the pandemic. And firmly arm in arm with the biggest A.I. players in the world. The CEO of Arm Holdings will discuss chip competition, geopolitical tensions, and what the A.I. future holds. That conversation and plenty more coming up. But first, the International Community is condemning an Israeli strike that has killed at least seven workers from World Central Kitchen. The British prime minister calling the situation in Gaza \"increasingly intolerable.\" France, the UAE, and Cyprus are also speaking out. The White House says it wants accountability.

The feeling is that the Israelis aresort of going further and deeper in terms of striking their enemies in Lebanon, for instance, in Syria as well. Keep in mind, for instance, in the early hours of this Friday, there was an Israeli strike. There's no question about that, really, despite their denial or their hesitance to claim responsibility on a facility outside of Aleppo, Northern Syria, that left nearly 40 soldiers dead, some of them Hezbollah fighters. What we're seeing is that the Israelis are increasingly striking targets, high-profile targets like these senior IRGC officials in Damascus. And of course, the Iranians have vowed to respond. The question is, how are they going to do it? Until now, what they have done is work through their various allied militias. Hezbollah here in Lebanon, militias in Iraq and in Syria, the Houthis in Yemen, they have always been hesitant to directly strike either the Israelis or of course the Americans who the Iranians and many in the region consider to be partners of the Israelis. But the thing is that, at this point, Iran's profile, its deterrence -- deterrent power is on the line and if it does not respond forcefully and strongly to this Israeli strike it will be seen as weak by both friend and foe. On the other hand, if it does strike Israel somehow directly or the United States, this could, indeed, ignite a wider regional war. Julia.",

They've expressed concern about the inability to get aid into Gaza, but they're actually not doing anything to change the course of Israel's offensive in Gaza, which has now left at least 33,000 people dead, widely believed 70 percent of them are women and children. Until they stop talking about concern and actually do something to stop Israel from conducting this war, it's going to go on and on.

There are quite a few high-stakes topics discussed in that more than 90-minutephone conversation between the two leaders that the White House described as candid and constructive. Among some of those topics, you mentioned a few of them, tensions over Taiwan, the South China Sea, North Korea's nuclear program, as well as China's support of Russia's war in Ukraine, which the U.S. expressed continued displeasure toward. There was also quite a bit of discussion of economic competition in the White House's telling of it. They discussed China's unfair trade practices, and specifically the ownership structure of TikTok, where Congress in the U.S. is currently weighing a law that would force TikTok -- or force the Chinese owner of TikTok to divest the company to new ownership. That still remains to be seen, but the White House has lent its support behind that bill so far. The White House says that Biden wanted to hold this call simply to check in with President Xi after their summit in November, during which the two leaders pledged to just pick up the phone and call each other much more often, so that there are not any misunderstandings between the leaders of two of the most consequential nations in the world. I asked NSC Spokesman John Kirby whether there was a particular catalyst. Why now? Why did this call need to happen today, rather than last week or next week, for instance? And he said simply that enough progress had happened at the staff level, that it was time for them to check in. We should note, though, Julia, that Secretary of the Treasury Janet Yellen is traveling to Beijing in the coming days. Secretary of State Antony Blinken will be traveling China in coming weeks. And, as is customary, usually the president likes to get on the phone to telegraph what's going to be discussed so that the meetings on ground are as constructive and productive as possible. Julia.",

And it's a wonderful Wednesday morning, of course, if you're just waking up with us in Asia. And it's another day of April showers on Wall Street in today's \"Money Move.\" Investors still trying to find their Q2 groove with stocks falling sharply and bond yields also rising, that's happening as more investors question the Federal Reserve's rate cut path with a June cut looking less and less likely due to strong economic data and of course stubborn inflation. Several Fed officials, however, saying Tuesday that they still expect cuts sometime this year. Thank goodness for that or the markets would be significantly lower. Asia, however, finishing mostly higher, as you can see. Strong gains for the Hang Seng, up more than 2 percent Tuesday as traders returned from the Easter holiday weekend. We'll see what Wednesday brings. Xiaomi is a big winner there, up almost 9 percent on reports that orders for its new electric vehicle have been strong so far. And a less electrifying story for EV giant Tesla. Elon Musk's company reporting its first drop in year-over-year sales since the pandemic. Tesla delivered 387,000 vehicles in the first three months of the year. That was well below expectations, and all this sent Tesla shares down 5 percent near in Tuesday's trade. Just to give you some perspective, shares have fallen more than 30 percent year-to-date, making Tesla, in fact, one of the worst performing stocks on the S&amp;P 500. The first quarter was a rough one for China's biggest EV maker, BYD e2. Its sales fell 40 percent compared to Q4, making Tesla once again the world's largest EV maker. That context is crucial. Dan Ives is the managing director of Wedbush Securities. And you always have a great phrase on these things.

And of course, it's increasingly being used to power and help A.I. Now, Arm is not a chip maker. It makes money by licensing its chip designs and technology to clients and partners like Google, Microsoft, Amazon, and Nvidia, just to name a few. And the licensing fees and payments from tech giants adds up. Arm's recorded revenues of almost $3 billion last year. Now, a quarter of Arm sales also come from China through an entity -- or an independent entity called Arm China, which is also one of the company's largest customers. Arm is based in the U.K. It recently listed in the United States, though its biggest investor is Japan's SoftBank. And its stock is up more than 80 percent so far this year on a par, in fact, with Nvidia's year-to-date gains, as you can see on this chart. Its shares also spiked more than 30 percent just two months ago after the firm raised its sales and profit guidance. And I'm very excited to say Arm Holdings CEO Rene Haas joins us now.

When you think about sustainability, when you think about the energy on the world's planet, you need the most power-efficient processors do those workloads. Now, with the advent of A.I., the great news, as I mentioned, A.I. is going to unleash all kinds of capabilities, all kinds of new experiences to enrich our lives. On the other hand, the amount of power that's required to run these data centers or run these devices is going to be immense. So, power efficiency is going to be extremely important relative to A.I. It happens to be an area that Arm is really good at. So, we're really excited about that opportunity.",

The relationship, of course, between the Chinese and the United States is increasingly contentious, I think, and not expected to improve, at least in the technology sphere simply because I think both are fighting for supremacy and for prowess.

She and the restof the Iowa Hawkeyes eliminated defending champions Louisiana State University from the Women's March Madness tournament. The showdown set an all-time ratings record for a women's college basketball game. Coy Wire has more. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR: On Monday, we witnessed arguably the most highly anticipated matchup of the college hoops season. An on-court rivalry centered around Iowa's Caitlin Clark and LSU's Angel Reese drawing more than 12 million viewers just in the U.S. A rematch of last year's national title game. A pumped-up sold-out crowd in Albany. And Clark was ready from the jump, hitting a three pointer, of course, to open the scoring. This game was tied at 45 at halftime and the pace was so fast, but Clark showed no signs of slowing down, hitting three after three. She hit nine of them in total from behind. They are tying the NCAA women's record for most in a single tournament game, also breaking the record for most career threes in women's Division 1 hoops. Angel Reese dominant as well, dropping 17 points, 20 rebounds. But in the end, she fell out and Iowa was able to crack the LSU code with their own cheat code, Caitlin Clark with another performance for the ages. A 94-87 win afterwards. Both Reese and Clark talked about their very different experiences this time around.",
