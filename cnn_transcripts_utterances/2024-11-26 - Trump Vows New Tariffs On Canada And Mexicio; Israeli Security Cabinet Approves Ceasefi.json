      "sentences": "Well, the Israeli Prime Minister made very clear that he believes the Israeli military has accomplished enough in Lebanon against Hezbollah over the course of the last several months, and that it was now time to translate those military achievements into a political solution by agreeing to this ceasefire proposal that has been negotiated primarily by the United States over many, many months now.The Israeli prime minister was speaking in the wake of quite a bit of criticism from both the right wing of Israeli politics for moving forward with this deal, but also from several leaders from those northernmost communities in Israel where residents have been evacuated for the better part of the last year and a couple of months now. And that's because those leaders are concerned that this agreement won't actually bring true security to northern Israel, that ultimately Hezbollah will regroup, will rearm and will pose a threat once again to those communities. But the Israeli Prime Minister explained that he believes that this agreement will allow Israel to enforce this agreement when it deems necessary, meaning to act against Hezbollah if indeed they violate the terms of this cease fire agreement. And he also laid out three other key reasons why he believes now was the right time. He wants to refocus the Israeli military and the government on the Iranian threat, though he didn't expand on that further. He also said that Israel needs to refresh its forces and its military equipment. And he also believes that this is an opportunity to de link the two fronts that -- the two primary fronts, I should say, that Israel is fighting right now, meaning the war with Hamas and the war with Hezbollah. Because previously, of course, Hezbollah had been unwilling to even discuss a ceasefire agreement as long as Israel was still carrying out its war in Gaza. And now, after months of drubbing, including the loss of its leader, Hassan Nasrallah in an Israeli strike, the loss, according to Israeli officials, of at least 50 to 70% of Hezbollah weapons, Hezbollah has now agreed to these ceasefire terms. But make no mistake, there is still considerable skepticism in Israel in particular, where I am right now in Northern Israel. And we should also make clear that until this agreement goes into place, this still remains a very volatile situation. We have seen the Israeli military carrying out very rare strikes in central Beirut, not just in the Lebanese capital, but in highly populated central areas of that city that have not traditionally been struck by the Israeli military. Several, about a dozen people at least have been killed in Beirut or in Lebanon, I should say, as a result of those strikes. And here in Nahariya in Northern Israel, we have heard air raid siren after air raid siren after air raid siren sending people scrambling into shelters. And you can expect that this will continue until this deal is actually implemented. As we saw at the end of the 2006 war, those final days were some of the most dangerous ones before the ceasefire went into effect. That's because both sides are trying to show strength in these final hours before a deal goes into place and to carry out strikes on targets before they have to stop. Brianna, Boris.",

Why impose a tax that puts them at risk?\" And then the Prime Minister -- Deputy Prime Minister of Canada saying, quote, \"Our relationship today is balanced and mutually beneficial, particularly for American workers. Canada buys more from the United States than from China, Japan, France and the UK combined and last year, 60% of U.S. crude oil imports originated in Canada.\" So that's the arguments that we are already hearing from these countries that are reacting quickly to Donald Trump's threats. And Trump has said in a True Social post that these tariffs will remain in effect until, quote, \"Such a time as drugs, in particular fentanyl and all illegal aliens, stop this invasion of our country.\" And now it's not clear how Trump will measure those -- the progress on those key fronts and how he will decide when those goals have been met. But I will point out that he has already had a conversation with Justin Trudeau, the Prime Minister of Canada, in the aftermath of these threats. And Trudeau called it, quote, \"A good call.\" But he also acknowledged that he has firsthand experience dealing with Trump and the challenges of being an ally with the now President Elect Donald Trump.",

It can be a sort of scattershot approach. And many of them have experience trying to lobby President Trump, now President Elect Trump, on how to get these tariffs lifted on certain industries and to create carve outs.

In an effort to avoid tariffs, companies could become less reliant on foreign goods and in turn create more manufacturing jobs here in the United States.Let's weigh those options with White House Economics Reporter at The Washington Post, Jeff Stein. Jeff, thank you so much for being with us. On that note about companies being less reliant on foreign goods and bringing manufacturing to the United States, wouldn't having a higher cost of labor and procurement for goods here in the United States ultimately make those goods more expensive? Isn't that one of the benefits of the global economy that you benefit from the invisible hand moving things around, making costs more efficient, thereby making everything cheaper?",

      "sentences": "Yeah, it's a great question because as a campaign reporter, you know, someone covering the campaign, I struggle to convey to people just how different this is than what we were talking about under the Trump administration, the first Trump administration.Trump imposed tariffs on some $300 billion worth of Chinese imports. And he particularly looked at specific industries, right? So he said, we have a competitive interest in having steel made here. And so he imposed tariff restrictions on the imports of Chinese steel. What Trump is talking about now is just a different category of thing, he's talking about or he called for yesterday and said he would impose tariffs of 25% on all Chinese -- on all Mexican and Canadian imports, and of 10% tariffs on all Chinese imports, regardless of what they are. And many economists are saying this makes little sense, right? Because maybe it makes sense for us to make sure that we can make our own steel here, but do we really need to make the cheapest electronics that are produced in China here? Do we need to make sure that all the avocados that we import from Mexico are made here? Does that even make sense? Do we have avocados that are even grown here to onshore and sort of bring back avocado production to the U.S.? And so some of the things that did not happen under Trump's first administration that have been upheld is saying, look, the tariffs didn't destroy our economy, we had a boom in 2018 -- 2019, are being or could be tested if Trump actually executes what he's talking about here in a very different way.",

And that's excluding what you just mentioned, which is a great point on the potential deportations.I've spoken to some meat packers and some sort of experts in labor who say that the percentage of workers in, say, meatpacking plants in the Midwest are overwhelmingly undocumented immigrants. We're talking 85, 90, 95% of the staff of these facilities that are necessary for relatively low cost of meat, for instance, to become available to American consumers. So the impact of these two together, I mean, it's a remarkable thing to think about that when Trump ran, the number one thing he had going for him was inflation, right? People were so mad about inflation that they were willing to vote for him despite what they saw as his other flaws. And the sort of the two central economic policies that he's pursuing, tariffs and mass deportations could reignite the inflation that propelled him to the White House, which is a hard thing to get your mind around.",

We did talk to some folks who said they could not wait to get out on the road because they didn't want to deal with the TSA. We know millions of more people are expected to go through the airport.

New York up towards Boston today as we get rid of one storm.But we have this storm that's continuing to come together in the Rockies, the West Coast where we've had problems at the airport as far as weather is concern, San Francisco and Los Angeles through a lot of the day. So here's a look at one storm that's exiting. We had some icy and maybe snowy roads up in New Hampshire, Vermont, Maine this morning. I95 Corridor is clearing up from Boston to New York, Philly down towards Baltimore that's drying out after some morning rain. Now, we have this next storm that continues to come together with rain and snow in the Rockies. That storm is going to continue to progress east as we go into tomorrow. Tomorrow actually fairly clear for the most part. Maybe some problems in the Central Plains. Then this thing blows up by Thursday.

Then this front exits as we go into Friday. So again, problem spots on Wednesday mainly focus in the Rockies, maybe parts of the plains.
