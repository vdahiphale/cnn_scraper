They're churning off an awful lot of ammunition, a lot of people are dying, and U.S. support is obviously somewhat wavering.It's the reason I think they need to go to a less resource intense strategy and focus more on holding what they own, what they have, and put aside at least for the time being probably talk of liberation. It is not that I'm against it. I just don't think it's realistic and I don't like it when people in Washington say why should we throw good money after bad, they can't achieve these ends?

I don't know. But right now I think it's hard to tell.

Joe Biden's policy on the border makes no sense. I do not understand why the Democrats essentially are supporting an open uncontrolled border. Massive people -- numbers of people coming here.

He's going to basically go to the Israeli people and say I'm all that stands between you and a Palestinian state controlled by extremists, be it Hamas or a feckless Palestinian Authority that's really just a front for Hamas.So he's going to take Joe Biden on because you're right, they are fundamentally different places about the management of Gaza and what comes after. I could see this framing an election sometime in 2024. And what's good about this for Bibi Netanyahu is it allows him to frame the election about the future. It's about him and the potential -- you know, avoiding of a Palestinian state, what have you.

I mean, 10 months from now, it is very hard to say, nine months from now, if people in America are going to be thinking about Israel, if they're going to be thinking about Gaza, the West Bank. We'll see where the world is, we'll see where the conflict it. But there's an actual substantive issue, which is that Biden tried to, one, reboot I think the Democratic Party if nothing else its relationship with Israel, right?There's a period under the Obama administration, where Obama did try to challenge Netanyahu on settlements and fundamentally lost that conflict, right? Netanyahu went around Obama to Congress and ultimately Obama backed down. So Biden sort of rebooted here. The Democrats sort of, unlike what Trump was pushing on Israel, they care about some kind of more meaningful Palestinian state and more meaningful justice for Palestinians. And Biden became again the sort of world's biggest ally of Israel. And the implicit assumption there was that by backing Israel like that, Biden would have influence he could use when he needed to use it. And what it coming immediately clear is Netanyahu did not see that deal the same way. And so then you get into this question, did Biden mean it? I mean, influence only matters if you're going to use it in both directions and if Netanyahu is going to go against the Biden administration on virtually everything they care about here, including the idea that Palestinians will be governing in Gaza and, you know, what you'd call the day after, though we don't know when the day after will be, then is there any kind of red line at all? I mean, is America going to be funding perennial Israeli control of Gaza, perennial settlement activity and expansion, and eventually annexation in the West Bank? So the problem for Biden here I don't think is like the politics in nine months. We'll see what that is. That politics will be dependent on whether the substance of what America ends up seeming to have signed on to, backed or financed, seems to his own coalition to have worked out or been just.",

There is a generation, an older generation and Biden is part of it, that saw Israel as an impossibility and a miracle. They saw it founded. They saw when the surrounding Arab countries tried to wipe it off the map. They saw it survived and then again in 1967 fend off an attack like that, and in 1973. And that generation is much more pro-Israel, right? They see kind of what Israel could have been and how unlikely it is. But they remember it as weak and vulnerable, too.Then you have kind of (INAUDIBLE) generation, I think sort of, you know, Gen X, older millennials, myself for that matter, who saw Israel as strong, right? They had control of Gaza, had control of the West Bank, where in many ways an occupying force. So as much it was immoral in that. But also saw and remember an Israel trying to create something different, saw a peace maker, saw a deal maker, saw peace processes, saw an Israel that was trying to find some way to a two- state solution. And I think what a lot of people are missing in a lot of the campus protests of which there sometimes is antisemitism, often extremism, but a lot of the people are there because if you're younger, all you have ever seen is Netanyahu's Israel, an Israel that is functionally an oppressive force in Gaza, an oppressive force in the West Bank. It's completely comfortable allowing those things to remain under its control or at least its borders under its control, and is in no way trying to, in the last 10, 15 years find its way to something different. And that generation is not pro-Israel. You could see this like just sliding down the polling, and that is in the long term a real significant security risk for Israel that they should take seriously because Joe Biden's generation is not going to be in power in America forever.",

Israel has lost the intellectual imagination debate in this country, and that is really, really short sighted.So while the establishment was playing -- AIPAC was playing the inside game, they've totally lost the outs game and the proof was, as we're saying, on campuses. That's the future. And what's interesting is most Israelis, like the Netanyahus, don't care. There's a certain contempt for Americans and even for American Jews. They're basically saying, you don't get it, we get it, we're on the frontlines, you're not.

So, as you said, just when the genocide against the Yazidis was beginning in Iraq, that ISIS committed, this company that had already been funding ISIS for a year actually ramped up its support for ISIS.And, you know, the invasion began on the 3rd of August, 2014. Just days later Lafarge was negotiating a new deal with ISIS. Not just to keep the factory going but to actually split its profits, give them a share of the cake, as they put it. They were negotiating the terms of this deal on the 15th of August when ISIS attacked Nadia's village, when six of her brothers were executed and when her mother was executed. They actually agreed, this cement company, one of the largest in the world, agreed to giving ISIS better terms in this profit-sharing arrangement that they were entering into. Ultimately agreeing to give ISIS 10 percent of its cement and 25 percent of the value of its raw materials. I mean, they are watching these images unfolding in front of them. The factory that Lafarge was operating through its subsidiary in Syria was just 52 miles away from Raqqa which was the center of the slave trade that the Yazidis became subjected to, the women and young girls. In the ground breaking prosecution that the Department of Justice brought against this company, the company admitted that it gave almost $6 million to ISIS and to a related group, the al-Nusrah Front. They admit that they agreed to provide cement, which reportedly was used by ISIS to build tunnels in which western hostages and Yazidis were held and tortured. So, you know, this is an absolutely shocking set of circumstances. We commend the Department of Justice for criminally prosecuting this company in what was the first ever prosecution under a statute that allows prosecutors to go after companies that provide material support and conspire with terrorist groups. But the prosecution resulted in this huge fine, as you say, three quarters of a billion dollars, none of that money has gone to the victims, not one dollar. So, the attorney general has the discretion to redirect some of those funds to the victims and we hope that he will do so. We have made a request for that. But we've also filed this lawsuit in the eastern jurisdiction -- District of New York seeking on behalf of Nadia, as our lead plaintiff, but also over 400 other Yazidi Americans to get compensation from Lafarge for assisting in terrorist violence.",

So, when I meet for the first time, we only understand what is going on -- in the other person's mind on our first conversation 20 percent of the time, we just don't know. But one thing I can do is when I'm meeting you is I can give you a gaze that says, you're a person to me. You're a priority to me. And so much is in that first gaze. So, I tell a story in the book, I'm having a breakfast with a lady named LaRue Dorsey in Waco, Texas. And she presents herself to me as a strict disciplinarian. She's a tough lady. I'm a little scared of her.Into the diner walks a guy named Jimmy Dorrell, a mutual friend of ours. And he says, Mrs. Dorsey -- Mrs. Dorsey, you're the best. You're the best. I love you. I love you. And she turns into -- a strict disciplinarian she's suddenly a bright eye-shining nine-year-old girl. The power of your gaze, of your attention to change somebody. And the key thing for Jimmy is he's a pastor. And so, when he sees somebody, he sees a person made in the image of God. He sees someone with a soul of infinite value and dignity. And you could be Christian or Jewish or atheist or agnostic, but seeing every person you meet with that level of respect and reverence is an absolute precondition for seeing them well. You have to extend that basic level of respect to every person you meet.",

And a lot of people we don't -- you know, I've come discern that only about 30 percent to 40 percent of the people I meet are question askers. The rest are perfectly nice. They are just not curious about you. They don't ask questions.And so, the quality of your questions determines the quality of your conversation. And so, we should be asking bigger questions. And some of them, when I get to know someone, it is like where are you from? Then as I get to know them better, it might be something a little, you know, fun like, tell me your favorite unimportant thing about you. And so, I learn from academic that he loves to watch a lot of trashy reality TV show. But then as we really get to know each other, if I'm really going to get to know you, I want to ask you big questions. If this five years in your life is a chapter, what is the chapter about? What talent do you have that you're no longer using? What crossroads are you at? And then you can really drill down. You can have a great conversation. Just exploring the answers, and you will leave with a sense of human connection, but you also learn about human nature and you learn about the world. It is just a more fun way to go in the world but you have to have the questioning skills to really get inside somebody else's brain.",
