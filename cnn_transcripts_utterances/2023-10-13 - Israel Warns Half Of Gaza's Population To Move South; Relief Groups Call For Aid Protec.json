We continue our breaking news coverage of Israel at war and we begin with a major development in the Israel-Hamas war.The U.N. says Israel is ordering more than a million Palestinians in northern Gaza to move to the south. The U.N. said it was told within the next 24 hours and several of those hours have already passed. A U.N. spokesperson calls the request impossible saying it could turn an already tragic situation into a calamity. Now it's likely the clearest sign yet though Israel planning to intensify its military operations in Gaza following Hamas's attack on Israel to build at least 1,200 people. Tens of thousands of Israeli troops, tanks and other military equipment now gathered along the Gaza border. Meanwhile, the aerial and artillery assault on Gaza shows no sign of letting up as Israel says it's destroyed Hamas tunnels, weapons caches, rocket launchers and storage facilities. But there is enormous and worsening suffering for the civilians in Gaza. The Palestinian health ministry there says more than 1,500 people have now been killed by Israeli airstrikes and shelling and without power and water or fuel, Tthe healthcare system is on the brink of collapse. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken is in Jordan right now with meetings scheduled in Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Egypt and the United Arab Emirates. In Israel on Thursday, he met with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.

And possibly, this is the, you know, next step towards this expected ground invasion that we've been talking about for the past few days in terms of what happens in Gaza.So this warning was given by the Israelis to the United Nations just before 5:00 p.m. Eastern time. So around about midnight, local time in Israel and the Gaza Strip. And what Israel was saying is that and this is what the statement says civilians of Gaza City evacuate south for your own safety and the safety of your families and distance yourself from Hamas terrorists who are using you as human shields. Now this area north of Wadi Gaza, which the U.N. says accounts for about 1.1 million people, that's about half the entire population of the Gaza Strip. So it's about roughly 10 kilometers south from the northern tip of the Gaza Strip, though it does vary. And what the United Nations is saying or its immediate response was that it is impossible to move that many people south without in its word devastating humanitarian consequences. Now, the UN's Palestinian refugee agency Anwar has already moved its central operations and stuff to the south. Hamas, while the Gaza media office which of course is controlled by Hamas, which controls the Gaza Strip, putting out a statement after Israel's warning, saying to Palestinians don't fall for what he described as false propaganda, and also said that it was just part of psychological warfare on the part of the Israelis. Now the U.N. Secretary General Antonio Guterres has asked for clarification. Israel's envoy to the United Nations has described the UN's response as in its -- in his words, shameful, Michael.",

But clearly what Israel wants to do is to minimize civilian casualties from any expected bombing or shelling or even ground incursion, which is likely to come if it does from the North.Now, we don't know for sure that it's going to happen, we expect it to happen. And we obviously don't know precisely where or when Israel would go in, but by clearing that northern part of the Gaza Strip, if it's able to do so, and if the Palestinian, the civilian Palestinian population pays heed to that warning, this would obviously make the job that much easier, both from a military perspective. And also, of course, in the if you'd like information war, in terms of the optics, by minimizing civilian casualties, but no doubt scenes of, you know, hundreds of thousands, potentially of Palestinians moving south with, you know, their -- all their worldly possessions, you know, to get out of harm's way is not going to be a particularly good look from Israel's perspective either. But it feels that this is something that it has to do. And given the gravity of the situation and the brutality of Hamas's attack on Israel in the early hours of Saturday morning, I think this time around, certainly compared with previous wars with Hamas militants in the Gaza Strip. Israel is less concerned about the optics of what it is doing and very much more focused on the military operation and of course, freeing those up to 150 hostages that Hamas took from Israel inside the Gaza Strip.

Thanks so much appreciate it.Now, with Israel facing growing criticism for an apparent intelligence failure before the Hamas attack, the Israeli military says it will investigate the group's use of a half dozen training camps in Gaza after locations were reported by CNN. According to our reporting, at least six of the sites were within two kilometers of the most heavily patrolled section of the border with Israel. Clarissa Ward with details. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) CLARISSA WARD, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voiceover): Propaganda videos put out by Hamas revealed chilling details about the years of preparations that went into Saturday's bloody attacks right under Israel's nose. Analyzing metadata from the videos, a CNN investigation can reveal the presence of at least six training sites inside Gaza, one just 720 meters from the most heavily fortified and patrolled part of Israel's border. In that camp, Hamas recreated an Israeli compound with elements of the nearby border crossing, including an insignia of the Erez Battalion. The videos show the even practice taking prisoners on zip tying their hands at the camp. Satellite imagery indicates the camp was constructed within the last year and a half. At two other locations in the southern part of Gaza, Hamas trained for their audacious paraglider assault, rehearsing takeoffs and landings. At all six sites two years of satellite imagery reviewed by CNN shows no indication of offensive Israeli military action. The imagery instead shows that in the last two years, some camps even expanded into surrounding farmland, and that there was activity in the last several months at the camps. The stunning revelations raised questions as to how Hamas was able to train so openly, so close to the border for so long, and why Israeli officials were unable to pick up on and prevent the October 7 attack.
