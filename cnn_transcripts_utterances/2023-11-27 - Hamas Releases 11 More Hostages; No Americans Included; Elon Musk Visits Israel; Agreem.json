We believe that the group is now on their way to hospitals where they will be reunited. with their families. Almost all of those freed today were children, 18 years old or younger. Two of them, two of them we are very happy to tell you, are 16-year-old Or Yaakov and his 13-year-old brother Yagil Yaakov.On October 7th, on the very day, that horrible day that they were kidnapped, I spoke with their mom on the phone, live, with you, listening. And she had been talking to her sons as the terrorists went into her home. She was not in the home at the moment. And she told me that horrible story about hearing her sons being kidnapped by the terrorists of Hamas. This is October 7th itself. And here is some of that conversation we had that night.

One of them was Abigail Edan, who we saw released yesterday, and then two additional women. But day four of this truce has now come and gone and no additional Americans released so far.And nothing we can say so far about the condition of these two women either. But this is a big part of the reason, Jake, why U.S. officials have been pushing for an extension of this truce. We are told that senior White House officials had at least four phone conversations earlier today with the Qatari Prime Minister. CIA Director Bill Burns was closely engaged. Of course, National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan was keeping the president apprised the whole time as negotiations were ongoing to extend this truce. But we are about to learn in the next 48 hours or so whether these two American women will end up being a part of the 20 additional women and children that will be released over the course of two days.

It's insufficient, and that's why it continues.And I don't believe it's a coincidence that we captured some Houthis that were trying to take over a ship, and all of a sudden two ballistic missiles are fired at a U.S. destroyer. Keep in mind, we did not respond to this, and we did not respond to the shooting down of one of our drones by the Houthis as well. So, these are more examples of a lack of response by the Biden administration. And I know they're concerned. They fear that if they do too much, it'll escalate. My argument is just the opposite. If they don't do enough, that the attacks will continue. At some point, you know, Americans will be killed, and that's when it will escalate.

C.J. was sentenced to 30 to 60 years in prison back in 2011.Now the point of our segment and the cover story that I wrote for \"The Atlantic Magazine\" was not only that C.J. could not have committed the crime but that C.J. did not have adequate legal representation so much so that I and my co-author argued it was a violation of the Sixth Amendment of the U.S. Constitutions guarantee to assistance by counsel. And today, a judge agreed and C.J. Rice could very well soon be a free man, could, could. Now the basics of the story, Rice was shot in September 2011. Those are his scars you see right there. And after he was released, he saw his pediatrician, my dad, Dr. Theodore S. Tapper. And Rice could barely walk. And soon after that, days later, two young black men shot a separate family causing injury but thankfully no deaths and no serious injuries. Rice was picked out as one of the shooters in a photo lineup. It seemed quite questionable. And remember, my dad had just seen Rice in his office. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DR. THEODORE TAPPER, C.J. RICE'S FORMER PHYSICIAN: He had staples in his abdomen over approximately an eight or nine inch surgical incision from his breastbone straight down, as far as you could go.

It would be unprecedented, do a gag order, it also be unprecedented for guy with 91 indictments or what charges against him still running for president and saying these kinds of things, never mind a former president saying these kinds of things about a judge.So it's a great example of how hard cases make for bad law.

It turns away people from actively participating, whether as voters or to become election officials or to become judges, public service becomes a danger when candidates like Trump are allowed to get away with this. And it also erodes the credibility of our democracy, when justice is not swift, when a bureaucracy is used to stop the wheels of justice from holding the President accountable.

He does not care about tradition. He does not care about decorum. He cares about weaponizing, anything that was useful for him to weaponize. And so I don't blame some of these senators. And we mentioned, if you were hanging around on January 6th, and you had that memory fresh in your mind, hang Mike Pence and, you know, who knows what kind of voicemails he got, I can see people sort of buckling and chickening out about voting to impeach and remove Trump.
