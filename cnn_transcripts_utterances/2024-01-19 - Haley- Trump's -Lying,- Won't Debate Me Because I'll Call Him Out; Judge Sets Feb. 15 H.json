And while there's a large range in age for the candidates, there's, you know, preference for some candidates, and some don't matter about age, but to others, it's more about the topics that they're talking about.So in the sense of age for office, you know, I remember that Nikki Haley was talking more about federal offices.

So the co-defendant of Donald Trump, one of the campaign operatives with him, who's charged in Georgia has raised this issue, as part of the case saying that the relationship that District Attorney Fani Willis has with the top prosecutor there, Nathan Wade, somebody that is paid by her office brought on to prosecute the case against Trump and 18 others, that that is potentially a problematic conflict in this case.Now, the judge is going to look at that. This defendant is saying there may be an improper relationship there. At very least, it's a distraction and something that could really hurt the credibility of these prosecutors as it continues being something that's an issue in this case, the judge is going to talk about it at this February 15-ish hearing, talking about the legal ethics here and these prosecutors working together on this. Now, separately, Fani Willis, the District Attorney in Fulton County, she's been subpoenaed to give a deposition to provide information sit for an interview in the divorce proceeding of Nathan Wade. She's been subpoenaed by the person who will become his ex-wife, his current wife that he's been filed and they both agreed to divorce about two years ago. Her deposition is scheduled for next Tuesday. She doesn't want that to happen. And she is saying in a filing trying to get out of that deposition, that the defendant Joycelyn Wade, Nathan Wade's wife, is using the legal process to harass and embarrass District Attorney Willis. And in doing so is obstructing and interfering with an ongoing criminal prosecution. She is also, Fani Willis in her filing, accusing Joycelyn Wade of potentially conspiring with some of these election interference defendants to try and get this to be part of the milieu of what's going on in this case. Now, Joycelyn Wade and her attorneys did release a statement yesterday saying this is a personal matter. And Fani Willis is using her public platform. So a lot to watch here, very messy, at least in the divorce proceeding.",
