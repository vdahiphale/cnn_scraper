The entire election likely to come down to a handful of key battleground states and that's where both campaigns will focus their attention in the coming days and we've got you covered.Our Danny Freeman is on the campaign trail with the Trump campaign in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, and Eva McKend is covering the Harris campaign in Metro Atlanta.

Both campaigns clearly know that all roads lead through Pennsylvania if they want to get to the White House, but the Trump campaign really putting the hours in today. This rally's about to kick off in just a few moments.But you're right, what happened earlier today is the former president was in Bucks County, all important Philadelphia suburbs, working at a McDonald's. We have video of it. He was working the fryer, making French fries. And really, this has come up as a campaign issue because Vice President Kamala Harris has said that in her past she once worked at McDonald's. Former President Trump, without any proof, has said that she never worked at McDonald's. But the Vice President Harris campaign emphasizes that she worked at a McDonald's, specifically in Alameda, California, in 1983 back when she was still in college and she worked there over the summer. So that's why former President Trump was at that particular stop earlier today. But the event that's been getting a lot of headlines from Pennsylvania is the one from last night in Latrobe. There was vulgarity during that event, a little bit of a call and response as well. And then there was this long rambling anecdote, let's say, about golf great Arnold Palmer. Take a listen.

So Kamala Harris saying these things, while important, she's potentially the president, she needs male substitutes to make that case. President Obama, President Clinton, she needs those male substitutes to get out there and say it to the young men and the older men who will listen to that, whether they're black or white or Latino.At this point, it almost doesn't matter. They need to see that Donald Trump has deteriorated. It's one of the most important messages of the entire campaign.

Now, because it was such a minor leak in terms of the intelligence disclosure, what one former Israeli intelligence official told me is that it's unlikely that in the assessment of that former intelligence official, it was an Iranian spy for instance because no one who with that kind of access inside the U.S. intelligence apparatus would risk being found out for something so minor as these disclosures that were published on a pro- Iranian telegram channel on Friday or at the weekend. Much more likely that former analyst told me that this was a deliberately, this is something that obviously the United States has not commented on and is unlikely to ever sort of like admit to anyway. But in intelligence circles in Israel, the possibility that this was a deliberate leak either to delay or deter an Iranian strike or against the backdrop of a U.S. presidential election to discredit the Biden administration is something that is being discussed about here amongst officials and in the Israeli media.",

I mean, I think the issue now is acute vulnerability, it seems to me, for the hostage. You know, it is curious, Sinwar and his obsession for secrecy. It'sconceivable as well that only Sinwar and a few others know right now the exact location of where the sausages actually are. And some of them, it was reported as being held by a group that may be affiliated with Hamas, but is not totally under Hamas's control. So again, I think in the wake of this -- of Sinwar killing, all of the enthusiasm and it's completely understandable how to use this moment in order to seek the release of the hostages. I think that Hamas right now has a stake in doubling down. It remains in many respects their only asset, the control of these hostages. So that might argue that they would enhance the need to keep them alive. But again, it's incredibly uncertain environment. Hamas is in the process of sanctioning or validating the leader. Maybe it'll be with Sinwar's younger brother, who's reported to be more radical than he was. Just unclear. The urgency, it isn't the only objective that the Israelis have in Gaza, but clearly it is the most urgent. And governing is about choosing.

There are 50 different elections. Each state is doing a different election. And so, what we're learning is all of these particular challenges -- I mean, last week, it was North Carolina and whether or not they could kick people off of the voting rolls. We're talking about all these changes in Georgia. There are suits in Arizona. So, what we're learning is we have to watch every state where both candidates know it could come down to that state. One more thing I will mention is that after the election, look to see what we're all watching is whether or not a case goes to the Supreme Court. Are we going to have another Bush v. Gore? Because in a 2023 decision, having nothing to do with presidential elections really, the court said, and when it comes to state courts interpreting state law, we still have, the federal judiciary still has a role to play. So, the court left the door open for a potential another big Supreme Court challenge.",

Days after his sudden death, fans continue to mourn as an investigation is pressing forward into his final moments and a fatal fall at a hotel in Buenos Aires. CNN's Camila Bernal has the latest on all of this. Camila, what are you learning? CAMILA BERNAL, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENTThe other thing that we learned from sources there is that the dad was able to see the body at the morgue, but we were also told that he was not allowed into the room where his son was staying. He was shown a similar room on another floor as this investigation continues. Now the father also greeting the fans that were there in Argentina outside of the hotel and thanking them for their support. As you mentioned, so many of these fans gathering all over the world this weekend in London, in Australia, in Japan, here in the U.S., including in New York and other cities. And a lot of these fans just gathering to bring letters, photos, teddy bears. They're singing together and speaking about how meaningful Liam Payne was and how meaningful One Direction has been for a lot of these fans as they've grown up with them. You've seen an outpouring of support on social media as well. The latest post from his sister expressing that he was her best friend and she, of course, is expressing her disbelief and her love for her brother. Now, we're also learning that another former member of One Direction, Zayn Malik, postponing his U.S. tour here, saying and telling his fans, thank you for understanding. Of course, it is being very difficult for a lot of these fans and for the people close to him, Jessica.",

This place will be rocking and rolling because the fan base here has been waiting so long to see the Liberty potentially win their first title in the history of the franchise.They've been around for 28 years. They are one of the original franchises in the WNBA, and they're the only one that has yet to win a title so far. They had their backs against the wall in game four. They're going to have to play better than they did. But this series has been so close between these two teams and it has been a case of the team that has responded from a loss coming back and winning that next game, and that's what we're going to need to see from Breanna Stewart, Sabrina Ionescu, these big stars that New York has in the biggest media market in the country. For Minnesota, they have been on this stage before and they have proven that they can win a championship. They won four in seven years. And if they can pull this off tonight, and it's certainly not a case of whether they can, but will they with how well they've been playing, they'll win a fifth, which is something that no team in the W has done to date. Let's take a listen to what some of the players are saying ahead of tonight's game. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
