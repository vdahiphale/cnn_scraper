And the doom dash into North Korea, new details on how and possibly why U.S. Private Travis King went rogue. Thanks for joining us here for CNN NEWSROOM. I'm John Vause. We begin in Auckland, New Zealand, co-host of this year's Women's World Cup and a city left reeling after a deadly shooting early Thursday morning local time. Two people were shot dead, six others were wounded when a lone gunman armed with a pump action shotgun opened fire near Auckland's ferry terminal downtown. The shooter was later found dead. Police say it appears he had no political motivation and did not pose a national security risk. And the New Zealand Norway opening match will continue as planned with kickoff three hours away. CNN's Angus Watson joins us live this hour just across the Tasman in Sydney, Australia. So, Angus, what more do we know about the shooting? Why did it happen? And what about the security now that's running the actual event the World Cup?",

Police were praised for their bravery rushing to the scene in order to neutralize that threat. The suspect was found with a bullet wound in an elevator shaft.

Details from CNN's Nick Paton Walsh. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) NICK PATON WALSH, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice over): It is grainy, dark and doesn't show us much of use. But it does claim to be Wagner rebellion leader Yevgeny Prigozhin finally in public and alive with his fighters in Belarus after 25 days of him vanishing from view. It emerged to perhaps by coincidence, a few hours after this man, the secretive head of Britain's MI6 intelligence agency told CNN in a rare public appearance that he thought Prigozhin was \"floating about\", providing the first confirmation from the west that he's alive. Britain's top spy seemed shocked at how a weak Putin was forced into accepting the Belarusian president humiliating deal that weekend. RICHARD MOORE, U.K. MI6 CHIEF: He really didn't fight back against Prigozhin. He cut a deal to save his skin, using the good officers of the -- of the leader of Belarus.

Someone like Mitch McConnell, who certainly knows the magnitude of what is involved here, the most he will do is -- is remain silent. And I think, you know, we can talk -- and we have -- about all the immediate electoral implications of this for each party. But this is an ominous moment for American democracy. Because you do have Trump as the leader of a political movement that has shown that it is willing to ease the threat of violence, that it is willing to use anti-democratic means in order to advance its goal. His argument to his voters has always been that, if I lose, the America you know will be irrevocably transformed and turn away from you and that, therefore, in essence, any means necessary is justified to prevent that. That was the case he has made, really, from the outset. It's certainly the case he is making now in his defense against these charges.

Of course, something of a shadow cast over tonight's game by that tragic incident that you mentioned there in downtown Auckland, where several of the teams are staying.Team USA is in New Zealand now. They were quick to release a statement regarding that mass shooting, saying, \"U.S. Soccer extends its deepest condolences to the families of the victims who were killed in the shooting in downtown Auckland today. We are saddened by the inexcusable loss of life to gun violence, and our thoughts are with the people of Auckland/Tamaki Makaurau and Aotearoa, New Zealand.\" Now, Team USA will be the red-hot favorite for this tournament. They have the chance to go three in a row. No team has ever done that before. Of course, they'll have more competition this time. This is the first Women's World Cup where there will be 32 teams participating. And European giants like the European champions, England, France, Germany, Spain, Norway will be hot on the heels of Team USA, which is undergoing something of a reshuffle, a rebuild in its team. Of course, Megan Rapinoe, that star player, saying that he will retire this year, but Sophia Smith and Trinity Rodman upfront, expected to dazzle for Team USA at these games. The entire tournament will be watching them. And host Australia, household names, the Matildas here we are excitement is building, hugely, ahead at this tournament set to begin here tonight with the Matildas playing the republic of Ireland in Sydney right after that New Zealand-Norway clash in Auckland, John.",
