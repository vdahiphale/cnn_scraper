That's according to Russian appointed officials who said the bridge was closed during an air raid alarm. Meanwhile, the U.S. says its cluster munitions supplied to Ukraine have been used in battle. The U.S. National Security Council says they're already having an impact on Russian defenses. Days of Russian drone and missile strikes have taken a toll on Odesa and other parts of southern Ukraine. President Zelenskyy says about 70 missiles and 90 drones were launched. CNN's Fred Pleitgen reports. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voiceover): Search and rescue crews trying to save lives after another round of Russian airstrikes in southern Ukraine. Moscow's army claiming they're hitting military targets. The Russian armed forces continued retaliatory strikes with sea and air based high precision weapons on workshops and warehouses with unmanned boats in Odesa and Chornomorsk, the spokesman says. But the Ukrainian say the Russians are targeting civilian infrastructure. One person was killed and several wounded when a missile hit this building in the port city Odesa, the mayor irate. Another terrorist attack by nonhumans on the peaceful city of Odesa, he says. Look at what they're doing. This is a nursery. There's a kindergarten nearby. Others desperately hoping their loved ones might be found alive. They're searching for my grandson, this man says, from the recording it seems he went down to the basement they're trying to dig up the rubble. Ukraine's air defenses were only able to shoot down about a quarter of the cruise missiles Russia fired, Kyiv says. Putin's military using some of its heaviest naval missiles designed to destroy warships and even aircraft carriers. There is no possibility to shoot them down because we understand what kind of missiles they are how fast they fly and their trajectory, the spokesman for the Air Force says. Ukraine says it needs more and better air defense capabilities from the U.S. and its allies are the authorities here we'll be able to do little more than try to save victims from the rubble after the attacks.

CNN's Oren Liebermann is at the Pentagon with details.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) OREN LIEBERMANN, CNN PENTAGON CORRESPONDENT (on camera): U.S. cluster munitions began arriving in Ukraine sometime last week, and it seems Ukraine has already been putting them to good use. According to two U.S. officials who are familiar with the information, Ukraine has already begun using cluster munitions in its ongoing counteroffensive against occupying Russian forces. The White House even acknowledged the use of cluster munitions, saying they're using them appropriately. Because of the controversy around cluster munitions there was an agreement between the U.S. and Ukraine to make sure that Ukrainian forces didn't use them in urban areas or against civilian targets. That's because all of the bomblets within the cluster munition can create a danger hitting a wider area. And if there are duds that explode later, those two can create a risk. But the White House says Ukrainian forces have been using them appropriately and crucially also effectively against defensive Russian lines that have proven a tremendous challenge to Ukraine, as it tries to break through and make progress and it's counter offensive. The White House said the National Security Council said that Ukrainian forces have used them effectively to move around and disrupt Russian defensive formations and positions along the front line as Ukraine pushes forward and it's counteroffensive. on the question of how effective they've been and what sort of difference they have made. That's something the U.S. is looking for very carefully to find out how effective the impact of cluster munitions on the battlefield so again, the U.S. and officials here watching that very closely to try to learn more, even with the controversy around them. The Biden administration made the decision to send over cluster munitions because of Ukraine's need for more artillery ammunition in its ongoing counter offensive, and especially as that counter offensive comes after about a year and a half of war.

The demonstration lasted about 45 minutes. He was issued, himself and his translator, permits by Swedish police to carry out this protest, although they emphasized that the permit is for the gathering, not for the happenings at the gathering. The event, the protest, was livestreamed. In the video, you can see Salman Momika, that man, that individual wiping his shoes at one point with the Iraqi flag, and appearing to step on pages of the Quran. It does not appear that he burned the Quran on this incident on Thursday. Still again, there were repercussions even before the demonstration took place, hundreds of demonstrators in Baghdad stormed Sweden's embassy in the city, setting part of the building alight. They were mostly followers of the Muqtada al-Sadr then prominent Shia cleric who was outspoken on this issue. Iraq's government crackdown, of course, saying that it's arrested certain individuals, that they would face legal consequences for the storming of the embassy, but at the same time, threatened to sever diplomatic ties with Sweden for permitting the demonstration, for permitting this protest to go ahead in Stockholm. As the event was taking place, Iraq took the first steps in that, expelling, asking Sweden's ambassador in Iraq to leave the country, and at the same time, recalling its charge d'affaires from Stockholm as well. We did see that there was information from a telecommunications giant which suspended the license of Sweden's telecommunications giant, Ericsson, and that was suspended by Iraqi authorities as well.

So you can see the disconnect there with the sheer volume of stuff that we are buying every year. And as you say, it really -- the 44 percent -- we only wear about 44 percent of the clothes in our wardrobes. The rest of it just kind sits there unworn. And so what we've seen over the last few years is more and more people are choosing to dispose of their clothes by giving them to thrift stores, to charity shops, and from there, there is this assumption people have that thrift shops are going to resell in store. It's not actually true between (INAUDIBLE) -- between 50 to 80 percent of what is in the charity shops is actually kind of bundled up, crated (ph) and then exported to the global south to the developing world where as you've seen there just isn't a way for structures to deal with it so you end up with these piles in the Atacama Desert, in landfills, in my reporting and we have a similar scale of the problem. It really is astonishing to see the scale of this waste that's happening.",

You know, a lot of times in these countries there are import themselves, they're buying this stuff. There was a really surprising market and it does (INAUDIBLE) some economic value to this country and it's been competing with fast fashion so we want to be careful about the word dumping.But you're absolutely right. The scale of this is huge. You know, from my reporting, I went to Ghana and West Africa, and which is where a lot of clothing, particular from the U.K. and the rest of Europe ends up. And I stood on gigantic dumps, essentially and saw, you know, you could pick out the names of the brands and it's still on the label, in some cases they still have the labels from the charity shops see on them. And the challenge that, you know, I interviewed the head of the sanitation department for the city, (INAUDIBLE) for Ghana. And he told me that the city's one solitary, sanitary landfill which had been built with a loan from the World Bank and was designed to last 30 years. There is so fast fashion waste coming into the country, it filled up in three and a half years. And what happens when you get a big pile of clothing in a very hot country, and a lot of this clothing is now made of plastic which people don't know is, essentially, fuel, you know, petrol? It caught fire in the dumping ground. And so they have to seal it, they have to cap it, their one landfill which they are still paying interest on. You know, some of the poorest people in the world are still paying interest on a landfill that burned down because of this fashion waste. The impact is really real in this community.",

It's something tangible. You could see it. You touch it every day. All of us have been recycling with those things every single day, often a lot of times. This is the low hanging fruit. You mentioned the water use, food waste is estimated to between 8 to 10 percent of all greenhouse gas emissions. We throw away a third of everything that we produce without it being eaten. For me, this was like a low hanging fruit for climate change. If you can't get people to grapple with the things that they're touching, and feeling, and using every day, it is hard to feel connected to the stuff that you need. For me, it's a lot of opportunity, this should be the first wave, the first line of issues to tackle.
