It's the Prime Minister, the defense minister and Benny Gantz, who formerly you would have described him as the main opposition figure, political opposition figure to the Prime Minister. But they bring in other figures as needed the head of Mossad, the army chiefs are there. There are observers, those who've been the head of IDF, the Israeli Defense Forces in the past, they bring in all the experts, they have had a lot of them around that table and to the point that you'll be discussing later with Rafael Grossi there head of the U.N.'s nuclear watchdog, the IAEA. That Iran shuttered its nuclear facilities Sunday knowing that President Biden over the weekend cautioned Israel against an immediate strike, but knowing that members of the war cabinet did want an immediate strike even while the drones and other missiles were in the air flying towards Israel. You think back to what Iraq has, rather, Israel has done in the past to strike deep into its enemy's territory at strategic targets, the Osirak nuclear reactor in Iraq in 1981, the nuclear power plant that was being built in Syria in 2007, there was a strike there it took Israel 11 years by the way to admit to that strike. But it shows the level and complexity of things that could be being discussed around that table right now that war cabinet table that they do want to act. That is clear. But what it's going to be these discussions go on. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ROBERTSON (voice-over): In heated debate, Israel's war cabinet facing their toughest decision since October 7th.

For now, how hard to hit back at Iran for not blew up relations with allies dominating Israel's political agenda. (END VIDEOTAPE) ROBERTSON (on camera): And the IDF Chief of Staff last night told troops during a visit to an airbase that they were thinking ahead, officials are thinking ahead, that they will strike back. But I think we should also look to Brussels and the European Union who are considering sanctions on Iran to the high level of diplomatic support that Israel is enjoying at the moment and the criticism from those same countries of Iran and its strike on Israel over the weekend. And the fact that there was a G7 meeting called over the weekend by the G7 leaders to follow up on the strike and trying to sort of coordinate action there is a movement I think we can see internationally towards a diplomatic response. That will obviously is something that Israel would like to see as well. But I think the idea that it's a diplomatic path alone that Israel is willing to settle for. That doesn't seem realistic when you look at past practice of Israel, that there will be some sort of military strike.

That is half Becky, of the original 40 number that has been talked about for weeks, if not months. We had learned that Hamas was saying to mediators that they did not have that 40 number. But now Hamas is telling mediators, we're only willing to offer 20 of those hostages. So then there's a question of whether in order to reach that 40 figure, they would add some of the men perhaps some of the IDF soldiers. And perhaps some of those hostages who have been killed, that remains to be seen. But this does appear to be a major impasse, Hamas not willing to release the number of hostages that had been agreed to in this framework and the same time Hamas accusing Israel, of not budging on their demands to allow Gazans to go back to the northern part of the Gaza Strip in an unrestricted way and for the IDF to pull back from Central Gaza.

But he also has a lot of his supporters, particularly supporters in the in the Hindu community, the Hindu majority here in India, because Prime Minister Modi has essentially basically by his life story, he's told his life story being the middle son of a tea seller and selling tea and listening to people hearing about their problems understanding of the issues plaguing everyday people.

The International Monetary Fund currentlyholding its spring meeting in Washington says the U.S. economy continues to exceed expectations and will considerably outpace its peers this year, but there is a catch that strong growth the IMF says could fuel inflation. So the IMF is urging the U.S. Federal Reserve to take what it calls a cautious and gradual approach to interest rate cuts. Well, let's have a look at what these markets are up to. They are, let's call mixed pretty much flat. And we know that investors in these stock markets have been keenly watching and listening and key indications about when those rate cuts might come. So the fact that they are mixed and flat this morning, may be an indication that people are understanding where the IMF stands, is it well. The United Arab Emirates where I am continues to grow as a Middle Eastern and global tech hub. And now Microsoft says it's investing $1.5 billion in the UAE's artificial intelligence firm G 42. That gives the U.S. tech giant a minority stake in the company and a seat on its board of directors. And it is worth noting the deal comes amid Washington's concerns over Beijing's tech advances and the U.S. has been especially worried about deepening ties between China and the Gulf States including the UAE. Well, China's economy is in focus today. Beijing says it picked up speed at the start of 2024. First quarter gross domestic product grew 5.3 percent from a year earlier, outpacing analysts' expectations. China's economy is one has been having a bumpy ride.

It was just about one month ago when government leaders here in Beijing unveiled aneconomic growth target of about 5 percent for 2024 some see that as ambitious. This latest report, though, on the health of the Chinese economy is very much in line with that target. But there are some questions about whether it can be maintained sustained into the future. If we look at the data manufacturing is a big part of the success. And in China there are really three big industries right now electric vehicles, solar panels and batteries. And being based here a lot of this is something that I've seen firsthand. Yet, as we've heard from Economist Harry Murphy Crews from Moody Analytics, quote, there's a growing mismatch in China's economy. Manufacturers are doing the heavy lifting, while households sit on the sidelines. And there's concern China is flooding the market essentially adding so much merchandise negatively then impacting pricing making it difficult for others to compete. It's an issue Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen talked about during her visit here just last week, a practice that can prevent a level playing field.
