Joining us now to discuss, Stef Kight, politics reporter for \"Axios\", and Michelle Price, she is national political reporter for \"The Associated Press\".Welcome to both of you. Stef Kight, let me start with you. This -- what Trump had to say about Harris's last name, nobody knows her last name. It's Harris. Trump rarely, even though, can sound like he is meandering and occasionally he's all over the place, usually there's a place from whence it comes, right? There's some reason why he's thinking about this. Do you have any insight into why that is? I mean, he clearly has had a very intense focus on her name.",

I mean, just the faces that are pictured there.And we also remember back to when Trump used the phrase S-hole countries, they say third world countries here, but it seems to be pretty unclear what they're doing here. This is, of course, something that is more official than Trump, potentially, rambling in an interview or at least if not official, then something that campaign thought that they would put out and sort of -- and give their stamp of approval to. What are they doing here and are there risks to this strategy?",

I think some of what the content that the campaign is putting online tends to reflect more of the fringier views that the comments that Donald Trump might make it, but that his advisers might not want him to make. It is an account. Generally, this social accounts that repeating some of those comments that his advisers are wishing he wouldn't focus on when you when you focuses on race, when he makes comments about Harris's name, rather than talking about issues like the economy.You know, there is -- this is something that Donald Trump has done before. You remember in 2016, he launched his campaign by talking about Mexico is not sending their best. And he made these very race- based seeming appeals as he was speaking out immigration. And there is certainly a part of the American electorate that seems to connect with that, but there is a racial fears behind some of this messaging. But there is a broad swath of voters, including Republican voters, Haley voters, who are concerned about the folks coming over the border. They're concerned about just is it chorus, who's being vetted. But they'll say that they want immigrants in this country. They want a diverse country and if Donald Trump starts to go too deep into that area, he's going to alienate some of these voters.",

It's something that I'm sure you and others as I have, we've been hearing from several Republicans, you know, both on background and sometimes on the record, they want to be focused on the policies.And when I talked to Republicans, they feel like there is an argument for them to be making against Kamala Harris that is focused on policies that they can focus on some of the stances she's taken in the past that they deemed to be too liberal or too progressive, and they feel like it's unhelpful to their efforts to kind of turn to some of these more personal attacks. You know, they were frustrated by Trump's comments to Black journalists, recently, they were frustrated by some of his posts on Twitter, and Truth Social. And so, they're hoping that he will get back on track. This is a campaign that for a month now we've been saying has been more disciplined and were kind of seeing that that fear take root in the Trump campaign. We've seen a very different tone. We've seen them much more aggressive trying to bring the attention back to the campaign. But again, we're hearing from a lot of Republicans who would like to see the focus remain on policy issues like inflation, like the border, like these issues, they feel like actually matter to voters and they're worried about the direction Trump's taking it. HUNT:  Yeah, we saw Trump hit those issues for sure in this Univision interview that the thing was that he was always coming back around to those personal attacks. Stef Kight, Michelle Price, thank you both very much for starting us off this morning. I really appreciate it. All right.

Now, Hamas has said that they don't want to talk for the sake of talking. They say that any negotiation has to end in a cessation of the war in Gaza.The Hamas statement over the weekend, for example, was saying that they have already agreed as far as they are concerned to a proposal so that was vocally supported by the U.S. president and also a U.N. Security Council resolution, and they're blaming Israel for moving the goalposts. On the other side, Israel is blaming Hamas saying that they will send a delegation to Doha.
