The G7 hoping its alliance remains solid as a rock ahead of talks tackling the Ukraine war economic shock. But first signs that a debt ceiling deal is moving closer triggering a mid be bullish stock display on Wednesday with all the major averages up more than 1 percent, The best one day rally for the S&amp;P in fact in two weeks more cautious trade today though, but European Stocks are rallying. And House Speaker Kevin McCarthy raising hopes by saying a debt agreement is possible by the weekend. President Biden also competent of a compromise the problem is they still have to meet in the middle and both be able to say they want that's politics remember too, a rally now. Also limits the market upside once a deal assuming it does finally getting done. From the debt ceiling smiles to retail store aisles the largest U.S. retailer Walmart reporting better than expected earnings and raising its full year outlook. Food sales strong but consumers pulling back on big ticket items like electronics. Chinese retail giant Alibaba also posting a revenue mess, but its shares set to rise more than 1 percent in early trade on news that it plans to spin it off its cloud division also a juggernaut pulling context, but our conversation too with the President of the E-commerce platform Shopify, who's been tracking the global growth of global entrepreneurs. That's coming up later on in the program. And Asian markets in the spotlight to which Japan gets set to host the summit of G7 nations. Green arrows as you can see that across the board with the NIKKEI rallying more than 1.5 percent. In fact, the benchmark Japanese stock index riding a six session winning streak and is now up 17 percent Year-to-date, the broader TOPIX index, hitting 33 year highs. I think that's a reflection of the upbeat outlook for profits, rock bottom interest rates, of course and a noticeable pickup in inflation and throw in investor friendly corporate governance reforms. There's a whole bag of the items there that are driving that I think compare though. And contrast with the mood in China. The U.S. dollar trading this six month highs against the Chinese Yuan on concerns that the Chinese recovery maybe spluttering. And China just one of the topics to be discussed at the G7 leaders meeting this week alongside of course the drive for greater security in the Indo-Pacific region. And as we've mentioned the war in Ukraine and officials there say air defense systems intercepted 29 missiles launched by Russia overnight. This after China's Special Envoy wrapped up a two day visit to keep meeting with President Zelenskyy. Sam Kiley has all the details.",

But Russia state television is telling a very different story. CNN's Matthew Chance has more on Moscow's information war. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MATTHEW CHANCE, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice over): State television where Russia fight sits information war. Reads story the U.S. Patriot missile battery, Russia insists it destroyed in Kyiv. U.S. officials tell CNN the system remains operational. But this is too rare a victory for the pro Kremlin media to play down. The much promoted Patriot was destroyed by Kinzhal. The presented gloats our hypersonic missiles were so fast. They cut through Ukraine's air defenses, like a knife through butter she adds. As for the six hypersonic missiles, Ukraine says it shot down a fantasy number the presenter says and more than we actually fired. A Senior Ukrainian official now tells CNN only minor damage was caused to the Patriot Air Defense System when one of the Kinzhal was shut down at low altitude on Tuesday morning. The Official said the U.S. aid system will be repaired soon. And an investigation is now underway into how the Patriot was targeted. Elsewhere, Ukraine says small advances have been made around Bakhmut. These night images appear to show an armored push in the fields outside. Russian state television is in this city touring devastated front lines under constant fire with Wagner mercenaries who say they're confident they will prevail. We will take a Bakhmut, eventually this Wagner commander tells the Russian TV crew following him around but at what cost we don't know, he admits. Another says they're shelling us from afar because they can't defeat us in close combat were too strong, he says. Ukrainian Officials confirm fierce fighting in the city captured on this latest drone video. Areas of Bakhmut suburbs devastated, but now being liberated the Ukrainian say. And back on Russian TV, there's growing acceptance that what was meant as a short offensive in Ukraine has spiraled out of control, exposing weaknesses and divisions in the country. It's not have a special military operation says this guest on state television but a faithful wall that Russians must win or face destruction. As Ukraine prepares for a counter offensive to reclaim occupied land, it seems Russia is also bracing for a fight. Matthew Chance, CNN, London. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

But as you and many of your guests have discussed in recent weeks, a debt default in the U.S. would not only be harmful to the U.S. economy. But it could have catastrophic side effects for really the rest of the world and the broader economy. And no matter what the G7 would like to discuss, it really could create a lot of hardship. So that is why the President is delaying, or at least canceling this portion of the trip to Australia and to New Guinea. But on the topic of the debt ceiling, it is something that will likely come up for conversation, when President Biden meets with these various world leaders tomorrow here in Hiroshima, they are expected to ask him some questions, and he will be expected to give some answers. With that said, we have heard, for lack of better word, some empathy from the Australian Prime Minister who said he understood why the President had to make that decision. And it's not as if he won't meet with the leaders of the so called quad, Australia, Japan, India they will all have attendance, even though they're not all necessarily formal members that G7. They will be there. So there will be some discussions. But as you just mentioned, a whole list of important issues that also need to be discussed. Certainly, Ukraine, and on the economic front, that will be a big part of the discussion. Right now, we still see Europe exporting items to Ukraine or to Russia, we see Japan importing gas from Russia. That's going to be something to see if that is restricted even further and then, of course, this broader issue of China. What kind of statement will we get from the G7, if any? A lot of these countries do have an economic stake in the Chinese economy and may not want to rock the boat so much. But there could be issues about potential sanctions, as well as economic coercion. We'll have to see on that. And finally, Julia, you talk a lot about artificial intelligence on your program that I am told is also going to be on these G7 discussions.",

But as you mentioned, Montana becoming the first state in the United States to ban TikTok and literally would be prohibited from operating within the state lines. And the short of that concern is it's all over perceived security concerns. So ByteDance owns TikTok that's a Chinese based company ByteDance. And so U.S. Officials are concerned that the Chinese government could access user data through ByteDance and through TikTok and you see some of those concerns with the governor of Montana tweeting specifically that to protect Montanans personal and private data from the Chinese Communist Party. I have banned TikTok in Montana. And so, you know, you see some politics in there, of course, but Biden's did fire employees last year, two of which were based in China for what they say was improperly accessing personal data of multiple U.S. based journalist. A Buzzfeed News report last year also highlighted that some Chinese employees had access to U.S. data. Now TikTok is saying that they've made some internal changes. And this time around and always there's no public evidence Beijing has systematically been accessing this data. But TikTok is out with a statement in response to the Montana ban, saying that this is infringes on the First Amendment rights of the people of Montana that we want to reassure Montanans that they can continue using TikTok to express themselves earn a living and find community as we continue working to defend the rights of our users inside and outside of Montana. And he testified on Capitol Hill here in the U.S. and Washington, D.C. back in March that all of these concerns are based on hypothetical scenarios, again, that systematic access to user data. And we've seen Montana joins now the more than half of U.S. States that have banned TikTok on government issued devices, but of course, this one is the strictest of the mall extending to an outright ban on TikTok, that law goes into effect in January.",

Joining us now is Sheila Smith. She's the John E. Merow, Senior Fellow for Asia-Pacific Studies at the Council on Foreign Relations. Sheila, great to have you with us on the show, I love the way that you described the meeting between these two leaders. And you described it as an opportunity to bask in multilateral momentum. Describe what you mean, because Kishida certainly put in a lot of geographical legwork ahead of this meeting? SHEILA SMITH, SENIOR FELLOW FOR ASIA-PACIFIC STUDIES AT COUNCIL FOR FOREIGN RELATIONS: That's right, Julia, it's great to be with you. So the Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida has been a very active diplomat statesman of late and especially in the G7 context. So you've seen him, just this year traveled to Europe to meet with leaders there come here to North America to meet with the Canadian Prime Minister, and obviously, the U.S. President Joe Biden. He has a lot at stake in the success of this meeting, but also in making sure that the world understands Japan's commitment to multilateralism. And you'll hear that in his language, you'll see it, I think, in the G7 statement that will be issued. There's a lot on the table here for, you know, in terms of not only Ukraine, but also obviously in the Indo-Pacific concerns about China and Chinese behavior. And of course, the G7 is an economic gathering as well. So the spillover effects of the global economy of the conflict in Europe are also on the Prime Minister's mind.",

Do we forget that Japan's northern border is actually a maritime border with Russia, and so oil, gas, and as you noted, the seafood industry relies heavily on that relationship with Russia.

What I think is going to be interesting to watch is that the leaders will go to the Peace Park, there will be a statement made, and in with this context of the Russian invasion of Ukraine and President Putin's sort of coercion, if you will, nuclear coercion statement that he's willing to raise the threshold of violence if necessary, to the nuclear level. I think this is going to be an interesting moment where the G7 leaders can talk about, once more mitigating the risk of the use of those weapons in a conflict.

They create jobs, they anchor our cities or towns, but they have a massive impact that goes so much beyond their own business. The problem is there's never really been any type of database that measures the actual impact of entrepreneurship. So we built one. And so now we're early launching the Shopify entrepreneurship index, it's going to be a home for data insights, and entrepreneurship across 40 countries in every single U.S. state. And we're going to be updating this every single quarter so people can see how things are trending, including where entrepreneurship is booming. And the reason we did this was no one really no one else has a list like this, the data like we have, because we power millions of stores in the U.S. alone. We have more than 10 percent of all e-commerce going through Shopify. So we really thought that it would be an important thing to put out there. And the reason we're doing it is because we want to power policymakers, government, media public with information, how to create more entrepreneurship. Now, one of the things that's fascinating, you pointed this out in your introduction, which I think you hit right on the head, which is that despite a very challenging macro environment right now, entrepreneurship is having a renaissance. I mean, in the U.S. alone, there was a record 10 million applications over the last two years for new businesses that is higher than the last 20 years.

And the results as you sort of discuss, they're pretty remarkable. And the U.S. ranks number one, but after that, you get into some other places, which are maybe a little bit less obvious, which we should talk about as well. But just focus on U.S. for a second, we saw total jobs supported or jobs created, GDP impact and business activity by Shopify entrepreneurs, each increase by 11 percent since 2021. And when you expand, you know, beyond just U.S., you see countries, like in Europe, like Lithuania and Romania, play second and third, globally. APAC continues to grow as a hub for entrepreneurship.

So we have to talk about that, because I think Japan was one of the ones that really stood out to me and surprised me. And obviously, that this was slowdown that we're seeing in China, just as quickly as you can, because I want to talk about Shopify, sort of compare and contrast and explain what you're seeing in those two places.",

In Japan, jobs supported by our entrepreneurs are up 24 percent and the GDP index is up 23 percent. So I think Japan is doing a really good job of not only fostering entrepreneurship, but making it a lot easier for the businesses and the brands and the retailers in Japan to sell outside of Japan. And you know the proof is in the pudding here.",

      "sentences": "Yes, I mean, look, Shopify is world class at building commerce software for entrepreneurs and larger businesses as well. And I mean, Ithink you know, if you look at the results, 2023 started off incredibly strong for Shopify and our merchants. In Q1 revenue was up 25 percent, GMV was up 15 percent, accelerating from Q4. We're also seeing even larger brands like Zhu Lilly and Glossier and Mattel and Heinz and Ted Baker and -- Athletic Greens also coming to Shopify as well. So in terms of our core metrics, all those were up our attach rate, which measures the actual usage of our products by our merchants is the highest it's ever been. So these are incredible results. And we also showed operational discipline. On the bottom line, we were cash flow positive for this quarter, and we provided guidance, we'll be cash flow positive each and every quarter of this year. But I also in terms of the logistics piece, Shopify really want to create less friction for entrepreneurship, and for small businesses and larger businesses. And when we announced logistics and our shipping product back in 2018, there was nobody else doing it, we felt like if we didn't do it, for our merchants, they would have to do it for themselves. And we're always in a better position, because we're economies of scale. So at the time, it felt like it was the right thing to do. But that really was never our main focus. It was never our main quest; it was always a side quest. And as we began to work with Dave Clark and Ryan over at flex port, we begin to realize that they can do this faster and more effectively, because that is their main quest, shipping and logistics is all they think about. And so by selling our logistics business to them, it gets us to focus back on our core competency, which is software and building software for commerce. And it allows our merchants to get the shipping and fulfillment that that we were trying to build for them. So it's been it's a great deal. But it also allows us to focus in a way that that we think is very important.",

Sowe're embedding AI into things like product descriptions. So when you're starting a store on Shopify or you're building store, instead of having to write your own product description, AI using AI, you're actually going to be able to provide a much better product description that ChatGPT is going to power for you. Another example is shop.ai, which anyone can go to, which is this incredible concierge. If you're planning a party with a particular theme, it'll suggest exact products for you.

They have a combined 220 million followers across social media, and have raised an estimated $1.6 billion worth of funding, according to Forbes. And joining us now is Rana Wehbe Watson, Special Projects Director at Forbes Asia. Rana, welcome to the show, this is very exciting. And I know you've been doing this now for eight years. I think what surprises me most is the sheer breadth and level of innovation. Despite the fact that we know economic conditions are challenging.

You mentioned the founders on thisyear's list, which accounts for about 70 percent of the 300 people on the list, have raised a total of $1.6 billion in funding this year. But last year, for example, while some parts of the region, we're still dealing with the pandemic, they have raised, the batch of last year had raised $3 billion. So funding has definitely gone down. But innovation hasn't. As a result, we actually see people aiming less entrepreneurs aiming less to create one product or one app to be for everything for everyone everywhere.

And it is, of course, now the most populous country in the world. So it's no surprise, but we do see Indians across all the categories that we have on the list, doing great things. You mentioned loop health, which is trying to make healthcare, healthcare insurance more accessible to people. We also have people who are creating ad tech companies, but not the ones that we're used to during the pandemic, where you actually give the lessons online. They're actually believers in offline learning one to one, but they're using technology as a software as an app to connect students to connect parents who want to track the progress of their, of their kids.
