And as Paula points out, you know, certainly the obstruction part of this investigation is why the former president is in the legal jeopardy that he is in, right?The fact is that they received subpoenas. They were ordered to return -- all of these documents -- they did not. And even after receiving them, there were documents being moved from the room that they had promised to secure. They had promised to put an extra lock on it. And so that's the reason why what Jack Smith is doing. And, you know, I think Paula hints at it there. The prosecutors seem to or believe that they know something, and that's the reason why they're bringing these people in to ask these questions, because they clearly seem to have information that they believe these men could shed light on.",

His son is the director of security now. So you're bringing them in and you have the footage. Just help me put together the pieces of what you're looking for to build a case and why the video footage matters. CARRIE CORDERO, CNN LEGAL &amp; NATIONAL SECURITY ANALYST: Well, so just a level set on this investigation generally, though, Evan is actually so correct in this, in that -- this is a former president we're talking about. Had it been determined, the Justice Department told him, we think you have classified documents, he provided them all, that would have been the end of this, the end. And instead, this obstruction part and the growing piece of it is why there is so much legal jeopardy and why it continues to expand to a broader array of people who potentially had either involvement or knowledge of the obstruction of this investigation. So the video evidence is critical because it shows what would happen. Video evidence is one of the best pieces of types of evidence in addition to, you know, text messages or emails, but sort of that documentary evidence because it shows what it shows. It's not reliant on a particular person's reputation in terms of their own testimony. So then they bring these people in, they're going to get their potentially corroboration of what's on the videos, and they need to get the story behind of how it is that information was delayed and being provided.",

(COMMERCIAL BREAK) [12:40:08] KING: For major escalation now in Republicans investigations into President Biden and his family. The House Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer has issued a new subpoena to the FBI, citing a whistleblower complaint. Comer and Senator Chuck Grassley of Iowa writing to the FBI, demanding a form they say, quote, \"describes an alleged criminal scheme involving then-Vice President Biden and a foreign national relating to the exchange of money for policy decisions.\" The White House is dismissing the claim. It says Republicans are, quote, trafficking in innuendo. Let's get the details. CNN's Sara Murray joins us now with the latest. Sara, what's at play here?",

And they say they've heard from an unnamed whistleblower who insists the FBI has some kind of evidence that Joe Biden, when he was vice president, was involved in this criminal scheme that involved paying off a foreign national.Now, we should note, they don't offer any evidence to back this claim up. They don't offer it in their press release, they don't offer it in subsequent interviews that Chuck Grassley has done on this. But Comer still has issued this subpoena to the FBI. He's asking for documents that are supposedly related to this. And these documents, John, are the kinds of forms the FBI would fill out when they have someone who comes in. They're memorializing an interview or they're trying to take information down from a confidential source. But essentially what these forms do is they document allegations. They don't document information that's been corroborated by the FBI. So, again, these are unverified claims. And we should note that while James Comer has been doing this Biden investigation, he has done plenty of subpoenas quietly outside of the public view. So it was a clear, deliberate political move for him and Chuck Grassley to decide they were going to go out publicly, announce the subpoena publicly with no information at this point to back it up, John.",

That's what the White House is saying and tying it back to what they say is a yearslong effort by Republicans in Congress to advance what the White House says are politically motivated attacks against the President and his family.Both the White House and Democrats see this as nothing more than a distraction, that they say is really designed to deflect from, you know, the policy debates on Capitol Hill and the fact that they believe Republicans have not put forward a clear policy agenda. I think, you know, ultimately the White House tends to ignore these investigations when it comes to publicly commenting on them. But right now, he just announced his reelection campaign, President Biden. And the case they're making is this is really about their -- appeasing the Republican base.

He kind of talked around it.This is not surprising that Republicans are investigating any allegation into Biden, whether substantiated it or not, because they said that once they took back control of the House, that they were going to do it. What is interesting to see is that there are several congressional Republicans that are saying, hey, you know, I know we said we were going to carry out these investigations, but there are several pressing issues at hand. There's the looming bank crisis, there's the debt ceiling crisis that still needs to be addressed and could possibly lead to the U.S. default.

ZOLAN KANNO-YOUNGS, WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT, THE NEW YORK TIMES: I think there was definitely initial anxiety in the White House. I mean, we know that they were bringing in more resources for their legal counsel. I know in the example of DHS, when it came to the investigation into Ale Mayorkas, that DHS was preparing and having meetings as well with the White House to kind of prepare for these investigations. There was definitely an initial concern about how much time this would take, these investigations would take, as well as some of the headlines that would get out there. But now, fast forward to now, as Sabrina was saying, look, you had expectations put out there by Republicans. Before the Mayorkas investigation, they said they wanted to impeach him, you know. Before any of these allegations are unveiled, you already have them coming out with a verdict, as you were saying.
