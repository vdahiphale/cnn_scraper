And this is some of the worst damage we've seen the entire day that we've been here.We are at a laundromat that, as you can see here, not much of it is left standing. The folks have done a pretty good job of moving all of the debris back on to a corner as they figure out what they are going to do next. The sign of this business, I will draw your attention to it. It fell on these three cars that are parked outside. In one of those cars, we're told, were two kids yesterday. The man you are about to hear, he was inside of that laundry mat and he was talking to the mother of those two children. The mother tells him, look, my kids are inside that car, I'd like to go out and get them. All of this is happening right before that tornado hits. The man tells her, ma'am, it's not safe to do that. Stay inside. And seconds later, that's when that sign fell. The kids, we're told, are ok. No one was hurt out here. Now, we caught up with that man earlier this afternoon. He was back out here to take a look at the damage. And he, look, all in all, he is happy everyone out here is OK. Here's what he told us. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

However, because this tornado was on the ground for such a short period of time, we believe well under a minute, the sense is they're going to be able to make do with what they have. They're not going to need a whole lot of emergency relief. The good news, again, Abby, is that, despite this tornado no, one was hurt out here.",

      "sentences": "It certainly is a sign that many people realize that their time is better served elsewhere.Look, all of my former bosses that ran for president spoke at CPAC because, over the years, it has been the place to go to get your message out and raise your name I.D. and increase awareness to the grassroots of the Republican Party. And now what we're seeing is many of those that are potentially running in 2024 have decided, instead of going to CPAC, they're going to the Club for Growth event down in Florida. Look, CPAC is about awareness. Club for Growth is about money. And what we're seeing is, while we had Nikki Haley come out today, and she just spoke, others are choosing to go where they can help to raise money. Here's what I thought was interesting with Nikki Haley's speech. I was watching that as we were getting ready. Look, she is taking her message right to President Biden. She is not - she has called punching sides to her Republican challenger. She's going right after Biden and what she calls Democratic Socialism. She's saying it's time to make this country proud and strong and not weak and woke. And really going after some of the important issues that really touched the red meat there at the crowd, talking about how she wants to make our economy strong, our streets safe. And also secure the election, which that's not a very popular topic with many people in that crowd, who are election deniers. But she made a really good point to make sure it's time to restore confidence in our election process.",

In part, because that's an indictment against her former boss, Trump, who she didn't mention. Do you really think that there is a good reason for Nikki Haley to address this particular crowd that seems to be veering much farther to the right and to Trump's column than she wants to position herself?",

And it's important because this is a message that the entire Republican Party needs to listen to.Voters in the midterm election made it quite clear they are tired of election deniers and conspiracy theorists. And as Mitch McConnell said, we need to focus on candidate quality. And the more we have Trump-like candidates - and I believe former President Trump that might do well in a primary - that is not going to fare well in a general election. So what she is doing and what I expect to see the other potential GOP 2024 candidates do is focus on, look, as a party, we are united on the policies. We just have a different style in how to go about accomplishing them. And that's really the GOP message moving forward, is let's get together with the policies that unite us. But understanding that we need a softer tone and a different tenor in order to appeal not just to the base but to broaden the electorate to a lot of the voters who have left the GOP because they didn't like the style and the personality that Donald Trump brings. Because it's time to broaden the base and not just really solidify the base.",

New data from the point-of-sale platform, Toast, shows that more and more places are asking customers to leave gratuity. And that's fine. But it also shows the tips may be shrinking. And it seems there is tip fatigue among all of us. With \"New York\" magazine recently stating, \"This might irritate or confuse you, but the reality is that there are new social expectations around what deserves a tip.\" CNN business reporter, Nathaniel Meyersohn, is here to walk us through these threads. I know I feel like I'm asked to tip for every and anything that I do that requires using my credit card. What are we seeing in terms of why people are no longer pressing that, yes, 20 percent button on the screen?",

It's being driven by the high cost of meals and inflation, plus, all the different options we now have to tip.This is based on some new data that shows that tipping is down at sit- down meals, pickup orders and also delivery. So down across the board, clearly a trend here. Not every state tips the same. Indiana and Delaware are known for giving the highest tips, while California and Washington, where the cost of living is higher, they're the least generous.",

So that means companies can remove those cash tip jars that we're used to in the past.You look at quick-service restaurants, think of coffee shops, Panera, Star Bucks, those types of places, the number of tips increased 11 percent in 2022 from pre-pandemic levels. So clearly, a trend here. And it has to do with the removal of cash tip jars.",
