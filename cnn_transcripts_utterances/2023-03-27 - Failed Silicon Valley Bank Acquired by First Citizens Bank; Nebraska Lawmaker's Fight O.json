It was some kind of wacky, you know, line of questioning from Terry Sanderson's attorney that turned into some viral moments, talking about everything from Gwyneth Paltrow's fashion, to her height, their shoes, and some would say it was bizarre, but yes, we should be hearing from Terry Sanderson himself.He has been pursuing these claims civilly against Gwyneth Paltrow for the last seven years. So, it'll be interesting to see who the jury believes, because there is no video from the alleged collision that took place seven years ago. Terry Sanderson says, that Gwyneth Paltrow barreled into him causing brain injuries. Gwyneth Paltrow says, no, he skied into me. And we heard her testimony on Friday. We will be hearing most likely from Gwyneth Paltrow's two children, potentially her husband, and then everything should rest later this week, and then we'll have the jury deliberating. It'll be interesting to see at how long it takes them to deliberate and whose side they're going to fall on, you know. Because again, like I said, it really comes down to their testimonies and that of their respective witnesses.",
