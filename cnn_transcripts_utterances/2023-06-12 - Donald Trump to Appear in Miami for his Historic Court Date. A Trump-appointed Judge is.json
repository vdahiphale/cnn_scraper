Just ahead, former U.S. President Donald Trump is traveling to Miami later today, that is ahead of his federal court appearance this week where he will face a 37-count indictment. That indictment is sparking dangerous rhetoric from some of the former president's supporters. We will look at the online chatter.And thousands of people have evacuated as a volcano in the Philippines spews gas and lava. We have a live report from Hong Kong. All right, thank you everyone for joining us. All right, so we want to start with this. Donald Trump heading to Florida in the coming hours to prepare for a historic day in court. What his former attorney general is saying about the classified documents indictment. Now, as for Mr. Trump, his supporters think about his legal troubles, we will also break that down with polls showing what voters are telling CNN. So, let's just pick up from there, because sources say Trump will meet, okay, we are having some problems here. Sources say Trump will meet with lawyers, and you know what? We are going to take -- we're going take -- we're going to go to Katelyn Polantz's report.",

Here's more of what Bill Barr had to say on Sunday on Fox News.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) WILLIAM BARR, FORMER U.S. ATTORNEY GENERAL:  If even half of it is true then he is toast. I mean, it's a pretty -- it's a very detailed indictment and it's very, very damning. This idea of presenting Trump as a victim here, a victim of a witch hunt, is ridiculous. He is not a victim here. He was totally wrong that he had the right to have those documents. Those documents are among the most sensitive secrets that the country has. He -- they have to be in the custody of the archivist. He had no right to maintain them and retain them. And he kept them in a way at Mar-a-Lago, the only one who really cares about national security, their stomach would turn at it. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And if the Department of Justice is able to convict on either even half of the obstruction charges here, the former president is facing serious time in federal prison. I'm avoiding your question of exactly when this trial will happen because that really is up to largely a federal judge's discretion in terms of how quickly or slowly this process will move.As you mentioned, Judge Aileen Cannon was appointed by the former president, but for me, what is much more significant is that second thing you mentioned, which is that she actually ruled on an issue related to this case, dealing with whether or not there should be a special master. And she ostensibly made a ruling that was just completely baseless and was actually overturned by the 11th circuit. But it looks like a piece of advocacy, not a piece of -- not a ruling from a judge. And so, if the former president wants this to take a long, time I think he has the right judge to make that happen.",

I mean, all of these -- all of these charges that are accumulating against him, and the others that seem to be heading our way, possibly from Georgia, and another from the federal special counsel relating to his efforts to overturn 2020.You know, outside of the Republican coalition, polling suggests it is having exactly the kind of effect you would expect that a majority of Americans beyond the Republican coalition are saying that if Donald Trump is convicted of a crime, they think that is disqualifying to serve as president. And in a CBS poll today, a clear majority of voters outside the Republican coalition said they viewed his handling of -- mishandling of classified documents as a genuine national security threat. But inside, kind of the under the dome world, inside the Republican coalition, the effects so far seem to be very different. Once again, as really, for the last eight years now, we have seen the vast majority of Republican officials speak out in defense of Trump's claims that he is the victim of a politicized, weaponized witch hunt. And very few voices countering that. A handful, Chris Christie, Asa Hutchinson, Bill Barr, John Bolton. But by and large, very few. And as a result, what Trump has been able to do is basically set up a construct into which moving away from him in the primary process is in effect rewarding those who are persecuting him. And I think that makes it very difficult for the other Republican candidates, even as the evidence grows that this is, as you would expect, not exactly a calling card to winning back the White House again in a general election.",

But for the other Republican candidates who are closer to the center of the race, Ron DeSantis, Tim Scott, Nikki's Haley, Mike Pence, I mean, the challenge they have here is you saw right away, Saturday afternoon when Donald Trump was speaking in Georgia. His argument was the deep state is coming after me because they know I am the only Republican candidate strong enough to stand up against them on your behalf. And in effect, by echoing his really vitriolic claims that he's being pursued by lunatic, deranged, Marxist, all his words, prosecutors, the other Republicans are essentially validating his argument. I mean, they are making themselves the chorus in his play. If in fact he is being, you know, they are now in the position of saying, yes, the deep state is going after Donald Trump, but you should nominate me anyway? At some point, you know, as we've said before, he's a former president with a big lead in the polls. You have to give voters a reason, Republican voters, a reason to bypass him for the nomination. This, certainly, this indictment, as Jessica can tell you, raises enormous questions about his judgment, his honesty, his fitness to be president. If they are unwilling to make that case, it's really hard to see how they overcome the advantages that he has now.",

We've been hearing all throughout the day jack hammering and heavy machinery working through the day to sift through that rubble. And while there have been no reported injuries, the governor said they are still working to see if anyone was actually alive in that truck when this collapse happened.

Now, the Ukrainians are still not calling this their big counter offensive. There were some indications by the Ukrainian president this weekend saying that the Ukrainians had now gone to defensive counter offensive operations. However, then on Sunday, the head of Ukraine's military intelligence, he came out and he posted a video of himself just sitting in his chair, being silent. And at the end of it, the Ukrainians said plans love silence. Obviously, once again, saying that they don't want to talk about the big counter offensive if indeed it is already underway. But one of the things that is clear is that right now in this country, the Ukrainians certainly have the initiative. There is no place where the Russians seem to be making gains. But a lot of places where the Ukrainians certainly are trying to make gains. One of those places is Bakhmut, where on Sunday, the Ukrainians once again said that they have won back territory.

We saw the debt ceiling, you know, we saw all these things that are kind of teetering. I think the stability for the Fed to be really -- that's what I think. They do posit.It shows signals that the Fed is paying attention to these other variables, because they are going to be aggressive. Let's be -- I'm going to be very honest. They're going to be hawkish and aggressive. There's nothing changing about that, because they're going to continue -- like I'd say, continue to probably look to do more high praises later, even though they're taking a pause. So, I think that's the important factor here. I don't want anyone to under, you know, to lose fact that they're not going anywhere, they're still going to try to be that two percent inflation number which is still kind of a very long way, you know, being hopeful but that -- I think I don't see them being not as aggressive as they've done in the past.",
