Moments from now, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and other officials will hold a news conference, as Israel's defense minister says the IDF has moved to a new phase in the war. New video shows the siege underway in Gaza. Massive plumes of black smoke are rising from the enclave. Just a short time ago, Israeli forces are now inside of Gaza. Overnight, the IDF's armored vehicles and tanks are on the move. Though the full scope of current activities remains unclear. We've also seen Israel unleash a heavy sustained barrage of aerial attacks on Gaza. Our teams on the ground report hearing large explosions and heavy machine gunfire. The IDF says the airstrikes targeted 150 underground Hamas combat spaces and terror tunnels. We're also watching new military activity unfold along Israel's border with Lebanon. The IDF and militant group Hezbollah continue to exchange fire on that front. Let's send it over to Wolf in Israel. Wolf.",

Really, when you look at what's happened since the start of this war, Wolf, the U.N. reckons about 100 trucks a day, need to get into meet the needs of the civilian population of Gaza. It is just 84 trucks that have been in since this war began 21 days ago. It gives you an idea of everything they're lacking. What has gone on Wolf has been medical supplies and food, the fuel that is so desperately needed to run the hospitals, for instance, hasn't got in at all since the start of this conflict. What that means is that the U.N. agencies, some of whom, as you mentioned a moment ago, haven't even been able to speak to their teams since this Friday night escalation are fearing including the U.N. agency that looks specifically after Palestinian refugees, that they may have to get out within the next few days. So, an extremely difficult humanitarian situation that has been made worse, as you say, by that near total blackout. Many families are unable to reach each other, their loved ones inside. And, of course, emergency services unable to be reached, because even those wounded cannot call the ambulances to where they are. And so, you've seen what had been, this hope over the last few days that some calls for -- although, ceasefire, perhaps, but it is a humanitarian pause, to help some -- address some of these urgent issues. We saw the U.N. vote on the United Nations General Assembly resolution massively in favor of a pause. That those hopes have rather faded as a result of what happened last night continues to happen today. In part, we've just been hearing from Antonio Guterres, the head of the United Nations speaking from Qatar about his disappointment, not just that the dashed hopes over the hostages since we had also Friday night be hoping for some good news regarding those negotiations. But, of course, the dashed hopes with regard to the hopes that aid might finally get in and that some kind of arrangement might get found for at least dual national citizens to be able to get out.

And that we're going to see sort of losses the Israelis taking how many Hamas defenders there are. BLITZER: Yes, a lot going on. The big concern, of course, for Israel going into Gaza, as you know, Bob, has to be a protracted fight that takes place in those extensive underground tunnel networks that Hamas has developed in Gaza.

That seems too much for me. But they are -- they are very deep. And the only way to get into them is fight from tunnel by tunnel.

You know as well as I, Wolf, what a national mission Israel has for itself in terms of redemption of its soldiers and civilians left on the battlefield. That is the cruelest of dilemmas.
