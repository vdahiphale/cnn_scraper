So, here you have these very pivotal days, Anderson. And the concern is about the crowd. It's truly remarkable. ANDERSON COOPER, CNN HOST, ANDERSON COOPER 360: Randi Kaye, thanks so much.

Things quickly went off the rails, tonight, as Trump is trying to seize back the momentum on the campaign trail. And we also have breaking news about that alleged hack attack, targeting the Trump campaign. CNN can confirm it was Roger Stone, whose email was hacked, as the FBI is investigating suspected attempts, by Iran, to break into both campaigns. I'm Kaitlan Collins. And this is THE SOURCE. It happened again. And it may not have come at a worse time for Donald Trump. The sit-down that he built as all-caps, the interview of the century, a one-on-one with the X CEO, Elon Musk, was the interview that wasn't at first, and for a long while after that. It was supposed to begin exactly an hour ago, at 08:00 p.m. Eastern. But when we, listeners, tuned in to hear that interview, between Elon Musk and Donald Trump, and instead heard this on a loop.

It is another major failure, in the same vein as when Governor Ron DeSantis agreed to launch his presidential campaign, in the same format, in an interview with Musk, and had an almost identical technical meltdown. When that happened, remember, Trump posted that the launch and DeSantis' campaign was a disaster. Now, tonight, his conversation with Musk has finally and belatedly gotten underway. We are monitoring it all. Right now, Trump is talking about his attempted assassination, after vowing to not bring it up again, following his speech at the Republican convention. I want to start this hour with some of our smartest minds to start us off. We have Aisha Mills at the table, a Democratic strategist, who has advised more than a dozen members of Congress.

But to your point, the problem for Donald Trump is he's basically been chilling for a year or so, right? He hasn't been on the campaign trail in a big way. The legal problems kind of hid some of that. And most importantly, he had an opponent, who was not doing much of that campaigning himself. The second that changed, this campaign has been exposed for one, that does not have the kind of offensive ability that I think some people thought they did. I mean, I think we looked at a race for a last year and a half that was stale, and it kind of presented Donald Trump as maybe a more imposing political figure than he was.

I think the community needs to level with the American people. Whichever way those types of interference cut politically, just speak the facts plainly, put them out there for the public.

But whenever they're discussed, it's important to set out what's the provenance of these materials. Where did they come from? Why are we seeing them?

I think that Putin essentially thinks that Trump is an easy mark. He doesn't respect him. But he understands that using flattery with Trump can get him a long way.
