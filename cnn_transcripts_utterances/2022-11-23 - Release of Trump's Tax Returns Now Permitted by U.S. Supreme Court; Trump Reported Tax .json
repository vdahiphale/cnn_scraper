But they still don't know who the killer is or how many people they're looking for. CNN's Natasha Chen spoke with the representative about what the police know so far.NATASHA CHEN, CNN U.S. NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  I asked the police spokesman here whether they're any close to finding a suspect. And what I was told is they're definitely making progress. What that means is they've interviewed more than 90 people, they've chased more than 700 leads, and they've set up a portal online for people in the community who might have relevant surveillance footage to be able to upload those videos to police. And they say they've actually received quite a number of submissions. And so, right now, their investigators are combing through those very large video files to see what may be relevant to hand over to the detectives on this case. Now, I did ask about the general threat level to the community, after all, a suspect has not been caught. And so, the spokesperson tells me that people do need to being vigilant. Here's what he said.

Kremlin says, Russian President Vladimir Putin will meet this week with mothers of reservist soldiers called in to fight in Ukraine. This comes as complaints have been flooding in from Russian soldiers, including those who were recently mobilized. CNN's Fred Pleitgen has the details.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voiceover): Stark images from what many believe to be the second strongest military in the world. This video posted on social media purports to show new Russian recruits camped out in the snow and cold with little more than tarps for shelter, some trying to warm up by fires. CNN cannot independently verify its authenticity, but those posting it say the soldiers even had to buy their own food to survive. Problems during training, problems on the battlefield, these recruits vent their anger at the Russian military. UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator):  We were abandoned without equipment, without everything. Where are the tanks? Where are the armored personnel carriers? Come on. Bring it or I'll come for you. PLEITGEN (voiceover):  Dilapidated barracks, horrendous sanitary conditions, poor food. The list of complaints often documented in social media posts like this runs long since Russia says it has mobilized more than 300,000 men for the war in Ukraine since September with more than 50,000 allegedly already on the battlefield, the Kremlin says. Some relatives, especially mothers, complaining about the treatment of their loved ones. This group at southwestern Russia saying their husbands and sons had been sent to the front line without adequate training or gear. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (through translator):  The commander who gave the order that our men should hold the defense ignored the decree of the supreme commander in chief that the newly mobilized should not be sent to the first line of contact. PLEITGEN (voiceover):  Even in the areas of Ukraine that Russia has annexed, mothers are taking a stand. Return students to their studies, this sign in Donetsk says. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (through translator):  Vladimir Vladimirovich, please return our children. There are many dead. Many captured. The rest of the children are physically and morally decimated. PLEITGEN (voiceover):  Soldier's mothers traditionally carry a lot of sway in Russia. And Russian president, Vladimir Putin, seems eager to show he's not tone-deaf to their plight. Recently visiting with the military says, were new recruits, even firing a sniper rifle himself. Trying to convey he cares about the new recruits. VLADIMIR PUTIN, RUSSIAN PRESIDENT (through translator):  About our country, you know, of course, we have costs. Most notably regarding losses in the special military operation. I think about it all the time. PLEITGEN (voiceover):  But many mobilized Russians and their relatives seem to feel left out in the cold after their country called them up to serve in a war that was never supposed to last this long.

Fred, when is Vladimir Putin expected to meet with these mothers and what's he hoping to achieve.PLEITGEN (on camera):  Hi, there Bianca. Well, the latest information that we have is that it's going to be on Friday that he's going to meet with these -- with the mothers. And it was interesting because the spokesman for the Kremlin, Dmitry Peskov, he came out yesterday and confirmed that such a meeting would take place. He says that such meetings are often on the agenda of the president and that he likes to keep up to date with what's really going on on the ground with Russia's, what they call, the special military operation. Obviously, that war effort in Ukraine. What's happened since then though is that some mother's organizations have come out and said that they haven't been invited to such a meeting. Especially one mother's organization that's been fairly critical of some of the things that have been going on that have called for their men to have better conditions on the battlefield, but of course, in training as well. And they say, so far, they've not received an invitation to that. And certainly, something that has made some of these mother's organizations quite angry. And it really is something that is quite important here in Russia, guys. The mothers carry a lot of sway traditionally, not just since what has been going on in Ukraine, but also really over the decades. They've been extremely important as far as Russian public opinion is concerned. And also, one of the things that's happening this weekend is on Sunday, it's Mother's Day here in Russia which is also a gigantic event here in this country. So, it's definitely something the Kremlin is watching out for. But there is some criticism that certainly is surfacing as well, guys.",
