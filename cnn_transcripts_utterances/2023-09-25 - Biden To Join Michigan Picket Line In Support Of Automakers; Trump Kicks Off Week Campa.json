But you have to keep in mind that this is a president who very frequently describes himself as being pro-union.And clearly, a decision was made here at the White House that it wasn't enough for the President to just talk about the fact that he is supportive of these auto workers. And just as a political matter, this is a story, Manu, that sort of touches on everything. There is, of course, sort of the political power of the unions. Remember, the UAW did endorse President Biden back in 2020, but they have yet to endorse him in his 2024 reelection bid. There's also the policy piece of this as well. Remember, there are serious disagreements that we have seen between these auto workers and the administration, particularly when it comes to the decision by the administration to invest billions of dollars in electric vehicles and whether that is ultimately going to be bad for these auto workers. And then, of course, there is the political piece of this, including the fact that former President Donald Trump, he is going to be making an appearance in Detroit on Wednesday. So we are about to see sort of this fascinating back to back split screen that has huge ramifications politically, even if White House officials and allies of the President have been saying for days that this actually has nothing to do with politics, Manu.",

The White House has not seen any sort of favorable movement on the economy. This is something that the president has been talking about a lot all the time, on immigration. There is deep concern and there is a deep sense of angst in country. And also in these polls, a strong sense of concern about his age, a strong lack of enthusiasm among Democratic voters compared to Republicans.

And I actually think age, as much as the economy, has a lot to do with it. It's true younger voters don't turn out in the same share that older voters do, but it is an essential block for Biden.
