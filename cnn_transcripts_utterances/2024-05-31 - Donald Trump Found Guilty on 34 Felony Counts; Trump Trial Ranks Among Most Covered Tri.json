Trump is also the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, which means he could also become the first convicted felon to be U.S. president. There is nothing in the the U.S. Constitution preventing him from running, and potentially winning, the White House. After less than 12 hours of deliberation -- deliberation over two days, a Manhattan jury of seven men and five women returned guilty verdicts on all 34 counts of falsifying business records to cover up hush money payments to a porn star, Stormy Daniels, ahead of the 2016 election. Trump is now facing up to 20 years in jail. While that seems unlikely, sentencing is set for July 11 and will be decided by the trial judge, Juan Merchan. Trump's lawyers have been planning an appeal almost since the trial began and say they will go all the way to the Supreme Court, if necessary. In the meantime, convicted felon Donald Trump remains a free man, apparently in good spirits, and ready to fight. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

He's out there proclaiming that -- that this was a travesty. It's the opposite of contrition. All of those factors, together with the ones you point to, will be taken into account at the sentencing. I think there's a substantial but not certain chance that the judge gives him a custodial sentence of about somewhere in the six months' range.
