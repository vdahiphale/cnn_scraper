      "sentences": "Well, Omar, we did hear him weigh in on the side of Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy this weekend, defending the H-1B visa program. As you mentioned, the program that allows highly skilled foreign workers to come and work in the United States.This is what he told \"The New York Post\" over the weekend. He said, quote, \"I've always liked the visas. I have always been in favor of the visas. That's why we have them.\" He went on to say, \"I have many H-1B visas on my properties. I've been a believer in H-1B. I've used it many times. It's a great program.\" Now, just to be clear here, Donald Trump is talking about H-1B visas, obviously, in this quote. But our colleagues actually dug into the data with the Department of Labor and found that most of the foreign workers at Donald Trump's properties are here with H-2B visas. Those are, you know, allow for jobs like landscaping and hospitality. But all to say, the reason this is so notable is because one, as you mentioned, this issue over H-1B visas and whether or not there should be more highly skilled foreign workers in this country, as Elon Musk has been calling for, is something that has really caused a massive rift among his supporters. On the one hand, you have the MAGA faithful who many of them attracted to Donald Trump because of his hardline immigration policies. And then you have some of the, you know, Silicon Valley latecomers to this, people like Elon Musk, but also David Sacks, a venture capitalists in California who liked Donald Trump and supported him this past election cycle, but also rely on these H-1B visas to bring these foreign workers for their businesses and their companies. Now, what's also interesting about this is that Donald Trump has not always been supportive of the H-1B visa program. I'd remind you that back during his first administration, he actually signed an executive order that limited the H-1B visa program and also you - the visa program saw a decline during his first term. He also ran on a platform in 2016 where he argued that American companies should be prioritizing American workers, not foreign workers, all to say Donald Trump is now coming in on the side of Elon Musk on this issue. Still unclear, though, what any sort of policy around this could be once he's actually in office. Omar.",

      "sentences": "Welcome back.Some health experts are raising red flags as U.S. bird flu infections in humans climb past 65, warning that America's sluggish response is setting the stage for a potential pandemic. Now, the CDC is pushing back against claims it's not testing enough to maintain control of the virus. Joining us now is Dr. Leana Wen, contributing columnist for \"The Washington Post\" and former Baltimore health commissioner as well. I mean, Dr. Wen, I just want to start with, I mean, should there be a more aggressive response from the CDC here? DR. LEANA WEN, FORMER HEALTH COMMISSIONER, CITY OF BALTIMORE: Yes, there should be a more aggressive response, especially when it comes to testing. One of the lessons that we should have learned from Covid is that just because we aren't testing doesn't mean that the cases aren't there. And, in fact, the CDC has data itself that should be alarming. There was a study published recently that found that 7 percent of farm workers in farms where there are active infections in animals had evidence of recent infection of the bird flu themselves. But none of these individuals tested positive for bird flu or were even tested for bird flu during their infection. Half of them reported having some kind of symptoms. Half of them said they did not have symptoms. So that illustrates that potentially we could have many more infections than we know of among farm workers. It also indicates that there may be some people who are asymptomatic. Now, we don't know that these people are asymptomatic and spreading bird flu. There has been no documented human to human transmission in the U.S. yet. But that said, we are not doing nearly enough testing to understand the extent of the spread of bird flu. And what we need is rapid tests. These are not impossible to do. We have rapid flu tests available. We now - we know that there's the ability to get rapid covid tests rapidly distributed, and we should be able to have these rapid home tests available to farm workers for their families and for the clinicians and health care providers taking care of these individuals so that those people can protect themselves and figure out what's going on with the patients and the individuals they're around, but also so that the U.S. can have a better handle on the total number of cases.",

She said that, \"we kind of have our head in the sand about how widespread this is.\" Specifically, she was talking about animal to human transmission there. But I wonder if you agree with that assessment, but also what lessons can be learned from how the Trump administration handled Covid to what we what we could be doing essentially here?",

And by the time there was rapid testing and more accessible testing, we were finding that there were far more cases.Also, we did not know about asymptomatic transmission of Covid early on. And I think that there is a lot about the bird flu and how it's mutating that we don't know about this time around, too.

And one of those signs is the fact that we have - we have an individual in Louisiana who is severely ill. There is a strain isolated from the individual that shows that there are mutations such that the virus may be more transmissible in humans. Normally, avian flu virus does not attach well to human airway receptors, but there are mutations that seem to render it to be more capable of attaching to airway receptors and more able to be transmitted.I think unless we're doing a lot more testing to pick up on who has the virus and therefore what mutations they have, we really don't have a good handle on what's happening. And you mentioned that we're in flu season. We're in a period where we have the regular flu. In addition, we may now have bird flu as well. And the really frightening scenario is if a single person contracts both avian flu and seasonal flu, in that case, the viruses could exchange genomes and we could have a mutant virus that is more dangerous because it spreads more easily among people.",
