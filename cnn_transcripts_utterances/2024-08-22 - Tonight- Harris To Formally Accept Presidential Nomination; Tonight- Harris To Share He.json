We know that she is going to make a forceful case against former President Donald Trump, talk about how he is a threat to democracy, talk about Project 2025, that conservative policy proposal.We also know that she is going to lean heavily into her personal biography, talk about growing up, the product of a single mother. You know, she is going to use her personal story to really illustrate that she understands what it's like to be working class and try to connect with working class voters. And, Brianna, I will leave you with this: this is going to be a history-making night. It's a big moment for black women in politics. They say, race aside, that she is eminently qualified for this time, this position.

Where does she plan to take this country? There's, as you know, polls are saying there's a sizable number of people who don't yet know who Kamala Harris is. So this is the moment for her to say that and to lay that out through her own - out of her own mouth, in a way that only she can. And I expect that she'll show the Kamala Harris that I've seen in those rooms, in the White House. And that is someone who has a heart and a compassion for people, the plight of people, understanding their circumstances. She is of them, from - coming from a middle class, worked her way through college.

I just came from Michigan. I'm going to Wisconsin. I'm looking at what's happening in Washington State. What I can tell you is, there are more - these are indicators for me. More people who have contributed to the campaign who have never contributed before. I'm not as interested in the people. I mean, I'm interested. I care about them.

More voter - new voter registrations, 83 percent of those, even in the first 48 hours, I think it was 36,000 new voter registrations, came from people between the ages of 18 and 34. I was at a young voters conference, you know, campus organizers from across the country, 300 of them.

I do think there's an opening. I do think those conversations have to continue. And I think we have to make sure that that empathy that the Vice President has shown does translate into action, because even today, there are 40,000 Palestinians who have been killed in Gaza, and we need to make sure that the pain of Palestinian Americans who are voting in this election, who have lost dozens of family members, is surfaced to the level where the American people can respond to that pain in the same way that we all responded to the heartbreaking pain of the American hostage families who are waiting for their loved ones to come home. This is, I think, very, very important for the Harris campaign. And I hope to continue to push for that unity, because at the end of the day, as I've said to so many people, perfection is rarely on the ballot, but real progress always is. And this is a moment where we can work with the Vice President. She has said so many things that are important to making the Palestinian American community, but not only. I mean, labor unions care about this. The black community cares about this. We care about making sure that we implement our domestic human rights laws, our domestic laws, our international humanitarian laws.

They're more likely to go with Trump because any of these folks who were backing Kennedy before that were on the edge about Joe Biden, well, they came over in the last 10 to 20 days when Kamala Harris became the Democratic nominee.",
