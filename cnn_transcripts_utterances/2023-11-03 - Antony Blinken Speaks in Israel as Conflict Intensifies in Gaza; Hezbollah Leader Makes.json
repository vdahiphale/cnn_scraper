Nasrallah has been quiet since the Hamas terror attack on Israel onOctober 7th. This will be his first major speech to the world since then. Hezbollah, the militia group that the United States considers a terror organization, has estimates of somewhere around 150,000 rockets inside Lebanon, high-technology, very accurate, that they could shoot into Israel at any moment if Nasrallah decides he wants to escalate this conflict. The Israel Defense Forces say they are on very, very high alert this morning listening to this speech from Nasrallah. We'll bring you details as soon as we get them. We have our teams everywhere around the world standing by. Inside Lebanon, in Tel Aviv, in northern Israel, at the Pentagon. Let's go first to Tel Aviv. CNN's Ed Lavandera is there -- Ed.",

And it is also going to focus on getting aid into Gaza, getting additional fuel, supplies, medical equipment to the Palestinians, obviously at a moment when they really, really need it. And so the Biden administration behind the scenes in conversations with their Israeli counterparts over the last few weeks, they have told them that their military objectives in Gaza are going to become increasingly difficult to achieve as the world watches the kind of destruction that is being wrought on everyday civilians who are in the Gaza Strip. And some presidential advisers close to Biden believe that it is only a matter of weeks and not months until it becomes increasingly untenable for the administration to rebuff calls for a broader ceasefire. Now, it remains unclear at this point just what Israel is willing to agree to when it comes to some kind of humanitarian pause because they have said that a ceasefire is off the table at the moment, but will they agree to some kind of a pause in hostilities for a few hours, a few days, to get the hostages out and to allow civilians to leave Gaza? That remains to be seen, but it is certainly something that Blinken is going to be pushing with his Israeli counterparts according to sources familiar with what he's planning.",

And General Clark, we do know that Israeli troops, they say they have now moved in from three directions and have largely encircled Gaza City here. What will they be doing? What does this encirclement allow the Israeli troops to now do? GEN. WESLEY CLARK (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST: Well, this is a pretty logical move, actually, John. They're going to -- if they encircle it they cut off the retreat of Hamas, provided they can get into the tunnels. They also can hold the hostages, if there are hostages there and keep them from being shipped out. It's a logical thing to do. Surround it, clear it on the inside, it's the right military strategy. You don't try to eat the elephant in one bite. But it also has a potential political-diplomatic dimension because if they focus on the center of resistance in Gaza, maybe that opens the opportunity to give a pause in the operations in southern Gaza. Maybe it's a pause that's not a real pause, they still reserve the right to defend themselves, to attack high-valued targets, but it might be spun diplomatically in a way that takes some of the pressure off the United States and Israel for the welfare of the Palestinian population there. So it's a logical military move with diplomatic consequences or opportunities, let's say.",

I don't know if you can see this, General Clark, but I'll just describe it to you. That almost all of the drone activity published in \"The Times\" today, the U.S. drone activity is over southern Gaza.

Continuation in industries like health care, they added 58,000 jobs, government added 51,000 jobs.What might be happening here in government is we might be seeing teachers returning to work, right, returning for the school year. So we might be seeing that. In terms of what this means broadly speaking a few ways we can think about it. What it means for the average American worker, it's a sign that the labor market is cooling but still strong, right. In terms of the Fed, there are a few things here that I think the Fed will actually welcome. One, the cooler job growth just to sort of create a bit more balance in the labor force in terms of the supply of workers and the supply of jobs, and so creating a bit more balance there, but also wages. Wages moderated. And that's something we've been watching very closely because of its potential impact on inflation. And so both on a monthly and an annual basis we saw wages cool. And on an annual basis, Kate, we saw actual cooling of annual wage growth of 4.1 percent. That's a slowest annual growth we've seen in two years.

Now here we are a year and change later he's been indicted on four things, none of them relating to this particular fraud. If he takes the Fifth he protects himself against any of those cases roaring back to life. It's possible he takes the stand. He says something that piques prosecutors' interest. They go, oh, maybe we should reopen a potential criminal case on him for fraud.
