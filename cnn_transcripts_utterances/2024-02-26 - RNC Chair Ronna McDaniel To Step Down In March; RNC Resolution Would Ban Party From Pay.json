And at least until we have a presumptive nominee. Michael, I like Michael Whatley. I know him well. I don't know Lara Trump, but as I say, they're both going to get elected. I don't think there's any real question about that, Dana. BASH: Henry, you mentioned the pair of resolutions that you're pushing inside the Republican National Committee. One was pledged for neutrality, the other one would bar the RNC from paying any of Donald Trump's legal fees. Lara Trump, who we were just talking to has not surprisingly suggested that she will be open to the committee paying her father-in-law's legal bills.
