He is, however sending a delegation here to Doha to continue negotiations for a ceasefire. Now, we know that the Mossad director, David Barnea will be here, we believe to have talks on Monday, according to a diplomat familiar with those talks with Qatari and Egyptian mediators.Now, there were meetings on Sunday in Israel. There was a war cabinet meeting where they decided the parameters of how far that mediation could go and what could be agreed to. We've heard from a Hamas senior leader saying that they believe that the proposal they have come up with is logical and that the ball is now in Israel's court. Now, we know last Thursday, Hamas said that their proposal was they wanted between 701,000 Palestinian prisoners to be released in return for all female prisoners, including IDF soldiers, and also potentially the elderly, the weak or the wounded hostages, assumed to be around 40. Although there's no definitive figure on that at this point. The sticking point comes after this phase, one, when Hamas has proposed that Israel fully pull out of Gaza militarily, and also there is a permanent ceasefire. We have heard consistently from Israel that that is not what they want to do that even if there is a temporary ceasefire, they are still determined to launch this offensive in Rafah, which we heard once again on Sunday from the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, saying that that offensive would take in all a matter of weeks. Back on Friday of last week, he approved the military and the evacuation plan for some 1.5 million Palestinians sheltering in Rafah in the south of Gaza. Although there's no timeframe for when it will happen. There is huge resistance to this plan, including from the main ally, the United States, the head of the World Health Organization, saying they are gravely concerned that this offensive could go ahead.

MIDDLE EAST NEGOTIATOR: I think that it's hard to know what's going to come first, although a grand campaign and Rafah is certainly not an imminent, we're probably weeks away. I think the administration is hope that sometime in the next several weeks, the Israel Hamas hostage for prisoner exchange, and for 45 days of common temporary ceasefire will somehow take hold. If that happens, I think the Rafah campaign will at a minimum be delayed, and perhaps it won't occur at all. I must say, though, that Mr. Netanyahu is not alone here, when it comes to wanting to continue Israel's grand campaign against the four remaining Hamas battalions in Rafah, I think, large majority of Israeli public, including that against the perhaps the putative successor to Mr. Netanyahu. He's also in favor of that campaign. So that's a tough issue on which the administration should choose. He's going to take on more than Mr. Netanyahu is going to take on I think the vast majority of Israelis think the administration would be much more inclined if they're going to use pressure to use pressure in order to get Hamas and Israel to do a deal.

Specifically a big American diplomatic and military delegation went to Niger last week to try and warm up these relations between the U.S. and the military junta there.They've always operated in one condition. That they are willing to continue cooperating with the military junta there, as long as they commit to a path to return the civilians rule in the country, which is not something that Russians have committed to. And U.S. officials now, telling CNN that they had a very tense meeting with the military junta in Niger, especially about the growing Russian military presence in the country. In January, the Russian defense ministry said that Russia and Niger were expanding the military ties. And right now, it appears that this is really the center of this controversy because the Russians operate in a way that the U.S. cannot. After the U.S. designated this as a coup, it is legally limited in what kind of cooperation or aid it can offer to the military leadership in Niger. Russia does not have the same kind of restrictions. And at same time, Russia can sell weapons and any other equipment to Niger much faster without the same kind of restrictions on you must respect human rights, you must go back to a democratic transition and democratic rule and all of that. And so that really is what the Niger military leadership does not appreciate. They said that they'll being lectured. In fact, after that, in a statement announcing the revocation of their long-standing military cooperation, this has been going on for almost ten years, they said that the U.S. had been condescending to them and threatening consequences which they don't appreciate. But here's the context. General Michael Langley, who commands the U.S. Africa Command warned Congress earlier this year that Russia is trying to take over the entire region called the Sahel. And he also said this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GEN. MICHAEL LANGLEY, U.S.-AFRICA COMMAND: I would say the Russian Federation's narrative drowned out the U.S. government's in the past years. They were accelerated. The Russian Federation, not just through Wagner stoked a lot of the instability across the Sahel. They did this through misinformation, disinformation campaigns. So I see or how we work could not double-down in our efforts is through our own information campaign, but (INAUDIBLE) our assurance efforts. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Let's show you how it all went down. Manchester United and their manager Erik Ten Hag are under a lot of pressure this season, but they made a brilliant start. Ahead after just ten minutes through Scott Mctominay (ph) but Liverpool wanted this one badly too, and they were soon level through Alexis Mac Allister. Remember their manager, Jurgen Klopp is leaving at the end of the season and the Reds want to win four trophies before he goes. So thank you, (INAUDIBLE). Liverpool 2-1 up at halftime. And they were just three minutes away from winning it. But United equalized through Anthony delighting a packed old Trafford Stadium. Liverpool were stunned. United, by the way, could have won it with the last kick of a game, but Marcus Rashford missed a huge chance. And he would have been ruing that in extra time when Liverpool regained the lead through young star Harvey Elliott. But Rashford then made amends for his earlier miss, leveling the game at three-all. And at this point, it seemed as though a penalty (INAUDIBLE) would have to settle it. But in the 121st minute of a pulsating game, United youngster, Amad Diallo scored the most sensational winner. And to put an exclamation point on the whole thing, he was booked for taking off his shirt in celebration, a second yellow card for which he was sent off. He won't care. It was a perfect mike drop to the most incredible win. So here is the semifinal draw. Manchester United will be thrilled with their next opponents. They've got Coventry City, that's a team from the division below the Premier League. Elsewhere though, Chelsea have a really tough draw against Manchester City -- can't wait for those games -- coming up in April. Back to you. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
