And so that's also an important dynamic to keep in mind here.As President Biden has been touting his pro-union bona fides, I mean, I think the point of the rail strike, it is a different authority. It's a different situation, but you can't minimize the impact that that has had on the membership and some of the unease that exists with some of these unions, the concern that Biden could somehow choose to intervene again here. So that's certainly influencing things. And, you know, as I've been talking to people over the last week about this very issue, you know, it's a question of why is this all happening now?

They need more black voters in order to be able to effectuate the black political power in that state. So 40 percent is simply insufficient. It is a direct violation of the Supreme Court's order. It is transgressive behavior by the state of Alabama in a way that we've seen historically.

Do they vote in a way that works to cancel the strength of black voters? And we know that that is the case and has been the case historically in Alabama. So we need a stronger district for black voters in order for them to elect candidates of their choice, which is what is required under the Voting Rights Act of 1965. This is a mandate by civil rights laws to make sure that there's fairness in our systems that black voters and other voters who have been historically discriminated against have an opportunity to have representatives who will speak to their interests and give voice to their concerns.

I mean, look, a lot of these members are already in pretty safe district. So it's not going to really have much of an impact. The Republican leadership stays out of Republican and Republican primaries on the House side. So it may not have that much of an impact.

I talked to his predecessor, Nancy Pelosi, about the notion of having those votes. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. NANCY PELOSI (D), FORMER HOUSE SPEAKER: Kevin is, you know, playing politics. It's not even clear if he constitutionally can expunge those things. If he wants to put his members on the spot, his members in difficult races on the spot, that's a decision he has to make.

So, you know, we'll see if they can get. But I guess the bottom line is that the incentive structure is designed to continue to facilitate what we're seeing now.

We reported last week that the club is putting money behind Alex Mooney in West Virginia. He's up against a Republican backed candidate in that Senate race. They may put money against behind Matt Rosenthal if he jumps into Montana, against a Republican leadership backed candidate in that race.

The meetings that they're having are budget meetings. They are talking about scheduling, where they're going to go next. And when I spent the weekend talking to different advisers on the phone, they were much more interested in talking about the negative DeSantis coverage. They were amped up rather than talking about any of this legal stuff. And when it comes to that, they say they have a playbook down. This has already happened twice. There've been two indictments. They expect likely two more indictments, including the one that we're discussing now in January 6th, the federal indictment and the Jack Smith special counsel probe. So they are just working from that. The fund raising, the political instigating with his base trying to rile them up. But again, they still are running a third presidential campaign.
