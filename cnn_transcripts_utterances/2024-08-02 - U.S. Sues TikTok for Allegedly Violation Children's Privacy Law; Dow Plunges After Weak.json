That's way below expectations.At the same time, the unemployment rate climbed to 4.3 percent. We have CNN economics and political commentator and \"Washington Post\" columnist Catherine Rampell with us on this. All right, you're looking at the job market slowing. And let's talk about how this is playing out politically. Trump's campaign is hitting on, with a tweet we saw, foreign born versus native born employment numbers. If you could just explain the difference here and who's included in each group, because it seems like he's kind of, or his campaign is pitting Americans born abroad against Americans born in the U.S.",

      "sentences": "Yes, there are a few things that I would point out here. One is that the data that they're referring to for foreign born Americans, about half of those people are actually U.S. citizens. About half of the foreigners or foreign born people in the United States, immigrants in the United States, are actually citizens at this point.The vast majority of immigrants are also here. If they're not citizens, they're here illegally. It's a very small share who are undocumented, especially undocumented, without permission to work and stay here. So, you know, not including DACA and things like that. So that's point number one. Point number two is that if you don't want immigrant workers here, then probably tell your grandma she can never retire. Because the reason why we've had so much job growth among the foreign born population is that the native born population in the United States is disproportionately older and retiring. So if you are a native born younger worker in the U.S., it's actually not that hard to get a job. There just aren't enough of you in order to fill all of the jobs that are being vacated by boomers, essentially. So you need working age immigrants to kind of fill the gaps.",

      "timeStamp": "15:40:00",
      "speaker": "RAMPELL",
      "sentences": "Exactly. Yes, it's not a zero-sum game. So the fact that immigrants, foreign born workers, are getting jobs does not mean that they are getting them at the expense of native born workers. In fact, native born workers have lower unemployment rates than foreign born ones.And again, that's because if you are a native born American, as I am, there are a lot of job opportunities for you. But the population is aging. I mentioned boomers are retiring. It's not only that, it's also that fertility rates in the United States have been low for a really long time. So we're not replacing the retiring native born workers with the same number of younger new entrants to the labor force who are also born here. And so there are a lot of jobs that would be going begging if you only had the population of people who were born here in the labor force. Immigrants tend to be younger. They're much more likely to be working age. The people coming here are often coming here in part because they want the economic opportunities here. So they're not taking jobs away from native born Americans. In fact, they're taking jobs that would probably otherwise be going begging, particularly in industries with major labor shortages, things like construction, agriculture, health care, etcetera.",

I think one of the things that we noticed was that he walked back a little bit of the finger pointing with respect to state and local authorities up there in Butler.I think he's also got a series of issues here now that he's got to regain the confidence of his workforce. I think the men and women of the Secret Service are getting a little bit restless with respect to some either real or perceived lack of leadership here and a lack of asset and personnel allocation for these events. So he's got a little bit of more work to do and getting that message out to his troops and to the American people.",

If for some reason assets were cut or were not allocated in certain areas, then the Secret Service is going to have to stand up and tell Congress or whoever why they did what they did. They need to articulate the reasons behind the decisions that were made.I think as we move into the homestretch of the campaign, I think you're going to see every asset available that's in headquarters of the Secret Service or in and around the field. Every asset is going to be utilized now. There is not going to be the cutting or the scrutiny of various assets sent out. Everything that the Secret Service has now is going to be out and in play because the eyes of the world are going to be on the Secret Service as we move into the Democratic convention. We have the U.N. in New York every year that we take care of all the foreign heads of state that come in. And then you've got the homestretch to November. So the Secret Service has to make sure that it is rebooting and reworking itself to make sure that it's dotting all of its I's and crossing its T's and spending extra time on that communication factor, because I'm still very concerned about why that information on the ground there didn't get to where it needed to get to.",
