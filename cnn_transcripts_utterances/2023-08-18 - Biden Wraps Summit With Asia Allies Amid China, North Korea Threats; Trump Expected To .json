We'll have an update on Trump's legal and political moves, including a snub of the first Republican presidential debate. And some U.S. officials are now raising concerns about Ukraine's ramped up attacks in Russian-occupied Crimea, fearing that Kyiv's forces are stretched too thin. I'll be getting reaction from the Ukrainian ambassador to the United States. She joins us live this hour. Welcome to our viewers here in the United States and all around the world. Wolf Blitzer is off today. I'm Alex Marquardt, and you're in THE SITUATION ROOM.

CNN's Paula Hancocks is standing by in Seoul. First, let's get straight to CNN's Arlette Saenz who is at Camp David. So, Arlette, what came out of this summit?",

North Korea continues to produce missiles and nuclear material. China is not using the economic leverage it has.Again, China is not happy about this, but this is, in some ways, the inevitable result of Chinese foreign policy, whether it's in the South China Sea, whether it's the pressure on Taiwan, whether it's military buildup. Of course, neighboring countries are going to respond. What's interesting here is that Japan is taking a much more forward- leaning position when it comes to regional security, and it's a real act of diplomacy or statesmanship that Japan and South Korea have come this close together and the United States deserves credit for helping to orchestrate this.

President Trump when he was in the Oval Office, threatened to withdraw U.S. forces from South Korea.

Thank you both for joining us this evening. Michael, I want to start with you. We know that the former president's team is negotiating with Georgia officials about when and how he's going to surrender. We're expecting that next Thursday or Friday. So, what issues are they trying to hammer out right now? MICHAEL MOORE, FORMER U.S. ATTORNEY:  Yes. There will be general issues about whether or not he'll be fingerprinted, whether or not he's going to have a mug shot taken. They'll be talking about, as Sara mentioned, the terms of release so that he can have a relatively smooth move through the jail system, the Fulton County Jail. And I really think you have to just start with acknowledging this is different because you're talking about a former president. So, there has to be security considerations there that you wouldn't have for other defendants, there has to be sort of timing that you wouldn't have when you talk about other defendants coming in, and so this is really just how the mechanism will work. This is different than a federal court case because you don't have a situation where they immediately go in front of a judge and there's a big discussion about the charges and arraignment and all that. That's scheduled for a later time. This is really just about being processed, having that initial information taken and having them released on some type of bond or --",

So, they've got witnesses to talk to, they've got documents to look at, they've got metadata to go back and scour as well. This is not a small effort. So, we may, as people have been sort of watched this and listened to it for a long time, think this is a fairly simple matter. It's not as you're preparing for case of this magnitude.

It doesn't mean that he's going to be the nominee, but it means he has the biggest chance out of all of them there that he will be the nominee regardless of what happens. And what's interesting, as Alice says, that, you know, Donald Trump not going to this debate is giving the middle finger to Republican voters. The Republican voters, a vast majority of them, will take that middle finger and will take the nine other fingers that Donald Trump has as well. That's how much they love him and support him and will do everything they can so that he continues to be at the forefront. And right now, it seems like every other candidate has their hands tied behind their backs because they don't know what to do. Mike Pence says, watch and learn. The only thing we've learned is that nothing that he does or nothing anyone else done has been effective.",

We heard Chris Christie then say that if what he's going to do is defend Donald Trump, then he should just drop out of the race and endorse him. Why would DeSantis even consider defending the frontrunner, the man who's just ahead of him in the polls?[18:35:00] STEWART:  Well, one answer is the base. He wants to -- as all of the candidates do, they want the base to look at them in a light that if Donald Trump falls off the radar, which is unlikely, but they want to ingratiate the base, and they also want to broaden the base. Look, here's the thing. We know Chris Christie has every single quiver in his arrow pointed at Donald Trump. He is going to fire all cylinders on Donald Trump. And the key is, for all the candidates, they also must spread the wealth and attack Donald Trump. Because the only way you get to Joe Biden is through Donald Trump. But, clearly, the memo here was when you see Christie spend every ounce of his energy going after the president, it wouldn't hurt if you show the base that you have Donald Trump's back on occasion.",

      "sentences": "Alex, I think it's important to point out many western officials you speak to consider Crimea to become of a red line, a hot button issue for Vladimir Putin. They are worried that if he felt like he might lose the peninsula, that they essentially annexed without really firing a shot in 2014, that that might lead the Kremlin to act extremely irrationally.Now, there's no real evidence at that point to suggest but people need to be deeply concerned about that, but that may be behind some of the thinking that Ukraine, in western officials' perception, should concentrate less on Crimea and more on the southern counteroffensive. But, frankly, watching how these two areas feed each other, it seems muddled thinking. It's clear Russia has a lot of assets in Crimea that are fed by that Kerch Bridge running through the Russian mainland, and that much of that is transferred up further to the northeast to assist Russian troops defending that long land corridor that runs to Crimea from the Russian mainland. That is the main target at this point of Ukraine's forces. And so when we see bridges, ammo, depots, roads, military infrastructure railways being taken out by targeted strikes by Ukrainians, it's likely that it's going to have a huge impact on what Russia can do to defend those positions around in the Zaporizhzhia front near where I'm standing. So, I think we might be seeing more of a reflection of western officials being worried that Crimea will be a flashpoint down the line if Ukraine, in an ideal world, were able to push their forces down and threaten Russia's presence there, but right now, where Ukraine do appear to be hitting infrastructure there to assist their the counteroffensive in the south. Some suggestions, too, by the way, today that the F-16 program utterly vital for Ukraine's moves in the south here, they need air superiority over the Russians to move faster. That might be getting traction after the public hullabaloo over the last 48 hours or so when you Ukraine said they wouldn't get the jets this year. Well, Denmark saying, yes, we can start training in the next ten days maybe, or so, the Netherlands behind it as well, the Americans clear they will supply the jets, but this could take months still. They may not see them in Ukraine until next year, and that's a real sore problem for Ukrainian troops dying every day on that southern front facing Russian air superiority. Alex?",

And they have said a number of times that they have sham referendums and adding Zaporizhzhia and other oblasts to Russian Federation, which is as illegal as aid in Crimea there would be a red line. And that did not stop us from liberating our land because we all know that it's all Ukraine. But also they did not lead to anything on Russia part in addition to the war crimes they already commit since 2014 and since February 24th. So, we just have to stay focused on what we need to do. We need to restore territorial integrity and we need to defend Ukraine and liberate all Ukrainians.

They're already talking about rebuilding. They should be at the table since Native Hawaiians kind of own the table. And then there is a transparency law in Hawaii.
