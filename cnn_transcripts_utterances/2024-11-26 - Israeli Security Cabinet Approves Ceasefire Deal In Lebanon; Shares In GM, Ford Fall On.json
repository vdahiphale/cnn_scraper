But this one managing to come together in a way that that one has not. And ultimately, it is because the two parties in the north, Israel and Lebanon, were willing to take a pause. The two parties in the south, Israel and Gaza and Hamas and Gaza, not ready to come to that sort of agreement. Now, one can influence the other, though, right because they were -- because Hamas and Hezbollah deliberately connected those two wars. Hezbollah launching this larger assault on Northern Israel in the wake of October 7th. Now they're split and I think one can reasonably argue that Hamas is in a weaker position because it doesn't have that pressure applied by its ally in the north.",

These tariffs can be avoided if the countries involved crack down on the flow of migrants, in the case of Mexico and Canada, and illegal drugs for all three.

But that's not the point, right? The point is, what is the negotiating tactic here? And as I said Canada taking a completely different approach and one that may remain controversial, is whether or not, despite the fact that there is a little bit, you know, about two years left on this current trade deal between Mexico, Canada, and the United States, do you just say bye-bye, Mexico Canada, the US, we are negotiating our own deal and we will see what kind of terms we can come to and Canada and Mexico can negotiate their own afterwards. The one change here, Richard, which I really want to make clear from speaking both to business leaders in Canada, people in the government of Mr. Trudeau, but also to Trump aides after he won that this is different.

TRAVERS-WOLF: Yes, absolutely. So I think it needs to be a two-pronged approach. Absolutely education needs to start as early as possible with young people and have that really go through their entire education to set them up to enter this world of social media but we also need greater regulation on the companies themselves.",
