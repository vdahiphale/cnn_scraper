      "sentences": "Yes, well, just to take you through the last 48 hours, the president had a meeting with his national security team on this specific topic yesterday at the White House.And heading into that meeting, he made some pretty blunt and interesting remarks. He was asked if Netanyahu is doing enough to get to a deal, and he simply said no. He wouldn't expand on those comments when asked about them later in the day by our colleagues, simply saying that we are in the middle of negotiations, and he said he was referring to the ongoing negotiations between the U.S., Qatar and Egypt to try and come up with some sort of proposal to put on the table, of course, that then Israel and Hamas could review. Now, we do know, however, privately -- we have reported this time and time again -- there have been frustrations with Netanyahu. And those frustrations within the U.S. government grew yesterday after speech that Jeremy detailed for you, which in part Netanyahu said that Israel would never leave, could not ever leave the Philadelphi Corridor. We know that remains a sticking point in these ongoing negotiations to get a hostage deal and a cease-fire agreement in place. So we have heard from U.S. officials that they're working on a final proposal to put on the table here to both sides, Hamas and Israel. But we also just heard from the NSC's John Kirby, saying he wouldn't use the term final. And it's hard to imagine that U.S. officials would put a final proposal on the table and back away, particularly when there are still American hostages who are part of those 68 hostages still believed to be alive held by Hamas. So where we are now is U.S. officials say that the murder of those six hostages over the weekend does underscore the urgency that has existed for some time, for months now, to try and get a deal in place. But what's unclear is how they actually translate that urgency into action to getting a deal done, particularly after the speech from the prime minister just yesterday when he was speaking with reporters -- guys.",

And they have got a lot of strategic priorities here, but the most important one in the view of the defense minister, Defense Minister Gallant, is get the hostages back. The most important one for the prime minister is make sure that you cut off that corridor from being a supply of new weaponry to Hamas. But there's politics involved as well. And many in the administration, the Biden administration, have suspected all along that Bibi Netanyahu is stretching this out because he knows that the minute that the hostages are released and a cease-fire is declared, that's the start of the investigations into how October 7 happened. It's the start of the investigations into why the Israeli Defense Force was caught flat-footed and responded so slowly. And it's probably the end of his time as prime minister. So these two are intertwined. Hamas has been a big element of this too. Let's remember one of the reasons we're having a problem right now and coming up with a final deal is, they just executed six hostages, including one America.",

It's not that the border isn't important. It's not that cutting off Hamas isn't important. It's that, when you're in a situation like this, you have to set a priority to your strategic objectives. And, clearly, the Israeli government is divided on that. And from those images that we're looking at of tens of thousands of people in the streets, none of those people in the streets are in support of Hamas or the awful killings, the tragic killings over the weekend. It's just that they believe that the first priority has got to be getting the hostages back, because you never completely defeated a terror group. We never completely defeated al Qaeda. What you do is hamstring their ability to conduct an attack again.",

That advice was largely ignored. And that was the beginning of the tension that you now see between Prime Minister Netanyahu and President Biden. At this point, Netanyahu is sort of riding this out to see how the election turns out. If in two months it turns out he's dealing with Donald Trump, instead of Kamala Harris, then it's a very different situation for him, because he will be under very little pressure from Washington. And that's why everybody is sort of riding on every word Vice President Harris is uttering on this topic to see if there is any difference in what we have been hearing from the Biden administration.

Obviously, they have been saying for some time that they believe that the enthusiasm, the polling boost was all just a bounce from Kamala Harris. But when you actually started talking to them, there was a little bit of a fear. This is not a long runway. How long could this bounce potentially last? But looking at recent polling, they believe that they are ahead of where they were in 2020, particularly in those battleground states, and they are feeling a little bit of a sense of relief, like this race is settling, like it is time for them to be able to get some of their messaging out, because some of the problems that they have had is that none of Donald Trump's attacks seem to be landing when it comes to Kamala Harris. None of what they have put out there has gotten any traction, particularly as we have seen so much enthusiasm around Kamala Harris. So the hope is now, as they have seen the poll numbers kind of start to shift into a more moderate zone, they believe that this is time for the real race, where they hit the ground running. They're going to be pouring money, resources into a lot of these battleground states. I'm told, in particular, Georgia, big focus there, as well as some of these other states. We know Donald Trump has been to Pennsylvania multiple times. He's going to go back again before November, several other times. They really are starting to view this as a serious neck-and-neck campaign, and they feel like they have a little bit of breathing room, which they haven't totally felt for the last several weeks, as we have seen this acceleration of Kamala Harris.",

And when you're talking about 10,000 votes in six or seven states, you're not talking a lot of wiggle room on really specific issues.
