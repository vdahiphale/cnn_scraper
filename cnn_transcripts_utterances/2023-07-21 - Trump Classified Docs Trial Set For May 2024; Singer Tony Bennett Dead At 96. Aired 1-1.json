Today, a federal judge ordering the trial start in May of next year. A pretrial hearing is scheduled for May 14th, and then the trial kicks off later in the month.

But Cannon also rebuffed Trump's legal team's request to delay scheduling a trial date until after the 2024 election, assuming this, of course, doesn't push until after that anyways. Remember, Trump is facing a total of 37 felony counts in the classified documents case. 31 of those counts are for willful retention of national defense information. He's also charged, along with aide Walt Nauta with conspiring to obstruct justice and making false statements.And with us now is CNN senior crime and justice reporter Katelyn Polantz and political reporter for Axios Stef Kight. OK. Katelyn, let's start with you. How did the judge settle on this date? Because what we should note is, yes, it's smack dab in the middle of the political calendar but it's as the primaries wrap up and we should have a sense of who the nominees are.",

And Trump wanting not to put a date on the calendar and really to kick this even past the entirety of the general election next year.But Judge Aileen Cannon, she's saying that she doesn't want to do that because she wants to manage this proceeding. So she essentially backs the whole way back from May into now, and she set up 33 different points where there are deadlines, there are hearings, there's all kinds of process that has to take place, arguments, all kinds of things, working through the classified records in this case, that get you to that late May trial date. Now, that date in court, like most dates in court, is not set in stone. It totally could move. Trial dates do move. But this starts you at a point where you can see this busy calendar for Donald Trump. Starting with the -- in October, he has a trial in a civil lawsuit out of New York. And then in January, he's in trial three times. Now, in January, he's in trial with Eugene Carroll in that lawsuit. And then there's his first criminal trial set for March in New York, in Manhattan related to hush money payments, and then this. That's a lot of time to have to spend in court also at the time this stuff is going. And the Trump team, they do believe, according to Alayna Treene here at CNN, she's already reporting that the Trump team thinks that they may be able to kick this much longer than just May of next year.",

For years now, Trump and his allies, and conservatives across the board, have been building this narrative of corruption at the Department of Justice, of bias against Trump and against conservatives. It started in 2015 and 2016. We've seen House Republicans continue this narrative with their own investigations into the FBI, into the Department of Justice.It's something that at least their base and a certain segment of Republicans are buying. And we see it the way Trump handles these indictments. He teases it before anything happens, letting his base know what's coming. And again, pointing to this narrative, he's been sowing for a long time that he is the target of political actors at the Department of Justice. And so, I think we will certainly see him play that card over and over again.",

But we'll see how especially Republican candidates vying for the presidential nomination play this.I've spoke to some campaign sources recently who almost seem frustrated that the timing is after Super Tuesday and are trying to figure out how do they convince the American public that it's not worth their time to back Trump, that Republicans should instead find someone who is not facing trial in the middle of a campaign season.",

It's almost a year out of the box from the indictment.

He knew what human beings are capable of doing to each other. And he didn't just -- this wasn't a time where just taking part in the civil rights movement meant tweeting something. He marched from Selma to Montgomery, Alabama I think was 1965. And that was a very, very tough year. He performed at a concert in Montgomery in 1965. And I recently read that the lady, the African American lady who drove him from the concert to the airport dropped him off the airport. She was murdered later that day by the KKK. So, he was in the very belly of the beast. And he put himself in that situation in order to stand next to Sammy Davis Jr. and Harry Belfonte, and others who were performing as well. And so, yes.
