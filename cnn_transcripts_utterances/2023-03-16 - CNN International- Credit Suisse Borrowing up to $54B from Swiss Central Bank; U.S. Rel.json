Just ahead shares in embattled Bank Credit Suisse rebound after lifeline from the Swiss Central Bank more on global markets in just a moment. We are now seeing the moment when a Russian fighter jet forced down a U.S. drone over the Black Sea that dramatic footage just ahead.And today is known as My Freedom Day. The students worldwide stand up against human trafficking and modern day slavery. We begin with a liquidity lifeline for one of the world's largest banks amid growing fears over the stability of the global financial system. Shares in Credit Suisse remain up after surging at the start of trading after the Zurich based lender agreed to a $54 billion loan from the Swiss Central Bank overnight. Europe's main markets are up as well. So good news there on Wednesday, Credit Suisse shares lost more than a quarter of their value, though, in one day. Global markets have been on edge following the bank turmoil that began in the United States last week. And we're now less than 2 hours away from a decision that will likely be watched closely worldwide. And that is when the European Central Bank announces where it'll whether rather it'll increase rates. Anna is watching that more attention on this unusual because Christine Lagarde said she pretty much said she was going to increase rates. But now there's some concern that might sort of destabilize things.",

      "sentences": "Well, if we look at the issues that we've had in the banking sector, and not just in Europe, we look at Silicon Valley Bank as well in the U.S. At the root of heart, part of the problem is interest rates and what that actually means for the balance sheets of banks because they hold these really long data, government bonds, very safe assets, but of course, worth a lot less as interest rates rise.And as a result of that there is a big question as to whether they need to bolster those balance sheets. Credit Suisse also had a whole load of other issues. But at the heart of this facing the banking sector is how much further are rates going to go? And will Central Banks act have given they're seeing this huge market volatility. As you say, last meeting in February, the ECB said the Governing Council intends to raise rates by another 50 basis points in March. That's almost unheard of not just to give the forward guidance, but to really bake in just how much they're going to raise it by. At this stage, it looks like they're going to have to do something. Do they cancel a rate hike altogether? But that suggests they're not taking inflation seriously, and inflation is still very high?",

Newly released footage shows the encounter between the U.S. drone and Russian fighter jet that forced the drone into the Black Sea. Here it is. It was released today from the U.S. Military a brief part of Tuesday's encounter. The Pentagon says it lasted 30 to 40 minutes though. This is the jet coming in dumping fuel on the drone.The camera from the drone, of course, comes back again in the footage and you see the propeller there being damaged and that's what forced the drone down which all this is all from the U.S. Military point of view Russia denying its pilots acted recklessly. Natasha Bertrand is at the Pentagon with more on this. It is fascinating, isn't it? Because this was classified video, but the Pentagon pretty much saying it proves they will write on their story.",

And that has prompted these two day shifts to basically, for lack of better words drop some of the tension in the past. And that includes a dispute that dates back to World War Two, when Japan was occupying Korea and the treatment of Korean workers by the Japanese.It was a moment in time that created some very deep wounds between South Korea and Japan that impacted the emotional responses between the two countries, the economic policies between the two countries as well as politics, but because of threats from North Korea, in particular, these two nations have decided to try to resolve these issues they have. There was an agreement on this labor issue a few weeks ago, and they are moving forward and basically creating a new diplomatic era. In fact, as we heard today from the Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, that along with South Korea, the two nations will resume shuttle diplomacy to basically create a new chapter in relations. And what he means by that is that these nations who had been silent really for 12 years are going to start talking once again. We're also hearing from South Korea's President Yoon Suk Yeol \"We agreed today that people of the two countries have suffered direct or indirect damage due to the frozen bilateral relations, and agreed to restore and develop Korea-Japan relations as soon as possible. We also heard today from President Yoon saying that the nations have agreed to completely normalize its military intelligence sharing agreement with Japan showing that there is a lot at stake so certainly a feeling of optimism here and on this term of this notion of a shuttle diplomacy, Max. They hope that this will cover not only things involving the military, but also politics, economy and culture. So certainly the start of a new era at least that is the hope I hear in Tokyo for both Japan and South Korea, Max.",

They've made their way the streets around the protests that have actually ended here, just in front of the Supreme Court where police are blocking them from going onto the actual grounds of the Supreme Court.But for many of the protesters here, many of them are young, or they are academics Professors at the University. They are very fearful about what this massive judicial overhaul will do to their own futures. They're fearful about what it will do to the independence of the judiciary, their people about what it will do to the rights of minorities. To them they see this overhaul as a potential beginning of the end, some of them say, of Israeli democracy. But this judicial overhaul which will give the Israeli parliament massive new powers over the Supreme Court's building is just behind me that their supporters say that this is necessary to help rebalance the branches of government. They argued that the Supreme Court without a written constitution has essentially been meddling in the rights of the Israeli parliament to legislate. Now, as you noted, the Israeli President Isaac Hertzog last night giving an impassioned speech, laying out his own compromise proposal on these reforms, to very long list of report. But it does take in some elements from what the coalition government led by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was? But sort of softened just a little bit, but what was most interesting in his speech was how worried you can hear in his voice, he was about the state of the country. He was sworn in for the first time saying that he was afraid to say it that he was worried that the divisiveness that's been tearing the people of Israel apart over this reform could potentially lead to a civil war and that is a very frightening notion. But almost as soon as his proposals went out, the Israeli coalition government and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu essentially rejecting them saying they don't do what we need them to do. It only perpetuates the problems that they see with the judiciary. Now, the question will be what will the Prime Minister and his government do next? Will they continue to push forward at the rapid speed at which they want to push this legislation through? They want to done within the next few weeks. Or will they essentially sorry to stop to the reforms? Or will potentially come to actually a compromise with the opposition that compromise, Max, I have to say, the seeming less and less likely by the --, Max.",

But yes, I mean, to be clear, there are some pretty significant differences from 2008.Let's just start with the type of risk, for example, that SVB and Signature experience really depositors fleeing from the account into these banks, or having to sell treasuries at a loss, right, which we've talked about a lot. 2008 what we saw with a lot of these banks were just essentially sitting on bad loans, bad credit loans. Another thing that's really important in the wake of 2008, is that many of these banks are certainly the largest banks are well capitalized; they are subject to intense regulatory scrutiny. And we may perhaps see even more of that in terms of the smaller banks and the wake of what we're seeing. But Max, I think two things can be true, I think we could potentially still see some banks fall potentially. And that also doesn't necessarily mean that we are on the cusp of a global banking crisis for some of those reasons that I've already discussed.",

We don't expect this to really take hold, just because, of course, the FDIC here in the U.S. ensures almost, you know, most accounts right up to $250,000. And the average checking account, the average account in the U.S. is far less than that. So for most people, you are safe, I think what is really interesting to see, as the dust settles and when the dust settles, is? Did the messages work, right? Did the Larry Summers of the world come out and who said don't panic? Did that message really resonate? And I think we just won't fully know the answer to that until the dust is fully settled.",

When I asked experts ultimately, what will it take to create some calm and the financial community that is the one answer I hear time and time again.
