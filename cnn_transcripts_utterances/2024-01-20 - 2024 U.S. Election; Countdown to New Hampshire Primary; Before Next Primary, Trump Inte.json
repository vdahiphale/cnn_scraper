They're also beginning to focus on the man each candidate hopes to face in November, President Joe Biden.But in recent days, Trump has ramped up his attacks on Haley. New Hampshire is believed to be friendly territory for her since the Republican electorate there is both more moderate than the national average and better off financially. A poll conducted earlier this month found Haley within just a few percentage points of Trump in the state. On Friday, Trump got the endorsement of South Carolina Senator Tim Scott, even though he's from the same state as Haley and she first appointed him to the U.S. Senate. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

I mean, we're used to seeing several candidates make it to the New Hampshire primary, and this time, there's just three on the Republican side. And one, Ron DeSantis, he's in the state, he's out of the state, he's back again, so it's really become a two-person race in New Hampshire between Nikki Haley and Donald Trump. And all week long, Trump has held a significant double-digit lead. Iowa really didn't reset the race. Didn't give Nikki Haley momentum. And so, heading into the weekend, you know, we're all kind of watching and waiting to see if the voters give us any surprises coming out of the weekend.

A person familiar with the conversation tells CNN, Netanyahu explained that the public comments he made a day earlier, in which he appeared, not for the first time, to reject the idea of a Palestinian state weren't meant to foreclose that outcome in any form.The White House says, the president reiterated his support for an eventual Palestinian state once the war between Israel and Hamas is over. Biden says, he believes Netanyahu would agree to a two-state solution, \"Given the right one.\" For the sixth time in about a week, the U.S. has struck Houthi targets in Yemen. According to a U.S. official, the strikes on Friday destroyed three Houthi anti-ship missiles. The U.S. and other nations are trying to disrupt the Iran-backed group's ability to attack international cargo vessels in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden. The Houthis say, they are targeting shipping lanes in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza. CNN's Scott McLean joins me now live from Istanbul with the latest.

So, the U.S. had tried for some time to avoid striking targets in Yemen, striking Houthi targets, thinking maybe it was better just to ignore them because of course the U.S. has been conscious of trying not to have this war in Gaza expand beyond those borders into the wider Middle East. And this perhaps would be one way to do that, and yet, these strikes continue.As you mentioned, this is the sixth round now of American strikes against Houthi targets. In this case, the Pentagon says that there were three sites that were hit, all of them had anti-ship missiles pointed toward the Red Sea and ready to be launched. And that posed a risk not only to commercial vessels, but also to U.S. naval interests in the region and that's why they went ahead with those strikes. The Houthis, though, have had some success this week. Their version of success, obviously, they managed to hit three U.S.-owned -- two U.S.- owned ships on Tuesday and Wednesday. They aimed at another one on Thursday, but they missed narrowly. In the first two cases, the damage to those ships was minor enough that they were able to continue sailing. But the point stands that commercial shipping is in obvious danger in the Red Sea as it passes through Yemen. The Houthis, though, say that they are not deterred. President Biden says that he acknowledges that these strikes have not worked, but he says that they will continue. And so, there's no signs that they'll stop anytime soon. And it's also interesting to note, Kim, that the top Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee in the U.S. was asked about this, and he said that, look, obviously the Houthis still have ammo but after these strikes, they have less of it.",
