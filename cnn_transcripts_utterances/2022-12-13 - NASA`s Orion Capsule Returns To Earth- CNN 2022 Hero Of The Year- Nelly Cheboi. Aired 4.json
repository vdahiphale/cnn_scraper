But before it`s splashed down a critical test, in one of the most nail-biting times of the re-entry process, the Orion capsule will separate from its service module then complete a skip maneuver off the edge of the Earth`s atmosphere, which will bring it closer to its landing site and cut down on the G-forces that future astronauts will have to endure. After that, all eyes are on the heat shield as Orion blazes back to earth at temperatures twice as hot as molten lava. NASA says the heat shield has been tested more than a thousand times and making sure it can take the heat is one of the primary goals of this mission. From the outset, the uncrewed Artemis I mission has been a dry run to make sure the spacecraft is safe enough for astronauts to fly on board.",

In 2019, Nelly quit her softwareengineering job to create her non-profit TechLit Africa. Since then, she`s provided thousands of students with upcycled computers in a way to connect with the world. Voters online selected Nelly from a list of CNN`s Top 10 Heroes. As CNN Hero of the Year, she will receive one hundred thousand dollars to expand her work. Her story is incredible. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) NELLY CHEBOI, CNN 2022 HERO OF THE YEAR:  I never forget what it was like growing poor. I never forget what it was like my stomach churning because of hunger at night. I would have to go and scavenge for food at trash bits. We grew up in a tin roof house. It was full of potholes. I used to look at the different light bouncing from the holes from the roof, and then just imagine what we look like to sustainably fix poverty. I was a very hardworking student even though I wasn`t in school often, and even though I was the most hardworking person I knew, I still did not know what a computer was. I am from Mogotio which is a small village in rural Kenya. And there isn`t much of an economic activity here. I got a full-ride four-year scholarship in America at Augustana College in 2012. I got a job as a janitor cleaning bathrooms. I discovered computer science in my junior year of college just out of accident. I needed to take an introduction to java for my math major and I just fell in love with it. I just knew this was what I wanted to do and also bring it to my community. Every three years, companies are upgrading their IT. Most of these computers are ending up in landfills. Well, we have kids here, myself included back in the day, who don`t even know what a computer is. And so, what we`re doing is that we`re working with institutions, colleges, companies, even individuals and then we bring it to the schools. We refurbish them. We install our own custom operating system that is geared towards teaching our kids self-efficacy, troubleshooting and Internet skills. All of you are going to be graphic designers today. The kids that we are working with are actually from four years old all the way to 12. And there`s also vectors, it doesn`t matter how much you zoom, it`s still perfect, it`s still a line. We have people coming in and just inspiring the kids. They can go from doing a remote class with NASA to music production, video production, coding, personal branding and so on. Right now, we`re working with 4,000 kids. My hope is that when the first TechLit kids graduate high school, their families and themselves will not need aid because they can make money online. That money will support their families. Their money will support themselves. I can`t even describe just how dehumanizing poverty is. Just getting crushed over and over again. My mom was working really hard and I was still going to bed hungry. I was still living in a house that was flooding. But the world is your oyster when you are educated. The thing that was really fascinating me growing up, not seeing change, not seeing hope, not even seeing progress. I feel like with this kid, I can see a path like, I can see a way where they can make a living online. And that is really like why we`re doing this work. My life is bigger than myself. If I have the power to change anything, I have to do it. I have to give it my all. I can keep doing it. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
