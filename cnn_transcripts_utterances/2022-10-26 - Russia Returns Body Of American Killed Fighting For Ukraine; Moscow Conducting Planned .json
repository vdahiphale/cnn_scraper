CNN is near the frontlines right now where Ukrainians are warning the heaviest battles are still ahead.Also tonight, my exclusive interview with the President of Israel on the conflict in Ukraine and more. He's pushing back and pressure from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy for Israel to choose sides in the war. And in the battle for control of the U.S. Senate, a second woman is now accusing Georgia Republican Herschel Walker of pressuring her to get an abortion. This, as Democrats in Pennsylvania are worried that John Fetterman's debate performance could turn off undecided voters. Welcome to our viewers here in the United States and around the world. I'm Wolf Blitzer. You're in THE SITUATION ROOM. We begin our coverage tonight with the war in Ukraine. The body of an American man killed while fighting alongside Ukrainian defenders is finally on the way home tonight after a swap with Russia. This, as Putin's army prepares for a major battle inside the largest Ukrainian city still controlled by Moscow. CNN's Fred Pleitgen has our report from the warzone. (BEGIN VIDEO TAPE) FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice- over): Ukrainian forces trying to hit the Russians on all fronts. This motor unit firing in the north of the country, while in the south Kyiv his continuing a counter offensive trying to capture the Russian occupied city of Kherson. We met up with an artillery unit on the battlefield. (on camera): The soldiers tell us there's firing going on here pretty much every day several times a day. The front line is not very far from where we are at all. It's a couple of kilometers in that direction. And right now, there's not very much movement on that front line, but still, the situation is very dangerous. (voice-over): Ukraine's defense minister says Kyiv's counter offensive here is complicated by wet weather in the area. But the commander says he believes in the end they will oust the Russians. \"BANDERAS,\" ARTILLERY COMMANDER: I know one thing for sure, we will never step back from here. We have no other choice, only forward. Ukraine has to get back all its territory and borders. PLEITGEN (voice-over): While Russia continues to mobilize 100s of 1000s for the war here, the Ukrainian say they found the Wagner private military company, founded by Putin ally Yevgeny Prigozhin is sending Russian prisoners with diseases to the front line. The chief of Ukraine's military intelligence told CNN's Nic Robertson. KYRYLO BUDANOV, HEAD OF UKRAINE'S DEFENSE INTELLIGENCE AGENCY (through translator): They put on them certain wristbands in blue, white or red color. Every color signifies tuberculosis, hepatitis or HIV. It's happening on a mass scale, most of them who are taken prisoners or their dead bodies, which were found in the battlefield had those wristbands. PLEITGEN (voice-over): CNN can't independently verify those claims. As Russian forces continue to lose ground in Ukraine, the Kremlin conducting massive annual nuclear drills involving submarine launched ballistic missiles and others launched from Russia's fleet of strategic bombers. While the Russians notified the U.S. about the drills well in advance, Russian President Vladimir Putin with a clear warning to Washington. PRES. VLADIMIR PUTIN, RUSSIA (through translator): What they are trying to achieve we see on the example of Ukraine, which has become an instrument of American foreign policy. The country has practically lost sovereignty and is directly controlled from the United States. PLEITGEN (voice-over): But the Ukrainians on the front line say they are fighting for their own freedom, not for anybody else. (END VIDEO TAPE) PLEITGEN: You know, Wolf, we did confront Yevgeny Prigozhin's outfit with those allegations made by the Ukrainians that he's essentially sending people with diseases to the front line, so far we haven't heard any comment from Yevgeny Prigozhin's group. However, the Ukrainians are also telling us that they believe that more and more newly mobilized Russians are being sent to the front lines right around here in the south of Ukraine, where of course a lot of the tough fighting is going on. They say these people have absolutely no combat experience and are essentially Cannon Fodder. Wolf.",

The President meeting with the top military and civilian leadership in the Department of Defense, it was framed as a regular meeting not addressing one specific issue. And it underscore just the sheer scale of tensions around the world, whether it is in Ukraine, which U.S. officials acknowledge is by far the most acute in this moment, obviously, the ongoing tensions with China, Iran as well. And we've seen over the course of the last several weeks, Wolf, the scale of the North Korean provocations with their missile strikes and the potential for a new nuclear test.But there is nothing more front of mind right now than what's happening in Ukraine. You have seen it from U.S. officials, including the President about the concerns about escalations. The concerns as Russia has notified U.S. officials of military exercises that include its strategic nuclear forces. And the very real concerns of the potential for a false flag operation related to a dirty bomb. Now, at this point, U.S. officials, Wolf, maintain, they have still not seen any shift in U.S. or in Russian nuclear posture, nor have they picked up any indications that they are moving towards anything like that kind of action. But the tension is real, so as the caution right now, certainly an element of the discussions between the President and his military leaders. Ukraine, also a topic of discussion for another meeting the President had today, Wolf, with Israeli President Isaac Herzog. Obviously, Ukraine has taken a different approach than the U.S. as it pertains to Ukraine, they have provided significant humanitarian assistance, they are not sending weapons system for their own national security reasons. However, there is a shared interest in the efforts of you -- of Iran to assist Russia, that is expected to be a central component of their discussion as they meet in the White House. All of this underscoring right now that even in the midst of a very intense campaign season, the foreign policy issues, foreign policy crises the President has on his plate right now are very acute and very front and center, Wolf.",

Ambassador Taylor, as -- you're the former ambassador to Ukraine, how important was it that Russia agreed to a swap, in effect to release the body of this American who was killed fighting alongside Ukrainian troops? WILLIAM TAYLOR, FORMER U.S. AMBASSADOR TO UKRAINE: Well, Wolf, we want to be sure we get all the bodies, all the people home, the Ukrainians want to do the same.

And when you're talking to European leaders, like Germany and France, a conversation about what would we do if the unthinkable happens, if the Russians use a tactical nuke?

And one of the things that I'll talk to my Independent friends and my Republican friends is you can't come out of your mouth and say that, oh, my God, you know, Herschel Walker exceeded expectations in his debate, but then John Fetterman lost his debate. What we're seeing is that the expectations were set where they should be set for somebody recovering from a stroke, he met or exceeded those expectations. There's no question that even though he had to pause, even though he had some issues hearing or reading the words coming off the screen, he's still more than capable enough to be a United States Senator. And I think for many of us even, I think it was actually endearing because you saw someone who's working to overcome. And what he did last night was stand on a very, very large stage and he overcame.

They've sent assassins to kill Israelis in Turkey. The assassination attempt against Salman Rushdie is the school of thought of the Iranian government. And as we see this combination today, 40 days to the death of Mahsa (ph) in, Mahsa (ph) in Iran, the heroic woman was killed by the Iranian regime. You have thousands of Iranian citizens who are harassed, or tortured, or arrested and killed by vicious and malicious regime as they are protesting for their own civil rights and liberties against the human feeling of independence and freedom. The Iranian regime is crushing them. And now moving forward with a nuclear program, which will endanger the entire region and the world.
