      "sentences": "Welcome, everyone. You are in the CNN NEWSROOM. I'm Omar Jimenez in Washington, in for Jim Acosta.Breaking news, the Senate has released the language of its bipartisan border bill which Majority Leader Chuck Schumer is now calling a monumental step. The compromise implements new stricter limits along the southern border, severely curtails asylum at the border, and ends the administration's current system of catch and release. But even if the Senate can pass the legislation, it is set to face stiff opposition from House Republicans as Speaker Mike Johnson has said the bill is dead on arrival before even knowing what's in it. It will be curious if that changes now that the text is out. We are also tracking severe weather on the West Coast. Last hour, Mayor Bass urged Los Angeles residents to stay home saying the city is not used to the life-threatening flood conditions it's set to experience. So we're going to bring you the latest updates throughout the hour there. But first, I want to get to CNN's Priscilla Alvarez. Priscilla, I know this is all happening in real time. We've got this legislative text. The Senate bill is now out. Have you been able to get a sense of what's actually in this and what you think is actually significant here?",

And that's not going to happen.Look, I've been speaking with Republicans in the House and in the Senate for the last several days, weeks and throughout today. And at least those Republicans in the House, they've been saying no. Whatever happens, as you said, no matter what's in this provision, no matter what the text says, they are going to vote no, because it's dead on arrival because that's what Donald Trump said. And look, there's some important provisions in this text. We are talking about the number of migrant crossings. We are talking about revisions and expediting the asylum process and immigrant visas. These are important components for meaningful incremental immigration reform. But none of that matters. Donald Trump does not want Joe Biden to have any kind of victory in this. He would much rather drag this out in the hopes that he will be president and he can claim victory on this. The frustrating thing, look, rational Republicans that I have spoken with, I asked them late this afternoon, if Donald Trump wasn't in the picture, would you be supportive, at least open to having this conversation, they said, absolutely. If Donald Trump wasn't working things behind the scenes, they would be more than willing to have an open conversation and work bipartisanship across the aisle to get something done. The reality is, Donald Trump has a huge chokehold on the Republican Party. Here's the thing, we all understand that there's a massive problem at the border. We need to secure the border first and foremost before we make any of these changes. President Biden does have more ability than he has actually exercised to secure the border right now. He is not doing so. That being said, incremental changes in immigration are better than no changes at all.",

They have negotiated in bad faith. They have no idea how to and no interest in actually governing on this issue, especially when Donald Trump says, don't do this. Going into the election for 2024, this not only helps Joe Biden flip the script and Democrats flip the script on immigration saying, we wanted this, we fought for this, we fought for additional strong, smart border security, even more so than some of our own people wanted. And Republicans have yet again are the ones that are saying no.

The first is to stop exporting fentanyl to the United States poisoning and killing 100,000 Americans every year.

Now people raised issues, they said she hired Mr. Wade, the other prosecutor when they were having a relationship, but her filing on Friday says the relationship started after.They said well, she took gifts from Mr. Wade. Again, she rebutted that. She said look, in a relationship you roughly split things 50/50. We both spent. So the most damning and damaging allegations are gone now. The law is not going to knock her out. But this case isn't only in the court of law, it's in the court of public opinion. I think Mr. Wade is a distinguished attorney, contrary to what some have said. He has done a great job on this case, defeated some of the best lawyers in the country in court, got four guilty pleas. The right thing for him to do to help us get past this now is to say, hey, I'm going to go out on a high note and say, in order to avoid distraction, close the books on this, I'm going to voluntarily step away. I think that's what he should do. She must stay. She was democratically elected to prosecute these kinds of crimes.",

All eyes will be on Las Vegas where the San Francisco 49ers will take on the Kansas City Chiefs with the Lombardi trophy on the line.Joining me now is Rachel Nichols, host of \"Headliners\" with Rachel Nichols on Showtime. So Rachel, good to see you. ESPN's matchup predictor says the 49ers have a 59.4 percent chance of edging out the Chiefs. What's your prediction aside from people getting mad every time Taylor Swift is shown on camera even if it's only for a few seconds? What are you going to be looking for? RACHEL NICHOLS, HOST, \"HEADLINERS\" WITH RACHEL NICHOLS ON SHOWTIME: Well, if both teams actually arrived in Las Vegas tonight, and for the Chiefs, it is their second consecutive Super Bowl. It is in fact their third Super Bowl in four years. And because of that, amazingly, they just sort of have a routine. This is how we handle the championship game. Right? And Patrick Mahomes was talking this week about all the players, totally comfortable with the game plan by now. Over these next couple of practices, it is just a matter of locking the details in. On the 49ers side, they also have recent Super Bowl experience, but a little bit different. They were in this game four years ago. They actually were facing also the Chiefs, and they were ahead 20 to 10 in the fourth quarter, thought they were cruising to a win and the Chiefs stormed back and won by 11 points. It was devastating for San Francisco. So the talk around that team for the past few days has just been sharpening up the defense and getting everyone focused on playing a complete game the whole way through. As for Taylor Swift, who you mentioned, a lot of attention about the fact that she will be playing a concert in Tokyo on Saturday night. How is she going to get to the game on Sunday? Is the time difference going to allow her to? Spoiler Alert: It will. But there is still enough hubbub about it that the Japanese government felt the need to put out a statement a couple of days ago to Japanese fans, assuring them Taylor Swift will not cut her concert short. You will get to see the full show, and then she has a 17-hour time difference. She will in fact arrived in Las Vegas on Saturday night, Nevada time so everyone can just stand down. It's all good.",
