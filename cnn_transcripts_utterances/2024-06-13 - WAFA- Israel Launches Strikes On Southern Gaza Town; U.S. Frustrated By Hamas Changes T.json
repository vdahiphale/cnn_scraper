The only argument for why it might be OK to violate the sanctity of that safe zone, the place where Israel has urged civilians to flee to so that they can conduct operations elsewhere and it's now changing its mind, has to be because there is some kind of high-value operation, either because they think Sinwar -- Yahya Sinwar is there, the head of Hamas, or they think that Israeli hostages are there. Those are the only two reasons that I can think of as to why they would violate the safe zone.

So, when an area is in fact designated as a safe zone, that's where a lot of people flee, and it is overcrowded. There are camps with almost no territory for new arrivals. But, they go there. So, if this is in fact an Israeli offensive on one of those designated safe zones, it seems to go into a whole new realm of what's been going on inside Gaza for the last seven, eight months. SCHMIDTto some degree about whether or not it's being accused of blatant war crimes. And so, for it to decide to move into this area at this time in this way, again, subject to what we find out in more detail in the coming hours, really suggests that something major is going on here.

Ahead of the summit, in a move demonstrating Moscow's military might and a projection of power, Russian President Vladimir Putin sent a flotilla of warships and a nuclear-powered submarine for a five-day visit to its ally in the Western Hemisphere, Cuba, a show of force with reminiscent of the days of the Cold War decades ago.At the G7 summit, U.S. President Joe Biden will unveil more than 300 new sanctions targeting Russia. The measure is meant to degrade Moscow's ability to source materials for the war, particularly from Russian ally China. Biden is also expected to sign a new 10-year security pact with Ukraine on the sidelines of the summit, which will include training for Ukrainian forces or weapons, other military equipment, and greater intelligence sharing. G7 leaders are set to announce a $50 billion loan to Ukraine, paid for with proceeds from Russian investments which have been frozen since the war began. Well, Moscow has routinely deployed warships to Cuba and other allies in the Western Hemisphere. Russian military drills in the region are not as common. 2008, four Russian warships, including the nuclear- powered cruiser Peter the Great, exercised as well on a visit to Venezuela, which is why many believe the Russian warships in one sub now docked in Havana there, as Vladimir Putin tries to project Russian military power a long way from home. Details from CNN's Matthew Chance in Moscow. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MATTHEW CHANCE, CNN CHIEF GLOBAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Onlookers line the seafront in Havana to welcome these powerful Russian vessels, including the flagship of the Kremlin's Northern Fleet, the Admiral Gorshkov, and the nuclear-powered submarine the Kazan, the message for many Cubans that Moscow, it's Cold War, ally is back. We have historical ties with the former Soviet Union and now with the Russian Federation, says this Havana resident, something that in my opinion is very important for the country. I've never seen something like this so close, says another. Such a large ship of that magnitude, I'm very impressed, she adds. But, the real message is aimed at Washington. Russian defense officials say the strike group, now just 90 miles off the U.S. Coast, has been practicing the use of high-precision missiles against the mock enemy. U.S. officials are downplaying any threat, saying they don't believe the Russian vessels are armed with nuclear weapons. But, U.S. officials tell CNN that ships and planes have been deployed to monitor the Russian exercises. And the naval deployment comes at a time of worsening U.S.-Russian relations, just weeks after President Biden greenlighted Ukrainian attacks on Russian territory with U.S.- supplied weapons, with Vladimir Putin warning Russia could arm U.S. enemies in response. VLADIMIR PUTIN, RUSSIAN PRESIDENT (Interpreted): If the West supplies weapons to the combat zone and calls for their use against our territory, then why shouldn't we mirror these actions? I am not ready to say that we will do it tomorrow. But, we, of course, should think about it. CHANCE (voice-over): There is no plan to supply Cuba with the kind of weapons these modern Russian warships usually carry. But, the Kremlin could still make trouble in America's backyard.

The closure of the Acropolis is becoming an annual trend as Europe breaks temperature records, year on year. It closed last July during a blistering heat wave, which swept through the continent.

A former federal prosecutor tells CNN sentencing guidelines for the crimes is only between 15 to 21 months in prison, but it's all up to the judge, who could even choose to place Biden on house arrest, given his security concerns. President Biden has already said he would not pardon his son, but there's still a possibility Hunter Biden's sentence could be commuted. The White House press secretary on Tuesday declined to rule out that option, saying she had not discussed the matter with the president. U.S. House Republicans have voted to hold Attorney General Merrick Garland in contempt of Congress for refusing to release audio from interviews with President Joe Biden during the classified documents investigation. Garland says it's deeply disappointing that House Republicans have turned congressional authority into a partisan weapon. Here's CNN's Manu Raju. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

And the position of the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel is that the -- if the president asserts executive privilege, and he affirmed that it was correct in this regard, that essentially, that is the correct position of the executive branch. So this is essentially a dispute between the executive branch and the legislative branch. And ultimately, if this gets resolved, it would have to be by the courts to determine whether Congress has the right to that audio. And if this plays out in the courts, this could take months and months and months to resolve, certainly, after the November election. So ultimately, that's how it could play out. But prosecution, as Republicans will concede, highly, highly unlikely. Manu Raju, CNN, Capitol Hill. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
