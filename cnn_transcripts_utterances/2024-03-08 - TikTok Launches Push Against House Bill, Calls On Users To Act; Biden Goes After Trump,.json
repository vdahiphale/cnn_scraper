So, from a purely political point of view, we'll get to substance in a second, purely politics. Do you think he did what he needed to do? SEN. LAPHONZA BUTLER (D-CA): I do. I think President Biden came out hot. And that's exactly the kind of energy that the American people have been wanting for. Just as a regular voter, every single day, it feels like the news is so dreary and down. And to have the president come out with that strong fighting position, the fighting stance for what was important, giving the people what they wanted to hear. No matter who you were last night, if you were listening to that speech, you found someone something in it that was talking to you. Whether you were a black voter or a rural voter. You cared about healthcare, you cared about housing and homelessness. There was something there for you.

And, you know, I think that there's always more voice and volume that can be awarded to the issue.He started off talking about it very early.
