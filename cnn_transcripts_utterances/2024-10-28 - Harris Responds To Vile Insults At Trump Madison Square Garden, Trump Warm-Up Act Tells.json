The candidates are spread out across the battleground states, trying to reach that dwindling slice of undecided voters. More than 40 million Americans have already cast their ballots.Plus, vile, racist, sexist insults. Dominated Donald Trump's rally at Madison Square Garden, the former president's typical fear mongering was actually upstaged by his own warm-up acts who disparaged countless Americans and likened the vice president to a prostitute. And when the votes are in, we could see the biggest gender gap ever. Two pollsters from both parties will break down the growing divide and how each side is trying to close it. I'm Dana Bash. Let's go behind the headlines at INSIDE POLITICS. Moments ago, Kamala Harris responded to those offensive comments we heard at Donald Trump's Madison Square Garden rally. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KAMALA HARRIS, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE U.S., (D) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: This is not new about him, by the way, what he did last night is not a discovery. It is just more of the same and maybe more vivid than usual. Donald Trump spends full time trying to have Americans point their finger at each other, fans the fuel of hate and division, and that's why people are exhausted with him. I'm very proud to have the support of folks like Bad Bunny and Jennifer Lopez and others who were supporting me before that nonsense last night at Madison Square Garden and are supporting me because they understand that they want a president of United States that's about uplifting the people and not berating, not calling America a garbage can.

Who -- by the way, sources tell me that the Harris campaign has been trying to get to lend his support to the vice president. So, this eventually snowballed into what you're saying, Dana, an opportunity for the Harris campaign as they are trying to make inroads with these Latino voters. And by the way, just hammering in home on the Puerto Rican vote, I did some math for you. Pennsylvania in 2020, President Joe Biden only won by some 82,000 votes. We're talking about half a million Latinos in that state alone, and many of them are Puerto Rican. So as all of this unfolded, those were the messages I was getting opportunity.",

I mean, there were so many things that were said throughout that -- from the other people who spoke that there was not much pushback from the Trump campaign, calling out a black man in the crowd, and saying the comedians joking about a carved watermelon. That is a flat-out racist statement that we have really not heard much distancing from the campaign.

With younger Puerto Ricans when they were extremely active and in the streets. So, he's not just a star who left the island a while ago and sometimes goes back. Like, he's deeply, deeply involved in the community there. And so, the residents there, I think, is critical. The other thing to Manu's point, like how we've defined down saying -- the campaign saying this doesn't represent the president's views on that one specific comment. And everybody's like, oh my goodness, wow. They put out a statement. They put out -- they didn't quite apologize, but they put out a statement that shows how bad it is. And to Manu's point, there were about 15 other things that they should have put out similar, more robust statements to -- when it comes to this, I was actually more struck, and Manu deals with these folks every single day. Among those condemning the comments were Senator Rick Scott of Florida, Maria Elvira Salazar, the Congresswoman from Florida.
