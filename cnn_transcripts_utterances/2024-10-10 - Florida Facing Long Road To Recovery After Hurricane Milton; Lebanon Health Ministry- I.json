Floridians and rescue crews are beginning the herculean cleanup effort after Hurricane Milton devastated that state. At least eight people are dead. That number is expected to rise when gusts exceeding 100 miles an hour, ripping roofs off of houses, stripping trees, toppling cranes, and tossing debris through the air. The roof of Tropicana Stadium, which had been set up as a makeshift shelter for first responders, you see there, completely shredded. In St. Lucie County, the storm spawned nine supercharged tornadoes, three of them, in less than 25 minutes, they destroyed everything in their paths and left at least five people dead. And while the storm has moved offshore into the Atlantic, the danger is not over yet. That's because flooding remains a major threat as rivers continue to swell. More than 3 million people are without power and airports remain closed. In the last hour, President Biden emphasized preparations, saved lives, and people need to remain vigilant.

The damage really is a result of the storm surge that we saw here. We're talking about five-and-a-half feet of flooding for Fort Myers Beach here in Lee County. That number was supposed to be anywhere between eight to 12 feet. So folks are breathing a bit of a sigh of relief. Now, that doesn't mean that there isn't, of course, a good amount of damage. You can see this one fridge here that was pushed him out of this business just came to a stop at the entrance of this restaurant here, the owner of this place, just -- just actually went inside for the first time and said they've got about a half a foot of water inside, but that he didn't think the damage was particularly bad considering the power of this hurricane. Now, Jessica, Hurricane Ian devastated a good part of Fort Myers beach two years ago. The storm surge for that hurricane was 15 feet. And so, the folks out here, were really concerned that Milton was going to, you know, damage this part on the same level as it did two years ago with Hurricane Ian. But that's not the case. And so, what we're seeing at this hour is a dump trucks that now line Fort Myers beach here. They're trying to get all of the debris, they're trying to get all of the sand that has been pushed in by the storm surge. They're trying to collect that onto these dump trucks so that they can get them out, and then folks can come back in and take a look at their damage. As you noted, coming out to me, a lot of these deaths are being attributed to these tornadoes. Two of them hit here in Lee County to the north of where we are here on Fort Myers Beach. One was in the city of Fort Myers, the other one was in north Fort Myers. We were there earlier today. We saw a number of homes that had the roofs torn off parts, the windows were blown out.

These were considers areas outside the zones that to have a significant Hezbollah presence. So that's where many of the people who have fled have taken refuge. Now, as you mentioned, the death toll according to the ministry of health 18 with 92 injured. But this is a preliminary death toll.

And keep in mind, Jessica, President Biden ended up canceling his trip abroad to Germany and Angola at the last minute so that he could be stateside to oversee whatever would come the country's way after Hurricane Milton. This was, of course, the president speaking to the public today. Yesterday, you'll recall that we actually saw or heard from the president three times about Hurricane Milton and the recovery efforts that are continuing after Hurricane Helene.So I think that in and of itself really gives you a sense of how important the White House clearly believes it is to show that President Biden and Vice President Harris, too, are really saying focused on these recovery efforts. I think the misinformation disinformation, piece is really important and clearly top of mind for President Biden and everyone on down. You know, yesterday, there was a really interesting moment where the head of FEMA joined the White House press briefing again and was asked a number of questions about this problem. And she said, one of the ways in which they are actually seeing this affect people on the ground is people simply not asking the federal government for help and assistance when they really should be. That, of course, is kind of tragic. This idea that people who could be getting help are not getting help and she said that this is because they are sort of confused and afraid about the government's role right now, given all of the factually inaccurate information that is sort of flooding the zone, and she said, as an example, this idea that if people ask for help, the government is going to confiscate their land. She was very clear, this is not true. So as you can see, all of these images that you are showing, the task ahead for the federal government both after Hurricane Helene and now Hurricane Milton, it is herculean, but it is both the physical -- physical recovery efforts that are ongoing across the country. And then there's just trying to win the information war and trying to make sure that people have the right information right now as this important to recovery is underway, Jessica.",

Before Milton hit and as Floridians were evacuating, there was already a significant shortage of gasoline. Now, according to the gas price tracking service, GasBuddy, nearly one-quarter of all gas stations statewide in Florida were without fuel. Thankfully, the mayor of Tampa says the city's port, which is a critical lifeline to the states fuel supply appears to have minimal damage. Let's bring in CNN's Matt Egan for more on this piece of the story. And, Matt, people still trying to leave, get around. And now there's added emergency crews, of course, coming and using up what's left of that gas supply. What do we know about how much fuel there is and who's able to access it?",

      "sentences": "Well, Jessica, this is a major focus for local officials and, of course, a major concern for Florida residents. The governor of Florida, Ron DeSantis, he said that date about one- and-a-half million gallons of diesel on hand, at 1.1 million gallons of gasoline. He said that he's directed the highway patrol to escort the fuel tanker trucks with their sirens on to get to the gas stations that needed.Now, as you mentioned, GasBuddy says about one in four gas stations in Florida, don't have any fuel. [15:25:01] That's as of the latest update around 9:30 this morning. And this is a bigger problem in some other parts of the state that have been hit hardest by the storm. So, nearly two thirds of the gas station in the Tampa region don't have any fuel, one in three in Fort Myers, Naples, almost half in Sarasota. Now, here's the good news. The Port of Tampa appears to have avoided the really significant damage that a lot of people were worried they were going to get, right? And that is very significant because this is one of the most critical pieces of energy infrastructure really in the entire country and without that poured, it would be difficult to get gasoline supplies into that part of Florida. So the fact that the mayor says that there's minimal damage here is very encouraging. And a veteran oil analyst, Andy Lipow, he told me that he sees at least seven fuel tanker vessels on the way to south Florida over the next few days, each one is carrying at least 10 million gallons of diesel and of gasoline and some of it will be jet fuel as well. And so that will help this situation really as soon as the coast guard is able to say that it's safe and they're able to open these ports, there should be plenty of fuel at that point -- Jessica.",

For another two weeks, we have extended the Hope Florida line. So that's going to be 24 hours a day, seven days a week. So if you need help or you need some resources, like maybe helping hand with some things around your house or maybe some things with some supplies, you know, we've got all these organizations that come to help and subsequently storms. They're all plugged into Hope Florida. So you can call 1-833-GET-HOPE, 1-833-GET-HOPE and activate. Hope is the disaster on for Hope Florida. And that is up and running. We also have small business loans available. So we have $50 million. It's interest-free, very forgiving payment options. If you need cash as a business, you can apply for up to $50,000. If you're agriculture and aquaculture, you have up to $100,000. And if your citrus and cattle, you have up to $150,000. So, please, take advantage if you want. If you want to apply for that, you go to Floridajobs.org/EBL. We also are accepting donations for the Florida Disaster Fund. This is a charitable tax deductible donation. Hundred percent of the proceeds go to helping victims of both Hurricanes Helene and Hurricane Milton. And so if you want to do that, you can go to Florida disaster fund.org Florida disaster fund.org. I want to thank everybody who's worked really hard. We're still assessing the damage from this storm. I mean, I think clearly just going around that there was damage from it. I think in some areas that in terms of what was being predicted, some of the worst-case scenarios did not come to pass, certainly in terms of some of the storm surge, people were predicting, perhaps in the Tampa Bay area. The storm did weaken as it made landfall. And so whereas it was churning ferociously off the Yucatan peninsula, by the time it made it to the coast of Florida, those winds were a little bit tamer, still, still enough to do a lot of damage. But in terms of our assessments and being able to bounce back, and I feel confident we're going to do that as a state. This power restoration effort is underway by all the major utilities. They've had the people ready and they know that this is something that's really important. So you got a lot of people working on that. We're very confident on reopening the ports like Tampa to make sure that fuel is continuing to flow. We have a lot of fuel in reserve and the state, if we need to fill any gaps. But I'm confident we're going to be able to have an adequate amount of fuel delivered to the gas stations one way or another if we need to use Florida highway patrol to help rushed the trucks there, then we'll do that. But we should be in pretty good shape as far as that goes. So I want to thank everybody that's been involved. We got -- we'll be putting out information about things like points of distribution for food and water. We're taking some of those inputs from some of the counties.

I mean, I'm thinking back to a cabinet session a couple of weeks ago where the cabinet was ostensibly meeting about including the northern front in Israel in their war aims.And, you know, everyone looked at that and, you know, it took many hours before there was clarity that that was a decision that had been made. But, of course, that was the night when the prime minister was thinking of getting rid of his defense but the point being they made what sounded like an innocuous decision. And then the pager bombs started going off in Beirut the next day. It was that decision at the cabinet was the decision to stop the war. So, is that what were going to see tonight? We don't know that. What we do know is that the government here is playing incredibly close to the chest that their aims and their intent here. You know, President Biden, as you said, spoken with Prime Minister Netanyahu, doesn't want Israel to strike Iran's nuclear targets, doesn't want them to strike the oil facilities, oil refineries. He's talking about proportionality, striking back. That would mean at the same things that Iran struck out here, which is intelligence headquarters, military bases that sort of thing. But there's, we get no sense here at the moment of what Israel is actually prepared to do. We know what they want to do. Prime Minister Netanyahu, and a lot of people in his cabinet would like to strike the nuclear facilities and they feel this is the best moment because Hezbollah, which has always been a danger for them in the north in Lebanon, it's sort of an effect, sort of incapacitated at the moment. So, this would be the perfect time to execute the strike. They've always wanted against Iran. But of course, that could cost some part of the relationship with the United States.

So no doubt they are going to be on high alert tonight as they have been for the past couple of nights, waiting to see whether or not there's going to be some sort of Israeli strike.But, of course, the Israelis have said it's unclear how and when a strike on their part is going to happen. But we have heard some warnings already coming from the Iranians, on the one hand saying that it will be a crushing blow in return if the Israeli strike Iranian territory. And then you had the deputy commander of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps who came out and said, if the Israeli strike Iranian energy facilities, that, of course, meaning first and foremost, oil and gas facilities, that then the Iranians could do the same thing in Israel also strike energy facilities there.

You could see this roof behind me has been completely -- well, not completely, but almost half of it has been sheared off, just totally devastated by the tornadoes touched down yesterday.We're told that a total of nine tornadoes slammed through this county on Wednesday three of them within the span of 25 seconds. That's according to CNN's estimates of National Weather Service warnings. I spoke to the pastor of this church, Leo Bolbrack (ph), a short time ago. Luckily, he said, No one was in this church at the time, no one was injured -- no, none of his parishioners were injured. He does know some people, some prisoners who are from the neighborhood where the fatalities occurred. The Spanish Lake's Country Club Village, a stay -- a modular home community, which is just back this way a little bit, but the media is not being allowed in there because they're still searching around, trying to find victims, trying to assess damage, and trying to kind of get their arms around overall, what happened neighborhood there. But again, you can see the damage behind me and if our photojournalist, Jake, can kind of pan to the left with losing our signal too much. You can see some damage there to a building adjacent to the church. That's part of the church complex. There again, this community was just completely devastated by this. And what I can tell you is that unlike some tornadoes that just kind of cut an entire swathe through a given community when they touchdown, from what our teams have seen on the ground here, this was one of those tornadoes that kind of would hit a specific spot lift up, hit another specific spot, and lift up, and move around. So you don't see like an entire street gone. You see a few houses damaged, you see something like this. And then now next door, you'll see something that's completely intact. So it just kind of demonstrates the fickle nature of these tornadoes. And again, if we can take just another zoom up of that -- of the damage here, the sheer force of the tornado to take a look at all that reinforced would the plywood and the beams and all of that, it just ripped it completely off its base there, Jessica. And we're kind of just scoping around here to get an assessment of more of this damage.",

To put that into perspective, if that's the second most ever issued in a single state, in a single day, only behind the super outbreak on April 27, 2011, across the Deep South. So just a staggering amount of tornado warnings 19 conformed tornadoes, but everything was spinning yesterday, and that happen in a matter of just a couple of hours.

And effectively what happens is the southern side of the storm seemingly disappears and that's what we saw yesterday with Milton. But what happens there effectively is colder air out ahead of the warm, moist air settled near the surface. And as the rain falls through, the atmosphere at effectively evaporates, and at that point, that drier air rushes down to the surface and brings incredibly powerful winds of up and above 100 to 110 miles per hour.And I think that's what caught a lot of folks off guard that perhaps looked at radar and saw that the storm was weakening somewhat. But, of course, those winds were rushing in fast and furious behind it and to of course, you saw winds along the eastern coastline up and above are gusting up in above 85, 90 miles per hour. And, of course, the storm made landfall along the western coastline. So Milton just really a wild storm and I would imagine folks in Florida are glad to see it go. DEAN:  One hundred percent.

KENNEDY:  That was so refreshing and wonderful and shows how our fabulous country has moved ahead. Born to a large family in Chicago when she was five, her father, a successful businessman, moved the family east, to wealthy Greenwich, Connecticut. She was raised Catholic. As a young woman, she led a charmed life, attending the best schools and falling in love with Robert Kennedy. They married in 1950. And as he and his brother, John, rose and political prominence, she was right there with them. The charming socialite, Ethel was considered by many to be more outgoing, more exciting, more entertaining than John's wife Jackie. But Ethel Kennedy's role took a more serious turn after President Kennedy was assassinated. As her husband became a senator and then sought the presidency himself, she struggled to raise 11 children. The last of whom she was expecting when Robert, too, was gunned down. The losses for Ethel Skakel Kennedy grew her whole life long. Both of her parents died in a plane crash, a brother was killed in another plane, went down. Her son David died of an apparent drug overdose. Another son, Michael, in a freak skiing accident. Her granddaughter, Saoirse, died of a drug overdose. Months later, another granddaughter Maeve, drowned with her eight-year-old son in a canoeing accident. She took each disaster in turn. And still, those who knew her say her faith never wavered. She founded the Robert F. Kennedy Memorial to raise money for the humanitarian and environmental causes in which he believed.
