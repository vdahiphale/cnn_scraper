      "sentences": "Hello, and welcome to Inside Politics. I'm John King in Washington. Thank you for sharing runoff day with us. It is yes decision day in Georgia. Raphael Warnock versus Herschel Walker in a big Senate runoff. The winner comes to Washington and alters the balance of power in a big way.Plus, a December rush, Congress must be through a long list of must get done items. Right now, big divides on defense spending, vaccines and stopping a government shutdown including a new Republican rift between Mitch McConnell and Kevin McCarthy. And today a watershed decision - watershed decision from the panel investigating the insurrection. The January 6 media says yes, it will make criminal referrals to the Justice Department. Up first for us today though, Georgia delivers a verdict and settles the Senate map. Voters streaming in and out polling places all across the Peach state today. And tonight, we count those votes. The choice Raphael Warnock, the Democratic incumbent or republican Herschel Walker. And this choice, a 51-49 said it tilted toward the Democrats or a 50-50 divide in the upper chamber. Yes, just one seat. But yes, an impact beyond what may look like simple math. 51 gives the Democrats tiny but critical space to maneuver. 50 leaves the president with no room for error in the Senate, just as a new Republican majority takes charge in the House. We begin today in Smyrna, Georgia, in Cobb County, the heart of the Atlanta suburbs and CNN's Eva McKend is there. Eva, weeks covering this race here, it is run off day. EVA MCKEND, CNN NATIONAL POLITICS REPORTER: It's sure is, John. You know, what a difference a few days makes? The last time I was with you on this program. During the early voting period. I was showing you these long lines of voters all across the state but that is not the case this morning. I started out today in Atlanta. I'm now in Cobb County and people seem to be getting in and out pretty quickly according to the Secretary of State's office. Right now, the average wait time is about a minute and 25 seconds. Herschel Walker and Senator Warnock meeting with supporters again today. Senator Warnock in Norcross, our Herschel Walker doing the meet and greet with supporters in Marietta. You know, Cobb County where I am right now, this is a place that both of these candidates really want to be competitive. That's because historically, it was a red county, but now it's more purple. And so, it is the site of swing voters that both of these candidates have long worked to capture. So, the polls close at 7pm, but really important, if you are online, if you happen to be in line, no lines right now. But if you happen to be online, you can actually stay through the hour. You do not have to leave at seven, you just have to be online by seven. But the polls close later this evening. Back to you, John?",

You've had these kind of auxiliary, kind of Southern senators that have been around him.But at least in the final push, it sorts of just been, you know, the man on his mission to get elected to the U.S. Senate. So, we'll have to see. I mean, it's very cliche to say it all comes down to turnout. But when you have the Warnock campaign, I'm feeling good about the early vote, and the walker campaign doing one of these tonight.",

There are procedural logistical and time hurdles that will no longer exist if they have 51 votes. And if they control the committees with a clear majority, and I think they view that as critical.But I also think when you talk to White House officials, they're very cognizant of what Georgia means to the Biden presidency to his win in 2020 and the political future going forward. I've been kind of fascinated by the president's post midterm travels. He was kind of allowed in Michigan a little bit before the midterm elections, but one of them was Michigan where Democrats are performed today, heading to Arizona where he wasn't necessarily welcome. And to be completely clear, the president is OK with that. When you talk to his officials take it personally sometimes, but the president has always made clear. They don't want me. I don't need to be there. I've been in this game long enough to understand that. But what I'm most fascinated about is if Warnock wins tonight, and we obviously need to count the votes, if Biden very soon after is in Georgia as well, because you're kind of seeing him lock into very critical states that he flipped in 2020, where Democrats overperformed and certainly if Warnock wins tonight, it would be a very good sign for a Biden team that hasn't necessarily launched yet for 22.",
