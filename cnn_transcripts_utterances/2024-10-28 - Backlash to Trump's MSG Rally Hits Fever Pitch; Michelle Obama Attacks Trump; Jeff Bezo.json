Mick Foley, AKA \"Mankind,\" is my guest tonight on \"Laura Coates Live.\" With just eight days left and polls at a virtual stand, so you might be wondering, are there really any voters whose minds can still be changed? Well, after what happened at Donald Trump's New York City rally last night, some in his camp are worried about this very thing, worrying that his closing argument was overshadowed by controversy. One source close to Trump says -- quote -- \"I'm livid,\" especially over this comment from a comedian, who was part of a Trump warmup act at the garden. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Democratic strategist Chuck Rocha, CNN contributor Lulu Garcia-Navarro, and former special assistant to President Trump, Marc Lotter.I want to begin with that point that he was making to suggest that, I believe his suggestion was, If George Lopez is saying it as a Mexican- American and talking about Mexican-Americans, somehow it is fine, similar to a Black person using the N-word to describe themselves or the world around them in some way. Is this convincing, though, to voters who will look at this and say, no, no, I'm offended when you use the word, when you talk about anybody, and it does cancel each other out? Is that a possibility or is what this comedian, I hate to use that term lightly here, is saying? It is so beyond the pale, that it's not a conversation about how we repossess terms of criticism. CHUCK ROCHA, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST, FORMER SENIOR ADVISOR FOR BERNIE SANDERS'S PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGNS:  It's an ongoing narrative in the story of this election. It's almost over. I can't believe it's almost over. We're at this point (INAUDIBLE). It's a self-afflicted wound that didn't need to happen. And strategists like me cringe at these moments because it could literally end your campaign and this could end his campaign. I'm not being hyperbolic, but there's a lot of Puerto Ricans in battleground states. And I was there walking the couch Sunday when I saw it. I not only run the largest Latino political consulting firm, I run one of the largest Latino PACs. And I went out on Twitter and said, somebody give me $30,000 so I can send this clip to every Puerto Rican in Pennsylvania to tell them what I think about. And I raised that money in six hours because that's how outraged people were. And I think that's the big difference here. You got to show some respect, especially with Puerto Ricans. They're a very powerful bunch. If any of you have ever been to a Puerto Rican parade, I'll say two things. First thing you do is you don't ever, ever say anything about their island.

They understand that he is a fascist. I think the voters that we're still trying to get to probably could care less and may not even fully understand what it means. It's just like you put up the poll about democracy. I think what they do know is whether or not they have enough money to make it to the next check. What they do know is whether or not they can afford their groceries. What they do know is whether or not they can afford childcare. And so, she has plans and not concepts of plans for all these things.While Project 2025 and Trump's plan is to get rid of things such as Head Start, she wants to make sure that we bring back the child tax credit, which would allow for families to have up to $300 per child a month in relief to help them when they are struggling with things such as childcare. When we're starting to talk about the cost of food, let me tell you, Democrats are ready to pass a farm bill. It's the Republicans that want to cut the $30 billion from SNAP benefits and so, therefore, they refuse to pass a farm bill. But we want to make sure that those that are struggling and only getting that $6 a day to eat, that they can have that money. We also understand the importance of investing in people. And so, when you're looking at the fact that she's laid out a plan for a million new loans with up to $20,000 per loan for newly-created small businesses, $20,000 being forgivable, that means that now we're creating new businesses, and we know that the backbone of our economy is small businesses. And so, this means that we're giving people an opportunity to build those legacies that will carry on for years and years and years, but also put them into a situation where they're not relying on somebody else to pay them a fair wage, but instead they can go out and make their own money.",

If they wanted to do no endorsement, they should have done it six months ago. Maybe he was busy. I don't know what he was doing, but he could have decided then instead of right now. The timing is bad. And again, he spent a lot of time defending himself about quid pro quo. I don't think that's really the issue.
