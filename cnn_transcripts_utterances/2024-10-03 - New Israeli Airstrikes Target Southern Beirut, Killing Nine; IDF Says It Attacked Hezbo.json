Lebanon was already in a very difficult place before this war started. Everybody knows the economy situation in Lebanon was in a very difficult place. Everybody knows that, after the Beirut port explosion, after the economy crash, the country has been struggling for over four years. This war just came to devastate. It's devastating the country. It's creating more instability. I'm not just talking about the economy; I'm talking about 1,200,000 people displaced today. It's an unprecedented displacement activity that happened in any country in the world in less than five days. We have hospitals filled with people, schools filled with people, people sleeping on the street and this war keeps going -- the way I see it is that this war has no goal. It's just destroying the country and it's just taking it to a place where it's very difficult to come from.

I think it's very hard to take anything coming out of Washington seriously these days, to be honest, because they keep saying one thing and then they do the exact opposite. They've been saying for months they don't want an attack on Lebanon. They don't want a new war happening in Lebanon. And a week later, we find out that there has been a tacit agreement to what is happening right now, the invasion that's happening and the continued attacks against the country. So it's very hard to really take anything. I think Washington is not displaying the diplomatic skills it has or if it's -- nor is it using the leverage it has to stop this. Washington is the only capital in the world today that has the leverage to say to Israel, enough, enough killing. We need to move to the negotiating table.

We saw attacks on health care workers. We saw attacks on residential homes, buildings hosting large numbers of people. We saw incidents where almost 100 civilians would have been killed just for the sake of a few Hamas militants. This is the pattern that we've seen in Gaza in over a year. This is the pattern.

But that doesn't mean that civilian protection and measures to protect civilians should go out the window. The things that we've seen in Gaza, as I was saying, you know if you think back to the strike on the Jabalya camp in October 31st, we recorded about 126 civilians killed in that strike for potentially a dozen Hamas militants. That means that the Israeli forces decided that it was acceptable to kill that number of civilians in order to achieve that military target. Now each target will have had to been decided upon at the legal level, at the Israeli targeting level. But they will be knowing and they will be making those calculations based on what they know about whether civilians are. And each those cases must be investigated.

Wednesday, Hezbollah organized a mob of media for a tour around the southern suburbs to show perhaps they're still in control. I asked spokesman, Mohammad Afif how Hezbollah will deal with Israel's repeated blows, a question he didn't like. \"I won't allow for that expression,\" he replied. \"Your Arabic language is not correct.\" His aides chant loyalty to their assassinated leader. \"We haven't taken blows. I completely reject that,\" he says. \"The resistance has recovered. The leadership is well. The command and control is well. The arsenal of rockets is well. Thousands of the heroic men of the resistance on the fronts are well. Most inhabitants of the southern suburbs have fled elsewhere, yet some, like Mohsen Abbas (ph), insist on staying put. \"My family left but I'm staying here,\" he says. \"They're bombing. Normal. What else could happen?\" Wednesday, Hezbollah fighting on its own rugged turf in South Lebanon, inflicted heavy casualties on Israeli forces that crossed the border. Hours after, its ally, Iran, rained down missiles on Israel. A war that started in Gaza has spread to Lebanon. In the week, Israel has bombed Yemen and Syria. If this isn't a regional war, what is?

Today, we wrap up with the story of KM Reyes, the co-founder of the Centre for Sustainability, who fell in love with the island of Palawan and has spent the last decade tirelessly fighting to protect it. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) (MUSIC PLAYING) BILL WEIR, CNN CHIEF CLIMATE CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  Conservationist Karina May Reyes, who goes by KM for short, was born and raised in Australia by Filipino parents. She only visited the Philippines a decade ago and what turned out to be a life altering trip for her and, you could argue, the island province of Palawan as well. KM REYES, CONSERVATIONIST AND CO-FOUNDER, CENTRE FOR SUSTAINABILITY (voice- over):  So I first came to the Philippines on April 23 of 2014. The date is etched because then I came to Palawan on June 23 of 2014, fell in with this great group of people that wanted to protect their island. And here in Palawan, we have a saying called, \"Come back, come back,\" because when you come to Palawan, you always want to come back. It's so beautiful. And I came and I just never left. WEIR (voice-over):  She and that like-minded group of people formed what is now the Centre for Sustainability, a small but mighty non-profit, determined to conserve what they consider their own backyard. The Philippines was once covered in pristine rainforest. But in just the span of 100 years, the 20th century, it dropped from 70 percent to just 3 percent covering. REYES (voice-over):  And the vast majority of that is here on the island of Palawan. WEIR (voice-over):  Annually ranking as one of the best islands in the world to visit, it is indeed a natural splendor but it has also been labeled as the Philippines' last ecological frontier and faces many environmental challenges. REYES (voice-over):  The main threats that we face is mining, deforestation, poaching, unsustainable development, burgeoning population encroachment. We're also really vulnerable to climate change now with the typhoons. (MUSIC PLAYING) REYES (voice-over):  So we're in Barangay Tagabinet. So one of the seven barangays of Cleopatra's Needle. WEIR (voice-over):  In the Filipino language, a barangay translates to a village or district. This one is the home of two of KM's core team members, cousins Solomon and Othoniel, who helped introduce her to the wonders of Palawan, planting the first seeds for what is now the Centre for Sustainability. REYES (voice-over):  In many, many ways, it's kind of where it all began for us, because this was really their backyard and where they would adventure as kids. WEIR (voice-over):  Most significantly Tagabinet is the launching point from which KM first started to explore a peak known as Cleopatra's Needle. REYES (voice-over):  The first time I came here, it was actually the very first time that I summitted Cleopatra's Needle. It took five days. We went up. We got a little bit lost, which is where Solomon and Othoniel's knowledge from their childhood was really important. And then we came down on this side, a spectacular hike. WEIR (voice-over):  The more she explored, the more she learned about the people, whose livelihoods depend on these forests; about the flora and fauna that thrive here and about the threats to its health. And a mission of conservation arose. REYES (voice-over):  At CS and for me personally, my job is, number one, to serve people. It's to serve my community. Like we love our backyard. And this area is an important area of biodiversity for the entire country. And so that's a big reason why we wanted to protect it. So let's do that. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

ROSALES (voice-over):  These winding mountain roads made further difficult to navigate by obstacles. We are entering an area that's closed off to regular people. Only first responders are allowed. And it is because it's so treacherous. We're seeing it for ourselves like thick mud all over the place, trees that are down, portions of the road has crumbled down. So I'm really concentrating here. This is difficult to drive. ROSALES (voice-over):  And even when debris and fallen trees are cleared by chainsaw and manpower to make way for rescuers, another major barrier. A FEMA supervisor who's been on his cell phone trying to get in touch with his team to figure out where they're at. ROSALES (voice-over):  Division Group Supervisor Colin Burress pulls us over. Can't get a signal? We're seeing for ourselves everything that the governor has been talking about.",

ROSALES (voice-over):  Back down the mountain, a second look at what Helene laid to waste. Before we can make it down, another danger getting through these torn and treacherous roads. JASON STUART, TASK FORCE LEADER, TENNESSEE TASK FORCE 1:  This is a special case. Typically, the roads washed out in a mountain atmosphere like this, you know hurricanes usually happen, you know toward the coast.
