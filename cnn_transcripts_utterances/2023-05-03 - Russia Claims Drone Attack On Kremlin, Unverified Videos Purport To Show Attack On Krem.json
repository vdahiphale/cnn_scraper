      "sentences": "I mean, I've got no indication that they're any closer today to using nuclear weapons than they were yesterday. But frankly, I'm just quite taken aback by this video that we're playing now for the first time.I mean, that -- you know, I was of the understanding of these drones landed close by the Kremlin Palace, but it looks to me like they're landing right on top of it. I mean, that, if I'm not mistaken, is the Grand Kremlin Palace, which is behind the red walls of the citadel of the Kremlin itself, and right at the very center, sort of literally and symbolically of the Russian state. And so if that is indeed a drone, as it looks to be, hitting the flag on the top of the Grand Kremlin Palace, I mean, that is an extraordinary -- an extraordinary scene to be witnessing, and obviously will be seen as horrifying for not just the Kremlin, and not for the officials of Russia, but people all around the country, that if they believed that they weren't going to be touched by this war, if they believed it was at arm's length, well, that is a very potent visual illustration. That is no longer the case. In terms of, well, are the Kremlin going to use nuclear weapons in response to this? Well, I don't think the calculus necessarily changes. It may well be an escalation. They may be prepared to launch, you know, significant attacks, perhaps to target the Ukrainian leader. They've tried in the past to kill him. And, you know, there's no reason to suspect they won't try in the future. And if this is the justification they need, then fair enough. But, you know, look, if Russia uses a nuclear weapon, even a small tactical weapon on the battlefield in Ukraine, it doesn't necessarily advance its military objectives. That calculus will not have changed. And it may will alienate the country even further from what's left of the allies it does have. I mean, China has made it quite clear. And I know this from the sources I've spoken to Ukraine, about the conversation that the Chinese leader had with President Zelenskyy, I think it was last week, when he basically -- or the week before, when he said, look, you know, we are totally against the use of nuclear weapons and the threat of nuclear weapons against other states, but particularly states who themselves are not in the possession of nuclear weapons. And that came to me from a trusted source inside the presidential administration. So if the Kremlin were to take that step, and to use nuclear weapons, it would risk alienating the most important ally, China, that it has in the world right now, not to mention the other countries like India and some African countries as well, that may well distance themselves from the Kremlin if they went down the nuclear line. But I mean, clearly, again, this is astonishing scenes from the nighttime in Moscow with that explosion taking place on the dome of the Grand Kremlin Palace, again, right in the center of the Russian state.",

      "sentences": "Yes. Well, look, I mean, Russia, for many centuries, has been organized around this citadel, this Kremlin, which basically means citadel, and it's this red brick wall which sits geographically right in the center of the Russian capitol, and is, as I say, the symbolic center of power for the entire country.There are lots of buildings inside that quite large compound, as you say, there are churches, cathedrals, there are various offices. The main building is a yellow structure, a grand palace, it's called the Grand Kremlin Palace. And that's where Vladimir Putin's offices are, for instance, and his staff and, you know, where many of his kind of presidential administration, you know, kind of helpers are located as well. He has an apartment there. He has offices there. It's obviously very heavily fortified. It's right on the banks of the -- of the Moscow River, which is just a few meters away from the -- those red walls that surround it. And so in many ways, it is the cultural and political center of the entire nation. And the fact that there's a strike like this, if that video is indeed confirmed as being accurate, is -- I mean, absolutely astonishing not just to me, I expect, but to everybody in Russia and around the region that will be watching this right now. [09:35:08] KATE BOLDUAN, CNN ANCHOR: And so, NPW, let me -- let me bring you back in on that, how the Russian people will react to this, again, claims of an attempt -- attempted drone strike in the Kremlin is one thing. I wonder also how the Ukrainian people will respond in seeing this social media video circulating.",

      "sentences": "I think there is possibly some nervousness because of those who follow how Russia behaves, wondering what this might indeed herald them. We're not going to know for days possibly, whether this is a rare lapse in security in Moscow or part of a wider messaging plan from the Kremlin to try and convince their public that their president has indeed been targeted. And that has, in fact, failed.I should point out, we are still very lacking in evidence outside of this Kremlin statements that this incident did, in fact, occur. But certainly in Ukraine, too, there may be some who have experienced air raid sirens, there apparently is one in Kyiv right now. We had one throughout the night in Zaporizhia, Dnipro where I'm standing constant. The Zaporizhia siren punctuated by explosions last night. Ukrainians, ordinary Ukrainians, living every day with the possibility that a missile fired by Russia may randomly hit the civilian area where they are in fact asleep. And so it's important to remember that when Ukrainians view this puff of smoke, possibly emerging from over the Kremlin, their sympathies will, of course, be very limited. And so I think that feeds into the culture of utter hatred we're seeing on both sides here. And it's important also to point out how Putin fits into all of this dynamic. It was his decision to launch the war, despite possibly some advice that it wouldn't have been a good idea. It was certainly his decision to persist in this way. And so there are many indeed arguing that he represents the issue for the Russian people as the head of the Russian Federation. And it is his decisions that led them down this path where I should point out, U.S. -- senior U.S. official, just in the last 72 hours, said that since December, claiming -- pointing at U.S. intelligence have been declassified, 100,000 Russians had been killed or wounded on the battlefield in Ukraine. And that's a startling number if it indeed proves to be the case. And so that is feeding into the daily lives of many Russians who will see this attack on the Kremlin as, yes, a sign that possibly if they are a fan of the Russian president, that he has indeed been threatened and Russia may need to retaliate at the same statement that makes this claim goes on to suggest. Remember, they're very clear about the need to retaliate or the fact they reserve the right to retaliate. And at the same time, their claim attempt on the life of Vladimir Putin has indeed been made. There'll be others who say, well, how far has Russia fallen? Indeed, we can see over the Kremlin's walls itself a puff of smoke like this, if indeed, this video is to be believed or not. And then others, of course, too who will just hope this ends. There are so many civilians we speak to here who are caught in this daily nightmare of explosions randomly landing in the residential where is where they are, and hope that Ukraine's counter offensive imminent as it is, may push Russia back and bring an element of peace back to a country which over a year ago was, after an eight years war in a limited area, from vast majority of people here living in peace.",

Law enforcement say Oropesa was caught hiding in a closet underneath laundry. The FBI says a call to its tip line is what helped. It came in at 5:15 last night, led them to the suspect and he was under arrest very quickly after that tip came in, around 6:30 P.M. CNN's Ed Lavandera is on the scene. He's been following this.

You know, last night we learned the news that Francisco Oropesa was arrested at that resident, that residence about 10 miles away from where the murders took place.This morning, sheriff's deputies here in San Jacinto County saying, quote, several more arrests have been made. They won't specify exactly the number and just exactly who has been arrested, but we have been able to confirm this morning that one of the people arrested is a woman by the name of Divimara Nava, and she is the longtime partner of Francisco Oropesa. According to a source that knows the family, they have been together a long time. They share a child together who is in fifth grade, and that that woman was arrested at the same location where Francisco Oropesa was arrested last night. She has been charged with hindering the apprehension of a fugitive. She is in the Montgomery county jail, which is the neighboring county from San Jacinto and also the county where the arrest took place last night. What is interesting is that we actually have witnessed, over the last couple of days, this woman coming and going from the house that where she lived with the suspect there just outside of Cleveland, Texas. She wouldn't talk to us. She actually went to great lengths to cover up her face so that we could not see her. And the law enforcement sources told CNN that she had been surveilled by investigators for several days. And all of this kind of leading to this arrest. A couple other tidbits of information, Kate, sheriff's deputies here also saying that they were able to discover that Francisco Oropesa had another cell phone. And in the days while he was on the run, he was actually communicating with other people that he knew. So at this point, it sounds like other people have been arrested. We haven't been able to confirm the exact number or what relation or who exactly those people are. But this is clearly an investigation, Kate, that continues to develop here throughout the day.",

His position is that his goal is to provide some form of relief to some of these Texas communities that have been struggling to keep their head above water in terms of the migrant influx that they're facing. But the criticism here in New York is certainly the obvious political theater of it all. Many of his critics saying that he continues to use people as political pawns, but this is also really important. The arrivals that we've seen on Abbott charter buses, they're really just a fraction of the roughly two to 300 asylum seekers a day that arrived here in New York City. That bus that pulled up earlier this morning was transporting about 41 men, women and children. And, again, we do expect another bus later today. But the concern is that even one bus would certainly compound the situation for New York City that has been struggling to keep its financial head above water with close to 60,000 asylum seekers since last spring. And this is with Title 42 restrictions in place. The concern in the days ahead, John, is with that no longer in the way as a restriction, and those numbers will continue to increase and the city will have no place to put these families that arrived here, and whether they are sent up by Abbott, or they come here on their own was it -- which is the majority of them.",
