I'm Becky Anderson.And we begin with breaking news in Syria, where 50 years of authoritarian rule by the Assad family has crumbled in the face of a lightning fast rebel offensive. In a statement carried on state TV, the rebels declared they have, quote, liberated the capital Damascus. Well, the rebels are seen celebrating on the grounds of the Syrian presidential palace and they are searching, they say, for President Bashar al-Assad, who has not been seen or heard from since early (VIDEO GAP) tells CNN that the Syrian military there has fallen as scenes of chaos unfolded inside Damascus airport early Sunday, with people rushing to flee the country. Here is what the Syrian prime minister had to say about the growing crisis.

They claim to have captured four cities in one day before reaching the capital of Damascus.Well, Syrians seen tearing down and setting fire to posters of the President Assad. Rebels say senior Assad regime officials are preparing now to defect in the capital. Well, for more on this, let's get you live to Paula Hancocks is with me in the studio here in Abu Dhabi. This is going at lightning speed. So let's just get us back up to speed on where we stand at this point. What do we understand to be happening on the ground? PAULA HANCOCKS, CNN CORRESPONDENT: So, Becky, we've had the official announcement now from the rebels. They've taken over the state-run media to control the narrative. They have come on air and they say that they have liberated Damascus, saying the city of Damascus was liberated, the regime of the tyrant Bashar al-Assad was toppled, also saying that all the prisoners from the state prisons, they call them political prisoners, were also released. Now, what we understand is that the rebels said that they were going to try and take over key strategic institutions within the city as well. We have seen that they have been on the grounds of one of the presidential palaces. It's very reminiscent of what we've seen in the past when there has been a brutal dictator toppled and those who have come to liberate the city have -- have then moved into those particular areas. We have heard from a source familiar with, with this as well, that the rebels are actively looking for Bashar al-Assad at this point, that they are -- they're questioning senior military officials. They're questioning (VIDEO GAP) exactly where he is, because he hasn't been seen since the rebels started to -- to enter the capital. There are plenty of reports out there about where he may be that he has fled the city. He's fled the country. We don't have confirmed reporting on this at this point but he hasn't been seen. So it is a very different Damascus, a very different Syria that the residents are waking up to this morning.",

      "sentences": "There are a number of different groups. There's one main group that we need to know about, which is HTS, this is the Hayat Tahrir al-Sham. They're the ones that have been leading the charge effectively across the country, and that that are leading in Damascus.But there are a myriad of different rebel groups that are part of this in different parts of the country. As well, there are some that are Turkish backed, some that are American backed, some that are Kurdish fighters that Turkey considers to be a terrorist organization. So it is an incredibly complex group of different, of different entities that are part of this. But HTS is most definitely the most prominent part. It is a group that up until just several years ago was affiliated with al Qaeda. So this is -- this is a group that, I mean, the individual al-Jolani -- Abu Mohammad al-Jolani, who's the head, he has a $10 million bounty on his head. He is designated or his groups designated as a terrorist organization. So it's not (VIDEO GAP) clear picture that we're looking at here that the bad has been removed and the good comes in. It is extremely complex and it's difficult to see what happens next.",

      "sentences": "Becky, great to be with you and very strange for me to be in Los Angeles, where I happen to be for a work trip, but where I really want to be is back home in, in Beirut, because these are truly momentous, historic events for Syria, for Syrians, for Lebanon and the region, as a whole, a murderous dictatorship that has ruled over Syria for 54 years, occupied Lebanon for 35 years, and then pushed this country into a bloody civil war after 2011, when a civilian uprising demanded freedom and reforms. That dictatorship has now come to an end.We don't know where Bashar al-Assad is, but it is game over for him. I don't foresee any possible return of pockets of resistance. This is really the end, and it has implications for the wider region, for the Iranian axis of proxy militias in the region, from Iraq to Lebanon, for Hezbollah, specifically across the border in Lebanon which has been decimated in this war with Israel that just ended with a ceasefire just last week. And all of this is coinciding with that, with that ceasefire, which is really interesting to note. For Hezbollah, this is a moment where they will feel isolated geographically because they will no longer be able to rely on supply lines of weapons from Iran, and politically, because their key patron, Iran, feels vulnerable and their key ally in Syria, Bashar al-Assad. The Assad regime is now gone. But most importantly, Becky, this is a moment where even though we know we at some point tomorrow -- after tomorrow, need to think about what this is going to mean for the future of Syria. It's a treacherous dangerous road ahead there could be infighting between the different rebel groups. There could be more violence. We can only hope for a smooth transition from here. But this is really a moment to embrace the joy that Syrians are feeling, to see their country returning to them and away from this dictatorship. The scenes from Damascus, from Aleppo, from Homs, from Hama, from these prisons where people are being let free are just incredible. And that is a moment, really, that we need to pause and -- and give credit to the Syrians who worked so hard and paid so dearly in blood (ph) and soil over those -- over those years.",

      "sentences": "I mean, in a way we can say that they've been planning this for 13 years, really, and that this was at some point going to, maybe not be inevitable. But this is, you know, this has been a long time in the making. I don't think that anybody expected or foresaw the downfall of Bashar al-Assad so quickly. But a lot of these groups have been around for a while. As your colleague was saying earlier, you know, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham in the north, Kurdish factions in the northeast, other factions in the south. And this became, in essence, a pincer movement that isolated Bashar al-Assad in Damascus.And the rebel groups had spent some time, it appears, and I think a lot of details will be revealed in the coming days or weeks, had spent some time setting up coordination amongst each other and infiltrating, of course the regime itself. And they were able to do that because the regime of Bashar al-Assad was in essence, ruling over what was a decrepit state -- excuse me -- that was falling apart, that couldn't really provide for its people anymore. And the result is it crumbled so, so quickly. Another element as I mentioned, is the ceasefire that happened recently in Lebanon after a devastating war which decimated Hezbollah, which showed that Bashar al-Assad was going to be on his own from now on. There was really no possibility anymore for Hezbollah to come to his aid, as they had in the past. Similarly for Iran and, of course, Russia is busy with Ukraine as well. So Bashar al-Assad was on his own, and this was the moment for these opposition groups, these rebel groups to -- to strike with the tacit support of a country like Turkey. And to some extent, I think also a different attitude within Israel, because they've always thought that the Assad regime was convenient for Israel. They haven't launched one attack against Israel since 1973, and always used proxies like Hezbollah to make life difficult for Israel. But the Assad regime sitting in Damascus was quite a convenient enemy for Israel, except that I think there's a realization. There's been a realization in Israel that Bashar al-Assad also allowed Iran and Hezbollah to grow powerful on Israel's eastern flank. And that simply did not suit anymore in the current context of this region.",

      "sentences": "Absolutely, a significant process -- presence and definitely, as you say, for about a decade now, and Russia, in coming to Assad's aid. And as you know, Becky, it is very doubtful that Assad would have been able to hang on and really fought out that Syrian civil war the way they did to hang on, without Russia's help crucially, crucially with its air superiority.At stake now though, Becky, is Russia and two very key assets that it has in Syria. That would be an air base. But also the important port of Tartus. And it seems in some way, shape or form, Becky, that Russia is coming to terms with this seismic change in the balance of power that will now happen in the region. And it's interesting because Sergey Lavrov, as you were just saying, was at the Doha Forum. Certainly he met with his colleagues from both -- from Turkey as well to discuss exactly what was going on. And yet he seemed to have only words and very little else in terms of support for Syria. In fact, he said that at this point in time, he thought that using terrorists to in his words, achieve geopolitical purposes was not the way to do this. And he said that Russia did not care how it looked, as if they were suffering a loss in Syria and that their concern was for the Russian people but it is crucial that even at a time think about it, Becky, even this week Russia was carrying out military exercises from both that air base and from that key port off the coast. There in the Mediterranean coast. And yet did not come to the aid of Syria in any material form. I think the seismic shift continues, and I think that when you look at the transactional nature of the Trump administration coming in, that Russia has decided that perhaps backing al-Assad in this way would have been more trouble than it was worth, especially given how stretched they are in Ukraine and have decided to leave it at this. Again. You could definitely sense the air of resignation yesterday with Mr. Lavrov speaking about this at length but not wanting to. And in fact wanting to speak more about Ukraine and that certainly spoke volumes. We will continue to see in the coming hours and days exactly what their involvement was, if any, and whether or not if al Assad is truly out of Syria, whether or not Russia aided in his safe passage.",

Rebel troops there have claimed control of Damascus, the capital and they've now been seen on the grounds of the presidential palace. The rebels are searching for President Bashar al-Assad whose whereabouts are currently unknown. In the capital, scenes like this are playing out. People standing on a tank posing with weapons, waving a Syrian flag. And this was what was happening at the Damascus airport. This video verified by CNN, shows dozens of people quickly passing through security checkpoints some rushing to departure gates in an attempt to flee the country. The airport, though, appeared to be largely unstaffed and flight monitoring websites showed no imminent departures scheduled. Clearly, you know apprehension on the part of some Syrians, those potentially aligned with the regime and celebration, by so many others in so many of these cities. Hours ago, Syria's prime minister announced the government stands ready to, quote, cooperate with any leadership. The people choose to ensure a smooth and systematic transition. CNN's Nic Robertson explains how that transition could look with the current militant leader of HTS spearheading this takeover. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",
