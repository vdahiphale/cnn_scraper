Early results show Prime Minister Narendra Modi's ruling BJP party is leading. But the main opposition, the Indian National Congress, is also making gains in a stronger than expected performance.Brexiteer Nigel Farage of the U.K. says he'll run for Parliament as a candidate of the hard-right Reform U.K. party. That's despite failing in several previous attempts to become an MP. The U.K. general election is a month from today.

The renowned infectious disease expert, who many Americans saw as a guiding light during the confusion of COVID-19, was called to testify once again on Capitol Hill. This was perhaps Mr. -- or Dr. Anthony Fauci's final showdown with Republicans over mandates, vaccines and the origins of the pandemic. And even though he's retired, Dr Fauci says he and his family are still receiving death threats to this day.

It's more of a diminishing, as if to say that they do subscribe to the fact that Mr. Modi has managed to notch up a considerable number of achievements, whether it's to do with distributing free food grains to the poor, or even playing the religious card, the card of majoritarianism. Mr. Modi, as we know, has been very much at the center of a Hindu-centric politics, a Hindu- centric shift in the Indian political discourse.So it's not as if there's been an outright rejection of that, but it almost seems to suggest that, at the same time, it's not as if all those things are enough to trump these genuine concerns that Indians have felt. It's been a tough year for India these past five years, particularly with the pandemic. We've seen rising unemployment figures. India is at the bottom when it comes to human development indices, whether it's to do with health or education, and I think those real concerns are manifesting themselves. I'd just like to add one more point. There's been a growing sense that, under Mr. Modi's watch, India has taken on an authoritarian turn. There have been concerns about the nature in which opposition parties have targeted. Freedom of speech has been stifled. This is something that even global democracy watchdogs have pointed out, saying that India is one of the fastest growing autocratisers in the world. Now, when we went out onto the ground, what we thought of this as somewhat of an elite preoccupation in living rooms and cities and so on had actually started to filter down. Ordinary voters were talking about how, even those who admired Mr. Modi, they sensed creeping signs of authoritarianism. They used the Hindi word for dictator, saying they didn't like it. And I suspect that it's all these factors combined which has seen this attrition in the BJP's vote, this attrition in the BJP's majority, at the same time with the possibility of Mr. Modi still coming back. That still can't be ruled out.",

Now, many of these partners represent India's very diverse regional fabric where there are all kinds of varying pulls and pressures, not all of whom subscribe to Mr. Modi and his party's hardline Hindu nationalist ideology. So it doesn't seem at the moment, and again, I say this with a lot of ifs and buts, whether they'll be able to -- whether Mr. Modi will be able to continue to govern as he has, dependent as he is on his allies, which are likely to put brakes on some of the more hardline or some of the more extreme impulses that we've seen of this government.Now, how successfully they're able to do that or not is a question we'll have to wait and see, and how Mr. Modi himself, because he's known to be someone who is largely a one-man show. He's not really someone who's been very comfortable doing business with others, and he's managed to get away with that because so far he's been able to win overwhelming majorities. But now he'll have to work within a coalition. Now they'll have to be give and take. And whether that leads to a certain softening of the manner in which this government has functioned is something that everyone here in India and around the world is watching very closely because India is, of course, as we know, the world's biggest democracy. And the backsliding that has been picked up, not just here in India but around the world, of India's democratic temperature is something that has been a matter of concern. And if a coalition government, if a BJP with a reduced majority will have to perhaps be more mindful of those anxieties and concerns is something that broadly should be seen as a positive.",
