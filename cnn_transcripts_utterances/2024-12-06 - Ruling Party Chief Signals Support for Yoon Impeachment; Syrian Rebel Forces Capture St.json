Now, the leader of Yoon's own People Power Party says he has credible evidence that the president tried to use troops to arrest key political figures. Some lawmakers have been camping out inside the National Assembly, fearing another martial law decree could be coming. Parliament is scheduled to vote on Yoon's impeachment as early as Saturday. We want to go live now to Seoul and CNN's Ivan Watson. Ivan, look, there have been a lot of developments just in the last few hours on this, but still no word from the president himself. You know, how will this unfold now in terms of this decision by his party to not challenge this impeachment?",

I mean, that's less than three days ago, if you consider how quickly the events are moving. And then this morning, Han announced that he'd gotten information that President Yoon had issued orders to the counterintelligence chief to round up key political figures. And I've just confirmed on the phone with a top official in the People Power Party that Han himself was on that arrest list. And that is part of what prompted Han to make this announcement, calling for the suspension of President Yoon. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) HAN DONG-HOON, PEOPLE POWER PARTY LEADER (through translator): Yesterday, I said I would work to prevent this impeachment from passing, in order to protect citizens and supporters from damage caused by unprepared chaos. However, considering the new facts that are coming to light, I judge that an immediate suspension of President Yoon Suk Yeol official duties is necessary to protect the Republic of Korea and its people.

After several days of clashes around the city, the rebels, led by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, entered Hama Thursday, and the regime forces pulled out, according to a statement from the Syrian army. The pullout was intended to avoid civilian casualties. The rebels took control of an air base, complete with multiple warplanes, and freed inmates in Hama's notorious prison. Hama has long been a hotbed of opposition to the Assad dynasty. It was in Hama in 1982 that Bashar al-Assad's father, then-President Hafez al-Assad, crushed an uprising, killing anywhere between 10 and 25,000 people, according to Amnesty International. Last Friday, the armed opposition quickly seized control of most of Aleppo, Syria's second largest city. Now, the next city on the highway South, Homs, is just 40 kilometers, or 25 miles away. A critical crossroad linking the capital, Damascus, with the Mediterranean coast, home to the Alawite minority, which is the main bedrock of support for the Assad regime. And if that regime was looking for help from its old ally, Russia, well, it may be not immediately forthcoming. Thursday, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Moscow is monitoring the situation and will decide on military aid, depending on how the situation evolves. Hardly a full-throated declaration of support for a friend in need. I'm Ben Wedeman, CNN, reporting from Rome. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Then, at 6:29 a.m., surveillance video from a nearby garage shows the suspected shooter walking down the street while on the phone, just minutes before he carries out the killing of Thompson at 6:47. The gunman then makes a quick getaway. And this new video appears to show a person dressed in a similar way just ten minutes later, on an e-bike, 25 blocks North of where the murder happened. Investigators also found a phone and a water bottle near the scene of the shooting. A law enforcement official tells CNN. A fingerprint was also lifted from the bottle, but it was smudged. Also still unknown, the motive but there are potential clues. Sources say a shell casing and live rounds found at the crime scene were etched with the words \"delay\" and \"depose,\" a possible reference to the phrase \"delay, deny, defend,\" which is the way some lawyers have described the tactics insurers use to avoid paying claims.",

Appreciate it.Now senior White House aides and Biden administration officials are reportedly discussing what are preemptive pardons for people who may be targeted by Trump after he takes office. Now, according to multiple sources, there's been debate for weeks over the use of these kinds of pardons, even for people who haven't been formally accused of any crimes as of yet. One source says Trump's legal advisers believe Biden would be setting a new precedent with preemptive pardons, which the Trump team could take advantage of later on to help their own allies. Trump has publicly called for jailing people such as former Republican Congresswoman Liz Cheney and Special Counsel Jack Smith, who brought federal criminal charges against him. OK, coming up for us, years of painstaking renovation work, they're about to be on display now when the beloved Notre Dame cathedral reopens this weekend. We'll have that story ahead.

A tsunami warning was actually initially issued for parts of California and Oregon and, thankfully, was later canceled. Now, California Governor Gavin Newsom has declared a state of emergency while damage assessments are still underway. Now, after more than five years, Paris's magnificent cathedral, Notre Dame, is reopening this weekend. The city is preparing for an official ceremony on Saturday. Catholic dignitaries, heads of state, and celebrities are expected to attend the inaugural mass is scheduled for Sunday morning, followed by eight days of special masses and prayers. Now, hundreds of artisans, carpenters and other specialists worked tirelessly to restore the treasured gothic cathedral after a devastating fire tore through it in 2019. Now the day Notre Dame went up in flames, of course, it shocked so many of us right around the world. I want you to listen now to CNN reporters who remember what the chaos was like on the ground.
