Today, you can still see there's just a little bit of some of the embers coming through. It is a completely different story. What firefighters can now do today is begin to draw containment lines. Even though I can tell you that right now, the two big fires, the Palisades Fire and the Eaton Fire, are zero percent contained, they are beginning to at least make some headway.

The amount of water that we got here in California a couple of seasons ago, that led to extraordinary growth. Just wonderful trees. My garden was doing great. But then, this year, I do not remember the last time it rained. So, it's extraordinarily dry. Even as I pick this up here, you can see all of this. This is all just -- it's all dead and dried out. And this is somebody who has sprinklers. So, our gardens right now are nothing but tinder, and that's across this entire area.

And he talked about -- he said that Carter and Ford became close friends after a very close and surprisingly bitter race, and that each of them agreed to give the eulogy at the other's funeral. So, the question was which one would be there in real-time, which one virtually. And so, Steven Ford read the eulogy that his -- that Gerald Ford would have given for Jimmy Carter, which was full of tributes to his character, to his belief in American values, to his expansive view. That was very impressive. There was Jason Carter, who was a grandson of Jimmy Carter, who gave a very humorous description of his grandfather. He was saying, you know, a nuclear engineer, but one time he made -- he accidentally called his grandson and he thought he was taking a photo on a cell phone, it was -- it got a laugh from the audience. And then, of course, there was Joe Biden, who is giving what was an extremely hard-edged eulogy, in my view. He talked about all the things that Jimmy Carter accomplished, including in human rights and the environmental visionary emphasis that he had and his work for racial reconciliation. But then, at least a dozen times, Biden very strongly emphasized the importance of character and kindness and honesty and principle and avoiding hatred and being true to American institutions. Many of those times he looked directly at the most recent of the president sitting there, Donald Trump, who was sitting uncomfortably next to Barack Obama, uncomfortably for Obama, I believe. So, Biden gave what was for him quite a hard-edged speech, I thought and -- but it was a quite appropriate end to these tributes for Carter, I believe.",

And that sense of being a minority propelled him to his fight and his struggle for equal rights, for civil rights, human rights. And he also said, I don't know how it's going to go down here, but I never could imagine to this day, I can't understand how a boy from Plains or a man from Plains became president of the United States.

One year before he was sworn in1977, Jimmy Carter's name -- U.S. was one percent. Everybody else who has taken this office has been famous in one way or the other, you know, from George Washington -- Donald Trump as a TV star, even Barack Obama had become a known figure in the previous four years. So, he won through a strategy of -- through a combination of bad luck for the country, good luck for him and careful strategy. The bad luck for the country is that the many terrible time, the fall of Saigon was just months in the past. The Watergate wounds and the resignation of Richard Nixon were still raw and open. Stagflation was the beginning. The oil shocks were starting. It was a really, really bad time. There was a sense, a profound sense of wanting something new. That was the bad luck for the country. The good luck for Jimmy Carter was that he came on to the national notice in a number of ways. Hunter S. Thompson then, you know, fear of loathing on the campaign trail wrote a very -- article in Rolling Stone based on a speech that Carter had given at the Law Day ceremony in Georgia saying, this was somebody who understands the need for real American justice. As Andrew Young having come from a white minority in a fairly racist part of Georgia, when he was governor he said, the time for racial discrimination is over. He famously put Martin Luther King's portrait in the Georgia State capitol. He managed to bridge black versus white, old versus young -- Vietnam War -- pro-veteran. He was a naval academy graduate versus antiwar people. Environmentalist. He became a bridging figure who had a kind of magic that made people think this guy could be the answer. Then there was this strategy. He was the person who invented the Iowa caucuses. That he -- Hamilton Jordan, Jody Powell, his comrades thought Iowa could make him president, and they pioneered that way of doing things.",

And I think the widespread sense among manypeople who had supported Carter, who respected him, was that the promise he brought into office, again, when he was the most popular president, first term president ever, with ratings higher than Reagan's or Obama's or anybody else's, was being squandered in ways that were correctable. And it was a sense of not knowing things he didn't know. I think it is to Carter's credit that he was the same person in every decade of his life, every chapter of his life, in his 44 years as former president, that was all to his strength of being able to invent all the causes he had around the world, to kill off practically the guinea worm, to monitor elections, to work on Habitat for Humanity, to write 32 books. When he was in office, these were both a plus and a minus, and it seemed a correctable minus. That was the effort that many people, including me, were saying, this can be turned around if we change course. And I think the analysis stands up for 45 years ago.

And I think it's a speech that stands up very well. And the passage, just following what you read, he talks about, you know, we have examples in our own history from Thomas Paine to Martin Luther King of the power that words can have. And so, I think that the complexity of his policy, as he announced it then, is that obviously no powerful nation can have a foreign policy based purely on civil rights, because any nation has realpolitik interest around the world, but it matters to say what you stand for, to say where you are heading, to say where you believe the arc of history should lead. And that commencement address at Notre Dame in 1977, I think stands as one of Carter's foreign policy legacies, along with the Camp David Agreements and the Panama Canal Treaty, and also as something that presidents since him have often have aspired to, and future presidents should.",

The inflation rate was beginning to soar. His popularity ratings from a very high level were beginning to plummet. There was turmoil around the world in the Soviet Union -- then-Soviet Union in Iran, in the Americas, and it was anything that you could say about discontent in the United States for the past four or five years was quadrupled back then. So, Jimmy Carter went up to Camp David. He had a number of advisers, historians, philosophers, religious leaders come and talk with him. And he gave this speech, and something that is -- many people know that the Malaise speech, even though he never used that word, what few people remember is that in the week or so after he gave it, the speech was enormously popular. Jimmy Carter's approval rating went up by at least 10 points, maybe 12 points in the wake of it, which is a huge -- which is a landslide, an earthquake in opinion ratings. People felt as if he had again connected with some nerve in the American psyche. Then after that, he asked for all members of his cabinet to submit their resignations, which was seen as a step towards disorder. It sort of stepped on all the news about the speech. But I think that Carter's speech, if read now or listened to, stands up as a president trying to address what we now think of as very contemporary concerns about what is the purpose of the country, what's the soul of the country, what's the balance between the public good and the individual short-term good.

He looked at, you know, the charts for individual weapons and so on. So, when it came to the Iranian hostages, this became a political millstone around his neck, because I believe the anniversary of their being seized in Tehran was Election Day, or right around Election Day a year later. And so, Carter, with his trademark intensity, was trying to see what could be done. What did the Iranians want? Is there any way to deal with them? There's a whole separate literature that you are well aware of about the ways in which the Reagan operation campaign appeared to be dealing with the Iranian hostage holders to make sure the hostages were not released on Jimmy Carter's watch, but it became part of his -- something he felt he could solve as he solved other problems. And then, of course, six months before the election or so, there was the disastrous Desert One rescue mission, where helicopters crashed, and I think that may have been the time, if there were a turning point in the campaign, it may have been that.",

He wasn't paying attention to Iran. By the time he decided to pay attention to Iran, he was getting three different advices. He was getting one advice from Sullivan, who was his ambassador in Iran. It was an arrogant man whose arrogance only matched his ignorance of politics in Iran. He was getting one other advice from Vance, who was the secretary of state, who kept advocating for continuous human rights pressure. And he was getting, I think, the wisest advice from Brzezinski, who realized that the human rights policies are going to get the Shah essentially thrown out of the country.

There is a misconception, something the Royalists have, that he, Carter, conspired to overthrow the Shah. I think that is against every evidence I have seen in the archives.

And it led to what he later described his born-again experience. But there was a contradiction there between his ambition and his faith. You know, as a Southern Baptist, you're taught that the -- really, the greatest sin is that of pride. And, well, Jimmy Carter had a lot of pride. He always knew he was the smartest boy in his class, smartest guy in the room, and he knew that that was a sin. He reconciled it by making the argument from Reinhold Niebuhr, borrowing from the -- from a liberal northern Theologian, the notion that, you know, the world is full of sin and needs to be reformed and politics is necessary. And so, he told himself, you know, I will do whatever is necessary to get elected and then I will use that power to do the right thing.",

It's talking about a crisis in America, in a spiritual sense. He was railing against what he called the culture of narcissism. He was railing against the notion that Americans too often thought that they could find happiness and wellbeing in self- indulgence and consumption. This is, you know, not the usual kind of thing that an American president will talk about. But what he's really trying to get at in that speech is there's a contradiction, you know, a conflict between the two essential principles in American life, our commitment to the freedom of the individual, which is very powerful in America historically. But also, our commitment to community. And Carter always believed in a very religious sense that, you know, you cannot have personal freedom without community. And he, I think, got this in part from his childhood growing up in archery in Plains, a small-town sensibility. And he thought that America in the '70s was drifting away from its commitment to community. And that speech is really tough and I would argue is prophetic. He was often sort of a prophet in the wilderness. Again, not much of a politician. He ignored the politics. This was not a popular thing to say, although he got a nice bump in the polls for about 10 days. But, you know, read today, it's actually quite astonishing to -- particularly since we have Donald Trump who sort of embodies the notion of narcissism. Donald Trump is about to walk back into the Oval Office. And so, it's an irony that narcissism has triumph. And Jimmy Carter would argue that this is something to regret.",

But, you know, history works with a pendulum and maybe the pendulum willswing back after having a narcissist who really doesn't care about the facts very often. Jimmy Carter, you know, campaigned in 1976 famously saying, I will never lie to you. And you know, skeptics were a little cynical about that. His own personal lawyer, Charlie Kerbo, turned to an aide when he heard that Carter had made this as part of his stump speech, I will never lie to you. Kerbo turned and said, well, there goes the liar vote. But Carter, you know, was a very decent man. He tried not to lie. He tried to do the right thing regardless of the political consequences. He had no sex scandals in his life. And certainly, not during the presidency. There was no financial corruption. It -- and you know, he kept the peace. He didn't send American troops into war. It's an extraordinary record and a personal one, and his personal commitment to trying to do the right thing and to being decent I think is something that, you know, people will gravitate toward in the future. His reputation historically, I think, is going to rise. And you know, Americans are may someday realize that they would actually like to have in the Oval Office someone who rises at 5:30 in the morning, gets into the Oval Office by 6:30 and spends 12 hours working very hard trying to read 300 pages of memos every day to -- and pay attention to the deals.
