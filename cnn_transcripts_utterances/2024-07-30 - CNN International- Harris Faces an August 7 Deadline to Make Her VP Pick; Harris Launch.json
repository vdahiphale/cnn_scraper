I think that they also think that Harris can appeal to black voters who will be crucial in the state of Georgia. And of course, Donald Trump has his issues in the state. He lost narrowly in 2020. He has not necessarily gotten along with the governor there. So, there are a lot of people who like the Republican governor there, but don't necessarily like Donald Trump himself. And so as you said, they believe that they can win and over those voters as well. And so, this is a state that a lot of Democrats thought maybe wasn't in play this time around and they're feeling really energized and they're feeling like there's some change on the horizon.",

That was never going to be free or fair because you don't have that type of elections here in Venezuela. But it was meant to be competitive. And then instead, with the results that were published on -- early on Monday morning and with the outcry from the international community, calling on electoral authorities to release all the data and all the ballot numbers that they have, while the government has lost almost any legitimacy on the international stage, apart from the usual friends, China, Russia, Iran, and Cuba, who have all congratulated Maduro already.On the other side. You have a population that is enormously discontent with the current government. According to polls that were done before the election took place, more than 60 percent of the Venezuelans were staunchly in favor all for the opposition ticket at the ballot. And they now feel that they have been cheated on. And of course, yesterday, we saw this dissatisfaction, this frustration erupt in widespread protests here in Caracas. We heard early in the morning, (inaudible) which is when people bang on their pots and tried to make as much noise as possible as a sign of protest. That is very common in other Latin American countries and has been very common here in Venezuela as well. And then in the afternoon, most of the people from the slums, from the outskirts of Caracas, people -- working-class people that normally would be more associated with the socialist government of Nicolas Maduro, well, they took to the streets and clashed with police and the national guard. Today, the opposition has called for new activities on the street. They're not calling for widespread protests yet. It's important to remark that yesterday's protests were spontaneous and they were not coordinated. The opposition leadership has instead called for street activities starting today, later in the morning, and they've published what they say are the data from the ballots that they have been able to collect. So there is now, I would say, a race to transparency between the opposition leadership and the electoral authorities, both of whom have been called upon to release the data. And this race to transparency is erupting onto the street and you can expect more protests here later in the day, Amara.",

Thousands more were forced to flee once again, after the IDF issued evacuation orders in parts of the city a week ago. The U.N. says more than 150,000 people fled, many on foot or on donkey carts. U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin says he is concerned about a possible escalation between Israel and Hezbollah, but does not believe a war between the two is inevitable. Now this, as the Israeli prime minister vows a severe response to the Saturday's rocket attack in the Israeli occupied Golan Heights, where 12 children were killed. Benjamin Netanyahu visited this site, that soccer pitch, Monday and Israel has blamed the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah for the strike. Hezbollah has denied responsibility.

Now, we've heard also from Lebanon's acting foreign minister speaking to CNN's Ben Wedeman. We understand that he has had assurances from third-party countries that the response from Israel would be limited. But despite those assurances, we are seeing many countries telling their citizens that they should leave Lebanon. This really started last month, seeing that many countries, especially in Europe, telling their citizens to leave while they can. But this has really intensified in recent days. We've heard from the United States, for example, telling their citizens that if they don't leave now and if tensions do increase and the situation deteriorates, they may then have to shelter in place. They are not, at this point though, saying that there will be evacuations of citizens and they are also saying that when it comes to the U.S. Embassy, for example, the key indicator of tensions in any country around the world, that the staffing and the security at the U.S. Embassy has not changed at this point. But we are seeing, for example, just on Monday, Germany and Belgium telling their citizens that it would be prudent for them to leave. So really, over the next few days, it would appear to be key as to what will happen when it comes to the tensions between Israel and Hezbollah. We are still seeing the regular for tit for tat, if you like, between the two sides. But certainly, there is a concern that there could be something more significant after that deadly attack on Saturday.

And yeah, it looks wet and the ongoing rescue operations right now are being hampered by the wet weather. But just looking at this scene that is unfolding in southwest India, it is just traumatic what these people are dealing with. The mud and the debris that is associated with these landslides, and it as all because of the amount of rain that has fallen in a short period of time. We did a bit of research within this subcontinent and you can see where the heaviest of rain has taken place. There's Kochi. There is the state of Kerala. The last 24 hours has seen anywhere from 150 to 200 millimeters of rain, and it just simply cannot hold that amount of rain in an already saturated soil. So you get the mountainous terrain or the hilly terrain and eventually, gravity winds, the slope fails, and down goes the debris along with it. So, it can include rocks. It can include full trees, even sometimes sweeping homes off of their foundations, taking them downhill along with it.So this is all part of the southwest monsoon. You can see the normal progression through the months of June and July through India. More rain is in this forecast. You can just see that onshore flow from the Arabian Sea that will bring rainfall to the hardest hit areas. Computer projections anywhere from another 150 millimeters up for some of these locations. Now, the other story, this is completely different topic, but something we are also monitoring very closely. The hottest day of the year in Paris, of course, we have our two weeks of the Summer Olympics occurring right now. There has been a lot of discussion around what is happening for the spectators and the athletes as well. And because Paris is so densely populated with buildings, this actually can kind of disproportionally impact the heat and the people on the ground as well, as this just traps the heat within what we call the urban heat island effect. Of course, we've got our greenhouse gases trapping in the heat closest to the surface where people live and reside. And that of course, impacts people here on the ground. So right now, already temperatures warming to 37 degrees. This is the warmest, what we've experienced all year long in Paris. So right now, we need to be very cognizant of how this could impact the athletes today. Heavy rainfall and large hail though, with these extreme temperatures that are occurring right now, we got a lot of bubbling cleanup of summertime thunderstorms, some of which could be strong to severe today.

They don't like that these comments are re-circulating.

They thought that they had this election in the bag. Now, with Harris, it is an entirely different race. They have an entirely different opponent. And they do believe that she's stronger, in part because she is younger and she is fresher, as J.D. Vance laid out in that private fundraiser. And so, over the next few weeks, we are going to see them really workshopping these lines, may be changing strategy here and there, while they continue to figure out what sticks with her and what the American people find that resonates with them when it comes to the attacks on Harris.

The -- so, what Acting Director Ron Rowe is going to say is that one of the first things that he has done in his new role is go to the Butler rally. And he's going to say that he climbed up on the roof, laid prone, and tried to see what that shooter would have seen.And after doing that, he said point blank in his prepared remarks, what he saw made him ashamed and he says as a -- as a many-decade member of law enforcement as well as a 25-year veteran of the United States Secret Service, he cannot defend why that roof was not better prepared. Amara, there is a lot of new information coming out. Senator Grassley's office has released a trove of text messages as well as body camera, which are showing really the local law enforcement side of this advance as well as the operation, and what these texts messages show is that, on the day of the rally, Thomas Matthew Crooks was spotted by members of local law enforcement 90 minutes before gunfire started. But it seems that local law enforcement lost track of him. And at one point, these text messages suggest that they believe he might have been walking away from the event, like they believe you may have left. So, there was quite a bit of confusion leading up to the gunfire and what we know from the previous hearing was that, while law enforcement on scene believed that this man was suspicious, the Secret Service did not believe that he was a threat until seconds before the gunfire started, and that is obviously just way too late. And so, what you're going to hear from this joint hearing today, this is the Senate Judiciary Committee as well as Senate Homeland and Government Affairs Committee, is going to be a lot of questions about what happened in the advance?. Why was this building, which was just 150 yards from the podium, why was that left out of the secured perimeter? And the secured perimeter means that anybody going in there would have had to go through a mag (ph) basically, so they would have been warned (ph), checked for weapons. So the big question is, why was that building so unsecured, but yet so close to the podium? And then further, what they're going to be looking for is accountability and then certainly, more detail on what the Secret Service is doing right this second to make sure that this never happens again, Amara.",
