Markets are concerned after a key Fed official said that hebelieves rates need to go to at least five percent to control inflation. Those are the markets and these are the main events. The new FTX CEO, a veteran of Enron says he has never before seen such a complete failure of corporate controls. In the UK, people brace for the biggest drop in the standard of living since the 1950s. And a Dutch Court finds three men guilty of mass murder for their role in bringing down MH17. Live from New York, it is Thursday, November 17th. I'm Rahel Solomon, in for Richard Quest and I too mean business. He oversaw one of the biggest bankruptcies of all time at Enron. Now, John Ray is in charge of FTX and says he has never seen anything quite like the failed crypto exchange. In a US Court filing, Ray shredded the company's founder and former CEO, Sam Bankman-Fried, saying: \"Never in my career have I seen such a complete failure of corporate controls. And such a complete absence of trustworthy financial information as occurred here.\" Matt Egan with us now from New York. Matt, good to have you. Look, as I said, John Ray, not new to cleaning up corporate failures, but even according to him, this is something he has not seen. What else did he say in this filing?",

You know, this bankruptcy filing paints the picture of a company that is basically a train wreck. Let me just run you through a few of the highlights from this filing. They say that FTX is basically controlled by a small group of inexperienced, unsophisticated individuals, none of the financial statements appear to have been audited. Again, none of them. Unable to locate any financial statements for at least one affiliate, many units did not have corporate governance, some never had Board meetings. Cash management is so poor that they don't even know how much cash FTX really has. And this is the kicker, corporate funds had been used to buy homes for some employees in the Bahamas. Just stunning findings from this bankruptcy filing that we just had out this morning. And this line from John Ray, I think really sums it up. He said: \"From compromised systems integrity and faulty regulatory oversight abroad to the concentration of control in the hands of a very small group of inexperienced individuals, this situation is on unprecedented.\" Now, Rahel, none of this, of course, is going to sit very well with the hundreds of thousands or even more than a million creditors, mostly customers who have their money stuck with FTX. You've got to wonder how much of a recovery they could really expect, given that the new guys in charge, they don't even know how much cash this company even has.",

But this time around, just be really careful who you give your money, and the original like old school, Bitcoin people would say something, not your keys, not your coins, because crypto is something you can control and be your own bank for. When you trust a third-party entity, like in this case, FTX, they can steal it from you. So if you're really hardcore about your privacy and your crypto just hold it yourself. It's kind of the crypto equivalent of like having your own vault and protecting it. And otherwise, I mean, I think Coinbase is still safe, you know, they've got real reserves.

So it was working against the Central Bank. If you have tax cuts, it increases demand, but of course, doesn't increase supply, so it fuels inflation. This, with tax rises and spending cuts does the opposite, so of course works, as Jeremy Hunt said, in lockstep with the Central Bank and may potentially mean that monetary policy going forward has to be less aggressive, although the jury is still out on that one. In terms of UK inflation and how it compares, it's not great, honestly. It is worse than most of the G7. It's worse than the Euro area. It's worse than the US, which of course, has been sort of coming down a little bit recently. And part of that is because of the international factors that we see, namely, of course, Russia's war in Ukraine, which was sent interest rates and inflation soaring around the world. But there are unique factors to the UK as well, Rahel. The Bank of England Governor this week was talking about the fact that the UK's workforce has shrunk since pre-COVID, fairly significantly, because of long term sickness, and things like early retirement. That, of course, leads to worker shortages, pushes up wages, or they're not enough in this climate. And the other thing, of course, is Brexit, which is still hampering trade, raising costs for businesses and all of that. That may mean that things are slightly worse. Now, and also it may take slightly longer to recover here in the UK.",

Gilt yields rose a little bit, so nothing compared to the reaction that we saw to the mini budget, but still not exactly a ringing endorsement. I think there are major concerns about the OBR, the fiscal watchdog in the UK that gave its forecast today that was pretty bleak for the medium-term outlook and the UK living standards are really going to drop, they say by about seven percent in the next two years, which will wipe out the last eight years of progress. I think there is some trepidation around what that could do. Could it worsen a recession, crush demand, things like that.

So I think the pressure was probably more acute in the UK, but I think in other countries, the concept sort of applies that most countries are facing high inflation, which are much higher than target and Central Banks are obviously trying to do their best in order to curtail that inflation.

So in some way, we could say they ended up announcing a budget, which markets are okay with and they didn't react negatively to it. There was a small drop in sterling and a bit of rice in gilt, but nothing, like what was seen after the mini budget.

Even though her critics will acknowledge she has been effective in pushing through legislation that Republicans don't like but legislation nonetheless, because of the way she's been able to maintain discipline and unity during her time in caucus. She has been leader for the past 20 years of the House Democrats. She became Speaker for the first time in 2007, when she was serving with George W. Bush at the time of the Iraq War. She was a leading critic of, that battling George W. Bush over that issue. Barack Obama came to power a couple of years later. In 2010, she shepherded through the Affordable Care Act in the United States, a sweeping health care bill that had been elusive for decades that Congress had tried to pass. A major priority, kept her party together but that was enough to cause her party control of the House of Representatives. Later in that fall, in the minority for several years, they tried to battle, back and ultimately got back into power in 2019, when she became the Speaker of the House again for the second time, the, only woman ever to serve in that position. But doing it at a time when she was going toe to toe with Donald Trump, ultimately leading impeachment proceedings against the former president two separate times. The only president in history to be impeached twice. That coming in the aftermath of January 6th, when her office was ransacked by pro Trump rioters, when those rioters were targeting her. Immediately after, the next, day at a press conference, she said this president needs to resign or he will be impeached. He was impeached a week later, the fastest impeachment proceeding in American history. But she has been so much, which is why the impact has been so profound. Democrats, even though the ones -- there have been many who wanted a change, wanted a generational change, and are eager for new leadership, we're still recognizing the significance she has had through her time in Congress.",

He hoped it would set a precedent, an example, that all senior Russian officials could be held accountable for their involvement in the crimes here.

On today's \"Call to Earth,\" aconservationist in southern Brazil is fighting to restore the forest one endangered plant species at a time. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) (MUSIC PLAYING) PABLO HOFFMAN, FORESTRY ENGINEER (voice-over):  The Araucaria ecosystem is an ecosystem within the Atlantic forest in Brazil. And within the last 100 years, because of timber exploitation and agribusiness and urban expansion as well, it is one of the most degraded and most risk of disappearing ecosystems in Brazil. Because of this degradation and (INAUDIBLE), most of the plants (INAUDIBLE) are also in a higher risk of disappearing. So what we try to do is to save the species from extinction. My name is Pablo (INAUDIBLE) Hoffman and I am the executive director of (INAUDIBLE). In the beginning, our institution was informally funded in 1997 for a group of forestry students. We like very much kayaking and doing the troops are cutting things discarded like loving the nature and loving specifically the plants. The Araucaria is probably the most important or the symbol of the (INAUDIBLE). Its relationship with all the species make the ecosystem function. We have at this nursery, the Chaua (INAUDIBLE) nursery, the most important number of species of this ecosystem being produced forestation (INAUDIBLE). We are talking about 250 species of plants among trees, shrubs and (INAUDIBLE). The (INAUDIBLE) forest has more than 1,000 species of (INAUDIBLE) plants. When you do restoration projects, you need to reintroduce the most rare species to improve the diversity. This will make the difference for maintaining the species in the long term, avoiding extinction. So especially in this area, we planted 1,600 seedlings of around 100 species. The first step we will map are finding the individuals in the remnant fragments of our forest. After, this we sow the seeds. Then we plant and grow them at the nursery. And the last step is to replant them in the wild. And, in the meanwhile, we also do some scientific research to produce more information about the species. Our project can be a replier to other regions in almost the same way. What we are trying to do is to leave a legacy for the next generations. This means that if we save a species, we will keep the ecosystem functioning. And when the ecosystems are functioning, they bring benefits for humans because we are part of the ecosystem. So I think my families and most of my friends' lives are dedicated to nature, to save nature, to save species and to save humans. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
