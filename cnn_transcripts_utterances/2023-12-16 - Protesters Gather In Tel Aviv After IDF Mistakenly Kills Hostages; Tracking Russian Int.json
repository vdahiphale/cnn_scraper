I'm Jim Acosta in Washington.We begin with new details after three Israeli hostages were mistakenly shot and killed by Israeli soldiers inside Gaza. The chief of the Israeli Defense Forces says he takes responsibility calling it a, quote, \"difficult and painful event.\" A military official says the three men came out of a building shirtless waving a white flag when they were shot by Israeli soldiers. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is calling it an unbearable tragedy. And this was the demonstration that unfolded in Tel Aviv tonight. Hundreds of protesters and families of hostages pleading for the Israeli government to bring back their loved ones. This comes as another hostage, 27-year-old Inbar Haiman, has died while being held captive by Hamas, according to the Israeli prime minister's office. Her death means 21 hostages have now died inside Gaza, while 129 others remain held captive at this hour. And CNN's Alex Marquardt is live for us in Tel Aviv. Alex, the prime minister just spoke. What's he saying about the hostages? What can you tell us?",

And it was very emotional, and there were a lot of people out there who feel like Prime Minister Netanyahu isn't doing nearly enough to bring those hostages home. Now he did speak just a short time ago. He said that the whole country is mourning, and he talked about the horrible tragedy that happened yesterday with these three hostages killed.He said we were so close to embracing them, basically they were so close to being freed and escaping from more than 70 days in captivity. But he did not take any kind of responsibility for what happened then yesterday with those Israeli troops killing the Israeli hostages. He actually said that military pressure is what is needed to get these hostages home. He has repeatedly pointed to the military operations as a way of squeezing Hamas to get those hostages released. And a lot of these hostage families disagree with that and are now saying that Israel needs to be much more proactive about putting a plan on the table, about negotiating with Hamas to get the hostages home now.

MICHAEL OREN, FORMER ISRAELI AMBASSADOR TO THE U.S.: Hi, Jim, good to be with you. Excruciate, unbearable. We didn't think that we could endure any more pain from this war and what precipitated the onslaught of October 7th, but this is truly unbearable. Unbearable for the families of the hostages who were killed, unbearable for the soldiers who killed them, who have been in combat for many weeks now, in the fog of combat, facing an enemy who doesn't wear a uniform, and can even be a suicide bomber. So tremendous confusion. We've heard already on your broadcast that the chief of staff of the Israeli Defense Forces took responsibility. The defense minister took responsibility. All these are extraordinary events here in Israel, and we're reeling with it. Having said all that, I think the vast majority of Israelis are determined to continue the struggle until Hamas is defeated because it faced the war. We have no option. ACOSTA: And Ambassador, I mean, should this tragic mistake be some kind of catalyst for re-examining the military strategy in Gaza? I mean, I understand what you're saying that Israelis by and large are going to want to continue the struggle and defeat Hamas and all of those larger goals that you laid out.

And yes, I do expect there'd to be another round certainly of negotiations and hope those negotiations will bear fruit. At the end of the day, Hamas will not release all the hostages.Hamas knows that when the last hostage is freed, that's when Israel could fill those tunnels with sea water or some flammable substances and that would be the end of Hamas. Those hostages are the get-out-of- Gaza-free card for Hamas. And so the ground incursion will continue. The pressure will continue to mount on Hamas. Hopefully it will relinquish as many hostages as possible and maybe there's some grand bargain at the end of it. Now keep in mind, one other thing that people tend to forget that Hamas is demanding the release from Israeli prisons of terrorists who have been sentenced to life imprisonment for killing Israelis. If Israel were to release those prisoners, you'd have to deal with the families of those murdered Israelis. They count too, and even a pause means that Hamas will reorganize and regroup and rearm, and we'll maybe gain some hostages' lives but we're liable to lose some soldiers' lives as well.",

And it set off a mad scramble at the White House to redact these documents of this sensitive information, with the idea being that they could then be declassified and released. Now the president did issue a declassification order on the final full day of his presidency but that did not actually lead to these documents being released.

Excuse me, she saw him taking it from the White House on the second to last day of the presidency tucked under his arm.Now as you said, Mr. Meadows' attorney, he strongly denies this, and he said in a statement to CNN, Mr. Meadows was keenly aware of and adhered to requirements for the proper handling of classified material. Any such material that he handled or was in his possession has been treated accordingly and any suggestion that he is responsible for any missing binder or other classified information is flat wrong. Now it's also worth noting here, Jim, that this binder and this intelligence was not among the items that was found when the FBI searched the former president's residence last year, Mar-a-Lago, and it also was not among the items that the FBI was looking for when it searched Mar-a-Lago.

You saw how few countries were willing to sport them even as they had the worst attacks against Jews since the Holocaust. And so the information space that they are in is very different than what we're debating in the United States or what's being discussed around the world.

He was doing that to avoid incarcerations, investigations against him, something we're very familiar with in the United States. And also to support his far right-wing colleagues in his coalition government who want to expand their control, their dominion over the Palestinians, take more territory that doesn't belong to them, illegal settlements in the West Bank. So that's the problem. Those people are still this government today. They're not likely to be after the war is over. But, but you know, part of the problem here is that Netanyahu is incented to keep this war going for his own domestic political purposes in ways that are not necessarily fully aligned with those of long-term Israeli national security. Now, Biden knows this. Biden is, by far, the best friend of the Israeli people on the global stage today. No other country is doing for Israel and taking the political risk for Israel that the Americans are under Biden right now. But he's not a friend of Netanyahu. He doesn't trust Netanyahu. And so far, the Israeli prime minister has been playing Biden a fair amount because he knows that Biden won't come after him publicly. And I know there are people advising Biden who need to take some more swings at the Israeli prime minister. I am personally in that camp.

That state's primary, of course, is next month.CNN senior data reporter, Harry Enten, joins us now to run the numbers. Harry, New Hampshire's governor this week endorsed Nikki Haley. There was a big response to that for Nikki Haley supporters. The question is whether these endorsements really matter all that much. Do they move the numbers? What do the numbers say? HARRY ENTEN, CNN SENIOR DATA REPORTER: I mean, look, here's the fact. What was so interesting to me about that Haley endorsement from Chris Sununu was the fact that it was only her second endorsement from a sitting governor or member of Congress. Ron DeSantis only has seven endorsements from sitting members of Congress or governors. Donald Trump at this point has nearly a hundred. So the Haley thing stands out because it's an outlier, not because it's some magic bullet that's going to help her win New Hampshire. Maybe it will. But the fact of the matter is Donald Trump, who I think we often think of as an anti-establishment candidate, is, this time around, Jim, the candidate of the establishment. There's no other way to put it. For goodness sake, he has pretty much the backing of Mike Johnson who's the speaker of the House. Kevin McCarthy says he'll eventually back him. When you put it all together. Donald Trump likes to say he's an anti- establishment candidate, but if endorsements matter, Donald Trump has to like what he has.",

There's only one exception to that rule, and that was Donald Trump back in 2016. But this, to me, Jim, is just another sign that this Donald Trump candidacy is very different from those in years past. This is a candidacy that is much more tradition that will, and Donald Trump has to like that he has all of these endorsements.",
