      "sentences": "-- 11 p.m. in London and 6world, this is your \"First Move.\" And a warm welcome to \"First Move,\" as always. And here's today's need to know. Trump trials, a New York judge upholding the hush money conviction against the president-elect and sets the date for sentencing 10 days before the inauguration. Speaker success. Republican Mike Johnson winning the speakership vote after Donald Trump personally calls the holdouts. Seoul standoff. South Korea's anti-corruption office suspend their attempt to arrest President Yoon, but the warrant is still active. And triumphs and tributes. Superstar chef Vikas Khanna on his award-winning New York restaurant Bungalow and the heartbreak that inspired it. That conversation and plenty more coming up. But first Donald Trump's hush money conviction has been upheld by Judge Juan Merchan. A New York jury found Trump guilty last May on 34 counts of falsifying business records. The case centered around payments to his then lawyer Michael Cohen, and hush money payments to porn star Stormy Daniels. Despite going forward with his sentencing, the judge overseeing the case says Trump will face no legal penalties. Sentencing is set for January 10th, just 10 days before Trump is sworn in as the next U.S. president. Legal analyst and former U.S. attorney Michael Moore joins us now. Michael, great to have you with us. The legal team for the president-elect did everything they could to avoid having sentencing before the inauguration day. So far, that's now failed. What do you expect to happen in terms of perhaps a potential emergency appeal before then? I can understand from the judge's perspective doing this to a president-elect easier than to a president. MICHAEL MOORE, CNN LEGAL ANALYST AND FORMER U.S. ATTORNEY: Yes. Well, I'm glad to be with you. I mean, this is not a big surprise coming from this judge who has insisted that the case move forward. But I think you'll likely see an appeal. Really, this is a little bit of a favor to Trump, if you ask me, because this sentencing by the judge, even doing it as an unconditional discharge, which is indicated he would do, which means that there would be no jail, no fine, no probation, mostly no penalty, it simply allows him to finalize this jury verdict. Then at that point, the Trump team can ultimately appeal. So, that appeal will be in place. I think you'll now see some emergency efforts to try to move forward and ask a state appeals court to stop this or to delay it for some reason. But the judge has been pretty clever in his scheduling order, and he's talked about those things that are -- it may be of concern. So, that -- you know, you can't take away from the time of the transition and that there are other things administration needs to be thinking about. And so, he's allowed -- the soon to be president to essentially appear by video, if that's easier. And that sort of takes the ammunition out of the argument that this will somehow -- this sentencing will somehow be an impediment to the transition team moving forward. So, he's already taken a few of the teeth out of any emergency appeal, but I'm certain we're going to see it. Because, you know, frankly, the Trump team has appealed with some regularity and to some success, and one of the reasons that you see these delays in all of these cases.",

To me, the real significance of today was that it reinforced the message of the budget and debt ceiling fight last month, which is that the sole source of pressure on Johnson and really the sole source of dissent among Republicans to Trump is on the right, and on the right specifically on the issue of demanding bigger spending cuts. And with the Trump tax cuts barreling down the road, as you -- as Johnson noted in that clip that you played, we are headed toward a reprise of debates we have had for many years that have often proved tough for Republicans where big tax cuts are linked directly to big spending cuts.",

What's also interesting to me and President-Elect Trump has also said that he wouldn't let this deal go ahead. He's willing to welcome a hundred billion dollars from SoftBank, also a Japanese company, into what one could argue today is way more politically and economically sensitive, which is things like A.I. and technology versus this deal for something which is steel-based and arguably a lot less important today than it was.",

And the idea that they alone should -- or theyshould be controlled by American companies alone. Even though, again, historically, they have not been. There have been Many plants that have been owned by Japanese -- owned or invested in by Japanese companies. Whereas as, as you point out, as you rightly point out, that some of these newer technologies where the technology could cross borders, might be abused in some way, maybe you would be more concerned about that technology being in the hands of some foreign country. Although, maybe not Japan or Korea for that matter, given that these are friends of ours. It's -- it would be different, I think, if we were talking about Russia or China or other countries that we have much more complicated, perhaps adversarial relationships with, but just none of that is the case in this particular set of facts. And as much as Biden, as well as Trump may think that they are helping the working class, are helping blue collar workers by this protectionist move, in fact, their jobs are being put at risk. And that's why you've seen a lot of division, frankly, within the union membership. The union itself has come out very strongly against this deal, but a lot of the workers are divided because they do see the writing on the wall. They do see that this cash infusion would be helpful to them. And by the way, this week, Nippon Steel even made a last, you know, sort of a Hail Mary offer by promising that it would not reduce steel capacity within the next 10 years without the explicit permission and approval of the U.S. government. So, you know, that's about protecting this industry, although, capacity may not be the same thing as jobs. Maybe that's what they were concerned about being replaced by robots. I don't know.

Launched last spring, Bungalow has already become one of New York's most popular dining hotspots. The New York Times awarded it a much coveted three stars. And in late December, it won a Michelin Bib Gourmand Award. Sufficing to say, it's one of the toughest reservations out there. Now, Bungalow is co-owned by Michelin star chef Vikas Khanna, who also is an author, filmmaker, and MasterChef India host. I also have the honor of calling him a dear friend. Now, we sat down late last month to discuss the success of Bungalow, what influences his cooking, and by far most importantly, how his beloved late sister Radhika, Radz, was critical in imagining what Bungalow could and should be. She died almost three years ago and therefore, never saw those ideas come to life. Vikas says her absence during this time of triumph fills him with the deepest regret. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) VIKAS KHANNA, CHEF AND CO-OWNER, BUNGALOW AND FILMMAKER: I still feel incomplete. Because somebody used to -- at this time, somebody used to call me Mera Sher, which means my lion. Generally, the first phone call will be her because we were in the same time zone. And I would call my sister when something big happened and she said, Mera Sher, we're going to show the world. Many big artifacts of the restaurants were planned, commissioned on the deathbed at Columbia Hospital, which she visited a few times. And this kept her going. We're going to make it. I think it was a maternal instinct of her. And I'm like, no, I don't care. It has to be a successful restaurant. You know, we are going to -- she's saying, no. It has to be a big restaurant. She said, no. It has to be a deeper restaurant.",
