Essentially, she had a year's long relationship with Herschel Walker, dating back to the 1980s. It was in 1993, shortly before the end of their relationship, when she said that he personally ensured that she get an abortion. This happened, according to her, in the state of Texas.That she learned she was pregnant. He drove her to the abortion clinic and ensured she get an abortion. She initially went without him and did not go through with the abortion. She told him this, that she was not comfortable with it. Then Walker, the next day, took her to the abortion clinic and ensured she had the abortion. Took her to receive medication soon after that. She then left Texas soon after saying that she was so traumatized. She says she has seen Walker deny the allegations from the other accuser and specifically that he never signs his letters with the letter H. She says he, in fact, sent her letters with the letter H. But ultimately, she argues that Walker is not morally fit to serve in the United States senate. She also says that this is not politically motivated, saying she's a registered independent and voted for former president Donald Trump twice. But feels, I think, so motivated to come forward due to seeing Walker take this hard line anti-abortion position, but says that in her -- in his personal life, he took a very different position -- John.",

One way they will do that is through an educational campaign. And a key part of that strategy is leaning on Trump era national security officials such as former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to try to make the case to these members. There's also talks about holding hearings on Russian war crimes to remind people what is happening on the ground. But so far, GOP defense hawks feel like they are going to prevail.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) NADA BASHIR, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  The final resting place of Mahsa Zhina Amini, a place of mourning and now of protest. Amini's name has become synonymous with a movement those posing the biggest threat to the Iranian regime in years, sparked in the wake of the 22- year-old's death while in the custody of Iran's notorious morality police, detained for allegedly contravening the country's strict dress code. But now, as the Iranian people commemorate 40 days since Amini's death, a significant marker of mourning and remembrance, it has grown to become far more wide reaching than its initial call for women's rights. As more and more protesters take to the streets demanding regime change. Amini's death is now remembered alongside a growing list of women and young girls who have lost their lives at the hands of Iran's security forces, though, authorities deny responsibility, disregarding the mounting evidence of the regime's brutal and deadly crackdown on protesters.",

It's really across the board, old, young, men, women, religious, traditional, and more liberal and reform-minded. And this is what's really different. And what you have is a regime that is teetering on not knowing what it should do. Should it actually unleash all the might of the security forces and do a lot more damage and kill a lot more people and injure more people and arrest a lot more people than they already have? Or have they got to try and manage it? Because they know the regime that in every household, including in the religious households, including in the households of the government ministers and the like, including of the Revolutionary Guard, in the Basij, there are young girls and women, mothers, sisters, daughters who are joined in this struggle. This struggle is exceptional because even the law enforcement is saying that the average age of those who have been arrested so far are girls of around 15 to 16. I mean, that's an incredible statistic. It's happening in schools. Every day now you see this gorilla protest starting up -- they're not massive. They're not tens of thousands on one corner.
