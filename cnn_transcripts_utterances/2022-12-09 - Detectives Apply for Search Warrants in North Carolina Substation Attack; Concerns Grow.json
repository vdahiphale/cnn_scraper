      "sentences": "Right now, in North Carolina, the power is back on, and authorities have applied for search warrants as they investigate who is behind the attack on the state's electric substations. Sources tell CNN authorities are honing in on two potential extremists' motives. CNN's Whitney Wild has the latest on the investigation. So, Whitney what more do we know about these search warrants?",

We don't know how many, and we don't know what they're for, but what it does show, Bianna, is that law enforcement is continuing to move at a rapid pace. They're doing whatever they can to try and find the person or people responsible for shooting these substations Saturday night. For causing a massive power outage that lasted five days here in Moore County.Meanwhile, law enforcement really pushing the public to try to help them generate as many leads as possible. They're offering an up to $75,000 reward for any information leading to the arrest of the suspect or suspects responsible here. And Bianna, they're canvassing the area trying to collect as much video as possible. Video that from cameras that may be affixed to nearby homes, trying to collect as much information as they can. Possibly someone might have caught the suspect on video or would have otherwise relevant information. Law enforcement says that they are fielding hundreds of tips, Bianna. So, the hope is they will have a very solid break in this case very soon. Back to you.",

But there are a group of Republicans who are pushing for them to be reinstated with back pay over the course of the last several months. So that is one possibility that the Pentagon may be preparing for. But again, it depends on the wording which is why the Pentagon is being very careful in what it says at this point.",

Today the CDC said more than a third of flu-related hospitalizations and deaths were reported in just the last week. CNN's Jacqueline Howard joins us to break down the numbers. So, Jacqueline, I know health officials are bracing for a possible surge in hospitalizations after the holidays. What are they telling you?",

      "sentences": "That's right, Bianna. I'm hearing that there is a lot of concern and the reason why flu activity here in the United States is still very high. And here are the latest numbers from the CDC released just this morning. So, we do know that so far at least there have been 13 million flu illnesses. About 120,000 people have been hospitalized due to flu, and we know there have been 7,300 deaths and sadly, Bianna, 21 of those were pediatric deaths, so in children. So, that's where we are right now.And if you look at this map of respiratory virus activity across the country, all but seven states as you see on this map are experiencing high or very high levels of activity. The blue is the highest, and then the dark red is where there's high activity, and only seven states, again, are not having this high to very high respiratory activity happening. So, we are hearing from many health officials across the country. They're encouraging people, get your flu shot if you haven't already. Of course, follow this mitigation measures that we all know like washing your hands frequently, and some health officials are encouraging people to put masks back on. And even in New York City, the health department there is urging residents to wear masks indoors while in public, and in crowded public places because of these high levels of respiratory virus activity right now, Bianna.",

So, as we get our annual flu shots and as we COVID shots, you could get a two in one. And what we've heard is that the FDA has agreed to fast track the review of this vaccine. What this means is that while they review the data, it will be an expedited process so that we could see sooner than later this process of Pfizer applying for authorization for this combo vaccine.And Bianna, I can tell you that we've been hearing from several vaccine developers about this combination approach. Novavax is another company that's working on a combo flu and COVID vaccine. So, moving forward as we see this possibly develop into an annual shot, we could be getting our flu shot and our COVID shots in one moving forward -- Bianna. Yes, streamlining it would be a game changer. That is true. Jacqueline Howard, thank you.",

And also -- but Morocco as well, Bianna, just an incredible story. Morocco taking on Portugal. And Morocco who were ever the first Arab nation to get through to the last state, seeking to become the first African nation to get to the semifinals of the World Cup. They take on Portugal.
