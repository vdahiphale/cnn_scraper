And the huge question today is what will that response be and when will it happen? How imminent could this be? And what role will the United States play?The White House and President Biden are now in constant communication with Israeli counterparts, senior administration officials, saying the U.S. does not believe Israel has made a determination on how to respond, but it could include strikes on nuclear targets or other targets in Iran. We have breaking overnight though. Already new airstrikes on Beirut from Israel and forces saying ongoing strikes against Iranian-backed Hezbollah targets are now continuing in the north here, as we're also learning, the IDF has deployed a new division of troops on Lebanon's southern border with new calls for more people from Lebanon to evacuate from villages. And Jeremy Diamond is live with me here in Tel Aviv. You know, Jeremy, even just the scale of in this moment that we're in, what is Israel going to do? When are they going to do it?

I mean, just think of all of the things that we have had happened over the course of the last year, where you're approaching the anniversary of October 7th. We have seen these moments over the course of the last year where it seems like this conflict between Israel and Hamas could explode into a wider regional war.Israel is now very much at war with Hezbollah to the north in Lebanon, as its troops move deeper into Lebanon. The Israeli military adding more troops there. And now, of course, as we have seen Israel strike the head of Hamas in the capital of Iran, we have seen them take out Hassan Nasrallah, and now Iran carrying out this ballistic missile attack, which they say is in retaliation for those killings. And now the question is, following this attack, which was mostly intercepted by Israel's air defense, but we have seen so many videos of this attack striking air bases in Southern Israel. We have seen multiple explosions there. I visited several sites. And now the question, of course, is how will Israel respond. And they are certainly under enormous pressure to do so. And how they calibrate it will be critical to seeing how this plays out.",

Which is to say, will it strike Iran's nuclear facilities, for example, try and set that nuclear program back?That is very much being considered right now by the Israeli Security Cabinet, which convened last night. I expect that there will be more consultations in the coming days. There's not a sense that Israel is going to respond immediately but it certainly will respond and at a time and place of its choosing, as we heard from the Israeli military's chief of staff yesterday, and similar comments from the prime minister as well.",

Let's bring in CNN White House Correspondent Arlette Saenz. And, Arlette, I mean, this is the crucial question for the world and for Iran and for those who are worried about a much broader conflagration that could -- you know, people talking about their fear of a World War III-type scenario.

And then there is the question, if Israel does respond, which people do expect, how exactly and what exactly the U. S would do to support that response.So, a lot of big questions for President Biden this morning as they are waking up to yet another very highly tense moment in the Middle East. He also said that he does plan to speak with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at some point.
