At least 100 people were killed and 150 others injured after a fire broke out at a wedding hall in the north of the country. A wedding guest says the bride and groom are devastated but are doing fine. Firefighters are looking through the burnt-out building for survivors.And the Prime Minister says officials will \"do everything\" they can to help those affected by the sad incident. While authorities say the fire was caused by candles and fireworks used during the wedding ceremony. And the situation was made worse by \"the use of highly flammable low-cost building materials that collapse within minutes when fire breaks out.\" Well, next, we turn our attention to Armenia where there is a growing humanitarian crisis and influx of refugees after neighboring Azerbaijan defeated separatists in the breakaway region of Nagorno- Karabakh. The Armenian government says more than 28,000 \"forcibly displaced persons\" from the Enclave have arrived in the country as of Tuesday. The mass exodus has led to this scene that you see right here. The only road connecting the region to Armenia packed full of cars as people tried to flee. The International Committee of the Red Cross tell CNN it is working with officials to open more aid routes into Nagorno-Karabakh. Many ethnic Armenians lament having to leave their homes behind.

This comes a week after Azerbaijani troops launched a lightning offensive to regain control over the long-disputed territory. It lasted just 24 hours before the outgunned separatist Armed Forces agreed to a Russian brokered ceasefire and to disarm. Nagorno-Karabakh for decades has been an internationally recognized part of Azerbaijan but populated by 120,000 ethnic Armenians and is long functioned as long functioned as a de facto enclave of Armenia.

One is the written essay which can be on any text on the syllabus, doesn't have to be on Swift, although you are super welcome to include Swift.And the other part is a more creative assignment where I asked them to reflect on the course and what they've learned and something that will kind of stick with them and they can do whatever they like for that. So I'm encouraging them to do like, they could write a song, they could make a podcast, they could make a video, a piece of art, whatever they like.",
