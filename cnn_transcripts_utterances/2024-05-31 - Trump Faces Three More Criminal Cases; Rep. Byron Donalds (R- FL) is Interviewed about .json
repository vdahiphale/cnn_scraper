      "sentences": "Kate, it's a long road ahead for Donald Trump in these three other criminal cases he's facing, the classified documents case in Florida in federal court, where he's accused of mishandling national security secrets and obstructing justice. And then the two cases he's facing related to charges around the 2020 election, January 6th, a state case in Georgia, and a federal case in Washington, D.C.All three of these have no trial dates at this time. That's because there is work to be done in all of the different fronts of these three cases. One by one, let's take them. The classified documents case in Florida, that's bogged down at the moment in legal work. Judge Aileen Cannon has a lot of requests from the defense that she's needing to get through. She has hearing set out until the end of July. The trial date is currently postponed. There just isn't one on the calendar. And there's a lot of work to do about how classified documents can be used in that case, potentially shown to a jury. It's going to take several months to get through all of that. Don't expect a trial this year. In the other two cases, a lot is up in the air this month. That's when the Supreme Court is expected to rule, before the end of their term, on questions of presidential immunity. This is primarily going to affect the federal case against Donald Trump. But whatever the Supreme Court does could have quite an effect in the Georgia case as well against him related to the 2020 election. And the Supreme Court ruling is at a point where it could create a couple different paths, either no trial at all, cases dismissed against Donald Trump if the Supreme Court gives broad protection to Donald Trump because he was serving in the presidency. But then, Kate, there is also the possibility they could define the presidency and the immunity a president gets and send this back into the court system so that judges could put trials on the calendar in the coming months.
