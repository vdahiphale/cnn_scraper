A member of Nigeria's ruling all progressive Congress Party. CNN's Stephanie Busari joining us live from Lagos with more on this. So, what happens now especially given all the allegations and the outrage of a vote rigging? STEPHANIE BUSARI, CNN SENIOR EDITOR, AFRICA (on camera): Good morning, John. Nigerians are waking up to a new president elect. And Bola Ahmed Tinubu has harbored a lifelong ambition to become president, and this morning, he's been declared. Now, as you say, the opposition parties have said that they do not accept this mandate, they do not accept the results. But the only recourse available to them is the cause as mandated by Nigeria's constitution. So, they -- a lot of lawyers will be very happy in their selections, they will be gearing up to stage a legal battle against these results. But for now, Bola Ahmed Tinubu remains the president elect of this country. Let me read you a little bit of what he has been saying in his acceptance speech this morning, John. This is a serious mandate. I hereby accept it. I'll be your servant and not be your leader to work with you to make Nigeria a great country. I take this opportunity to appeal to my fellow contestants, let us team up together. It is the only nation we have, it is one country, and we must build together. Let's work together to put broken pieces together. Now, he faces an uphill battle. There are a lot of broken pieces. He has to bring the economy back to life. It's on life support right now. He has to tackle huge public debt. He also has to unite a country that's very divided along religious lines, ethnic lines, and now generational lines. Many of the young people voted for his opponent, Peter Obi, who was known as a kind of third horse candidate. The first time a third candidate has tried to break the two party domination of this country but unfortunately, has failed to do so, John.",

The U.S. Supreme Court heard argument Tuesday in two challenges to President Joe Biden's student loan debt relief plan. Demonstrators gathered in Washington to back the president's plan. It could potentially forgive federal debt of up to $10,000 for individuals making less than $125,000 a year, canceling up to $20,000 on debt for individuals on Pell grants. Some of the more conservative justices on the court appear skeptical, but an Obama appointee signaled Mr. Biden has the right of way from Congress. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

A senior Pentagon official told U.S. lawmakers Iran could produce a bomb's worth of fissile material in about 12 days. Iran has continued enriching uranium to near weapons-grade level, in violation of the nuclear agreement reached during the Obama administration. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) COLIN KAHL, U.S. UNDERSECRETARY OF DEFENSE FOR POLICY: Iran's nuclear progress since we left the JCPOA has been remarkable. Back in 2018, when the previous administration decided to leave the JCPOA, it would have taken Iran about 12 months to produce one fissile -- one bomb's worth of fissile material. Now it would take about 12 days. And so, I think there is still the view that, if you can resolve this issue diplomatically and put constraints back on their nuclear program, it is better than the other options. (END VIDEO CLIP)",
