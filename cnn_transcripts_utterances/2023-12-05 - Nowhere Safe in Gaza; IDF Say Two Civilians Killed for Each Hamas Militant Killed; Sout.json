Of course, remember when the Iron Dome takes down rockets that are fired from Gaza, shrapnel falls to the ground. And that can hurt people and that appears to be the case for at least one person. But it is rather rare to see an impact. Of course, when these rockets are fired, they are often intercepted by the Iron Dome. Israelis and Tel Avivians have become accustomed to the sound of these sirens. But when we saw that large plume of smoke just to the north of us in northern Tel Aviv, that really was quite remarkable. Oftentimes, the Iron Dome will allow rockets to get through if they don't feel like -- if it does not determine that a rocket is going to harm civilians. But in this case that impact site was quite close to a residential population.",

Frankly, I can see it cleared up a bit. But you are giving me a sense of what is to come, the change in weather and how that is going to exacerbate the situation on the ground in Gaza. Give me a sense of what you are hearing from aid organizations. BEN WEDEMAN, CNN SR. INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Well, they have been ringing the alarm bells now for the past 48-72 hours. Concerned the Israeli are focusing their military strength on the southern part of the Gaza Strip, an area where people have been advised, just a few weeks ago, to go south to avoid being harmed by Israeli military operations. It appears that is exactly what is going on. We just got video of a house where displaced people were staying, about 50 people. That house was directly hit in an Israeli airstrike this afternoon. And there were dozens of fatalities as a result. In addition to that, the humanitarian situation is nothing short of catastrophic. You have tens of thousands of people, basically living out in the open in weather like this. It is getting to the winter. It is part of the eastern Mediterranean. Winters are cold and wet. Today is a very good example of that. On top of that, not much aid is actually entering Gaza from Egypt. Our understanding is, so far today, only 20 trucks have entered Gaza with food and medical supplies. That is about a tenth of the number that were coming in during the seven- day truce, which means, increasingly, starvation is a defense possibility. People simply have to do what they can to get something to eat. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) WEDEMAN (voice-over):  Desperate times call for desperate measures. And in Gaza, if that means looting the local bakery, destroyed overnight by an Israeli airstrike, so be it. \"Look at the people,\" says Ikram Arayi (ph). \"They're doing this out of hunger. It was the Barakah Bakery.\" Barakah is Arabic for blessing. But now Gaza is under the curse of war. It was the last functioning bakery in Deir el-Balah. People's basic needs. Striking it is a kind of terrorism. Once the sun came up Monday, people of all ages descended upon the bakery, taking away bags of flour, cooking oil, scraps of wood to use for cooking and heating and just about anything else they could carry away. This man describes it in one word:  chaos. The World Food Programme's Abeer Etefa warns the people of Gaza are reaching the breaking point.",

Yesterday, the Israelis say they allowed 180 trucks through into the Gaza Strip. But the Palestinian Red Crescent Society said they only received 75. That is even lower than what the U.N. humanitarian operation said, 100 trucks. Whatever the number, 75, 100, 180, it is still a tiny drop in the ocean, considering the needs of almost 80 percent of a population that is displaced. A lot of them are now moving south where they are living in the street, any open space that's available because the south, where they were told to evacuate to, is no longer safe for them. The U.N. office of (INAUDIBLE) coordination of humanitarian affairs says, the conditions for the delivery of aid do not exist and whenever aid is coming in, it's not sufficient. On top of that, just the Rafah crossing alone is not enough to meet the needs of people across the Gaza Strip. People have died (INAUDIBLE) everywhere. Nowhere is safe. They've lost everything. They need everything, not just food, water, medicine, shelter, just about everything. So many people left with just their clothes and their families.

They are sending information out, where people arebeing told exactly where it is dangerous and where to move to. Frankly, we heard this even when they were targeting the north. We saw strikes in the south, where people listening to the IDF had moved but still they were part of strikes. Do you think the Israelis are not getting it right in terms of the actual direct targeting, that they are saying they are doing but a very different scenario is playing out on the ground?",

The Israelis can say they are being precise but the evidence on the ground suggests otherwise, given thesheer number of civilians who have been killed in this. Even the most elite militaries of the world, of which I would consider Israel one, is unable to completely minimize or mitigate civilian casualties in an urban setting like Gaza. It is just so densely packed, even the most minor error is going to lead to civilian deaths. So I think we are very much minimizing civilian casualties, in a scorched earth approach, to hunting down Hamas, they are objectives that work across purposes. That is what we are seeing here.",

I think the administration wants this operation wrapped up before the new year but the Israelis are pushing back at that, saying they have their own timetable. What I have not heard yet is a plan for what happens once the fighting stops. So when will this end is the first question. The second is how will this end. Unless there are resources dedicated to thinking through the political part of this, the negotiated settlement, I think it is shortsighted on the Israeli side.",
