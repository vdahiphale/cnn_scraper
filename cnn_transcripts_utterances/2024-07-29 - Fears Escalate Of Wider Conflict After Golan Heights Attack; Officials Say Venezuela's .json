However, what the opposition was hoping for, and what the international community was hoping for, was a competitive election, was an election that could bring an end to the impasse that Venezuela has been living through in the last decade with an authoritarian government that day-after-day lacks most of the international legitimacy. Well, yesterday's results, Bianna, unfortunately do not give any sense of legitimacy with most South American and Latin American countries all asking for an audition, all asking to see the full results. The ballot papers that the electoral authorities have said grant that victory to Nicolas Maduro just because, as you said, there is that discrepancy between the latest numbers from before the vote and some informal exit polls that we have collected in Venezuela. It's illegal to share any exit polls. The electoral authority is the only authority allowed by the law to give results. But there is, of course, a lot of concern. It's interesting that the only countries, at least in Latin America, that have already celebrated Nicolas Maduro's victory are Cuba, Nicaragua, and Bolivia. Even left wing democracies here such as Chile, and especially the president of Brazil, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, have shown a lot of -- have shown a lot of urgency to and demanded to see those act. The opposition has, so far, stepped short of calling for in -- for widespread mass protests on the street like the ones that we used to see in 2017 or 2019. But, of course, tension is rising very rapidly here in Venezuela, Bianna. And in the next few days, you could see some of those clashes taking back place on the streets of Caracas.",

They have -- they suspended the audit of the process. They haven't published in their portal the information, which is what they usually do and they have done in past processes. And so it's basically the government that has to prove that those numbers, those figures, have any kind of, say, real basis. And that is what the governments around the region have been asking for. Maduro has come out of this much weaker than what he -- than what he entered in this process because he was looking for legitimacy and so far has not obtained that legitimacy. On the other hand, the opposition has come up very strong. The figure, the support of the opposition candidate that, Edmundo Gonzalez is really astonishing. It's beyond it. It's higher than what the poll -- the poll had predicted. So the opposition is now in the -- in the -- in the process of first consolidating the diplomatic support that it has received throughout the region is also in the process of just pushing, pressing the government to come up with these figures.

The U.S. intelligence estimates are that they probably have 150,000 rockets, drones, others in storage so they could overwhelm the Israeli defenses. And, of course, Israel is stretched thin here now.

They don't usually havethat bigger voice in this, but clearly it's a more reform-oriented set of individuals who were hoping would be a voice of calm here, but we don't know what their role is. The second big factor is the Iranians did step back a little bit after their missile attacks back in April on Israel and Israel's counter response. We thought that could escalate. It did not. And that would be pretty much the model that you'd want to follow here. I think the Iranians are being cautious for the same reason Hezbollah is.

And it comes as Marvel crossed the $30 billion mark across all of its movies at the box office.
