And they want greater assistance from their. EU partners. But at the end of the day, it's about the fact that the number one sort of polarizing issue in Europe in many ways, as with the United States, is the question of immigration. And based on people's perceptions and experiences from news stories, from politics and so on, there's a perception that there is a crisis, that it's out of control and that it's a threat to not just the nation, but the EU zone in general, and that therefore the European Union must respond.And it would seem at this junction that no matter what you do with facts, reason and so on. The fact is that the narrative of immigration in Europe today has gone from being something positive, the sort of the foundation of European countries towards something extremely negative.

And when it gets down to the sort of the really kind of fundamental sort of issues that countries like Italy had, the first point of entry for migrant is still the country in which one is processed. What the European Union has tried to argue is that this new policy strikes a sort of an improved balance between the kind of logistical deterrence aspects, safety, security, and so on, and also the human rights aspects.But actually, what's contained in this policy, is really an increased focus, which is really, I think, of great concern towards outsourcing and externalizing migration. In other words, working with third-party countries, non-EU countries, to do the processing before they actually arrive in Europe. And that's something that human rights organizations have been talking about for a while, that undermines those rights and also forgets in this whole equation that the right to migrate is a human right.

And Orban has already spoken out, the prime minister of Hungary, saying that under no circumstances will he participate and work along with what is supposed to be a success and an example of EU solidarity.At the end of the day, once again, and we saw this in the lesson of Brexit, the more the European Union makes concessions and mainstreaming streams and kind of works with these far-right parties over their anti-immigration status, ultimately, the more they end up legitimizing them and making them more palatable, ultimately, to the electorate. And we see this once again, Orban instrumentalizing this with, as you mentioned, the upcoming early June European elections, where it's clear that the EU vote will be used once again by far-right parties that will, you know, optimize their votes by appealing to what is a low turnout election and ultimately shaping that agenda, which I think ultimately will lead to ever increasing and harsher legislation, which unfortunately never really meets the desired outcome in this context.

Trump's team argued a delay was needed to appeal a lower court's ruling on presidential immunity and a bunch of other irrelevant stuff. The criminal trial regards payments made to adult film star Stormy Daniels to cover up an alleged one-night stand with Trump nearly two days -- two decades ago. Trump can still appeal the denied motions to New York's highest court, but it doesn't have to accept that appeal. And it's happening on Monday. First time a president, a former president sitting in a criminal trial. Well, they call themselves the Goon Squad. A group of white law enforcement officers in the U.S. state of Mississippi known for their aggressive, violent tactics against criminal suspects. Now, six of those former officers are facing lengthy prison sentences for the racist and brutal torture of two black men in January of last year. CNN's Ryan Young has our report. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",
