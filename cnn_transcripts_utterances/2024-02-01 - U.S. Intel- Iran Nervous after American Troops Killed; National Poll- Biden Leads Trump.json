So we are told that the U.S. has seen signs that Iranian leadership is concerned by some of the more recent escalations by its proxy groups.I think it's important to remember that Iran does not have perfect command and control over the many proxy groups that exist in Iraq, Syria, and of course, the Houthis in Yemen. And so what we're told is that, when the Islamic resistance, which U.S. officials have said is responsible for that drone attack that killed three U.S. service members on Sunday, launched that drone attack and ended up killing three Americans, that really kind of was a wake-up call for Tehran, and it made them nervous. And they are not seeking an all-out war with the United States, and they have for that reason been trying to calibrate their approach in a way that kind of harasses U.S. and Western interests in the region via these proxy groups but doesn't necessarily back the United States into a corner where it feels forced to respond in a very significant way, by -- by striking Iran directly. That is something that the Iranians don't want, and it's something that the United States does not want either. So the other part of this is that the Iranians are increasingly nervous about what the Houthis are doing in Yemen, because the Houthis have significantly disrupted the global economy with their attacks on commercial shipping. And that really risks angering some of Iran's closest allies, some of its only allies including China and India. China has recently called for these attacks to stop. And the problem here is that the Iranians have probably the least amount of control over the Houthis of any of their other proxy groups. And so the question now: is Iran going to be able to reign them in at all? They certainly have an incentive to because of the fact that it is really not good for Iran's bottom line to be alienating some of its key allies here, Phil.",

But there's two things in particular that I think are worth noting. No. 1, Independent voters broke for Joe Biden in this poll 52-40. That's a 12-point lead. That is significant. And also with women. They -- women support Biden by 58 percent. That's up. He has a 22 percent advantage with women, up from 12-point -- a 12-point margin just a month ago. Those are both really significant numbers and deciding factors and both independents and women are the ones that break for Nikki Haley on the other side. And so I think that's going to be really, really interesting to watch. Now, all of that said, when you look at the Real Clear Politics average, or the 538 average of all of the polls that are out there, Trump is still ahead by a couple of points. But I'm really trying to see, is this a momentum moment? And I think it could be an early indicator that some of the things that happened over the last two weeks are going to be damaging Trump.",

We rarely see angles like that.But I think my take is that none of it really matters, if I'm being honest with you. I mean, the Senate has introduced a bunch of bills to protect children online. None of them have gotten passed. And so every time you have a hearing like this, you sort of have to shrug and say, Well, is this going to amount to anything? And I don't think so. What this does is it creates a spectacle that they hope will bring momentum so they can pass bills. But let's be real: it's not an election year. They have till July. And I don't think this does anything than create some viral moments.",

They passed one bill on child sex trafficking online.But for all these other issues, they don't need to be taking priority for these senators, quite frankly, as something like passing a budget or something like passing something for their constituents that's very specific to their states. This is the type of issue where they will get a lot of applause and a lot of support from their constituents if they address it, but passing a bill on it doesn't really help them politically. And so that's why I think you see them using this as an attention grabber but not actually moving any bills forward. I also think in terms of what these bills are going to look like, Internet policy is extremely, extremely complicated. If you move or change one law, you might inadvertently upend the entire Internet. And I think these lawmakers know that there's a lot of people in their districts and in their states who rely on the Internet for their jobs. So they're careful not to meddle too much in Internet policy.",

We know it's a factor. But to be able to put laws and restrictions on these industries; for courts to be able to say that these lawsuits, a lot of class action lawsuits are viable, you would need to have some sort of proof.
