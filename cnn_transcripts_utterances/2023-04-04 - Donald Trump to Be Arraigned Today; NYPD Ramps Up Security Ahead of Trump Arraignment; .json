He'll be stopping at the district attorney's office, and then he will be going into criminal court. It sounds like a receipt [SIC] -- a routine procedure, but it's anything but that, of course. For the first time, a former American president will indeed be indicted. But what he will do is learn what criminal charges he is facing. And I am told that he was huddled here in Trump Tower overnight, and he'll be meeting with his lawyers and political advisors again today. And that is the central question. What exactly are the charges? He's facing some 30 criminal charges or so. But this will be a fairly brief hearing. He will be inside the courtroom for likely 5 to 10 minutes or so and then leave New York and fly back to Florida. But this is the very beginning of a legal road for the former president. Of course, important to remember: this is one of at least three potential cases he's facing. There's a Georgia case, a federal case investing [SIC] -- investigating his potential involvement in the January 6th insurrection. So this case begins here in New York. But one thing has advisors are stressing: they said that they hope, at least, that he lets his lawyers do the talking here in New York. And that he will sort of handle the politics of this in his speech tonight from Mar-a-Lago. But that is the central test facing this former president. Can he keep these two separate? Will the judge issue a gag order? Of course, his attorneys are arguing against that, saying it would simply be a violation of his First Amendment rights and his ability as a candidate to speak. But one thing that's clear, Kaitlan. Mr. Trump arriving here as a former president and a current frontrunner in the 2024 presidential race, as well. But this is the beginning of a road now where both of those are linked. The presidential campaign is inextricably linked with this criminal cases, as well -- Kaitlan.",

And now the threat looms heavy for the people who reside here, because yet another potential severe weather outbreak today. Now we need to get into some details, because this impacts over 70 million Americans. And I want you to see in my graphics, because there's two different outbreaks that we're anticipating today. One across the North. That's the Midwest. So Davenport, keep an eye to the sky. You're under a moderate risk today. That is for the afternoon and evening. But further South, from Missouri into the Ark-La-Tex region, including Little Rock, where I'm located. That is more of a late evening to overnight period. So the potential there exists for what we call nocturnal tornadoes. That means tornadoes that occur under the shroud of darkness. Those often take people off-guard, because they're sleeping. They don't have their warnings available to them. And of course, that catches them off-guard. So greatest probability of tornadoes today, we've hatched out those areas.
