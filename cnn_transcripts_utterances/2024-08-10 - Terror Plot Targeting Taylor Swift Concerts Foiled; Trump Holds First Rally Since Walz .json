And it's interesting, it was actually his first rally since the weekend, and the first since Vice President Kamala Harris had finalized the Democratic ticket. And Montana, of course, is a reliably red state. When I talk to Donald Trump's senior advisors, they tell me there are no concerns about his chances of winning it come November.But he instead chose to come here instead of a battleground because he was stomping for Tim Sheehy, the Republican Senate candidate. Now, he is locked in a tight Senate race with the longtime Democrat, Jon Tester, and it's really considered one of the hardest fought battles for control of the Senate majority come the fall. Now, Senator Steve Daines of Montana, the chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, was also at that rally on Friday, and I caught up with him beforehand off stage and he told me that he was the one who privately encouraged Trump to come and support Sheehy so publicly. He said, really, that he reminded Donald Trump of the importance of having Republicans control the Senate particularly when it would come to potentially confirming his nominees. Now Donald Trump did give Sheehy and other Montana lawmakers a shout out while on stage but really his speech is very similar to what we heard at that press conference he held in Florida on Thursday. He ran through a laundry list of familiar attacks against Harris. He attacked her intelligence. He attacked her positions on the border, on the economy. He also described her running mate Tim Walz as someone who is radically liberal. But one thing that was new that we saw on Friday was that he actually stopped at two separate points to show videos going after Harris. I want you to take a look at what he did.",

The campaign had been built to take on Joe Biden, and they felt that they were easily defeating Joe Biden, so much so that Republicans were making plans for their agenda for next year when they control both chambers of Congress and the presidency. But what we've seen is since the change of candidates, Democrats have surged. And Donald Trump is starting to figure out what works and what doesn't against Kamala Harris.His initial attempts have been to sort of divide the electorate along race and gender and say things that many Democrats perceive as sexist or racist against her. But the polls don't really show that those are landing so far. We're seeing Kamala Harris surge in swing states. And our latest poll from The New York Times shows her ahead in Pennsylvania, which really could decide the election.

He's an every man. He's one of the more conservative Democrats in the Senate. But it's going to be very difficult for him to survive this election.The way the parties have divided and the way America has divided over the past decade makes split ticket voting less likely. Donald Trump is expected to win Montana. His support there will be helpful for the Republicans.

They're trying to launch an investigation into whether or not she did enough to control migration at the border.

It's hard to see how they will be able to really dig up much dirt or opposition research against her, given the short time until the election.

So, that's the big concern. We're not talking a tremendous amount of rain, but really anything at this point. And you can see from the map, you still have rain in Maine, portions of Massachusetts, and then, still down across some of the southeastern states as well. That's where the greatest threat for flooding exists. So, the Carolinas and even portions of southeastern Virginia, you've got that flash flood threat for today. You've got a couple showers and thunderstorms popping up around Charlotte, even around the outer banks, and this is going to continue throughout the day. Another concern too is the river flooding. Because remember, that takes time. That's a delayed effect. A lot of these rivers, creeks, and streams throughout here actually don't even peak in their crest until Sunday, Monday, and in some cases, Tuesday. So, you're still going to have some flooding concerns in a lot of these areas, just from the rivers, creeks and streams, let alone any additional rainfall that comes in. And another thing. For all those folks trying to clean up from the damage, you've got intense heat and that humidity mixed with it. Some areas that heat index level will be around 105, to 110 today. So, not very good news. And yes, Debbie moves out, and it's still hurricane season, though. So, we're keeping eye on the next system. Right now, just this cluster of thunderstorms here in the Atlantic, but it has an 80 percent chance of becoming the next name storm here in about the next five to seven days. So, the question becomes, OK, where is it going to go? What is it going to impact? Most of the spaghetti plots have it kind of heading towards the U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico by the middle portion of this week, and then, from there, starts to turn but we just don't know at what point or what impact it may have to the mainland U.S. But in the short term, if you've got some travel plans to the Caribbean, you may need to keep a very close eye on this. If it does get named, which it is expected to the next name on the list is Ernesto. That would be the system that we are talking about there. And one thing to note too, is it has the potential to, once it really gets going to start to intensify very quickly, because of how warm this water is here.

However, according to CNN reporting, it doesn't seem to be directly linked to this actual attack, although, of course, you know, ISIS was, you know, basically founded in Iraq, so, it might tie this alleged plot more directly to Iraq itself.What's interesting about the plot is, you know, how far advanced it was. I mean, this guy, the main suspect, had a police light that he was apparently going to use to kind of get close to the concert venue. He had explosive precursors, he had knives. He had a 21,000 in counterfeit cash. He had, you know, he had all the makings of a plot that was pretty far advanced. And also, he didn't, Amara, have to get into the concert venue to do a lot of damage. [07:40:03] There would be thousands of fans outside the concert venue. He could have used his vehicle as a weapon in addition to the other weapons that he had. So, I think it was a, you know, the Austrians moved very quickly to arrest a pretty advanced plot.",

In fact, he was born in Britain. This teenager who carried out the attack.And if you look at the U.K. government web site, sort of terrorism, it's the -- right now, the level is a substantial likelihood of a terrorist attack.
