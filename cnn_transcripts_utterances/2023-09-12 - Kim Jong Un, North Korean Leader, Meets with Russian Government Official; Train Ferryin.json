      "sentences": "Well, Kate, we do know, as you say, Kim Jong Un is in Russia. He is heading north, as we understand at this point. As you say, the location of this meeting is not entirely clear at this point. Although, there is speculation that Kim Jong Un may be heading towards Vostochny. Now, this is where there's a cosmodrome space launch center, and it's also where we heard through Russian state media that Vladimir Putin will be heading to next. He's currently in Vladivostok at this eastern economic forum, but he did say he would be heading to this area as he has a personal agenda.So, that could well be where they're meeting. Now, what we've heard from the Kremlin, is that it will happen in the next few days. They said this yesterday, they said it again today. But Dmitry Peskov saying that it will be a full-blown visit with talk between two delegations and it will touch upon, \"Sensitive issues\". There will also be an official dinner between the two leaders. Now, we do know that this is going to have a military focus. We have heard from the Kremlin that Sergei Shoigu, the defense minister, he went to Pyongyang back in July to start this whole process, will be within the delegation. He will be within the meeting with Kim and Putin. We also note that a very key Marshall, Ri Pyong-chol from North Korea is on this trip as well. He's sanctioned by the U.S., by the U.N. He's considered the leader of North Korean's missile program. He is going to be part of it as well. So, that really sets the focus to a very military-focused deal here. Now, the U.S. officials backed up by South Korean officials and intelligence have said that they do believe that Russia wants ammunition, wants small arms out of a potential arms deal, something that North Korea can accommodate because they have a stockpile and they also have huge production capabilities. And then on the other side, the U.S. officials spoken to CNN believed that North Korea could get satellite technology or a nuclear submarine technology out of it in return. Kate.",

The death toll from the devastating earthquake there has climbed past 2,900, and that number is expected to rise. Roads into the mountains have been destroyed or blocked by debris. One witness said, \"We are hoping for miracles from the rubble.\" Morocco state media reports the country's military has now reached the epicenter with aid. CNN's Sam Kiley live on the ground there.

These villages, John, are built on kind of -- on the tops of the helix. If you can imagine a series of steps going up into the mountains and it is as if a giant has ran down those steps and smashed village after village after village.This village here is utterly destroyed. We walked about 1,000 feet further higher, came across a small farming hamlet where a six-year- old child had been crushed at 11:00 on Friday night when this earthquake struck. Her uncle was still sitting in the rubble alongside her brother, both of them still in a very tearful state. Now, there are some aid levels coming in here, but it's mostly private donations. A lot of ordinary Moroccans are coming in because the effort of the military is focused now on trying to reach those even further flung villages, accessible only on foot. The area we visited just this morning was only on foot too. But even further deeper into the mountains the situation is assumed to be more and more dire, but they are getting out there with Chinooks and Puma helicopters, trying to get aid very often. Just throwing it out of the back of aircraft. They can't even land or don't dare land on these villages in case they disrupt what rubble there is covering what few survivors there might conceivably be. But really, at the other side of this, this is a process of now gathering the dead and trying to figure out hose to rebuild so destroyed villages. John.",

      "sentences": "Yes, Kate. So, essentially what happened here is that Secretary of State Antony Blinken approved a waiver late last week that allows these banks that you mentioned overseas to transfer that $6 billion in Iranian funds to account in Qatar without fear of being issued sanctions.Now, this waiver is a sign that a deal with Iran to free those five Americans who have been deemed wrongfully detained, thereby the State Department is moving forward. And in a notice to Congress, detailing the waiver, Blinken also confirmed that as part of the deal, they U.S. has committed to release five Iranian nationals currently detained in the U.S. Now, just speaking broadly here, this is a very delicate balancing act for the Biden administration, because on the one hand, they want to get these Americans home, and it's very rare for these kinds of negotiations with Iran to actually bear fruit. But on the other, the prospective deal has already spurred criticism from Republicans in Congress who say they're opposed to releasing any kind of money to Iran in exchange for the detainees. And that doing so, essentially, amounts to a ransom payment. Republican Senator Mitt Romney said on Tuesday that releasing the funds would lead to, \"More kidnappings.\" Adding that, \"That's why you don't negotiate with the terrorists.\" Still, the administration which has made securing the release of wrongfully detained Americans a central part of its foreign policy says that their release of these funds is a key part of the process and that will lead to these Americans' release. And officials have stressed, Kate, that Iran will only be able to use this money for humanitarian purposes, in transactions overseen by the Treasury Department in Qatar. Now, the White House did acknowledge a sensitivity of this. And in a statement to CNN on Monday they said that, \"As we have said from the outset, what is being pursued here is an arrangement wherein we secure the release of five wrongfully held Americans, and this remains a sensitive and ongoing process.\" Kate.",

And it says, it fully complies with all applicable labor regulations. The number of on-the- job injuries declined in 2020 when travel during the pandemic cratered.

Just last month, Massachusetts State Police say a forklift operator at Boston Logan was pinned by a metal beam and killed while he servicing a JetBlue flight. SEN.
