      "sentences": "Great question. So, the Fed took a brief pause when it met last in June. I think a lot of people are expecting the Federal Reserve is going to go back to raising interest rates in their July meeting just a bit, you know, just a small bit, but it's their way of signaling that they still feel like they need to keep their eyes focused on inflation.So, you know, they're going to keep increasing interest rates now, that's obviously bad news if you want to go buy a house, maybe if you need to borrow money to buy a car. But I think they've shown that they've been able to raise interest rates without, you know, doing massive destruction to the economy. So, if they raise interest rates a little bit and the labor market remains strong, the consumers keep spending, maybe this economy can withstand a little bit, you know, higher prices. But I think they're at the point now where they're trying to figure out when do they finally stop? If they do raise interest rates just a bit more, is that going to be enough to get inflation to come back down? Inflation in the U.S. is lower than it is in many other countries, but it's still much higher than the Fed is comfortable with. So, that's something they're going to be watching very closely.",

And I think if we see retailers really prepare and hire aggressively for, like, the, you know, winter shopping season, that will be a really good sign. If we see the consumers are going to spend heading into the holidays, that's another really good sign.So, I think those are the things we're going to be watching. At the beginning of the year, we had those big bank failures that were very concerning, and obviously huge layoffs in Silicon Valley. So that, to me, signaled that here we go, we're heading into a recession, but the economy seems to have shrugs that off. If we can keep this going with consumer spending going well and consumer confidence picking up a bit, I think we should be in pretty good shape.",

He has a large tattoo on his -- or, pardon me, has large tattoos on his arms. He was last seen wearing his prison uniform, a denim jacket, as well as Crocs as footwear. Officials say, he was being held on arson and burglary charges and that he is a suspect in a homicide investigation.Also, an attempted robbery at a nail salon in Atlanta does not go exactly as planned.
