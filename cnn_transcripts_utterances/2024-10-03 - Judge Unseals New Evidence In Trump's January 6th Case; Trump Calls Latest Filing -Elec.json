That's exactly the thing Mike Pence said when he said he wasn't going to vote for Donald Trump in this election.So I think that's definitely right. What is very interesting, though, and this comes back to that gap between Republican candidates who are maybe Trump light, who are MAGA, like think about Kari Lake in Arizona versus Trump. They don't poll nearly as well. That brand doesn't transfer as much. So would it be very fascinating and good -- look, we're not done with 2024. I don't want to talk about 2028 just yet.

And if they want to hit back hard there, the nuclear facilities would be one target, or perhaps the oil installations, which would really undermine the economy and undermine the leadership as well.But people are talking about anything right up to trying to assassinate the supreme leader. Israelis aren't going to tell us exactly what they're planning because that would undermine the whole operation. The other perspective is were looking here, obviously images of Tel Aviv being under attack earlier the week, but they are currently going into Beirut as you were describing, do they decide to finish off or try to finish off Hezbollah as a punishment to Iran, there are -- there are so these are live images actually from Beirut. You can see that attack is ongoing. There are many options open to the Israelis.
