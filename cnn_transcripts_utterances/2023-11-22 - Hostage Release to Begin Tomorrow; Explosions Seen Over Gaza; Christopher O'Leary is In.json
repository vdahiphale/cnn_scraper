Eighteen hours from now a truce between Israel and Hamas is expected to begin. And with that truce, a pause in fighting and a significant number of hostages who have now been held in Gaza for nearly 50 days are expected to be released. It also marks the first major de- escalation, if you want to call it, in this war since the Hamas terror attacks started it all on October 7th. Here's more on this deal. Hamas will release 50 women and children held captive in Gaza. In return, Hamas says 150 Palestinian prisoners currently in Israeli jails will be released. And with this, fighting will pause for four days. With the pause, hundreds more aid trucks with food, medical supplies and fuel will head into Gaza.",

Now, she joins the names of two others the IDF has confirmed were found dead inside of Gaza, 65-year-old grandmother Yehudit Weiss, and 19-year-old Corporal Noa Marciano. So, this would be the third - or first, rather, presumed hostage who was confirmed dead by the IDF. Still waiting for more details in terms of how they came about this information and whether this was inside of Gaza and, if so, if her body has been recovered.Of course, these are critical and very difficult moments for the families who are waiting for news of their loved ones to find out if they're on that first batch of 50. And this is why many have said that even now, as they know a hostage release deal has been put into place, there are still very anxious, nervous and worried moments about whether - whether it mean their loved ones are coming out or whether it's more waiting and what happens from here. Again that -- as you pointed out, that hostage deal, and the pause in fighting set to take place at 10:00 a.m. tomorrow. Not a surprise. We're still seeing fighting. We have seen in multiple previous rounds of fighting that the continued fighting goes up until the pause goes into effect. So, even if there is rocket launches or Israeli strikes until 9:50, the critical moment is 10:00 tomorrow morning that we're watching. Fighting before that does not mean in any way that this has fallen apart.",

We have been into Gaza and gotten the sense of the amount of forces Israel has put there. And that includes not only the fighting forces, but also all of the logistics to support the tremendous number of forces in Gaza. They will simply take up defensive positions and wait for the pause in the fighting to end, initially scheduled now for four days. But if Hamas keeps releasing Israeli hostages, then the pause could be even longer and the Israeli troops will simply wait there. Now, over the course of the past weeks now, Israel has hadsurveillance drones flying over Gaza as a way of monitoring not only their own troops but threats to their own troops. Those will stop flying over northern Gaza for six-hour periods. And that too will - will essentially rob Israel of one of its critical assets during a pause in the fighting. But that's what they've agreed to, to secure the release of Israeli hostages. Now, of course, it's then a question of when - when does the pause in fighting end and what does that look like? Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said the war - the war very much continues as Israel tries to continue destroying Hamas.",

But he kind of viewed this - this pause as kind of allowing Hamas time to regroup. He compared it to, you know, being in a - in a fight with your opponent. And once you've knocked them down, giving them the time to get back up. So, some concerns here in Israel certainly among former officials about what that pause could allow, what it could mean for Hamas when it comes, tactically speaking, in terms of fighting.",

Thank you so much for being there. Joining us now to talk really about exactly what Kaitlan's mentioning here is Chris O'Leary. He's the former director of hostage recovery for the U.S. government, currently a senior vice president for global operations for the Soufan Group. It's good to see you, Chris. Coming -- take the deal and the agreement just first kind of on its face and the details that we're learning of it. Coming from your background, what do you think of this agreement, this deal? CHRISTOPHER O'LEARY, SENIOR VP FOR GLOBAL OPERATIONS, SOUFAN GROUP: So, it's a success, but people shouldn't be high-fiving each other quite yet. It's 50 hostages that are not released yet. And as you just highlighted, your partner in this negotiation is a terrorist organization that just massacred 1,200 Israeli citizens a month and a half ago. Hamas is using this for tactical delay on their part. They're not doing this for humanitarian reasons. They're not doing it for any other reason because this is an asymmetric war and this gives them leverage to drag things out. And hopefully, for their point, erode international and domestic support for Israel's continued military operation in Gaza.",

If it took this long to get 50 women and children out, only imagine how difficult it's going to be to release uniformed IDF soldiers. It could take years.",

We know that there are various groups linked with Hamas that are even criminal, just like criminal gangs in Gaza that are holding some of the hostages. What does that mean for any effort, if you're talking about a hostage rescue operation versus one of these agreements? What does that mean for them?O'LEARY: So, it would be ideal if all the hostages were located together and if it was in a location that Israel could fully understand the pattern of life of the guards, you know, what the defenses were. In hostage rescue you want to know the details - the granular details of the structure of the building, which way the doors open, inward or outward.

The first thing that will happen - and I've worked with Israel and it's kind of a standard that the U.S. has, and I know Israel has it as well. Their medical condition will be addressed first. Then their psychological condition will be assessed. Once they are ready, they will be debriefed.
