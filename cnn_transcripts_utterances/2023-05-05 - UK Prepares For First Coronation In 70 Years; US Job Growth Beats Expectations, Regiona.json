My word, what an event. Good evening and a warm welcome to London. I'm sure there's a Latin phrase or there should be for the eve of the king's coronation, the \"eveus coronationus,\" but it is the night before the coronation takes place, and for the first time in seven decades, the Commonwealth is going to celebrate the crowning of a new monarch. Fifteen countries will have a new Head of State, excitement is in the air. It's all going full throttle. And thousands of people are already gathering along the procession route to Westminster Abbey. There, King Charles III will present himself to the people and take the Coronation Oath. There will be representatives from more than 200 countries. The First Lady of the United States there, Jill Biden meeting the Prime Minister Rishi Sunak's wife at Number 10 Downing Street. Oh, Lionel Richie was there. Celebrities, members of Royal families, there was a garden party earlier in the week. Isa Soares is with me. It's all built up to what is I think, a tremendous atmosphere tonight.",

Richard, the expectation was closer to 0.3 percent, but actually, when you look at the three-month moving average, where you sort of average the three months, sort of smooth out any volatility month-over-month, that is actually moderating. I would argue, Jay Powell would like to see that. And when you look at the supply of workers, Richard, we have had a supply problem here in the US.

Not in that language, necessarily, but in Fed speak, and essentially what you have here is Jay Powell will say, look, we might be done, but we are really going to be data dependent, meaning that labor reports like this matter, meaning that CPI reports like the one we will get next week really matter. But to your point, Richard, I did ask the chief economist of ZipRecruiter, Julia Pollak, that very question earlier. And I said, look, you've get a labor report like that -- like this that we got today. This is sort of throw cold water on the idea that we will see rate cuts this year, not a pause, but rate cuts. And she said, look, it's hard to see at least right now how the Fed could justify cutting rates when you still have a labor market that is continuing to heat up, as we saw. And look at the Dow, I should point out Richard, the Dow was actually now positive, again for the year on the back of these gains. So this is something that again, I think there's a little bit of something for everyone here, but in terms of rate cuts, hard to see how it's possible after a report like this.",

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) QUEST (voice over): It was King Charles's grandfather, King George VI who is believed to have been the first to refer to the Royal family as \"The Firm.\" It is a name that stuck, often used by the late Queen Elizabeth to describe the business of being the British Royals. The Firm is a large sprawling financial empire that certainly made the Windsor family rich indeed. But there are many myths about just how wealthy they are. For instance, the family doesn't privately own Buckingham Palace or Windsor Castle or the Crown Jewels. These are owned by the nation. There are other assets like Regent Street, Ascot Racecourse and even Britain's lucrative seabed that are owned by another institution called The Crown Estate. In a deal struck in 2011, the Royals have paid the sovereign grant. It is set at 25 percent of The Crown Estates' profits. This money is given as a kind of allowance. It pays for staff, Royal duties, and the upkeep of Palaces, and the rest of The Crown Estate money goes back to the British Treasury.",
