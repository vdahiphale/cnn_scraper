I mean, if you look, Anderson, at our new CNN poll from New Hampshire, you have Trump at 39, right, and you got Haley right behind with 32, and Christie has 12. So, obviously, you can't say that all 12 are going to go over to Haley, right? It wouldn't be fair, but you know most of those and you look at those, you don't need him all to pull ahead of Trump. So let's get straight to Omar Jimenez, because he's in New Hampshire. He was there when Christie made that announcement and said both the onstage and offstage comments that Anderson just played.

Christie even came out later in the night and went as far to call Governor Sununu a liar. And then here we are less than 24 hours later, Governor Christie making the announcement that he's suspending his campaign. He did it to a roomful of supporters and voters in the town hall format, which is the way he kicked off this campaign. It's been a staple about how he's run this campaign, particularly here in New Hampshire. And as we heard tonight, it was how he ended his campaign. And as we heard over the course of some of these comments, he really tried to paint the picture of the stakes for not only him being in the race, but for what's ahead in this race for president, especially when it comes to Donald Trump.

Those comments were actually to a man named Wayne MacDonald, who heads Chris Christie's New Hampshire campaign here. And those comments were made essentially as he was informing them of what he was about to do and what at that point was just minutes. Now, how that reverberates into any potential endorsement in the future, we will see. But just last month, I was sitting down with Chris Christie, literally looking at him face to face. I brought up some of the dynamics that are at play now about whether he and Nikki Haley coexist in this race. And he point-blank told me, I am not going anywhere and come January 23rd, which is primary day here in New Hampshire, you're going to be shaking hands, I'm going to be shaking hands with voters until the polls close.

And really it's one of those things that shakes up the race in a way that has many crosscurrents. It's not clear exactly if this will be the focus of the debate tenor or mentioned it at all. But certainly it is on the minds of both of these candidates.The media reaction from Nikki Haley is, she congratulated Chris Christie for running a hard-fought campaign. Now, those two served as governors basically at the same time, she in South Carolina, he in New Jersey, in an entirely different pre-Trump era of the party. But you heard that hot mic moment there, and that is what Florida Governor Ron DeSantis seized upon. He says he agrees with Chris Christie's assessment there that she is going to get, quote, smoked. So we will see if that dynamic sort of continues on stage tonight. But the reality is, Anderson, this does not affect the Iowa campaign that much, because Chris Christie was not competing in Iowa. But going into New Hampshire, which this race is going to do in less than a week's time, it certainly does. So there have been behind the scenes reach-outs from both campaigns. I am told that Nikki Haley has not spoken to Chris Christie. We will see if that changes. She certainly is likely to get perhaps some of his votes. There's no doubt about that. But without an endorsement, it's unclear how many. So this hangs over the race in one bigger way, that it is really winnowing even before the voting begins, this is much different than eight years ago in the 2016 campaign, when there were nearly a dozen candidates still left in. These two podiums on the debate stage behind me, so indicative here of this races, small, of course, the person a hanging over all of this is Donald Trump. And he is not here, Erin. COOPER: All right. Jeff Zeleny, of course, on that debate stage, where Anderson is as well. And our New York team here with me. So, Alyssa, Christie dropping out, unexpectedly in terms of the timing.

And what he does not want to do is put his full weight behind someone who might end up being Trump's VP or might end up endorsing Trump. So I think this is kind of his mea culpa.

If she's able to turn out independents and moderates, she does have a pathway. Her team is creating a ground game in South Carolina. It is a tremendous uphill battle. But Chris Christie also said something last week, which is if it's Trump versus Biden, Biden is going to sweep the floor with him. The numbers don't bear that out.

When it comes to celebrating, there is some glee among the former president and his allies, that a candidate whose sole platform was attacking Donald Trump could not only not survive in a primary, but not even make it until the first vote was cast.And that gives him a little bit of an edge, they feel. They can say this is where the Republican Party currently stands. But there is a larger issue of concern around Nikki Haley that was happening even before Christie drop out. Now, of course, as we noted, as your panel noted, we cannot say where Chris Christie's votes are going to go. If they would go to Nikki Haley, but it does appear that would be the obvious choice. And Trump's team had already been deeply concerned about the rise they had seen in her poll numbers. They are spending a combined, campaign and super PAC, $4.5 million on attack ads on Haley, on immigration in New Hampshire. They believe immigration is one of the top issues in the granite state. They are also sending 1.3 million dollars alone, the super PAC, hitting Nikki Haley in New Hampshire. Just to give you an idea of how much money that is, they have pulled back all spending on ads attacking Florida Governor Ron DeSantis. Now, they are expressing confidence, I was told by one senior advisor that sure, it will impact some undecided voters, but it's not enough to change the trajectory of the race. We also got a memo put out, they said it was a confidential memo written by their pollster to the campaign heads, put out by the campaign, that said this is not going to impact Trump winning in the state. But again, as we know, they have been concerned about Nikki Haley. They are watching those numbers carefully. They are looking at the tabs in every single poll and as we have reported, Erin, the team that is around him right now is one of the most disciplined to date, which means they are analyzing data looking through this. And there is a reason they are spending so much money going after Nikki Haley. So it's certainly not all a celebration tonight -- Anderson.",

There is no doubt that he is a very, very happy, wanted to see Christie humiliated for taking him on and all of that. But in the short run, this is a problem for them. It does make Haley more competitive in New Hampshire. There's no question about it. Now, I have some doubt as to every -- I don't think there's a street conversion. I heard Kristen Soltis Anderson say this a bit earlier, I think there are people who will say, I may just skip this one. You heard Christie, he gave a blistering speech, and it was not just about Donald Trump, but about the other candidates who are afraid to take him on. And that was very much Haley as well as DeSantis. So it could be that some of his supporters just decided so. But in the bulk of them will, I think, will got to -- go to -- Haley.

And one thing I do want to know in terms of tonight's debate, this underscores why Nikki Haley and Ron DeSantis, frankly, have a delicate dance to do. DeSantis is playing for Iowa. Nikki Haley needs to be able to do well in more independent, moderate-leaning New Hampshire. While at the same time not of putting voters in Iowa.

You have Barack Obama, right, who's married to and got two children, they go to church, they're like good people. You've got Joe Biden, who goes to church every Sunday. He's won the most devout Catholics we ever have had that we can think of. But no one seems to think that is okay. The reason why, you look at Iowa, according to the \"Des Moines Register\" poll, 80 percent of people who show up in caucus are pro- life, right? And as Alyssa just said, Donald Trump gave them the end of Roe. So they may help him in a primary. In a general election, it's going to be very tough for him to get past that number.
