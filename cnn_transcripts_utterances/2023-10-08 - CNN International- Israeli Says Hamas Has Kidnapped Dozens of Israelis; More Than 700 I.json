The Palestinian Health Ministry says more than 400 Palestinians are being killed, including 78 children.Some of the first known victims of the attack inside Israel were at a music festival. Israeli officials say at least 260 bodies have been found at the venue near the Gaza border killed by Hamas forces. For more on all of this let's bring in CNN's Hadas Gold in Jerusalem. And Hadas, yes, perhaps the most shocking part of what's happened over the last nearly 48 hours is the ability of Hamas to get perhaps hundreds of fighters on Israeli soil and take dozens of hostages back into Gaza. It's unthinkable. But that's the reality that Israel was dealing with. HADAS GOLD, CNN CORRESPONDENT: I mean, that's the reality also just how many breaches not only of the fence, but that these militants were able to some of them were able to paraglide and some of them came by sea. And many of them came by land. It's also not clear, you know, in these breaches of the fence. How many of the people who were coming in, were you know, full on Hamas militants? And how many of them were Gazans just kind of along for the ride who, came in as well? And I almost wonder if even they didn't expect to be as successful as they were. The most stunning aspect of this, of course, in these militant infiltrations is not only the fact that they went essentially, you know, house by house just killing whole families while they were in their homes, and but it's also the fact that they took hostages with them. We do not know the conditions of these hostages. We don't even have an official tally that we have from Hamas is saying they claimed that they have more than 100 in their captivity. They also claimed that among those are senior members of the military. Islamic Jihad, which is another militant group in the Gaza Strip, says that they have 30 in their possession. And they both say that they have them in strategic locations across Gaza. But what we do know is among the hostages are many if not mostly civilians. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) GOLD (voice-over): Palestinian militants kidnap a group of distraught women and children in video posted on social media. It's terrifying to watch even more so if the people who are being abducted are your family. Yoni Asher is safe in his home in Israel, but he says he's terrified for his wife and two young daughters abducted by Hamas militants from his mother in law's home near the Gaza border. He says the last days have been difficult. He hasn't slept and desperately wants to send this message to their captors.",

I want you to help me find my boy. A pain shared now by many Israeli families, not knowing if a loved one is dead or alive or ever coming home. (END VIDEOTAPE) GOLD (on camera): And Michael, as we speak, I've been hearing what must be fighter jets flying overhead even here in Jerusalem. We know that the Israeli military has been bombarding the Gaza strip with airstrikes. I believe that there are now been more than 1000 targets that the Israeli military has targeted in the Gaza Strip. If noted the death toll in the Gaza Strip. But these airstrikes are expected to continue essentially nonstop. The question now, Michael, of course, is whether there will be a ground incursion. We have seen a buildup of Israeli military capabilities along the border, not yet clear whether that's enough for the ground incursion, or if it's just the buildup of trying to re secure the border. But with that number of hostages still in the Gaza strip with just the size of this attack with a number of casualties in Israel. I don't know if there's ever been another 24 hours in Israeli history with these many Jews were killed, or these many Israelis were killed in one day.

So there was already sort of a shaky sense, but so much of the focus was to the east, was to the West Bank.

So I don't frankly think anyone knows what's coming. I think the Israelis are still figuring out exactly what's next. I was quite surprised to hear an IDF spokesman just about an hour ago, issue a video statement online. Where, he seemed to be indicating that a ground incursion was in the works. He said, very clearly that 100,000 men and male and female personnel have been mobilized for what he called an attack against Hamas inside Gaza. That seems to be suggesting something that I wouldn't have expected might be developing quite so quickly. But I think that speaks to the almost the panic on the Israeli side. But the longer they leave this, the harder it's going to be to, you know, ameliorate or fix the situation quickly.

U.S. Defense Department keeps some of those stockpiles in Israel. They are officially U.S. stockpiles belong to America. But it's also understood that Israel can tap into those if it needs to. So the request according to an Israeli and a U.S. official was for precision guided munitions, aerial munitions, in this case an Iron Dome interceptor. As of right now we've seen Israel attacking from the air so it makes sense that that's what they want to backfill on that front and make sure they have on hand and then Iron Dome interceptors. We just saw from Clarissa how critical that's been in at least holding back many of the rocket attacks. Some have gotten through purely from the volume of fire that has come from rockets, but they have still played a crucial role in protecting Israeli areas from rocket fire so those interceptors also important in the U.S. almost certainly ready to provide those.

This disturbing social media video geo located by CNN shows one of those victims, hands appear to be bound in in captivity. And Hamas claims the hostages are distributed across the strip, Israel believes to be used as human shields. Still, Israel's military is pressing on with air assaults already underway. The IDF says it is preparing for a potential ground incursion, and that all options are on the table. Thousands of Israeli reservists have been called up for the task. Israel's army is telling Gazans to clear the way for operations, ordering families to leave their homes and providing locations for evacuation. But with the conflict short, they engulf the whole of the strip for most there is no way out. Gaza is largely isolated from the world by an Israeli air land and sea blockade in Egypt southern border closure. Electricity, which is mostly provided by Israel, was cut off to the enclave and internet disrupted, unclear how long services will be severed. And with Hamas leadership reportedly going underground, the 2 million people living in the 140 square mile territory have nowhere to turn, fears that an unprecedented attack on Israel could yield unprecedented bloodshed in Gaza.

But already we're beginning to see the toll of it more than 400 Palestinians killed that's according to Palestinian health officials. Tens of thousands have been displaced from their home, many now piling into Gaza City, making every strike there ever more deadly, potentially ever more risky for civilians trapped in that tiny space.

CNN Senior UN Correspondent Richard Roth joins me now. Good to see you, Richard. The UN is so often and impotent in situations like this, what has it been doing? What can it do? RICHARD ROTH, CNN SENIOR U.N. CORRESPONDENT: It's been too long, Michael. There it is tough for the UN; I remember the countries will contest even just one word in a statement. And that could go on for hours. The 15 nations of the Security Council were not ready to issue a statement, even if it just condemned violence anywhere in the world doesn't rule it out. It might take a few more days. And we as another guest you had said we don't know what's going to happen next. I mean, if more hostages are taken, I'm not going to say that countries on the Security Council will immediately flee to support Israel, but you have different factions there. You have the United Arab Emirates, who spoke relatively sympathetically about what happened in Israel. But they're not going to just give up on the Palestinians; no matter that Hamas is not a member state. The Deputy U.S. Ambassador Robert Wood was asked by an Arab journalist about where's the U.S. support when the Palestinians are killed by Israel? (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ROBERT WOOD, DEPUTY U.S. AMBASSADOR TO THE U.N: When you say protecting civilians, we are very much concerned about the impact of this invasion by Hamas, not just on civilians, right in that immediate area, but in the region, this conflict could grow. And we don't want to see that happen. And obviously, our thoughts are with all civilians that are hurt. But what we need to focus on is this ongoing terrorist violence being committed by Hamas.

Tomorrow, Monday morning in New York, that's probably the 78, 79th meeting of the Security Council. Hopefully we don't get there when it comes to the Middle East, but you can't rule anything out.",
