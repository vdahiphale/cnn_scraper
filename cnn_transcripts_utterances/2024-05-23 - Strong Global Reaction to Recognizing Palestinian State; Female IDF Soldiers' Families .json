Now this comes one day after massive crowds filled the streets of Tehran for their final farewell. Today, you see, as well as eight others killed in a helicopter crash over the weekend.CNN's Fred Pleitgen was there in Tehran on the ground and has this report. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice- over): Hundreds of thousands lining the streets as the caskets made their way through Tehran, chanting, marching along, paying their final respects. Ever since that helicopter crash that killed Iran's president Ebrahim Raisi, as well as of course the foreign minister Hossein Amir- Abdollahian and several others we've seen some of the displays of public mourning here around the country in Iran. That was especially here in Tehran where this massive procession is one that is part of the funeral processions to lay to rest the people who were killed in that helicopter crash. (Voice-over): I am here for my president, she says. He did a lot for Iran, to prove that we loved him very much. Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei himself leading the funeral prayers. With foreign dignitaries, but also senior leaders of Hamas in attendance. While Iran's investigation into the crash is ongoing, the president's chief of staff, who was traveling in a different chopper in the convoy, saying one of those aboard the doomed chopper was alive and communicating for at least three hours after the crash. The chief of staff also giving more details on the incident itself. GHOLAM HOSSEIN ESMAILI, IRANIAN PRESIDENTIAL CHIEF OF STAFF (through translator): Captain Mostafavi, who was the pilot of the helicopter carrying the president and the commander of the helicopter convoy, ordered the other helicopters to gain altitude and go above the clouds. When we reached above the clouds, and after about 30 seconds, we realized the president's helicopter wasn't with us.",

So what we're seeing today is the president's -- the late President Ebrahim Raisi is his body will be taken to Birjand. These are the pictures you can see here.This is the city where he represented the Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei for many years and so this has significance when it comes to Raisi himself. We know that the other bodies will be now taken to their hometowns so that they can be buried. The foreign minister, for example, Abdollahian, he is going to be buried just south of Tehran. There will be funeral ceremonies as well at the Foreign Ministry Building this morning in Tehran for him. But when it comes to the late president, you can see significant numbers coming out onto the streets. Once again, a similar thing to what we saw yesterday. And then after this, he will go onto Mashhad. This is his hometown. This is where there will be the final funeral rites and he will be buried later this Thursday in that city. So it has been a multi-day event. This is Iran wanting to show the world, wanting to show its own people as well that there is significant mourning when it comes to these individuals. Of course, these pictures only tell one side of the story. There are other elements of the Iranian population that did not support the ultra-conservative President Raisi. He oversaw significant economic crisis, also mass protests in 2022. So this is really just representing one segment of society, but it is what Tehran, what the officials are trying to show is that this is a time of mourning from tomorrow. They will be looking forward to the elections, which will happen on June 28th, and looking to who will replace permanently these individuals. We know very quickly after the deaths were confirmed, there was an acting president, an acting foreign minister put in place. A real sense of wanting to show there will be no disruption and there is stability in the country -- Paula.",

So a surprise announcement from the British prime minister who says a snap elections will take place on July 4th. Rishi Sunak stood outside 10 Downing Street in the pouring rain, you see him there, Wednesday to deliver the news. And it's probably no coincidence it came not long after some good economic numbers were released showing the U.K. inflation was falling to its lowest level in some time. The prime minister admitted his Conservative Party has made mistakes, but he insisted the Tories remain most capable of leading Britain out of challenging times. Still the six-week election campaign is widely expected to bring an end to the Sunak government. The opposition Labour Party led by Keir Starmer has a commanding lead in the polls.

And in 2019, it was a single issue election, Brexit. Boris Johnson's slogan was \"Let's get Brexit done.\" And since then, questions around COVID, Ukraine, Russia, et cetera, have in many ways, especially Brexit, receded into the background and it's a whole range of domestic issues that now concern voters.Its longstanding question of the cost of living, health care issues, we remember that under Rishi Sunak historic strikes from nurses and so on. And another range of domestic environmental issues and social services and so on. And all of those issues are issues on which the Conservative Party has an appalling track record.

I mean, the number of years that it took for that process to unfold was incredibly disruptive especially because the elements pushing it that remain important political players today, let's not forget that the outgrowth of the U.K. Independence Party and of the Brexit Party are now in reform, which are causing real problems for the conservatives because they're currently polling at 10 plus percent.And what we've seen since then unfold in Europe is a kind of rise and a mainstreaming and an acceptability of some of those far-right issues, and ironically, paradoxically perhaps even, if the election in the U.K. was to return a Labour Party government, it would be an interesting move away considering the path in France, just sort of move to the right. Italy, Hungary, Germany, and so on. And the Netherlands. So it would be an interesting kind of term here. And I think that under Keir Starmer, there's a possibility to kind of revisit some of the parameters of that relationship and to begin some sort of open dialogue by shifting away from so many of the sort of immigration xenophobic issues and to Europe issues, and to kind of rebuild the scaffolding with that particular relationship.
