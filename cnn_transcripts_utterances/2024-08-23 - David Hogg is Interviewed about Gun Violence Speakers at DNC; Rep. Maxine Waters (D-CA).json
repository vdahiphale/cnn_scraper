But, more than that, I think because of the politics that Donald Trump had helped to create, many people were divided, many people - I mean, they still are divided, obviously, but many people were hopeless. They felt like they were in a dark tunnel with no path at the end of it - or no light at the end of it. And what we're seeing now, with the incredible leadership of Vice President Kamala Harris, is that leadership, is that excitement. And people just, you know, I think more than anything, just didn't want to see a rematch of 2020.",

And to those Democrats that take money from the NRA or are supported by the NRA, I think they need to be primaried. And I think I'm going to be working on that very soon.But, in the meantime, I know that under Vice President Kamala Harris' leadership and President Biden's leadership, we've seen the first - the passage of the first gun law in 30 years. In politics, as in life, I don't care what people say. I care what they do. And what we've seen is the administration do a whole lot on addressing gun violence, right? Whether that's the creation of the first office of gun violence prevention, or the passage of the first gun law in 30 years. And I think what we're going to be able to do here, as we saw after Uvalde, for the first time in 30 years, Democrats and Republicans came together and passed a bipartisan bill. And I think other Vice President Harris' leadership, with her experience in the Senate, and with Tim Walz's experience in the House, we'll certainly have a great chance at getting more gun safety legislation passed, especially if we obviously have - if Democrats have control of the House and Senate.",

For example, how does he credibly get an interview and talk about, you know, the 15,000 people that showed up in Detroit was false. It was artificial intelligence. How do you - how do you entertain talking with someone who wants to be president of the United States of America, who can look you in the face and lie to the media, to the public, to his opposition? Well, we have to make sure that we call him out.

He loves Kim Jong-un he said. They have love letters or something going. I mean it's so much there.
