And what they're going to see is the heavy amount of infrastructure that has already put -- been put in place by state authorities and federal authorities. And this has also become kind of that flash point between Republican leadership here in Texas and the federal government, Governor Greg Abbott and others here in Texas very critical of the Biden administration. And behind me, you see this is like one of the boat ramp launches where state DPS troopers go out onto the river. They will see, these lawmakers will see miles of steel shipping containers, razor wire, all of the federal, state and local law enforcement agents that are out here trying to control the border, but despite all of that infrastructure that is in place, December another record-breaking month in terms of illegal border crossings, more than 225,000 illegal crossings. That's about 10,000 a day. But at the same time, John, the situation has really changed dramatically just in the last week. The number of crossings have really dwindled. We have been here several days now and the number of crossings are very low, not anywhere close to what it was just the week before Christmas, where we were seeing thousands of people crossing here into Eagle Pass.

And now you have thousands and thousands of Americans that actually visit Colombia for vacation. And we have to stabilize those countries. If you don't do that, if that's not a part of the conversation, then we're not going to do anything to fix this problem, because you -- and we see this around the world. We have seen the capsized vessels of people trying to leave Africa to get over to Italy, for instance, and other migration of people trying to leave parts of Asia to go to Europe. If you don't do something to address the extreme poverty and violence in those countries, it doesn't matter if we reform asylum. The problems at the border will continue to pile up. And so we need for Democrats and Republicans to put together a group of members, bipartisan, to really work through this and stop trying to go for the big, fancy sound bites and what have you. That's not helping. I have been in Congress now for 10 years, and that's the path that we have been on the last 10 years, and look where we're at now. Nothing has happened.

Iran promised retaliation. Never quite saw the retaliation to the degree that some expected. So, highly revered, highly powerful in Iran and the victim of a U.S. strike three years ago. So, today, they are celebrating or marking the anniversary of his death, quite a lot of crowds there because he is revered in Iran, and now Iranian authorities calling this a terror attack. It's important to note that there was some speculation early on, well, could this, in light of Israel's attack on a senior Hamas leader yesterday, be at all tied to Israel? Based on officials I have spoken with, that is quite a leap to imagine Israel carrying out a strike inside Iran. So we should make that note early on, because, of course, speculation often gets beyond the story. In terms of terror groups, there are terror groups with enormous capabilities in Iran and neighboring Iran. I have spoken to experts on the region who brought up the name of ISIS potentially, ISIS not a friend of the -- has carried out attacks in the region before, not a particular fan of the Iranian regime. And ISIS has been more active and more capable since the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan a little more than two years ago. But, again, it's early to assign responsibility here.

And it has some activity outside the country. It maintains a leadership. It claims the rightful leadership of Iran, as some of these exiled groups will. But, again, we have no evidence at this point tying it to a group like that. But to your point, John, there are groups not just outside Iran who might have an interest in attacking the Iranian regime, but there are groups inside Iran, Kurdish groups as well. And then, again, we also have to run this through the filter of the Iranian regime. They do not have a good track record for releasing accurate public information. So, whoever they blamed this on earlier, what circumstances they are saying or behind this attack or the details of it, we should, of course, that run that through our own filters with some skepticism, because they're not the most forthcoming or accurate or honest leadership when it comes to explaining their own moves or attacks like this one.",
