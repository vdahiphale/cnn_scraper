And breaking news tonight about a possible new ceasefire deal to bring Israel's hostages home that also could let Hamas' senior leaders get out of Gaza. Good evening. Thanks for joining us on the eve of what could be the last fire break for anyone in the Republican Party to stop the former president, that or perhaps the final confirmation that the party once again belongs solely to him. Four hours from now, voters in the tiny northern New Hampshire town of Dixville Notch will cast the first ballot to the first primary in Campaign '24. That's not going to take long to count, there are just six people expected to vote there. About an hour from now in Laconia, the former president is going to hold his final rally in the state. That event which comes a day after Ron DeSantis endorsed him and dropped out of the race is going to feature three other former rivals who did the same -- Doug Burgum, Vivek Ramaswamy, and South Carolina Senator Tim Scott, who then Governor Nikki Haley appointed to the Senate.   Also endorsing the former president, Governor Haley's own home district Congresswoman Nancy Mace. She did it today even though in the wake of January 6, she was saying things like this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. NANCY MACE (R-SC): Their lives would have been in danger, too, the two most precious people in my life. We need to hold the president accountable. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Governor, I appreciate you being with us. So do you believe Ambassador Haley needs to win tomorrow? GOV. CHRIS SUNUNU (R-NH): No, New Hampshire has never been a must win for Haley. If anything, it's a must win for Trump. There were three things I think that we wanted to do, which was get it down to a two- person race. And she did, she wiped everyone else out of the race, have a strong second, that's all but guaranteed and build on the momentum coming out of Iowa. Going into our home state to go from 20 percent in Iowa, building on that here in New Hampshire and then going into our home state, the election isn't next week, it's like three or four weeks away. She's going to have a lot of time to go back and do what she's done many times before, which is win. She knows how to win in South Carolina. So there's a lot of opportunity there. Oh, and by the way, she could win. I mean, she's really within a stone's throw in some of these polls. So, she is surging. I mean, all the wind is at her back.

It wasn't bad a year ago, it's even better now, 2.3 percent in the last state report, that is a historically low unemployment rate. That means a strong economy, right? Well, look at this, what's the price of gas? You think about New England. Forgive me turning my back a second I want to stretch this out. A year ago, it was $3.30 a gallon. Right now, it is $3.03 a gallon. So again, getting better. But this is the number that's worth watching. Let me get rid of this off the screen here. This is what still aches in the heart of these voters. I'm going to stretch this out. Because yes, if you look at the year-to-year inflation, right now, things are getting better, 2.6 percent in the last year, prices have risen. But this is what sticks with these voters. If you are making thirty, forty, fifty or sixty thousand dollars a year and you were paying six percent inflation or more a year ago, that means you still have your old car. You didn't go to Disneyland, you stopped saving money, you probably started dipping into your savings to pay for grocery, to pay for fuel and stuff. So that is still a hangover effect. Can Joe Biden by the general election convince voters to focus on that number? Not that number? Maybe but at the moment, they think the economy needs work and I know it's cyclical. Economists would say it's not all Biden's fault. You know, he inherited the economy and all of that, but that's their life. That's still their hangover in their experience.",
