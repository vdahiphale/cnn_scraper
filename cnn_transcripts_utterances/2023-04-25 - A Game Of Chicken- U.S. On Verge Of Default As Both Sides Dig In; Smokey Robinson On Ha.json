The nation is at risk of a potential economic disaster. Thanks to partisan and intra party politics in Washington, the U.S. is scheduled to default on its debt as early as June, something that's never happened before. And if the nation defaults, that means massive job losses almost assures a recession. Federal benefits like Social Security are at risk. Interest rates, what you pay on your house, your car, your college loan, they all skyrocket. The stock market, it tumbles dragging with it your 401K's. I know what you're thinking. You're saying, Michael, come on. We've seen the movie before and we know how it ends. They're going to figure it out just before the clock hits midnight. Since 1960, Congress has acted 78 separate times to permanently raise, temporarily extend or revise the definition of the debt limit. It's all seemed to work itself out but in life, there are no guarantees. Republicans are demanding more than $4 trillion in spending cuts in exchange for lifting the debt ceiling. The President Biden insists that budget talks shouldn't be included in something this consequential even as some in his own party are pressing him to negotiate. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. JOE MANCHIN (D-WV): It is his job. This is the responsibility of the leader of the free world and definitely the United States' president. He has to negotiate. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

My colleagues who put conditions on speaker McCarthy are not going to fall for that trick. And let me answer the question you asked in your monologue.

And I think that is going to be the key going forward. And I really, I'm hoping as a country, we really take the time to work with Congress and say CMS today, you should no longer accept infectious disease codes for flu or RSV, or COVID without a definitive laboratory diagnosis.Let's move into the 21st century, as we've done with cancer and cardiovascular disease, we should be diagnosing RSV and flu and COVID with every urgent care visit, we shouldn't be guessing. And once you know what you have, then you can easily find new viral infections. And so, we need a better human surveillance system. We spent a lot on zoonotic and animal surveillance systems. Now we need to take that into humans. Every U.S. Embassy and every consulate could be our early warning system. We know how to do this with wastewater. So, every embassy every consulate should be monitoring their wastewater, we should know what is circulating around the globe.

That talked about the mental health of our young people and how it was deteriorating and noted all of the increased ER visits, suicidal ideation. This was June of 2020.I sent that report to the CDC because SAMSA said they weren't getting any traction, I knew the CDC was going to put out new school guidance, I asked the CDC to include in the opening, issues about the mental health of young people. So, school boards and parents could make decisions on the whole of their child to really ensure that they understood the risk of the children not being in school. And CDC refused to include that in their guide. When you know, when you say you're following science and data, you need to follow the science and the data and what is getting us into trouble, even today is us making assumptions. We lost 270,000 Americans to COVID last year, we're going to easily lose well over 100,000 this year. This doesn't have to be our future. We know how to stop this. We've done this with pandemics all over the globe. I've spent 25 years doing it everywhere around the -- around the globe. You can change this, but we need -- we need the general support of Congress and CMS and CDC to really come into the 21st century and work within our healthcare delivery system, utilize our electronic medical records, don't create parallel systems. We know how to be more efficient, more effective.
