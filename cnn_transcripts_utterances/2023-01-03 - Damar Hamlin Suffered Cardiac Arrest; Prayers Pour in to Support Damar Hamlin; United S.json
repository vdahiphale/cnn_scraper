      "sentences": "Hello and welcome, everyone. I'm Rosemary Church in Atlanta.And we are following a major development in our breaking news out of the National Football League. About an hour ago, the Buffalo Bills confirmed it was a cardiac arrest that brought down player Damar Hamlin in Monday night's game. The Bills said his heartbeat was restored on the field and that he remains sedated and in critical condition at a Cincinnati hospital. A closer look now at what happened. Hamlin who plays safety collapsed after a hub tackle in the first quarter of the game against the Cincinnati Bengals, which has since been postponed. Hamlin is number three, and wearing white. Watch as he makes the tackle and you can see him stand up fairly quickly, but then he falls backwards. An ambulance was soon brought out and he was given CPR on the field before being rushed to the hospital. The looks on the players' faces from both teams said it all of course, some in tears, visibly upset, many kneeling and embracing one another. A lot of people understandably worried about Damar Hamlin right now. The 24-year-old is in his second season with the Bills and has played in every game of this season. Athletes from across the world of sports are sending prayers and well wishes. And football fans are also sending their thoughts and prayers. Some even gathered outside the hospital where Hamlin is being treated right now. Fans of both the Bills and Bengals came together to show their support with some holding candles. And earlier, the NFL held a conference call to discuss Hamlin's injury. One of the people speaking on that call from the league was Troy Vincent, executive vice president of the NFL, himself, a former all-pro NFL player. And here's part of what he said.

And I think right now it's obviously important to focus on the health of DeMar Hamlin.I mean, that is the most important part of what we're going to learn over the next couple of hours is, is he OK? You know, is he out of sedation? Is he going to ultimately recover from the cardiac arrest? But you know, once we're past that point and we're no longer speculating about his health, I think the story will shift towards those moments in between. And there's a little bit of confusion right now on that conference call you mentioned from the NFL. Troy Vincent was very specific on that call telling all of us that at no time did the NFL consider restarting this game, that the five-minute warmup was a matter of confusion. He called that notion ridiculous. But as we were watching it play out full-time and myself from the couch, just like many Americans around the country, that did not seem to be the case. It seemed as though, there was going to be a five- minute warmup period. Things were going to try to move forward. And we've seen the NFL move forward in the past with things like concussions where the game must go on, so to speak. And for me, it was really the coaches, the head coaches on both teams, particularly Sean McDermott of the Buffalo Bills, that was the one that changed that tide and really observed what his players was Were going through, and talked to Zach Taylor, the Bengals coach, and met and said, listen, you know, I don't think that, that we can continue this. At least that's kind of what it looked like. And then when they went to the locker rooms and we saw the state that the players were in, it became very clear that they were the ones that were going to step in and protect the mental and physical health of their team as everyone was clearly struggling with what they witnessed.",

Now remember, hindsight is always 20/20. These professionals that were there at the game didn't have access to a video camera like we do, watching this play over and over again. They had seconds. They had seconds to respond. And what we're finding out is that we did, we're hearing that they did revive heart functionality. They got a pulse back right there on the field.

It would be a very ominous or poor sign if as they pull back that ventilator, he has no respiratory drive.What we're looking for is that he's breathing on his own. He's breathing with the vent.

Another third element now, musculoskeletal, neurologic, you know, cardiac, it's going to open a whole area of investigation into this sport. I will tell you, I have two young sons myself, and I will not allow them to play tackle football at this juncture because it's just too dangerous at this point. Also, the players are getting so much more sophisticated in how they tackle each other. It's getting to become a very, very dangerous sport. Now, we all love football, but we have to really think it through now and say, is it worth it? And what can we do to protect these players so that nothing like this ever happens again, even though this case is one in a million. This is like getting struck by a lightning, the way that the chest has to be hit at a millisecond of a -- of the hearts repolarization.

But when they saw them start doing chest compressions and they saw the medical staff start to use the AED to try to shock Damar Hamlin back, you saw the reaction of those players walking away and being distraught, being very emotional. The kind of thing we don't see on a football field. I am told that when he left the field here at the stadium, he had a pulse, was not breathing on his own at that time. But the reaction from the players on the field, a lot of times we see in the NFL and we all understand it's a violent sport. Head injuries, that happens. Spinal injuries, that happens. We see some kind of positivity from the players. They walk off the field. A lot of times it's a thumbs up. We didn't see anything like that tonight. We saw -- we saw players crying.

So, we never saw him collapse. But it was -- it was very apparent from the reactions of the other -- of the players around him and the officials that something seriously was wrong. I have quite frankly never seen players react that way. And I, you know, obviously these are guys that are accustomed weekly, unfortunately to seeing their teammates be injured. It was -- it was very apparent just seconds after he collapsed that something was terribly wrong. And then the sheer number of athletic trainers and emergency medical personnel who came out to treat him, the speed with which a backboard and stretcher was brought out, and then the ambulance was brought onto the field. All of this led us to, you know, come away with the conclusion that whatever it was that had happened to Damar Hamlin was something extraordinarily serious. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Same sort of scene in college when I was playing for Stanford, our running back made a collision with Curtis Williams of the University of Washington. He was paralyzed from the neck down. Two years later, he passed away. These scenes are haunting. The thing I think we need to take away from this is, one, it's a reminder of how precious life is.

Later today, the incoming Congress will vote on whether he should hold one of the most powerful positions in Washington. The vote comes as members from the House and Senate return to the Capitol to mark the start of the 118th Congress. Republicans regained control of the House in the midterm elections, and McCarthy needs 218 votes in order to secure the top job. In the Senate, Democrats remain in control with Chuck Schumer as the majority leader. McCarthy has made a number of concessions in an effort to secure votes, but his attempts to persuade some of his fellow Republicans to back him appear to be falling short. House Republican Bob Good from Virginia is among those who are opposing. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. BOB GOOD (R-VA):  There is nothing he has done to earn my vote.

McCarthy has already made a bunch of concessions to try to empower the rank-and-file members, weaken speakership, but that is still not enough for others who are pushing to go further.So, what does that exactly mean? It could be a situation that perhaps we have never seen before, or at least something we have not seen in a hundred years, multiple ballots for a House speaker. In 1923, it went up to nine ballots. It took several days. Ultimately, a speaker was elected. How long will this process take? McCarthy is indicating to his allies that he is planning to stay in this race no matter how long. In the words of Don Bacon, saying he would stay in the race until hell freezes over. And it is uncertain if Republicans who are challenging him will continue to mount that opposition through the course of many ballots. One Republican congressman plans to run in this race, Andy Biggs of Arizona. That could be enough to siphon away just enough votes to deny McCarthy the speakership. Now, the other big question here is whether any other potential alternative could emerge to McCarthy. At the moment, no one exists who can get 218 votes, not even Steve Scalise, who is the House Republican whip, who is poised to be the new House majority leader, the number two in the new Congress. If he were to get -- if he were to run, I'm told by multiple Republicans, he also would not get the votes to become elected speaker. All of which raises major questions for Republicans as they would hope to celebrate the return to power, as they hoped to plan to organize their new majority. Instead, they have to vote into a tense internal feud over the future speaker, and Kevin McCarthy is pushing to get there. The question is, can he and how long will it take?
