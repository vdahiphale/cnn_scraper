Adding to the anger is a fire that broke out in the capital of China`s far west Xinjiang region on Thursday night. Ten people were killed and nine were injured in a fire at an apartment building in Urumqi. Most parts of Xinjiang have been under lockdown for more than a hundred days. The deadly fire sparked nationwide outrage because widely circulated videos which have now been censored in China show that COVID measures, COVID lockdown measures very likely delayed firefighters from getting to the scene. Now, state media claims that people in the compound were allowed to leave the building, that it was considered a low-risk COVID area. But video shows fire trucks unable to get close to the scene because the compound entrance was partially blocked. The video shows it`s blocked with fences tents and metal barriers that are normally used as part of COVID measures. The videos also show smoke and flames coming from a high floor of the building but the water failing to actually reach the fire. What adds to the tragedy is that those who died in the fire likely spent their last three months largely confined to that building if not entirely. The fire really struck a cord with the public here because we`ve seen scenes of tragedy and suffering play out over and over again since the start of the pandemic. Countless stories of people struggling to get enough food daily necessities and emergency care and lockdown three years into these draconian policies, frustrations are more frequently turning into public protests which are normally rare and authoritarian China. Last week, in the southern city of Guangzhou, some residents revolted during lockdown by tearing down barriers and marching through the streets. There were violent clashes at the Foxconn factory in Zhengzhou this week. But still, there`s no end in sight to zero COVID. Selina Wang, CNN, Beijing. (END VIDEOTAPE) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

This new tech startup wants to replace fossil fuels with concentrated sunlight. But unlike traditional green energy suppliers, this startup is able to store fuel to create power even when it`s dark outside or cloudy. But while the company has major financial backers, it`s not a perfect solution. Stock prices are low and some question whether Heliogen can execute on a large scale. We`ll hear now from CNN business producer Jon Sarlin. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JON SARLIN, CNN BUSINESS PRODUCER (voice-over):  In California`s Mojave Desert, renewable energy company Heliogen is working to harness concentrated sunlight for more than just powering your home. Using artificial intelligence, these mirrors can produce the extremely high temperatures needed to make things like concrete, steel and green hydrogen.
