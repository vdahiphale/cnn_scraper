He talks about getting -- Israel meeting to wrap things up as quickly as possible in Gaza, not really mentioning the civilian death toll and the destruction that has happened there.But, this is going to be a very interesting meeting, because on the one hand, former President Trump was in many ways the most pro-Israel President that we've ever seen. They -- he moved the embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. He recognized the Golan Heights as being part of Israel. He struck the Abraham Accords between Israel and several other Arab countries. But then, Trump was angered by Netanyahu in the wake of the 2020 election when Netanyahu very quickly congratulated Joe Biden on his victory. President Trump thought that was premature. And so, the Netanyahu camp has been trying to get back into Trump's good graces. So, this is going to be another meeting to watch very closely.",

Jeremy, how are Israelis reacting to the Prime Minister's speech, given that it happened in primetime viewing for Israel, and there had been a lot of focus among the Israeli public specifically for those details that Alex Marquardt noted were not in that nearly hour-long speech?",

      "sentences": "Yeah. An unprecedented fourth speech from this Prime Minister before a joint session of Congress. That's something we haven't seen before from any world leader. It also speaks to the fact that the Prime Minister has been in office for a very long time.Jeremy, there had been hints going into this speech that he would give more detail as to what a day-after plan in Gaza would look like. But, that didn't appear to happen other than once again reinforcing that there would be a demilitarized and de-radicalized Gaza that would be run by civilians. But, who those civilians are and who would ultimately be in charge, we heard none of that. DIAMOND: Yeah. That's right. And we haven't heard a lot from the Israeli Prime Minister on this issue. He did give a nod to it yesterday in talking about this notion of demilitarizing Gaza, doing it in partnership with some Arab allies in the region. There has been reporting recently, of course, that the United Arab Emirates might even be willing to put some kind of a multinational force together and actually send troops in on the ground to provide kind of a law and order position, while that kind of transition period is happening in Gaza. But, beyond just kind of talking about ideas that have already been out there, we really didn't get a lot new from the Israeli Prime Minister on that issue. And what we certainly didn't get was a commitment on his part to some kind of longer-term solution. And I think that's ultimately one of the overarching takeaways that I had from this, is this is an Israeli Prime Minister who was focused more than anything else on justifying the Israeli war in Gaza, garnering support for that war, making the case for that war, at a time when there is a deal on the table that could potentially end it, and I think that more than anything, that is telling about the Israeli Prime Minister's mindset. Whether or not that is an attempt to kind of shore up his right-wing allies before he takes a leap towards a ceasefire agreement, that's certainly a possibility. But, if you just listen to the Israeli Prime Minister's words at face value, this did not sound like a man who was thinking about a long- term future in Gaza, or who was thinking about signing a ceasefire agreement in the coming days.",

All of this has been an extremely fast timetable. The past month was about like a week.CNN Senior Reporter Edward-Isaac Dovere joins us now live. So, Edward- Isaac, it's good to see you. We have Kamala Harris there on the campaign trail in Houston, a new ad just out, and now remarks from her campaign regarding what we saw yesterday, countering what the Prime Minister of Israel was doing as he was delivering comments before a joint session of Congress. We saw protests outside, some of it peaceful, some of it not, some of it included pro-Hamas chants and flags, as well as the burning of American flags outside of Union Station in D.C. The Biden administration earlier was quick to put out a statement. It had been a little bit longer till we heard from Kamala Harris's campaign about this. But here, we now have word that she condemns the burning of American flag outside Union Station in Washington on Wednesday. I mean, I guess this is just what we can expect the tightrope she is going to have to walk, being her own candidate campaigning, while at the same time also being the Vice President to the current President. It's maybe a little bit difficult to be in lockstep, but also your own person. EDWARD-ISAAC DOVERE, CNN SENIOR REPORTER: Yeah. Look, and that statement actually is from her government office. Another part of it, yes, there is the burning of the American flag that she condemns. She also, in the statement, writes, \"I condemn any individuals associated with the brutal terrorist organization Hamas, which has vowed to annihilate the state of Israel and kill Jews.\" That is a pretty strong and direct language from her, and it comes at this moment when she is meeting with Benjamin Netanyahu this afternoon, when she gets back to Washington. And as people are looking at her and saying, they really don't know where she actually stands on Israel, she has obviously been part of the administration with Biden. People telling me who are familiar with it that she, for most of the substance, agrees with Joe Biden, has made a point publicly and privately of talking about the emphasis on some of the rhetoric and making sure to talk about the suffering of Palestinians, make clear that when they're saying they're anti-Hamas, that it is not the same as being anti-Palestinian, and that the Palestinian people are separate in this from what Hamas has been doing. That is a rhetorical shift. But, it also speaks to a sense that she will maybe have a different overall relationship with this issue than Joe Biden has. Biden, obviously, for 50 years, has been one of the most pro-Israel people out there, Jewish or not. And most people would say, one of the, if not the most pro-Israel presidents that we've ever had.",

She was just more a bad cop in terms of being more tough on Israel, and focusing more on the plight of the Palestinians.

I mean, we have focused a lot on his ability to really address his own policies in a way that he hasn't been able to do so well over the past few months that ultimately led him to the decision to drop out of the race.

He talked about Donald Trump. He did not mention her name. Donald Trump's campaign went after her for not being there, said that she was insulting the Jewish people and running away from Israel. But, of course, J.D. Vance, Donald Trump's running mate, was not there either, even though he is the Senator.

That didn't seem to have a nationwide ultimate. The impetus wasn't there to go down that route. It didn't work for them, even though it's a great line. What do you think the response should be from the Harris campaign to these types of attacks?NATASHA ALFORD, HOST, \"THEGRIO WEEKLY\": Well, I think she is being attacked because she is a worthy contender, right? The fact that they have to stoop so low, that they have to go with the racism and the misogyny, that speaks to what S.E. said, which is that they don't want to engage in policy conversation. So, I think she needs to lean into that. That ad with Beyonce in the background was brilliant, because not only thematically does that song \"Freedom\" speak to so many people, people want to be free from this disgusting, uncivil sort of political moment that we're in. They're tired of personal attacks. They're tired of being divided as Americans. People want to be proud of the America that we were told about as children, one that embraces everyone. And so, she can lean into that. She can be the example and the adult in the room. But, please be clear. Kamala Harris with her prosecutorial background, her time in the Senate, she is fierce. She is tough. She can fight. And so, people want somebody who can hit back, but do so with the truth and do so with some integrity.",

In response to this ad, I noticed a tweet from Amy Walter of The Cook Report, and she wrote that the freedom message is one that many Democrats have argued works better than calls to protect democracy. So, that's sort of in line with the point that you just made.S.E., Republicans close to Trump say they're really worried about him and his allies venturing too far down the road of racism and misogyny and personal attacks against the Vice President. You've had the current Speaker and the former Speaker also worry about some of this language, and telling the Republicans, in particular this campaign, not to go down the DEI higher road. I am wondering, do you think they'll actually heed that warning and advice?",

Of course, LaCivita really knew what he was doing, and whether it was encouraging Donald Trump to distance himself from 2025, whether that's true or not, or not to dance on Joe Biden's grave while he was struggling. Those were two very good things to advise Donald Trump to do when he did them. He will need to be advised again, and so will J.D. Vance, that these kinds of attacks are really deleterious to their campaign.There is always a question of whether Trump will listen, because he has his own principle and he has impulses that he can't deny, generally. But, that would be the smart thing to do. And like I said, he has smart people running this campaign. The problem is, they didn't have a plan for this campaign, the one against Kamala Harris. So, they are basically starting over and having to scrap a very finely tuned campaign that was meant to be run against Joe Biden through November. So, I think that's why you're seeing this sudden explosion of undisciplined, sort of not a unified Republican Party uniting around a single message, uniting around ideas.
