This is just north of Houston, where on Friday authorities say that this man, the 38-year-old Francisco Oropeza conducted this brutal killing of five of his neighbors. Now they originally were able to track his cellphone. He discarded that phone, authority said.And so at this hour, no leads. But as you mentioned, an $80,000 reward right now for information leading to his capture. Now just to walk you through these events, witnesses say that on Friday, neighbors went over to the suspect's home because they kept hearing the sound of gunfire. And they asked him, hey, can you shoot on the other side of your house, there's a baby here that is, you know, being disturbed by this ear piercing gunfire. Rather than stopping shooting, the suspect allegedly soon charged into the home of his neighbors, opening fire, killing a woman in the doorway, killing three other people and then killing a nine-year-old boy. Now one man who was inside that home who was able to escape, he lost his wife. He lost his child in that killing, but he spoke in just an emotional press conference describing what that incident was like. Have a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) WILSON GARCIA, FATHER OF 9-YEAR-OLD SHOOTING VICTIM (through translator): One of the people who died saw when my wife fell to the ground and was dying. And she told me to throw myself out the window because my children were already without a mother, so one of us had to stay alive to take care of them. And she was the person who helped me throw myself out the side of a window. But she's still failed. She died. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

The root of their issues can largely be traced to Silicon Valley Bank, more specifically, the fear that spread following the collapse of SVB. First Republic counts many wealthy clients as customers.That's part of what is led to this as well with most of their business, First Republics focused on the coast. They have branches in places like Beverly Hills, Silicon Valley, Palm Beach, Florida, New York, Greenwich, Connecticut, there's no problem there. But many of their affluent customers, they held large balances with the bank, which eventually meant two-thirds of its deposits were above the amount of the -- that the FDIC insures and that was at the -- as of the end of 2022. And then after SVB failed, First Republic customers, they got spooked quite simply and started pulling the money out fast. First Republic reported last week that customers had pulled $100 billion in deposits out just in the first three months of this year. And that happened after as Vanessa was just talking about, 11 other banks had come together in mid-March to give first Republicans $30 billion lifeline. It gave them time, but it did not save them. Share prices were down by 97 percent since early March. On March 1st, the bank was trading at around $122 a share. Since then, the stock price just has plunged now below $4 a share. All of this adding together and making it pretty clear as the end of last week that First Republic's fate was sealed. Sara?",

But we're not going to negotiate on the debt ceiling.And on the other side, you had the Republican whip Tom Emmer, who helped to muscle through very narrowly the Republican plan, which has, you know, over $4 trillion of spending cuts last week saying, we won't let the nation default on its debt. But we're not going to deal with what the Democrats want to deal with. So that's where they are publicly. This to me is sort of exhibit A of why people are so fed up with Washington. I know there's exhibit A, B, C, and all goes to Z. But this is really important, especially now, especially as you've been reporting all morning about the failure of this bank, because people don't want more chaos and disruption at all in their wallets and in their bank accounts. And so they're saying, they're talking past each other. They're doing it to pasture. And eventually, it is hard to imagine that they will not find a way to for both sides to claim victory, and both sides to figure out a way to make sure that the nation doesn't default on its debt.

They are still showing their various constituencies that they are sticking out the positions that they want.And so they're not at the time -- at the place where they're sitting down at a table like this. I'm not saying right now that something wild will not happen in Washington. I mean, it was 2011, they didn't allow America to default on its debt. But they came so close that the rating, got a downgrade, which had never happened in America's history. So look, I think the thing that people need to know is that, despite the sort of, frankly pandering that we're seeing on both sides, from politicians, they do in their heart of hearts, understand the stakes, and the stakes are incredibly high when it comes to the financial stability of the American economy and voters and their pocketbooks.",

There's no question about it.But now they have -- they've sort of again, positioned themselves so that they can inch back to some kind of -- and this -- let me just actually say this because it's so complicated I think for a lot of people. When you hear the Democrats saying, we're not going to negotiate on the debt ceiling, were because it is, as you said, the bills that have already been, the money's already been spent. These are bills that we have to pay.
