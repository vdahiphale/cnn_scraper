This was in the Taiwan Strait where the U.S. was conducting a joint exercise with Canada.The Navy released this video of the Chinese warship cutting right in front, you can see there, of the U.S. Navy destroyer. The U.S. says the Chinese were being reckless. China blames the U.S. for being there in the first place. There is the moment the two warships nearly collided from afar. Again, about 150 yards between them. We should be clear, at sea at these speeds, that's very, very close. Joining me now, retired Navy captain, Sam Tangredi. He's the chair of Future Warfare Studies at the U.S. Naval War College. Good to have you on, sir. CAPT. SAM TANGREDI, U.S. NAVY, RETIRED &amp; LEIDOS CHAIR, FUTURE WARFARE STUDIES, U.S. NAVAL WAR COLLEGE: Thank you.",

By the way, just a few days after a Chinese fighter jet came right in front of the U.S. surveillance jet in the South China Sea.This has not happened by accident. This is not a Navy captain freelancing. It is part of a broader Chinese strategy. What is that in your view?",

Of course, that violates international law.The reason we conduct these transits is specifically to support international law. One of the principals in international law is, if you don't use your rights, they will eventually go away. So that's what we're trying to do, continue that. SCIUTTO: Now, the problem is China doesn't recognize international law here. It didn't in the South China Sea when it took territory claimed by half a dozen different countries and built island that's have become military installations. China doesn't recognize the law. The U.S. wants to demonstrate this is the law. These are international waters. That's -- your immovable object meeting an irresistible forceful. Where does that leave the U.S. And China?",

None of those resulted in war.But the problem is the that Chinese Communist Party will always feel threatened by successful democracies. Because they look at the future and they say, a day will come when the Chinese people are more prosperous, saying, OK, we're prosperous. These democratic nations are prosperous, too. They get to vote. We don't get to vote. So it is in the interests of the Chinese Communist Party to, in any way they can, cut down the power of democratic nations in the international system.

You want to protect your crew and the ship itself.How close a call was this? TANGREDI: Oh, well, people look at 150 yards and say that's plenty of time and space to maneuver. But we have to remember, the \"USS Chung- Hoon\" is 1,000 tons at 160 yards. And let's talk about trying to stop a vessel in its length, which you probably can't do with your car on the highway. And this would not be like a car accident. This is like two buildings colliding together. So it is very difficult. In the open ocean, we prefer to keep about 2,000 yards away from other transiting ships. Maybe as near as perhaps 1,000 yards. But generally, that's about as close as you need to come in the open ocean. The Taiwan Straits are 150 nautical miles wide. There is no reason for ships to have to pass that close unless it is a deliberate provocation.",

A CNN exclusive is revealing how Ukraine is leveraging Russians against Russia.Sources say Ukraine has cultivated agents and sympathizers inside Putin's borders to carry out sabotage against the Kremlin's forces. It is not clear if this network is behind the eight drones shot down over the skies of Moscow last week but U.S. officials believe the agents did launch a drone at the Kremlin in early May. Let's bring in CNN national security reporter, Zach Cohen. He's part of the team that broke this story. Zach, what are your sources telling you about how Ukraine is obtaining these drones?",

We have two sources that point out that there are well-established smuggling routes from Ukraine into Russia that could be used to basically ship drone parts into Russia and to be configured later once across the border. A European intelligence official also mentioned that had the border between Ukraine and Russia is very large and very hard to control. They noted, too, this is a peripheral area of Russia where survival is key. Take a look at this quote. \"Survival is everyone's problem so cash works wonders.\" That just speaks to the level of chaos and the level of self- preservation happening in this sort of No Man's Land of the border between Ukraine and Russia. And regardless of how the drones are getting behind enemy lines, it speaks to how Ukraine is trying to take the war to Russia at a time when we know they're planning a counteroffensive come this spring.",

Many of them told her that they had no idea where they were going or even that Sacramento was in the state of California. Brianna, also new information. The Lawyers for Civil Rights, the same attorneys representing the immigrants in the Martha's Vineyard situation, they sued DeSantis and also Virtol. Those attorneys are now on the ground in Sacramento providing legal assistance to the migrants there.
