Rob Portman, one of the most closely-watched races in the country. Trump, obviously, has been campaigning for J.D.

So joining us now to talk about what we should expect today is Statehouse News bureau chief for Ohio Public Radio and Television, Karen Kasler. Karen, thanks so much for being here. And I know you've been watching all of this so closely. What have you heard from voters in the closing days as these polls are set to open in about 45 minutes from now? KAREN KASLER, STATEHOUSE NEWS BUREAU CHIEF, OHIO PUBLIC RADIO AND TELEVISION (via Webex by Cisco):  Well, the issue continues to be the economy. I think it's been that way through this whole campaign though, of course, there was a blip this summer where Democrats really gained some ground with the Dobbs decision overturning the right to abortion. But that economy issue and gas prices -- that's what you keep hearing from voters. And I think it shows in the way that Tim Ryan has been campaigning. He's really been chasing those moderate voters, those frustrated Trump voters, trying to lure them over rather than really focusing on the Democratic voters that are his base.",

Voters will also pick their next secretary of state, fill a number of house seats, and vote on a ballot measure that could guarantee the right to abortion.Joining us now, government and politics reporter for the Detroit Free Press, Dave Boucher. It's good to have you. What are you hearing and seeing on the ground from voters that you don't think is getting enough attention in the national -- on the national stage about these races? DAVE BOUCHER, GOVERNMENT AND POLITICS REPORTER, DETROIT FREE PRESS (via Skype):  Well, we've definitely also heard about inflation and gas prices, but there's a difference between what voters are concerned about and what's actually driving them to vote for a particular candidate. In our most recent poll, voters said inflation and the economy were the number one issue, but the number one issue driving their vote on the governor's race was abortion. So, as you noted, there's also a proposed constitutional amendment that would guarantee the right to an abortion in the state constitution in Michigan, and Gov. Gretchen Whitmer has really tied her fate to that. Polling has showed that both that constitutional amendment is probably going to pass and that Gov. Whitmer is sitting in a relatively strong position heading into Election Day. HARLOW:  But what I -- what I brought up earlier that I think is really interesting, Dave, though, is the fact that there are some voters that our folks are talking to -- Dana Bash was just there talking to a voter who said well, I voted for the ballot initiative to protect an abortion right, but because that was on there I felt free to vote for Tudor Dixon who does not support that -- which I found fascinating.

We know what it's all about with the Powerball.You know, I have heard of flights being delayed, I've heard of trains being delayed. I've even heard of court cases being delayed. But this is a new one on me. I've never heard of the Powerball being delayed. And as you point out, Kaitlan, it's security protocols, which is a very mysterious realm because lottery officials are fanatical when it comes to their security protocols. Here's what we know. The lottery -- the Powerball is sold in at least 45 different states, plus the District of Columbia, plus Puerto Rico, plus the U.S. Virgin Islands. And in all of those independent lottery associations, they have to follow very strict security protocols. And they've got to tabulate and they've got to turn in their returns, and essentially, everything has to go perfectly. Somewhere along the lines last night it has not gone so. Now, quite frankly, with close to $2 billion on the line, it's not exactly a good look and we're still waiting to find out when this drawing is going to take place. Lottery officials do expect that it will take place today -- they just can say exactly what time it is going to take place. And we should point out the good news is if you bought a ticket, you haven't lost. The bad news is you just don't know if you're going to win. And by the way, if you're hoping that you can still rush out and go buy a ticket, I believe that train has already left the station.",
