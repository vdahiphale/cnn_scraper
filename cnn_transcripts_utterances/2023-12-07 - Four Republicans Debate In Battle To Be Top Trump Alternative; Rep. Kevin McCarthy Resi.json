I'm Kasie Hunt.With the Iowa caucuses less than six weeks away, four Republican presidential candidates went after each other on a heated and sometimes insulting debate stage in Alabama last night. Chris Christie, Nikki Haley, Ron DeSantis, and Vivek Ramaswamy sparred over a number of issues trying to set themselves apart to become the key rival -- the number two to frontrunner Donald Trump. Trump, of course, skipped all four debates, including this one, and his absence loomed large. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) CHRIS CHRISTIE, (R) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  The fifth guy, who doesn't have the guts to show up and stand here -- he's the one who, as you just put it, is way ahead in the polls. And yet, I've got these three guys who are all seemingly to compete with Voldemort -- he who shall not be named. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

From Haley and from DeSantis, we hear sort of these sort of measured criticisms. And then you have someone like Vivek Ramaswamy saying January 6 was an inside job. So there's not really this concerted effort among all of the candidates to try to draw that contrast.

Back then, he was running on a vision to make America great again and was a voice for those who felt left behind by this country.And today, that is not the message at all that we're seeing from him. He literally is campaigning on saying stuff like I am your retribution. And he has talked about proposing things such as weaponizing the DOJ to enact revenge on his political enemies. He's called for doing away with parts of the Constitution. And so, people think sometimes, I think, that when we say democracy is at stake that it sounds alarmist. And I think that there have been these kinds of dire warnings ever since he, honestly, came onto the political scene back in 2015. But the thing is that we need to be paying attention to his words and what he's actually saying. And so, I don't think it's necessarily a joke when he says I'm going to be a dictator on day one. And he was actually given multiple opportunities during that interview with Sean Hannity to say that he wouldn't break the law or that he wouldn't abuse his power, and he sidestepped the question and then tried to play it off as a joke.

And I think, to Sarah's point, you could see Sean Hannity in that interview trying to get him to say no, I will not be a dictator.The reasoning that the campaign -- you know, for the campaign to be concerned about it is the general election. Because there does seem to be some concern among people who work for Trump that this line of conversation is problematic for the general election. How do you -- like, how do you view that in this -- in this context? I know you and I talked yesterday. He's clearly making a play to the base of the Republican Party that seems -- and Mitt Romney was out there yesterday saying yeah, his base is fine with these authoritarian tendencies.

This does reinforce a concern that Republicans, and even Kevin McCarthy, had where he said look, if you want to make this campaign about revenge -- or as Chris Christe said, retribution -- this will not help you. It will hurt you. And especially, when you have a president like Joe Biden in the 30s in his approval rating, you have an opportunity to talk about voters and what they want. And so, making it about yourself -- which again, as Christie pointed out he often does -- hurts you to win a general election.

He was above 50 and took that really significant dip with the Afghanistan withdrawal.

Him getting pushed to the right by his right flank -- a times, squeezed by those conservatives. And of course, this all came to his decision to put a clean continuing resolution on the floor to avert a government shutdown at the end of September. And that was just the last straw for some of these hardline conservatives. Eight of them, led by Matt Gaetz, bringing that motion to vacate that ended up being successful and deposing McCarthy from his position in a pretty stunning and embarrassing fashion. So after that, this speculation had swirled. Would McCarthy stay in the game? Would he stay out? Would he run for reelection? Finish his term? He openly said this was a tough decision and ultimately, saying it would be a gut decision. At the end of the day, he decided to tap out early. Again, I don't think anybody is too surprised by this just considering that he had been at the top of the House -- the top of the GOP conference and had this embarrassing fall.

I don't think anybody thought that it could get this slim, Kasie.And you mentioned Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene -- of course, a very close ally of Kevin McCarthy -- has spoken out against the eight Republicans who forced this vote to oust McCarthy and has since been critical of Speaker Johnson. She bluntly said yesterday, \"I hope nobody dies.\" Because if anybody dies in the Republican Conference, that slims their majority even more and brings them in very close territory, Kasie, of losing the majority. So, in any way that you look at this, Kevin McCarthy's leaving Capitol Hill at the end of the year is significant for House Republicans. You bring this back to Speaker Johnson. We are heading into a very high-stakes period of legislating appropriations. There are two government funding deadlines next year. Leaders still want to pass funding for Ukraine and funding for Israel. There's that vote on opening an impeachment inquiry into President Biden expected next week. But if it gets punted until next year, after the recess, these are all going to be heavy lifts. On any day, they are going to be heavy lifts for Speaker Johnson and his leadership team.
