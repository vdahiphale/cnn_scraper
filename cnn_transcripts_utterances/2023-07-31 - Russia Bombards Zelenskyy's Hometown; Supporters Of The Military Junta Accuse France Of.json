Tonight, this is whatthe hometown of Ukraine's president looks like just one day after he said the war is returning to Russia. More on Russia's vicious retaliation. Also ahead, political flags in Niger as supporters of the military Junta accuse France of planning strikes to free the president. More details and how France has responded. And a new army of drones, watchtowers and A.I. scouring the U.K. coastline for small boats. But it hasn't stopped people from dying, our special investigation ahead this hour. A new wave of Russian attacks has hit the hometown of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Here's video capturing the moment missiles slammed into Kryvyi Rih. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

The attack comes after drone strikes were reported against Moscow over the weekend. Now, President Zelenskyy in his address said the war was returning to Russia. He called this, inevitable, natural and absolutely fair. Russia's defense minister says his country is intensifying its attacks in response to drone strikes. Meanwhile, we're tracking a chilling threat by Russia's former President, Dmitry Medvedev says his country may be forced to use nuclear weapons if Ukraine's counteroffensive succeeds. This isn't the first time he's threatened to use nukes, but it's notable that a top Russian official is saying publicly, Kyiv's counteroffensive could work. This comes as Ukraine says Saudi Arabia is hosting upcoming peace talks, the Kremlin says it will monitor the negotiations. For the latest, I'm now joined by CNN's Nic Robertson from London. Nic, great to have you on. Zelenskyy's hometown of Kryvyi Rih hit, we've seen these images, and one of the big unknowns at the start of the war was when the war would eventually go to Russia. Zelenskyy now saying it was inevitable and he says it's fair. How does this change the dynamics of this war?",

But what Ukraine is now doing, now it's clearly developed a type of drone that it can produce in some numbers, and that can go all the way from inside of Ukraine, all the way to Moscow, they now have another tool at their disposal, to interrupt Russia's narrative to its own people, and it's having effect.

So, I think there are other ways to engage. And I said, in Mali, in the early days of the coup with now Colonel Goita, President Goita, the president of Mali was taken by the military as well. There were enough pressures coming from different quarters, so eventually, they released the president.

So, I don't see them going anywhere any time soon. However, I do believe with that robust engagements, they will eventually, there's opportunity for them to step down. We saw this in Mali 1991, the military staged a coup, they were under tremendous pressure, after a year, they stepped down, organized elections, and Mali was a democracy for a good old -- a good part of two decades. That it started with a coup. The other point I think, Eleni, that we are missing here, we talk a lot about France engagement, U.S. commitment and all that stuff. A lot of that commitment is on the kinetic counterterrorism side. In other words, that's the militarized part of phone engagement. What we don't see in the Sahel is heavy investment on the democracy side. So, we see when Ukraine wants democracy, when Poland wants democracy or the Czech Republic, the West puts a lot of money to support that democracy. And I'm talking billions.

Just the tropical intense rainfall. And then it slowed down right through here, right through the Beijing area. Now, the next storm we're talking about, Khanun or Khanuni(ph), depending on how you want to pronounce it, jackfruit there in Thailand. That's a storm that may make another approach to the mainland China. But look at some of these numbers, one third of a meter or 12 inches of rainfall came down just in 48 to 72 hours, causing pictures like this. Just to the west was the bullseye west of Beijing where some of those spots in there, I can pick out 250 to 350 millimeters of rainfall. So, here's Khanun, you can call it whatever you like, Khanun, Khanuni(ph), here it is, Okinawa, all the way up to Amami Oshima. These are the areas that are going to get impacted by this. But like you said, don't really know where this is going to go. Because the computer models are very confused after about 72 hours, and even the joint typhoon warning center turns it up toward the north, and some of the computer models then turn it back towards the left or to the west. But this is what the American model looks like after about 72. We know where it's going for now. That would be Okinawa in the area there, and likely somewhere in the ballpark of a 220 kilometers per hour storm. But after that, all of these different ensembles have completely different ideas of where this is going. The one that we trust the most does have, approaching mainland China, there's Shanghai up there. But then kind of stopping and turning and then turning to the right. When that happens, all kinds of things can happen. The storm can lose intensity, it can get sheared apart, or it can just rain and rain and rain for days in places where it stops. Certainly, in the ocean, the computers are saying a meter of rainfall. Let's hope that is not in the ocean near an island chain there.",

I think the fact that, you know, Russia feelsvulnerable because of the Ukrainian success, so even though they're trying to spin this as a failure on the part of the Ukrainians, the real answer is that it's actually much more of a Russian failure than anything else. Russia has not advanced in 10 months. They have not been able to do anything that would allow them to move their forces forward. They basically allowed for a war of attrition to take place. And as a result of this, they've, in essence, developed these defensive lines, which are vulnerable. There's no question about it. But the question that they have to deal with is, you know, can they actually sustain this defensive process?

So, they are able to instill fear in places like Moscow, which is 800 kilometers away from the Ukrainian border, more or less, and that is a basic flaw in the Russian system because they're allowing these types of things to happen. But the Ukrainians cannot really prosecute and major advance into Russia. They say they don't want to, which is another key point here. But they also, as you pointed out, don't have the equipment or the permission to use NATO equipment in the direction. They are therefore purely defensive purposes and their ability to execute that defense, which includes that counteroffensive in -- within Ukrainian borders, that's really what the Ukrainian mission is.

Crimea, the Donbas, the portion of the Donbas that they've had since that time. So what the Ukrainians can probably hope for is some kind of a rollback of the positions that the Russians have taken since February of 2022. If that happens, that might result in somewhat of a limited at least ceasefire. But that really points to a problem. The Ukraine will not be able to achieve its goals, and Russia will not be able to achieve its goals.

Joining us now is CNN's Stephen Collinson to break this down for us, Stephen, great to have you with us. We're seeing those images coming through from Miami, him appearing in the court. He's been accused of not being truthful about moving these boxes. Do you think that he's going to be a potential witness here? Perhaps face criminal charges? How important is this person to the case?",

      "sentences": "Well, I think, Eleni this all brings back that famous Watergate scandal, that it's not the crime that getssomeone. It's the cover-up. What is significant in the latest developments in this case with Mr. de Oliveira? Certain other workers at the Mar-a-Lago resort is that he raised the possibility that former President Trump was not only hoarding classified documents, but that he was actively trying to obstruct the government, getting them back, documents to which he was not entitled as a former president, some of which are of the highest national security standards. So this is where the legal problem for Donald Trump is getting worse and worse, because if it is proven that he orchestrated the deleting of surveillance tapes, as the special counsel is now alleging, that gets into a whole new level of criminal liability for him. Obstruction of justice, which is far more potentially damaging in a courtroom in front of a jury than just the initial case about whether Trump was illegally keeping classified documents that he had when he was president.",

And then the special counsel came and put more charges on him last Thursday night on the classified documents case. There are also signs that the district attorneys' investigation in Georgia over Trump's attempt to overthrow the election in that key state in 2020, that's also coming close to a charging decision. So, the legal morass around Trump is getting worse and worse almost by the day. You could see a situation next year where he spends almost as much trial -- time on trial in a courtroom as he's able to do on the campaign trial, but the political situation from the Trump, conversely, is actually getting a lot better. There's no real sign that any of his Republican challenges in the primary race are making much ground against him. A poll out today has him 37 points ahead of his biggest rival, Ron DeSantis, the Florida governor, in that race. So Republican voters aren't buying any of this right now.",
