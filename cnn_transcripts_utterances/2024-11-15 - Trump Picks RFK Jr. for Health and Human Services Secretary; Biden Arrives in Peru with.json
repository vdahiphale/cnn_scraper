      "sentences": "Welcome back to CNN NEWSROOM. I'm Max Foster. If you're just joining us, here are today's top stories.U.S. President-elect Donald Trump adding to his list of Cabinet selections live on stage. During an event for the America First Policy Institute, he announced that North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum will be Secretary of the Interior. Russia is watching the Cabinet selection process pretty closely and is celebrating some of his choices. Russian state media are cheering on the selection of Matt Gaetz as Attorney General and Tulsi Gabbard as Director of National Intelligence. Trump's pick for Health and Human Services Secretary has people talking. Robert F. Kennedy Jr., an environmental lawyer and activist who's a known vaccine skeptic, will head to the department. RFK Jr. has long been known for his bizarre behavior, some of it involving dead animals, much of it involving misinformation about vaccines. CNN's Brian Todd has a closer look at his controversies. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) DONALD TRUMP, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT, 2024 PRESIDENTIAL ELECT: I'm going to let him go wild on health. I'm going to let him go wild on the food. I'm going to let him go wild on medicines. BRIAN TODD, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): The person Donald Trump's going to let go wild, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., is the 70-year-old son of Democratic icon Robert Kennedy, and has become known mostly for espousing outlandish, false conspiracy theories about the COVID virus. ROBERT F. KENNEDY JR., FORMER U.S. PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: COVID- 19 is targeted to attack Caucasians and Black people. The people who are most immune are Ashkenazi Jews and Chinese. TODD (voice-over): And he's repeatedly, baselessly called the COVID-19 vaccines unsafe. LAURA BARRON-LOPEZ, CNN POLITICAL ANALYST: There could be widespread disinformation to the public about what they should or shouldn't be doing in terms of their public health. TODD (voice-over): The co-chair of Trump's transition team told CNN's Kaitlan Collins this, about what Kennedy might try to do with the COVID vaccines that are in place now which have been proven to be mostly safe. HOWARD LUTNICK, CO-CHAIR, TRUMP-VANCE TRANSITION TEAM: He says, if you give me the data, all I want is the data, and I'll take on the data and show that it's not safe, and then if you pull the product liability, the companies will yank these vaccines right off of the market. TODD (voice-over): In May of this year, it was revealed that Kennedy once claimed in a deposition that a parasitic worm had once entered his brain and died, which he said led to, quote, severe brain fog, and trouble with his short-term memory. He actually joked about it.",

BioNTech and Novavax both saw losses of more than 7 percent in the last hour of trading as news of Trump's choice began to spread.Last week, Kennedy said he would immediately start studying vaccine safety but promised not to take vaccines away from anybody. U.S. President Joe Biden now in Peru for the APEC summit with its focus on Asia-Pacific economic cooperation. The president will seek to reassure leaders who are talking about how to insulate their economies against potential challenges posed by President-elect Donald Trump. In particular, Biden will meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping on Saturday. Steven Jiang is following all of this for us from Beijing. I'm just wondering how you think Xi is going to go into this meeting and what he might want to get from Biden.",

      "sentences": "That's right. But, you know, as you mentioned, the election result from the U.S. really is looming large over this meeting, because the Chinese have a lot to worry about, not just those potential massive tariffs that Trump has threatened during the campaign, but also now they have to potentially deal with quite a few China hawks that Trump just picked for his new cabinet and national security team.But Chinese officials have been telling us that they are fully prepared to deal with the second Trump administration, which they expect to be quite different from the first time around. They are also saying that they are very much capable of fighting back, even faced with a sluggish economy at home. Now, their more immediate concern seem to be the potential disruption or even total halt of just resumed bilateral exchanges between the two sides on numerous issues. And that actually is how the Biden administration sees this meeting as well, with officials saying from their point of view, no matter who is in the White House, both sides need to find ways to manage this tough and complicated relationship between two superpowers. That's why they say Biden is going to mention some of the progress they have made, but also continues to raise a lot of U.S. concerns multiple fronts. But from Xi's perspective, though, he's going into this meeting, really trying to project this image of stability and global leadership. And some analysts have also said this kind of multilateral setting like APEC gives him an opportunity to drive a wedge between the U.S. and its allies and partners, because if there's one thing China likes even less than potential tariffs, that's Biden's approach in the past few years of forming this united front with partners and allies targeting China on numerous issues. So the setting of this meeting, of course, in Peru, also very interesting, because China just unveiled a multi-billion dollar mega port there built by one of its state owned companies, really a testament to its growing economic clout in the region, long considered to be America's backyard. Now, of course, China has replaced the U.S. as the biggest trading partner with a growing number of Latin American countries. So that kind of stark contrast between China's continuing growing investments and what many see as America's neglect or at least disinterest in the region is something that Xi Jinping is definitely trying to highlight and take advantage of as he goes into this meeting with Biden. Very likely their final meeting -- Max.",

But its effects can still be felt in some parts of the country. That's the case of the southwest where this phenomenon has been moving to.Spain's meteorological agency has activated this Thursday some orange warnings for the regions of Sevilla, Cadiz and Huelva due to the risk of torrential rains. More specifically, this agency estimated that in some towns they can accumulate up to 30 or 40 liters of water per square meter in just one hour. That's why the authorities have suspended all school activities for the day and also recommended the population not to move around until the rains have come to an end. Also, many were paying attention to the situation in Valencia where other warnings were active but in this case lower warnings. Fortunately, the authorities reported no injuries or personal damages over the day. Now, this Friday many will fix their eyes in what happens inside of Valencia's Parliament. And this is because regional president Carlos Mazon will appear before the deputies to provide political explanations on the response that his government offered to the emergency. We should recall that last Saturday thousands protested in Valencia against the response that the regional government has offered because they considered that it was slow and not enough and that's why many were asking him to resign. But we will have to wait until this Friday to see what will be next. Pau Mosquera, CNN, Madrid. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
