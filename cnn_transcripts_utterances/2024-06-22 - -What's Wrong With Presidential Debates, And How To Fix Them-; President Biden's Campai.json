      "sentences": "Setting the bar. I'm Michael Smerconish in Philadelphia. Thursday here on CNN is the first of two scheduled debates between President Biden and Trump. Jake Tapper and Dana Bash will moderate. The debate will last 90 minutes with no live audience.There will be no opening statements. Answers will be two minutes, rebuttals will be one minute. Closing statements will be two minutes. Based on a coin toss, Trump will go last. There will be two commercial breaks and perhaps the biggest rankle microphones will be muted when it's not someone's turn. The stakes are high. The race is tight, whether measured in national surveys, or by battleground states. So the debate is a very big deal and opinions as to who won will no longer be influenced by expectations. Advantage, Joe Biden. And here's why, I call it, be careful what you wish for. In the last two weeks, President Biden traveled overseas to participate in a commemoration of the 80th anniversary of D-Day. Then he came home. On June 10, he attended a Juneteenth concert on the White House lawn and it a widely circulated video he looked well stayed standing amidst a crowd dancing to the music. That video was shown on a loop over at Fox News. Then he returned to Europe to participate in a meeting of G7 leaders. The result was another viral video no doubt you've seen this footage of the President on June 13. And if you watch the version presented on a certain outlet, he looked last befuddled and ultimately rescued by the Italian Prime Minister. It's not that the video was edited. It's all a matter of the camera angle that was shown. \"The Washington Post did a nice job in giving the full view. And seen from a wide lens we see that the President's attention was captured by parachutists whom he seemed eager to engage and maybe congratulate on their landing. Then came last Saturday night. At a star studded Los Angeles fundraiser, this time, the first video that went viral recorded by The Hollywood Reporter is Christopher Gardner seem to show President Obama rescuing a frozen President Biden. These two shown on a loop. And once again, then we got to see additional angles of what happened. They depicted the president standing still basking in the glow of a supportive crowd perhaps until Obama signaled it was time to go. The video for the L.A. fundraiser has become an election Rorschach test. Republicans they see frailty. Democrats they see friendship. The White House accused opponents of playing cheap fakes video and promoting misinformation. Fox responded that they only played unedited videos and then took the opportunity to play them again and again and again. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

As many as 86 percent of Americans say he's too old in one poll.\" The this was referring to Biden doing more lengthy interviews.But then, in the State of the Union, President Biden spoke forcefully and he received positive reviews. The talk of him stepping aside quieted, at least for a while. And yet now with these videos that Biden detractors show and discuss on a loop, the talk is back. Perhaps it's a case of be careful what you wish for because all the talk has lowered Biden's debate bar so far, that it won't take much for him to exceed it and be perceived as the winner as happened with the State of the Union. And this may be why after months of assailing Biden's mental abilities, even suggesting that Biden would need to take drugs to enhance his performance, Trump is suddenly shifting his tone. During an episode of the All-In podcast hosted by Silicon Valley entrepreneurs released on Thursday while continuing to attack him, Trump said this.

And since 2008, the moderator and chief for the group now called Open to Debate, which bills itself as a nonpartisan debate driven media organization dedicated to bringing multiple viewpoints together for a constructive, balanced, respectful exchange of ideas. Their group recently published this report, discourse correction, what's wrong with the presidential debates and how to fix them. He's also the co-author of \"In a Different Key, The Story of Autism,\" which was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize. John, I remember, in your Oxford style debating, when people used to vote as they would enter the theater and then vote at the end, and you would measure change.

And what happens by virtue of the fact that we have a full hour for a topic is you get to see in depth, not just how a person would make their case, but how they will defend their case where their basic philosophy comes from, how their logic works, how they think in real time. But for that to work, there needs to be a clear division of sides. Yes or no sets that up better than anything else.It really sets up a dichotomy of two views that are in conflict with each other, just basically from the beginning. And that has not been the case, generally with the presidential debates. They're -- very often there's a question that's put to one debater, for example, years ago, Bernie Shaw asked Mike Dukakis, what he would do if his wife were raped, what his reaction would be? I think that was a terrible question, because it wasn't a debatable question. He didn't then ask everybody else that. He didn't ask everybody else, what do you think of Mike Dukakis' answer? It was much more like a press conference moment. There wasn't a back and forth a yes or no for anybody else on the stage to debate.

The biggest challenge in these debates has been particularly in recent years. And that's what we've seen in the study that we commissioned. Our CEO Clea Conner ask two researchers at Princeton to go look at the past debates. And the fact is that the tendency has been particularly in the last several rounds of election cycles for the control to get lost because the debaters don't observe time. They don't shut up when the other person is talking particularly one was more liable to do that than the other. And the problem with that is things go off point, time runs out the clock.And being able to turn off the mic is a really powerful tool. And I think that Jake and Dana are very, very much more empowered now to control things that way. And the other thing along the way is to just check the debaters and are you answering the question, to call them out when they're not answering the question. Not get into an argument with the debate -- with the candidates. Don't try to fact check them because I think that's a very, very problematic area. But just to know that they are going to come in with things that they want to say that they prepared, they may even have memorized that they're going to resort to again and again, and to not let that happen, to call them out and keep things on track.",

We're almost in July of the election year for a campaign to say, aha, we've discovered the message. But I think a real and true message is one they've begun to circle, which is, Biden is a guy who's earnestly working every day to try and address the problems of the American people. And Trump every day is working in his own interest. And I think that's what people believe. I think there's a fundamental difference between public perception of their motivations. And you then can talk about various issues, whether it's abortion rights or taxes or any number of issues on which Biden is on one side, Trump is on another side. You know, a great example of this is immigration. Yes, that issue has worked well, for Trump in this election campaign so far. But you know, last winter, he had a chance -- there was a chance to do something really, really meaningful about the border and Trump directed his Republican acolytes in the Senate to kill it. Why? He said at the at that moment, he said, because Biden would get credit for it, and we want the issue. That's Trump. I mean, that's Trump in a nutshell. And I think that can be exploited.

Yes, there is a concern about Biden's age that you address, and whether he can control events. But there are real concerns about whether Trump can control himself, which is one of the -- which is one -- or whether anybody else can for that matter, which is one of the issues that, you know, will put him on trial in this debate, and how he behaves in this debate.

And we did so because of the judgment over 20 or more years of history that he did the right thing. So, I look back at my changed conduct, my changed attitude towards Gerald Ford, and thought to myself, Donald Trump, unlike Richard Nixon, was held accountable, indicted, and convicted by a jury of his peers, even if it was a heavily Democratic jury pool, at least one or two jurors by that statistic, were Trump voters who voted beyond a reasonable doubt. So, he has been held accountable. That's even more than in the Nixon case where Ford pardoned him before trial. But then I looked at Hunter Biden and the empathy that so many people feel towards addiction and the disease of addiction. And I thought that by mentioning he deserves to be commuted in any sentence now that he's been held to the principle of the rule of law. And Senator J.D.

And so, it will put Mr. Trump in an interesting place.Also, it's the right thing to do if what we're talking about is beating Trump on the issues which, as a Democrat, of course, and as somebody who has been very concerned about Trump's respect for the rule of law, his role in the insurrection, his promise to abandon the constitution, believe what he says, that's where we should beat him. David Axelrod has it exactly right. Joe Biden has to prove that he's up to the job, and I believe he will at the debate, but let's decide -- just to repeat again, Michael. I understand my own family in some respects, disagreeing strongly with what I wrote, but I also believe that we can beat Mr. Trump at the ballot box, and that would be the better outcome than allowing him to continue to martyr himself as a victim of a criminal justice system, that the very same system convicted Joe Biden's son, and Joe Biden said, no, I will not pardon or commute my own son.",
