You are watching ONE WORLD.Lebanon's Prime Minister calls it a new day for his country after a brutal period. A ceasefire between Israel and Lebanese militant groups, Hezbollah, is now in effect after more than a year of fighting. The big question is, will it hold? And what does this mean for the war in Gaza? Inside Lebanon, which shares its border, its southern border with Israel, the army began bolstering its presence in the south, and the sign of how the truce is actually already affecting change. Lebanon's education minister says that schools across the country will reopen on Monday. Earlier, thousands of Lebanese displaced by the war began the journey home, despite being urged to delay their return. This was a scene as cars snaked their way through packed highways. A celebration across the country. The U.S.-backed proposal calls for a 60- day pause in the fighting to form the basis for a lasting truce. A 2006 U.N. Security Council resolution has been the blueprint of this agreement. U.S. President Joe Biden is hailing this deal. Here's what his National Security Adviser told my colleague, John Berman. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JAKE SULLIVAN, U.S. NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR: Implementation is going to be key. And that means ensuring that Hezbollah, the terrorist group, cannot rebuild its terror infrastructure in Southern Lebanon, and that the Lebanese Armed Forces do their job in filling in the security vacuum in Southern Lebanon rather than Hezbollah. The United States, along with France and other countries, are committed to ensuring this deal is implemented effectively. And we're going to take steps until the time comes when we can all breathe easy and say, yes, this is actually in effect. It is going to stick. It is going to work. But day in, day out, we are going to make sure that we're doing everything to see to it that the terms of this agreement are enforced. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "An enormous amount of work, Zain. This is something that has been in progress for avery long time now, more than a year. And, frankly, the U.S. hope had been that some kind of ceasefire deal could have been struck between Israel and Hezbollah before an all-out war, before an Israeli ground incursion. They had been working on a ceasefire deal in parallel to the efforts to try to get to a ceasefire in Gaza, but recognizing the fact that they probably couldn't achieve that in Lebanon unless the war in Gaza were over. Israel has long pushed for those two issues to become separate. And in that way, they did succeed. And so this was primarily led by the American envoy, Amos Hochstein, who is part of the National Security Council. He was shuttling between Washington, Jerusalem, Tel Aviv, Beirut for the past few months, trying to get this deal across the finish line. And I think what they've been admitting now is that all of the parties involved, whether it's the Israeli government or Hezbollah, that they have gotten to the point where they find this deal acceptable. Certainly, the U.S. was reaching the end of its rope, feeling like it had put all the pressure on the different parties that it could. But Israel, according to the administration, feels like it has succeeded in degrading Hezbollah, getting them to go back to behind the Litani River and clear out the Hezbollah infrastructure from Southern Lebanon. The Israeli government feels that it has achieved its military objective. Certainly, Hezbollah has been beaten to the point of submission where it no longer is saying that the war in Gaza now needs to be over. And I think the parties are also looking ahead to the Trump administration. There is a sense among U.S. officials here in Washington that Trump does not want to be dealing with this issue when he comes into power in January. And that might have given a nudge encouragement to the Israeli government to agree to this now. Zain, I think one big question that we have is, how is this going to affect the war in Gaza, the efforts to strike a ceasefire and hostage deal there in Gaza? Because, of course, the war continues to rage there. You hear from Jake Sullivan, the national security adviser and others that they do intend to focus on that. They hope that it will encourage Hamas, because Hamas will now believe that they are more isolated because Hezbollah is no longer coming to their aid. I would not say that we are hearing the kind of optimism that we have in the past, but this is certainly going to be an effort for their final few weeks in office. Zain.",

I mean, one of our correspondents there, Alexander Marquardt, was just touching on the fact that, you know, there isn't necessarily a huge amount of optimism that this cessation and hostilities between Israel and Lebanon could actually pave the way or could actually turn increase in appetite for a cessation of hostilities between Israel and Gaza.

The U.S. is going to mediate and bring the two sides together to sort of seal this as a permanent ceasefire. And there happens the ceasefire than the past that did hold for a while. And in fact, the one between Hezbollah and Israel, the previous one, which it is very similar actually to what was just detailed in this ceasefire. And it was only after October 7, and the war in Gaza started, that Hezbollah sort of entered the conflict with Israel. So I'm optimistic that there is a high potential this can hold if, obviously, both parties abide by their terms of them. And I think there's a will to abide by it, considering as we saw that communities had to leave their homes and their villages on the border. So the will, and I think the necessity on both sides exists, but this is also still not completely decoupled from Gaza. I think how the situation unfolds in Gaza, if it's moving towards an actual ceasefire end of the war, if it's going to escalate, that will determine this. And also Israel in Iran, the direct confrontation that's been blowing up a couple of days, that a couple of times in the past, yet, going to have an impact on all of this. So all of the pieces are still connected to each other.",

And this was the case on the Lebanese side of us, actually the human whole, the civilian toll of the war on both sides of the border. That was the factor that the Israelis were emphasizing the security of these communities and their ability to return to their homes. So I think that's important. And also to be able to sort of secure, continue that security and make sure that the attacks don't come again from Southern Lebanon, which is also again, marrying that on the other side of the border is what Lebanese communities on the -- on the southern border of Lebanon are looking at. But at the same time, I think this all ties into the election results in the US. The region Iran certainly and its allies, these non (INAUDIBLE) are watching U.S. politics very closely, less than two months of the Biden administration. And the Trump administration is going to come in with a completely different doctrine on the Middle East. Yes, the talking point is that he's going to be the president of peace as it is going to make deals. But how true that's going to be, how possible and what it's going to look like for the different parties, for the Palestinians, for the Lebanese, for the Iranians, I think it remains to be seen. And that's something that everyone in the region is watching for the next two months.

Almost 30 years ago when I wrote \"Wicked\" in London, living in West Hampstead, I had to takeout a few short segments of the first 70 pages in order to make the story gallop a little more quickly toward the meeting of Elphaba and Glinda at Shiz University. So two or three small segments left -- were left on the cutting room floor, as it were, of my novel. And now I realize the little green idea that I had walking over Hampstead Heath and in the lakes has become this giant green weather system that, you know, covers half the globe. And the intellectual property of my story is going to outlive me by possibly quite some decades. So I thought somebody will eventually do a young Elphaba. And why should they do it? Well, I'm still alive and functional.",

That's something you don't get in the musical age, because however brilliantly they sing and wherever well written is the play, those people are still about 18 rows away or 45 rows away, or 120 rows away.
