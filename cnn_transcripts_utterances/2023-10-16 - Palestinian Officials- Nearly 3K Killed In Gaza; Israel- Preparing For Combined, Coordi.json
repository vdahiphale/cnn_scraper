This hour, we are tracking the desperate rush to give aid in and people out. A very warm welcome to the show everyone. I'm Isa Soares. Good evening. Tonight, the humanitarian crisis in Gaza is deepening as Israel steps up airstrikes. New drone footage shows the extent of that destruction. Palestinian authorities say nearly 3,000 people have been killed, hundreds of thousands are trying to flee. The UN says there has been no progress on a full opening of the Rafah crossing between Gaza and Egypt. You can see there at the bottom of your screen, the White House, said it hopes it will be open for aid today. Meanwhile, the Hezbollah militant group in Lebanon says it is targeting positions in Northern Israel. Israel is ordering people in several Israeli villages near the border with Lebanon to evacuate. The IDF has exchanged fire with Hezbollah, as it builds up forces in the region. Nic Robertson is in Sderot for us this evening, and Nic, in the last, I think, 10 minutes or so, we saw rockets out of Gaza flying over, I think Tel Aviv.

But they seem to be going to the north and that seems to be at the central Israel and that seems to be borne out with what we've heard here. They were potentially going into the east of Israel over our heads here as well, but it was a very small number of missiles. Meanwhile, the troops around here, this is now a militarized zone. The troops here are preparing to go with for the possibility of going into Gaza, but past experience from former IDF soldiers who have been in 2014 with that incursion, despite the fact that the IDF is asking civilians to move and despite the fact many civilians, hundreds of thousands that have moved towards the south of the Gaza Strip, there's a real likelihood and a reality that when troops do cross in, they may well face civilians who haven't moved on.

RICCIARDONE, JR., FORMER US AMBASSADOR TO BOTH TURKEY AND EGYPT: It sounds as if what is happening right now is that the Egyptians and Americans are working together to find a way to have a controlled opening of the borders so that people -- desperate people can get out in manageable numbers without giving Hamas a way out and without resulting in a massive, massive flow of refugees across that border.

So it goes way back over many decades from the founding of the state of Israel on forward into the many wars. It is complicated. The Egyptians see that Gaza's main borders and connectivity to the world had been through the land border with Israel, and indeed the sea that is blockaded by the IDF and of course, Gazan airspace has been closed. The Egyptians really don't like the idea that the land border with Egypt is the only alternative for getting aid in or letting suffering people out. They do recognize, however, that as a practical matter, it is the only real alternative while the Israelis are at war with Hamas. They certainly feel the pressure to help, they feel just genuine compassion, I know with genuine compassion for the people of Gaza, but they are also very wary of a threat to their security emanating from Hamas from Gaza.",

There are not enough shelters to house the sheer number of civilians, and even those who do find spaces in overwhelmed schools turned refugee centers, it is little comfort to the youngest victims.

And the land invasion will lead to absolute carnage. I mean, there's no way around this decision to invade Gaza is a decision to create civilian casualties on a scale not seen in the Middle East before. Anybody who's been to Gaza who'd seen the overpopulation in Gaza and assessed to that. And certainly, the hospitals will not be evacuating. You know, as health professionals, our commitment is to our patients, first and foremost. We are here to advocate for them. We are here to defend their rights to life. And we will certainly not be evacuating because most of our patients cannot evacuate. Draft injuries induce multiple injuries in multiple systems. Even the less wounded ones have multiple fractures in a lot of their limbs.",

As you cansee, the area fighting at the top of this map right there in response to mounting skirmishes on Monday, Israel ordered the evacuation of 28 Israeli villages in a zone up to two kilometers from the Lebanese border as Israel prepares for a possible second warfront. CNN's Matthew Chance rode along with the force of Israeli soldiers who say they're ready for that what -- for what may come. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MATTHEW CHANCE, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voiceover): They're bracing for a dangerous second front but we gained exclusive access to Israel's tense northern front. CHANCE (on camera): Well, the Israeli army have now sealed off a security zone -- some of the areas close to the Lebanese border because of the threat being posed. But they're taking us now to the closest period -- the closest place they can do that they say is safe to see the lay of the land. CHANCE (voiceover): And that land is hostile. None of the Israeli soldiers here wanted their faces shown to hide their identities from Hezbollah, the powerful Lebanese militia with a vast arsenal, trained on these positions from across the border.",

And Israeli soldiers in this position in Israel tell us over the past few days. There have been multiple attempts by Hezbollah fighters to penetrate the fence and to come into Israel but they've been fought back. If there is going to be a second front in this war in Israel the likelihood is it's going to start here. CHANCE (voiceover): Already, there have been exchanges of fire forcing local Israelis to flee, terrified what happened in Israel's south could happen here, too.",
