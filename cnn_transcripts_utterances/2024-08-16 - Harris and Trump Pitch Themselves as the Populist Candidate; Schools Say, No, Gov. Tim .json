I don't think it's unusual for Democrats to acknowledge that. But the fact is that inflation is on the right trajectory right now. And the reason why the prices have been so high is because the economy has been so strong. That's the problem. It's paradoxical, but it's true, you know?And one more thing about this policy initiative that she just announced today. I remember, I worked in the Clinton administration. Bill Clinton used to say that you may not be able to solve all the problems, but you have to be caught trying. And that's what she was doing today. Her solutions may not be the ones that will solve all the problems for the economy and they may not even make it through Congress, but at least she's caught trying. Donald Trump was caught giving tax breaks to millionaires and billionaires. He's caught giving tax breaks to corporations and deregulating. That's the exact opposite of what she's doing here. PHILLIP:  You may disagree with what Keith said, but I think that there is something astute politically about what he just said. You do have to be caught trying in politics. Everyone stick around, much more ahead. Coming up next, Trump and his allies say that Tim Walz forces schools to have tampons in boys' bathrooms. But we've got a fact check for you.
