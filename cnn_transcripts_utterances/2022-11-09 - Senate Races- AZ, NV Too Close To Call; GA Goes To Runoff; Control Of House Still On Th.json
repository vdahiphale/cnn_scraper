And here's where things stand right now, Erin, in the House of Representatives, after a flurry of projections already this afternoon, there are still 45 seats that need to be called. But the Democrats path for holding control seems to be right now narrowing a bit.On the Senate side, the number of races without CNN projections is now down to only three Arizona, Nevada and Georgia. And once again, in Georgia, that race is headed for a runoff election in early December. We have correspondents across the electoral map where the votes are still being counted. Let's start in Arizona right now. CNN's Kyung Lah is joining us from Phoenix. Hey, Kyung, they are deep in the counting process right now, what is the latest? KYUNG LAH, CNN SENIOR U.S. CORRESPONDENT: Well, Wolf, election week continues because as you just said Maricopa County, the most populous county here in the State of Arizona. That counting is still going on. I've spoken to all of the top campaigns and what's happening inside those war rooms are they have their experts out with their pens, their calculators or computers, and they are doing math. They are trying to figure out what is the path to get them to victory and that is still very much unknown. Here in Maricopa County, there are about 400,000 ballots that are still being counted. Some of them have to be signature verified. It is going to take some time. And we just got the latest update from Maricopa County's Board of Supervisors, the head of the Board of Supervisors. And he says that the counting will not be over today, take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BILL GATES, (R) CHAIR MARICOPA COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS: Right now, we are laser focused on getting through this count and doing it in an accurate way. By the way, we anticipate 95 percent to 99 percent of the votes will be counted in Maricopa County by the end of the day this Friday. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "I'll get to the map in a second. I just want to echo Phil for one second, Erin. We don't know still a lot about the outcome. Joe Biden can say he did much better than Republicans thought he was going to do and he did much better than what history says - what traditionally happened in a president's first midterm without a doubt the President has bragging rights there. The issue is he may well still have divided government.So he may beat history, if you will, but still have a very tough existence with divided government, (inaudible), you're absolutely right. Look, Joe Biden likes to call himself when he was the Delaware Senator before he was vice president, the third senator from Pennsylvania, it's where he was born. Not only did John Fetterman win that very competitive Senate race, but there are four competitive House races here. Let me just bring up the competitive seats in the House. There were four competitive House seats in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, Republicans thought they could win two or three of them goose egg for the Republicans in Pennsylvania. They not only lost the Senate race, but they also lost a competitive House races there. In the Commonwealth of Virginia if you want to stay in the D.C. area, yes, Elaine Luria lost down here in the southeastern part of Virginia. But the other two vulnerable Democrats both held their seats and this one is telling Abigail Spanberger in a district Joe Biden carried by 6.7 percent. Republicans thought they were going to get a lot of those districts that Biden won by five or six points, they simply did not in Virginia. You can go across the map. I'll just bring out the national map of the House of Representatives, close out the competitive races, so you see at all. That we see blue in Michigan, that we see blue in Wisconsin, that we see a little bit of blue, even out here in Kansas. Not all these races are called, but the Republicans thought they were going to wipe out the Democrats here and now we're waiting out on the West Coast that's the key one and that's why the President won't be able to say it at four o'clock, Erin. But the Democrats look more competitive in some of the California - southern California districts than Republicans thought a month or so ago. So the President can say it wasn't as bad as you all thought it was going to be, but even he can't give you a final number.",

I just want to say this, this town is often wrong and so there are people analyzing, it's just the case, right? And Donald Trump can't win the Republican nomination. Joe Biden is out after losing Iowa, New Hampshire and Nevada. And so I would be aware of any morning after when we still don't have the final numbers analysis.But let me come to the State of Florida and let me look at the governor's race. There is no question that Ron DeSantis has a story itself today, right? Can he sell that nationally? Let's deal with that down the road. But does he have a story to tell today? Yes, he does. I just want to show you across the red down here and the red down here. This is Ron DeSantis yesterday against Charlie Crist, 59 percent of the vote to 40 percent of the vote against a former governor now in Congress. That's an impressive win, especially when you go back in time, Erin, to look at Ron DeSantis four years ago against Andrew Gillum. See the blue in here?",

Ron DeSantis one four years ago, but he lost Miami Dade and he lost some of the counties across the I-4 corridor right here.Fast forward to today, there is no doubt, DeSantis can say, see, not only can I win my state, I win the swing areas in my state. I made inroads among Latino voters. That is a great story to tell. The question is can you sell it nationally and I want to say this, remember when Glenn Youngkin won in Virginia, he won against the former governor of Virginia Terry McAuliffe. You have the former governor of Florida, Charlie Crist. Voters don't like to go backwards. They don't like to go backwards. They like change or the status quo is preferable to going backwards. So here, yes, Ron DeSantis has bragging rights, but let's be careful not to over inflate it.",

And so, obviously, we're talking about the economy, reproductive freedom, we're in Ohio, we lost that after Dobbs, so that's top of mind. But fundamentally, our democracy is on the line and we have got to talk about it and be very clear about who's - going to protect our democracy and who's working to undermine it.

And Erin, on that same call, Democratic officials were saying they believe there's a \"mathematical possibility,\" they can still hold on to the House even though it is a very narrow path for them to do just that.
