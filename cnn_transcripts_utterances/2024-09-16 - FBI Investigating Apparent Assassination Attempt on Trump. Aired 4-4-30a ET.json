It is Monday, September the 16th, 9 a.m. here in London, 4 a.m. in Palm Beach, Florida, where federal authorities are investigating an apparent assassination attempt on Donald Trump about two months after the former president was shot and injured on the ear at a rally in Pennsylvania.Here's what we know so far this hour. A 58 year old man identified as Ryan Wesley Routh has been detained. A source says the FBI investigation has now gone global as officials look into his background. Sunday's incident unfolded whilst Trump was golfing at his West Palm Beach club. The plan, a last minute addition to his schedule, we understand. Authorities say the Secret Service fired shots at a man with a rifle in the bushes along the perimeter of the Trump International Golf Club. He was later tracked down in Martin County. The sheriff described the man's reaction. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SHERIFF WILLIAM D. SNYDER, MARTIN COUNTY, FLORIDA: The suspect's demeanor, I would describe as having a relatively calm, flat, affected, was not displaying a lot of emotion, never asked what is this about. Obviously, law enforcement with long rifles, blue lights, a lot going on, never questioned it. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

We got a hold of Martin County Sheriff's Office, alerted them, and they spotted the vehicle and pulled it over and detained the guy. After that, we took the victim, I'm sorry, the witness that witnessed the incident, flew him up there and he identified as the person that he saw running out of the bushes and jumped into the car.

We are praying for you, Mr. President. CNN'S Kyung Lah is following this story from Los Angeles and has more detail on the person being detained. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) KYUNG LAH, CNN SENIOR U.S. NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: The investigation now is a global one as investigators try to figure out who exactly is Ryan Wesley Routh. What CNN has been able to compile per our investigative team is that he is a 58 year old man and he has an extensive social media history, according to various posts and pictures that we have been able to gather across the Web. We found a GoFundMe page that he was asking people to help donate to help fund his stay in Ukraine. He traveled to Kyiv and you can see these pictures posted here. He was there. He was asking friends to help fund his visit and encouraging others to join him in Ukraine. And it appears that this travel was extremely unofficial. He claims in this GoFundMe post that he was traveling there to support the people of Ukraine, that he planned to stay at a hostel with a military unit and that he was donating tactical gear to soldiers fighting on the front lines. None of this, though, does appear to be something that we can prove at this point. This is what he had been posting on that GoFundMe page. We have been able to determine, according to public records, that he was splitting his time between Hawaii and North Carolina. In Hawaii, he was a self-employed affordable housing builder. [04:05:00] He started in 2018 a company called Camp Box Honolulu. It's a company that builds storage units and tiny houses. He, according to a local paper there that had interviewed him, that he had been donating one of these to homeless people in Hawaii. In North Carolina, he has an extensive history there, dating back many years. According to federal campaign finance records, he had registered as an unaffiliated voter without a party in 2012. He did vote this year in the state's Democratic primary in March, according to the North Carolina State Board of Elections, and he had contributed more than $100 to ActBlue. It is a site that funds Democratic campaigns. And North Carolina public records does show that he had various brushes with the law. He had barricaded himself with a weapon in 2002, after being pulled over by police, and he had barricaded himself for a number of hours in that standoff. Public records also show that he has a number of court cases dating back to the 1990s, where state and federal authorities repeatedly accused him of failing to pay his taxes, and that he was ordered by various judges to pay thousands of dollars to plaintiffs in various civil suits. And one thing that the FBI, according to my colleague Josh Campbell, would be focusing on is trying to cull that social media profile. As far as his recent mindset, in a separate post on X, the former Twitter, he had been tagging President Joe Biden, as well as Vice President Kamala Harris, encouraging them to visit people who were injured at the rally at the first assassination attempt of the former President Trump. He wrote in a post directed to Harris to please come and visit the people who are injured. And then in an April post, he tagged President Biden's presidential account, and he was making suggestions about what the tagline for the campaign should be. We were also, the investigative unit was also able to reach the eldest son of the man who has been detained. And that son via text told CNN that he saw his father despite all the records that we've been able to pull on him. He described him as a loving and caring father. And this doesn't sound like the man I know to do anything crazy, much less violent. Kyung Lah, CNN, Los Angeles. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

But because he's not, the security is limited to the areas that the Secret Service deems possible.

And people would like to have the facts well before the conspiracy theories or the ideas and the thoughts are out there, but that's virtually impossible. You have to let law enforcement do their job to gather the facts, because as we see, information is coming from all over. It's coming from overseas, it's coming from the West Coast, the East Coast, the South. So you have to put all those pieces together and filter them out to see what's true, what's not true. You're trying to connect the dots on his history, on family, on relationships, on everything.

He is unstoppable. Senator Lindsey Graham said: Trump was in good spirits and he's more resolved than ever to save our country. And Donald Trump's running mate J.D. Vance said on X: I'm glad President Trump is safe. I spoke to him before the news was public. And he was amazingly in good spirits. Still much we don't know. But I'll be hugging my kids extra tight tonight and saying a prayer of gratitude. U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris says she is glad that Donald Trump was unharmed on Sunday. And in a statement, the Democratic presidential nominee condemned violence and deeply disturbed by the possible assassination attempt of former President Donald Trump today. As we gather the facts, I will be clear, I condemn political violence. We all must do our part to ensure that this incident does not lead to more violence. Meanwhile, her running mate Tim Walls echoed her sentiment. He wrote: Gwen and I are glad to hear that Donald Trump is safe. Violence has no place in our country. It's not who we are as a nation. Shortly after Sunday's incident, Trump sent out two fundraising emails, saying in the second one: My resolve is only stronger after another attempt on my life. I will never slow down. I will never give up. I will never surrender. Trump took to social media on Sunday. Trump also took to social media after the incident, praising the U.S. Secret Service and other law enforcement officials after the apparent attempt on his life. Saying in part, quote: The job done was absolutely outstanding. Marc Caputo, a national political reporter for The Bulwark, a conservative news outlet, told CNN that the Trump campaign will likely capitalize on the latest apparent assassination attempt.

And this comes at a time when the U.S. is already incredibly polarized. The rhetoric is very divisive, and the elections appear to be very emotional, high-stakes affair, where apparently there are people that are so aggrieved and concerned that they're resorting to political violence. I mean, I think that's what the most concerning thing actually is, beyond the misinformation issues, is that we had an attempt on Trump's life two months ago, and already there's another attempt that this political violence is begetting more political violence. Now, the only thing that's cooling temperatures, I think, just even a little bit, is understanding that in both cases, the attempted assassin was either a registered Republican or, in this case, voted for Trump in 2016. But part of the issue is that Trump himself has said that he's not going to accept the election results unless he wins. That gives people that are very aggrieved. The only alternative, in their view, is that they have to resort to violence, and that's incredibly concerning.",
