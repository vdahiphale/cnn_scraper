Let's go OUTFRONT. And good evening. I'm Erin Burnett. OUTFRONT tonight, Russian versus Russian. Putin refusing to help what has been his most prized fighters in the private army in the Wagner group. That's at least according to the chief of Wagner tonight, who is complaining that the Kremlin will not take his calls anymore. (BEGIN AUDIO CLIP) YEVGENY PRIGOZHIN, WAGNER PRIVATE MILITARY COMPANY (through translator):  To get me to stop asking for ammunition, all the hotlines to offices, to departments, et cetera, have been cut off from me.

The U.S. estimates that at the start of the year, there were about 50,000 Wagner troops fighting. But recently, Yevgeny Prigozhin, who you heard there, and his fighters have been pleading, pounding the table for more ammunition almost daily. In fact, here they are over just the past few days.(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP) PRIGOZHIN (through translator):  I'm knocking on all doors, sounding the alarm with ammunition and reinforcements, as well as covering our flanks. WAGNER FIGHTER (through translator):  We are the artillery units of Wagner PMC, every day we carry out difficult combat tasks, covering assault groups.

Especially given right now, it is Wagner's flag flying in Eastern Bakhmut. Not Russians. But the ammunition shortage that we keep hearing so much about, may explain why Putin tried something, suddenly a little bit different today. Launching what has been described as one of his biggest air assaults in months.This image captures the moment that three missiles were fired from Russia. It's almost like a firework there, going up into the sky. And in fact, according to Ukraine, 84 missiles were launched overnight. Ukraine intercepted only 34. At least 11 people have been killed, and of course, that means it hits a lot of infrastructure. Power was knocked out in several areas. And tonight, Ukraine is bracing for another aerial attack. And all of this coming as the economic costs continue to mount for Putin and his inner circle. Tonight, we're learning that the United States and his allies have now seized more than $58 billion from Russian oligarchs. That is a huge number, $58 billion. It's important to emphasize that. But it is not a lot, relative to how much they have. To really squeeze the Putin insiders, there is still much more and money out there. According to \"Forbes\", they have 83 Russians on the list of the world's billionaires. And that's just the money that they, have not even Putin. And their collective worth, again, not counting all those accounting billons to Putin, according to \"Forbes\", is an astonishing $320 billion, which sure puts about 50 into perspective. Alex Marquardt is OUTFRONT in Ukraine tonight. And, Alex, with that missile assault across the country that you heard and saw yourself, what is your latest on the ground there?",

Do you think that Russia is increasing its capability or supply that would allow them to use so many of these in one night? REP. JIM HIMES (D-CT):  Well, Erin, there is no evidence that they are increasing their surprise, it's going to be the supply of the high-end equipment that goes away first, and certainly these advanced missiles are high-end equipment, we see this across the battlefield, right?

Since the 1940s when Hitler tried to break the back of the British people by incinerating London and Coventry, what these sort of attacks have done is steel the fines of the defenders.

Michael Cohen is, of course, the former fixer of the former president, who in 2018 admitted to lying to Congress and was convicted.

So, if he's the ultimate target, the decision to actually invite him in to testify would raise all sorts of concerns, to be sure, about whether he would take the Fifth Amendment, et cetera, on various issues.

Is it typical to keep someone in the hospital, for a few days of observation, after a concussion? DR. SHAE DATTA, NEUROLOGIST &amp; CO-DIRECTOR OF NYU LANGONE'S CONCUSSION CENTER: I don't feel that it's very typical, after a concussion. Normally, they enter an emergency room, and get evaluated, and perhaps get some scans, for stability. As long as there's no bleed on the CT scan, then we assess them, for a few hours, and let them go.
