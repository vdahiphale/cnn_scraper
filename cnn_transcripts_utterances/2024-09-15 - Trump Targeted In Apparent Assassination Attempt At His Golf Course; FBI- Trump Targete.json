      "sentences": "And good evening. I'm Erin Burnett in New York. We have breaking news tonight.The FBI investigating what appears to be a second attempted assassination of former president Trump. Of course, it was just nine weeks ago that he was shot. The former president we are told tonight is safe, and let me tell you what we do know in this rapidly developing breaking story this hour. Trump was golfing at his golf club in West Palm Beach. The source says he was between holes five and six. At that point, a Secret Service agent, a hole ahead, spotted a rifle barrel sticking out of a chain link fence, spotted that barrel and then opened fire. Now police say Trump was not that far away, about 300 to 500 yards. Obviously not far when a scope is involved, which it was. Shortly after authorities say a witness saw the suspect run from the bushes and then jumped into a black Nissan. The witness taking a picture of the car and plates, and that is how officials were able to detain him as he fled north. Here is how officials are describing what they found this hour.

I want to go to Kristen Holmes, who's obviously in contact constantly with your sources, Kristen, in the Trump campaign.

And as you get more and certainly on the state of the former president's mind, you're going to be back with us of course, and nothing could be more important than that. I mean, someone tried to shoot you twice in nine weeks. Just to think about this on a human perspective, what this means for what state of mind he is going to be in, what's going to happen from here obviously is crucial.Our law enforcement analysts are with us now. Our chief CNN law enforcement intelligence analyst, John Miller, senior national security analyst, Juliette Kayyem, and former Secret Service agent Jonathan Wackrow also with me right now. So let me ask you, John Miller, what you're learning right now and I know that Kristen and Randi were going through some of the details about the suspect who I just want to make sure everyone knows since we are talking about the second assassination attempt, it appears in nine weeks that this individual is in custody. That Secret Service engaged him. He tried to flee, but he is in custody, so they're able to question him. I don't, at least from my understanding, he hasn't said anything as of yet. But what are you learning from your sources about this individual? And why he was there, to Kristen's point, if no one else knew Trump for sure was going to be Florida, never mind at Mar-a-Lago on the golf course? Was he just sitting there every day waiting for this opportunity or did he have some sort of information?",

He was arrested driving a car that was registered to what we believe is his daughter. And how did he know to be on that golf course on that perimeter at that time on this day, is one of the key questions that the FBI and the Secret Service, from a protective intelligence standpoint, are going to need to know the answer to.But there is one possibility, because Kristen Holmes, who has done incredible reporting throughout the day on this, you know, tells us it's not on a public schedule. It is, you know, not known to people that, you know, where he's going and when. But she also reported when he moves, it's a big cavalcade of cars. So if you see it going from one place to another you can have an idea. But more relevantly, in today's age, and we experienced this in New York City, protecting presidents where we would do something called an OTR, an off-the- record. It wasn't on the schedule. They would go to dinner at a place. It would be some private meeting where people spot that on social media and they'd put it out so if he was in the area lingering for a long time looking for that information they'll have to go back through his social media, and that somebody say, I'm on the golf course and Donald Trump is here.",

The distance between the agent and between that gun, whether they saw it with the naked eye or not, we know that this all went down very quickly, that that gun was already, you know, through the chain link fence waiting. So, Jonathan, you know, what is your view, from what we know right now, it's limited, but that's what we know about the actions of that Secret Service agent?",

We have a range of 300 to 500 yards, which with a scope, of course, is, you know, that can be shot. We all understand that. But what does that mean to you, Juliette, that this was close enough from the perspective of somebody who knows what they're doing with a scope and a gun can shoot and succeed at hitting their target from that distance.And that's a distance we're talking about. When we're just trying to understand here how close this actually came to happening?",

So the engagement may have happened at a time when he was further from Trump than he, than the assassin essentially intended.And regardless, it's all too close, it shows the challenges of setting up legitimate security perimeters when you have people who are targets, who are former presidents and presidential candidates. And you simply cannot have a security perimeter that encompasses all of all of, you know, all of that area in Florida. So this was incredible work by the Secret Service, it appears at this stage, probably a lot of luck, but also the assassin's intent of when engagement or when the shots would have been fired was may have been later. And we would have reason to believe that only because his backpacks are still on the fence. We don't know where Trump was going to be at that stage.",

A suspect is in custody. The former president is safe according to several people in his orbit. He has of course posted on social media. The assassination attempt, and we understand, involving an AK-47. It happened just before 2:00 this afternoon. Trump was at a place he would consider to be incredibly safe, in his safe private area, his own golf course in West Palm Beach. He is now back at Mar-a-Lago.

Of course, not under these circumstances, although thank goodness that this attempt failed. What is standing out to you from what you are hearing so far from our reporting? ROB D'AMICO, RETIRED FBI SUPERVISORY SPECIAL AGENT: So two things. One is I think you're seeing that complacency that maybe allowed Pennsylvania to happen stop this one. So I don't know. And I can't get into the -- you know, mind of the officer, the Secret Service guy. But if he had seen this rifle barrel sticking out before Pennsylvania, would he have taken that shot? I don't know if he would have. I think the heightened alert and this is real, this is -- people are going to take, you know, take assassination attempts, I think played into this and it stopped it. But what I also think is your last -- Juliette mentioned I think that he caught him early. I think this was an advance agent about a hole ahead of the president, and when looking at it, he didn't have his vest on. So we had a vest with ceramic plates on which tells me he was looking at an encounter with law enforcement. He didn't have it on. He had his backpacks on the thing. He might have been doing what we call as a former sniper scope check. So you want to put your weapon where you're going to shoot from. You want to see your field of view through the scope. And he got caught by the Secret Service agent who's advancing the next hole.",

Because the ceramic plates are -- the reason that you put ceramic plates on it for a rifle engagement. They stopped rifle rounds. So he is looking for an encounter. Why else would you bring it and put it there if you're not, like, going to put it on through the event. So I think he was preparing and he was looking out the chain link fence that he was on, and seeing what his scope can see because there's scope when you start looking through a scope, it really brings down the field of view. So he's probably checking that out seeing where he could actually engage the former president. And the Secret Service agent sees his barrel sticking out, which again is a bad sniper tactic. You never allow your barrel to go past something. But he did that. Secret Service agent sees it and engages him right away. I don't think he would engage him right away if it hadn't been for Pennsylvania, but I think they caught him beforehand. I think he was waiting for him to get in what we call an ambush zone where it's a shorter distance and he has better field of vision and that agent interrupted it.",

MARC CAPUTO, \"THE BULWARK\" NATIONAL POLITICAL REPORTER: I'm not hearing what his reaction is specifically to this right now, but what I'm hearing from people who know him is that there is a tremendous amount of anger in Trumps inner circle, outer circle, on social media. And there was already considerable amount of paranoia and that's only going to increase The second assassination attempt I don't think we've ever seen this before.

There's a whole load of questions and local law enforcement that I've talked to have asked the same questions and no one really knows. But leading up to this, the former president had been subject to some critical coverage in the news media for stoking some conspiracy theories about the first assassination attempt.

And then hole six runs from that point all the way down that right side of the golf course there. So basically, from your hole five to hole six indicators. That's hole six. So we know that the president was walking from five to six when the shots rang out. We also know that it was the advanced agents that saw the shooter and they are essentially one hole in front. So, they were likely walking from six to seven, which is just right around the corner. If you look at it very closely on the map, it's a place where if he had not been seen, when the president went from hole six to seven, he would have been in the tee boxes, which is the beginning of whole seven, very, very close to the fence that runs right along that bottom street there, which is summit avenue.

The question is, how did he know the president would be there at that moment today and you know, the two, extremes of that are, well, maybe he had information from someone who knew, that's the worst possible scenario. The opposite extremist, well, maybe he just got completely lucky and he went to this place knowing it was a place of advantage and he decided to hide their wait. I think that's unlikely as well. In the middle is probably where we're going to find this out. It may be that he has been surveilling the presidents movements, which is easy to do just by watching the motorcade come in and out of Mar-a- Lago and go from Mar-a-Lago over to the Trump international golf course probably on many occasions. And so, realizing you could generally divide a pattern of activity. You could watch for the movement of the motorcade to know when to go over there and then put yourself in that position at the right time.
