Mass acts of gun violence playing out across the country from Washington state to Pennsylvania to St. Louis to Illinois to Georgia. And the long holiday weekend is far from over. In the Chicago suburb of Willow Brook, one person is dead and at least 22 others injured after gunfire erupted overnight during what witnesses described as a Juneteenth celebration.

It started at 6And so the officers that were there went to respond to the 911 call, and while they were doing that, they heard the gunfire. So they returned to this area as quickly as possible. It was chaotic. Unfortunately one person dead, 22 injured. But officials also saying that more people were hurt as they were trying to get away and escape the chaos.

In the meantime, overnight in St. Louis, Missouri, police say 10 teenagers were shot downtown. The victims ranging in age from 15 to 19 years old. One 17-year-old died from his injuries and another teen was critically injured after being trampled as people rushed to get away. Police say they recovered several weapons, including an AR-15-style weapon. Right now they have a 17-year-old suspect in custody. And last hour I spoke with the St. Louis mayor, herself the mother of a teenage boy, and I asked her to talk about whether or not we've all become desensitized to gun violence in this country. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MAYOR TISHUARA JONES (D), ST. LOUIS, MISSOURI: That's part of the problem. The NRA and the pockets of people we elect to send to Congress to represent us is part of the problem. And the gun industry cannot be held liable. As President Biden said last week when he spoke to a gun safety conference, the gun industry is the only industry that is not liable for the havoc that they're wreaking on our cities and on this country.

And judging by the statement coming out of the Chinese Foreign Ministry, it sounds like there seems to be a common interest at stabilizing relations, historically bad relations, between the world's two largest economies. So the Chinese Foreign Ministry is saying, hey, we want to get back on track to that kind of spirit of cooperation that was established when President Biden and Chinese leader Xi Jinping met in Bali back in November. They were talking about a need to be able to handle unexpected and sporadic events in a calm, professional, and rational manner. That is the kind of rhetoric we were hearing from the State Department going into this, saying the number one goal that Secretary Blinken had was to create lines of communication to avoid something going wrong like an incident involving U.S. and Chinese warplanes and warships in the South China Sea from spiraling out of control.

For many the holiday represents a profound moment of triumph but it also serves as a reminder for our nation's often painful history.Joining us now to talk about this is journalist Victor Luckerson. He's the author of the new book \"Built from the Fire: The Epic Story of Tulsa's Greenwood District, America's Black Wall Street.\" Victor, great to see you. We'll talk about the book in a sec. But I want to start asking you about why this holiday has grown in importance and whether it's likely to take on greater significance in the future. You're seeing more Juneteenth celebrations happening around the country and people are finally understanding what it's all about. Let's talk about that. VICTOR LUCKERSON, AUTHOR, \"BUILT FROM THE FIRE\": Yes. You know, Juneteenth really is an essential holiday for black America. It began during the civil war when slaves in Galveston, Texas, first learned that they were free. But it's important to understand when those slaves learned that, the war had actually been ended for months. You know, freedom came but it came with a catch. And that's surely been the story of black America for so long. You know, even in Greenwood, the community that I've been writing about for so long, in Tulsa, they've been celebrating Juneteenth for more than 100 years. It's a holiday that really holds a lot of value for folks and it began in that heart of Texas but has really spread all over the country. You know, we saw the holiday itself expand so much in national awareness in 2020 when President Trump decided to come to Tulsa on Juneteenth holiday, you know, to much conflict in the community. I was there on the streets of Tulsa actually when Trump was there. I saw how much that decision really hurt the community. But, you know, something that came out of that that was positive is the fact that so many more folks in our nation are now aware of Juneteenth, honoring it, celebrating it, And I think that's a great thing.",

You know, it's really important for people to understand that, though the Tulsa race massacre was a horrific event, Greenwood cannot only be defined by its trauma and only be defined by those two days. So this story that I put together really captures that community over the course of more than 100 years.You know, it was such a privilege for me to be able to meet, for example, the Goodwin family. They're the single family that's been in Greenwood, on black Wall Street, for more than a century. They came to Tulsa seeking what all families want, a better education for their children. And so they arrived in Tulsa in 1914. They established a business right there on Greenwood Avenue. They, like so many others, had their homes and their livelihoods tragically destroyed during the race massacre, but the Goodwins stayed and rebuilt. They helped their neighbors to rebuild, and they're still right there on Greenwood Avenue. And I developed a friendship with Jim Goodwin. He's an 83-year-old attorney in Greenwood. He also owns a newspaper, the \"Oklahoma Eagle\" that the Goodwin family owns. So it's really been a pleasure to talk to people like him, who are both so resilient, but also so adamant about the fact that justice has not been served for the people in that community. And we're still seeking reparations, still seeking justice, and still seeking so many things that black folks have been denied in this country really since the civil war and since Juneteenth began being celebrated as a holiday.",

Another member of the Goodwin family, Jim's family is actually a state legislator, Regina Goodwin. She's one of the few black people in the Oklahoma state legislature. And so I was sort of had a firsthand view of this conservative backlash you're talking about.You know, I saw how in Oklahoma, House Bill 70 and 75 was passed in 2021 saying that if a student felt uncomfortable in the classroom, a teacher could be punished for that. You know, there's just so much ambiguity in the way that these laws are written, and we can sort of see the way that some conservatives are exploiting that ambiguity in order to make it hard for teachers to do their jobs. You know, one thing that really worries me about this backlash is that in some ways it mirrors what was going on in Oklahoma before 1921. You know, we saw in Oklahoma, a place that was at one point egalitarian, almost utopian in some senses, but then decided to import Jim Crow policies from the Deep South. And it seems like we're kind of seeing something similar today where all these individual states and Republican legislatures are deciding to sort of embed discrimination in various forms into their laws. And so I think what we really need to do as America is to be vigilant about standing (INAUDIBLE) rhetoric when we see it about opposing laws that are not in our interest and really about, you know, being allies to each other in these tumultuous times.",

But as soon as the crowd got larger and it got out of hand, he told his daughter to head back home. Speaking with other people in the neighborhood, they said that this is an annual event that's supposed to be fun, a Juneteenth celebrating African- American history but it turned into a deadly situation.
