We're talking about a major storm surge as well as high winds.There are now 14 counties that have been told to evacuate. Those are mandatory evacuations for people. 32 school districts are closing down. People are warning -- the authorities here warning in Pinellas County, in particular, to make sure that you make your plan now and leave soon as this storm approaches because it will likely not stay as a Category 1. We are expecting it to grow as it hits that very warm water which fuels this storm. There is also always the potential of tornadic activity as well. There are plenty of places people can go. But right now, they're saying get out of these zones where the storm surge could be dangerously high. Let's bring in Derek Van Dam, who is standing right next to me. We're standing and this is the confusing thing for a lot of people, especially visitors who are not familiar with what happens in a hurricane. You look behind you and it looks like paradise because it is. It is absolutely gorgeous. But in a split second as these bands come, you can get slapped with very high winds and the rushing water.",

      "sentences": "Yes, especially that this coastline is so vulnerable to the storm surge, and we're going to get into all the details about that. But, Sara, it is literally off to the races for Hurricane Idalia. It is now into the open waters of the warm Gulf of Mexico. And we talk about that being jet fuel because water temperatures there are literally two to upwards of four degrees Fahrenheit above where they should be this time of year. So, that is just going to aid in this intensification process.And you can see on my graphics, there's the hurricane there. And it's got a general northerly trajectory and it's moving at quite a clip, 14 miles per hour. And that's significant because that means it's going to bring those first rain bands onto the west coast of the Florida Peninsula here in the coming hours. Here's a look at that storm surge. And I want to show you that red area we are highlighting. Basically, that is the most vulnerable coastline in all of America to storm surge. 8 to 12 feet in Cedar Key. They talk about Hurricane Hermine back in 2016, which was a Category 1 that brought six feet of storm surge. This will be a Category 3 upon its arrival and that will likely bring catastrophic storm surge to Cedar Key and those general areas as well. I'm very concerned about Clearwater. Four to seven feet is the official projection here. But what makes this coastline so vulnerable, Sara, is the fact that it is so shallow. You could literally walk from where we are standing now to the beach directly behind us and you'll walk into the water for several hundred yards and you'll only get up to your waist at best. So, that water literally has to go somewhere. It is going to be pushed up by this approaching storm system that is accelerating and strengthening and that is the concern. So, many people focus on the winds. Yes, that's a threat, but the storm surge is the number one killer during a hurricane.",

If the winds can blow that over and it's not even a hurricane at the time, it's just the outer band of a tropical storm. We are talking about some real power here, especially as it hits that warm water, as you have said. We are waiting here. Yes, it's beautiful. Yes, it looks like somewhere that you want to be, and you do, except this is going to change fairly quickly and people are being told here in Pinellas County and 13 other counties to get to a safer space.

Judge Chutkan came down right about there, March of 2024, about six or seven months from now.Now, Trump's team had argued, we've been given over 12 million pages of documents that we have to review. We need more time. But the judge bought DOJ's argument. They said, look, we've streamlined this for them. We've identified the main documents. They can word search this. They can get it done. Judge Chutkan and basically said, hey, get to work. The American public needs to see this. Now, as you said, Phil, Donald Trump immediately disregard all this blather.
