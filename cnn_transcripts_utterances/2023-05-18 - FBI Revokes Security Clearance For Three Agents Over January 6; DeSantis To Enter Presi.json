They took a break and now they are back into the room again, ready to keep on with the proceedings.The agents are the star witnesses in this Republican-led hearing and they are there to prove how the FBI and Justice Department are working against conservatives. And the Republicans called this the weaponization of government. And remember, they were stripped of their security clearances. Sara Murray has been monitoring the hearings. And what are you hearing so far, Sara?",

We learned in a FBI letter last night that these two men were strippedof the security clearances; one emailed the colleagues to exercise extreme caution, saying law enforcement had infiltrated the group at the Capitol. And one refused to participate in a SWAT team arrest of a rioter, saying he believed it was excessive force. And he had brought an unauthorized flash drive into the FBI building and downloaded documents on a FBI computer. This is how Jim Jordan and the top Democrat in the committee are framing what we are seeing in this hearing room. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. JIM JORDAN (R-OH): This is the kind of retaliation they have faced for coming forward to tell us the truth and three, three of the brave whistleblowers the lawyer who represents them will tell us their story, what they saw and then what happened to them, because they were courageous enough to report it to Congress. REP. STACEY PLASKETT (D-VI), HOUSE IMPEACHMENT MANAGER: My colleagues on the far right are on the mission to attack, discredit and ultimately dismantle the FBI. As part of their mission, my colleagues have brought in these former agents, men who lost their security clearances because they were a threat to our national security. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Let me walk you through the timeline, because there are multiple steps to the rollout.First, some time next week, he is going to file paperwork with the FEC, that he is a candidate and there will be a soft launch either digitally or otherwise that hints at a larger announcement to come. And then the donors will assemble May 24th through the 26th at a Four Seasons hotel in Miami, to start to raise money for the presidential effort. I am told that the goal for each person down there is raising between $100,000 to $150,000 so that DeSantis can come out of the gates with one of the largest fund-raising days in history. And some time after Memorial Day, he is going to be making an official launch in the campaign in his hometown, where he grew up and became a Little League star and went on to go to Harvard, Yale, military career and now governor of the state of Florida. Now I'm also being told by sources that this is all subject to change, because DeSantis likes to keep people on their toes. And even his closest donors and advisers are in the dark about his movements. And he does not like the media to preempt the announcement. But this is what we expect in the coming weeks.",

      "sentences": "Well, these 16 records could shed light on the extent to which the former president was aware of the proper process for declassifying documents.According to the letter from the Archives, that was exclusively obtained by our colleague, Jamie Gangel, it says that some of the letters reflect communications involving close advisers, some directed to you, Trump, personally, concerning whether, why and how you should declassify certain records. Now here the former president has cited a constitutional privilege to try to block the special counsel from obtaining these records. But the Archives said that the special counsel is willing to go court to establish why these are so critical to his ongoing investigation. We know that among the crimes he is investigating is whether someone should be charged with mishandling classified material. And to do that, they have to acknowledge they had knowledge, that they were transferring materials without proper authorization. Attorneys have made different and sometimes conflicting explanations for how this all went down. Just last night, one of the former president's lawyers said that he didn't have to go through what he called a bureaucratic process, that he had the constitutional right to declassify the documents. And they also said that the former president had a standing order but over a dozen former officials said they were not aware of that. So if he did declassify them, how he went about doing that. And it is a question to be settled by the courts. The extent of this very broad power to declassify comes amid a flurry of activity by the special counsel and, as of yet, we don't know when he is going to submit the final report.",

It bans most abortions once cardiac activity can be detected. They can be at six weeks and before many women know they are pregnant.There are a few exceptions, like fetal anomalies, like heart or nerve defects or the health or life of the mother or cases of rape and incest or underaged pregnancy. Only five women by the way hold Senate seats. And all of the women opposed this bill and they held it up last time. They say they plan to do it again.

In North Carolina, we had a court last year that ruled that partisan gerrymandering was unconstitutional and the legislature had to redraw maps.

But with the gerrymandering, we have a supermajority. We've had enough Democrats to uphold my vetoes. But because we had one Democrat switch to Republican, they now have supermajority by one vote. But we have pulled Republicans to expand Medicaid, to improve clean energy legislation. We're going to keep working because we know the people of North Carolina are behind our public schools, want women to have health care and don't want restrictions on the voting. And we are not finished. I will never ever back down when it comes to women's health. And I think that is what the people of North Carolina want me to do.",

And they will in the ballot box in 2024 as every legislative seat is up. There will be a new governor because I am term limited and I have a little more than a year and half to serve as governor. I believe they will go for President Biden and put emphasis on the state. And the women's reproductive rights are on the line. And the legislators have done this 12-week ban but they have forecasted more is to come and some of the states around us have ways to make it worse. So people are going to rise up and say, we have had enough of this.
