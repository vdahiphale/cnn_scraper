They say convicted murderer Danelo Cavalcante was spotted by a security camera south of the perimeter where they previously been searching. They spotted him overnight. And now they have photos. Two school districts in the area are closed today because of concern that the escape killer could be hiding nearby. CNN's Danny Freeman is with us now for the very latest.

He's got an expert team, and not just in the urban back alleys of Philadelphia looking for fugitive felons. They have done this business in the woods before, as recently as July with Mike Burnham, another murderer who escaped a different county prison up in Warren with survivalist training, lasted about 10 days out there. Or I go back to 2014 with the Eric Frein case, a domestic terrorist, 48 days on the run, ended with a massive shoot-out. And George Bivens, the lieutenant colonel from the State Police, who you see is the overall coordinator here, led that effort. And that was, again, in all kinds of rural areas, wooded areas. A state trooper was killed in the final gun battle with him. So, nobody who's doing this is out on their first rodeo. And they have a relatively small area. They're going to get this guy.",

There is new CNN exclusive reporting this morning on where and whom and what special counsel Jack Smith is focused on right now in the federal election subversion investigation. Look, here's the situation. Donald Trump's trial date has been set forMarch. But we have learned this morning as part of this new exclusive CNN reporting The investigation itself is not over. He is talking to other witnesses. The grand jury is still meeting. Smith is seeking to learn about money that was raised off of these baseless voter fraud claims and then used to pay for alleged attempts to breach voting equipment. CNN's Paula Reid joins us now with the latest on this. Paula, what are you learning here?",

      "sentences": "Well, look, a month ago when the indictment came down from the special counsel -- and it only charged former President Trump, a lot of people were surprised.The indictment, though, does mention co-defendants or co-conspirators. And the question was whether this case was just going to be narrowly tailored, so that it could go to trial before the 2024 election, or whether anyone else was going to be charged. And that's what our colleague Zach Cohen and I sought to look into in this new reporting. And we have learned that, in recent weeks, the special counsel has been asking witnesses specifically about co- conspirator Sidney Powell. She's one of the attorneys that helped push those baseless claims of voter fraud. And they have been asking witnesses if Powell ever presented any evidence of these claims. And investigators, we're told, have heard repeatedly, no, she never presented any evidence. But investigators are also interested in Powell's nonprofit, Defending the Republic. Now, that nonprofit helped to profit, helped to fund- raise off of these election lies. But then we know, according to an invoice obtained by CNN, that that group used some of the money that it raised to hire forensic experts who were able to breach voting systems in four states that Biden won. So this new reporting shows that the special counsel is still clearly working hard on this investigation, but it's unclear if Powell or anyone else will be charged. But, remember, our initial understanding is that maybe there would be this narrow federal case, and then a more broad state prosecution, which we have, of course, seen in Georgia, where Powell and others were charged. But now this new reporting raises questions about whether that's actually going to be the case or if the special counsel could possibly file additional charges.",

I'm going to let everyone else hang out there. I'm not going to indict them. It turns out what happened was, he had some additional work to do regarding some of these other defendants. He wasn't there yet. And he made the decision that, if he waited until he was over the line, so to speak, with -- for all those other co-conspirators, he wouldn't get this done quickly, perhaps wouldn't get it done before Election Day. And so he made a tactical decision to indict Trump first, and then he's continuing his work. So, this way, he gets everything wrapped up for the co-conspirators before Trump actually faces trial, which I think will mean that those co-conspirators are not going to be eager to testify in his defense.",

I think many people, including me, thought that he would wait as long as he could to see if his case were removed to federal court, which, of course, he has argued for.

And then here he's pursuing, I would say, high-risk, calculated-risk legal strategy to try to remove that case to federal court. It will be very interesting to see how that plays out.

DR. SANJAY GUPTA, CNN CHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT:  Well, it sounds like they did a pretty comprehensive sort of evaluation. So, this was -- I think Manu said August 30, so a few days ago now. So, apparently, after that last episode, it sounds like, there was enough concern. It doesn't sound like they did these types of tests in July after that first episode. But after this most recent episode, the idea that, was this a stroke? Was this a seizure? Or was this something else, like a movement disorder, such as Parkinson's and medications not wearing -- not working well? It sounds like they evaluated for all those things, brain MRI, EEG, and then neurological evaluation, sounds like, and basically saying none of those things seem to be the case here. So, that's good. That's good news. I think I'm curious to know what kind of follow-up. When you do these types of imaging tests to do an EEG, you're getting sort of these -- these snapshots in time. So, sometimes, things may be happening, but you don't catch them on the scans. But, nevertheless, it's a pretty thorough evaluation. And, as Manu said, they're basically saying, look, he had this concussion back earlier in the spring, as a result of that, lightheadedness, which is a little bit of a tough line to draw between the concussions, lightheadedness, and these symptoms. But that's basically what this note is saying:  We have ruled out some of the leading other possible things here.",

You do an EEG, and someone is clearly having a certain type of seizure, which could explain those symptoms, that would rule in the diagnosis. But, yes, a lot of times with something like this, you are saying, hey, look, what are the worst things that could possibly be causing this? You want to -- you want to hope for the best, but prepare for the worst, that sort of mentality. So, you look at the worst possible things and start to rule them out? A brain MRI. Is there blood collection still in the brain? Is there a tumor? Is there something else there? It sounds like the brain MRI, they don't say that definitively, but they say -- basically give you the impression that it was normal, an EEG, no evidence of a seizure disorder. So those are -- those are pretty good tests. And then it sounds like he had neurologists also evaluate him, do a full exam to see, does he have any evidence of Parkinson's disease, a movement disorder, which oftentimes you can diagnose by doing a good neurological exam? So they have looked at sort of the worst things, frankly, that could be causing these types of symptoms, these freezing episodes, and basically saying, we don't find anything here at this point. So it's good news. I mean, it's good for him to know that. What I think is still confusing a bit, John, and I guess to your point, is, concussion in the spring. Lightheadedness, yes, that can be one of the symptoms. It's not something you put at the top of the list. And, certainly, you would just hydrate for that. If this was a problem, why not just make sure that he's being hydrated? Why does he continue to have these spells? And two is then drawing a connection from lightheadedness to freezing, it's just challenging. It's just -- it's very hard to connect all those dots.",
