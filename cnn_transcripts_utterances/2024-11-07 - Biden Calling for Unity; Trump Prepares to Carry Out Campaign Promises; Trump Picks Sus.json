China's President Xi Jinping tells Trump that their countries would benefit from cooperation and lose from confrontation. Three people are facing preliminary charges over the death of the former One Direction band member, Liam Payne. And new data shows 2024 will be the hottest on record. All that and much more coming up. But first, Donald Trump is now president-elect with inauguration day a little more than two months away. Earlier, President Joe Biden called for unity. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN, U.S. PRESIDENT:  I've said many times, you can't love your country only when you win. You can't love your neighbor, only when you agree. Something I hope we can do no matter who you voted for, is see each other not as adversaries, but as fellow Americans. Bring down the temperature. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

I think what you see, if you look deeply into the exit polls and the vote cast, the two main data sources we have, is that pretty consistently it tells us that voters favored in unpredictable future over an unacceptable present. You know, voters were not unaware of the risks that Donald Trump presented. A majority of voters said they viewed him as extreme. A majority of voters said that he risked taking the nation in an authoritarian direction. A majority opposed mass deportation. A majority said they wanted the government to do more to expand access to health care. And of course, the majority supported legal abortion. But a substantial slice of voters in each of those camps voted for him anyway, because they were discontented with the economy, discontented with Biden's performance, and they wanted a change in direction. One quarter of women who said they supported legal abortion voted for Trump, one quarter of Latinos who said they oppose mass deportation voted for Trump. And I think that gives you a sense, those kinds of dynamics give you a sense of how powerfully the discontent over inflation shape this election. And, of course, as, you know, governments all over the world, incumbent governments all over the world have been rattled, and in many cases, dislodged over the same discontent.

I mean,her advantage among women was significantly smaller than Biden's. It was even smaller than Clinton's in 2016. And as I said, I think a big part of that was the economy. The share of women in the exit polls who described the economy in negative terms was even higher than it was among men. I mean, they were -- a lot of women were feeling economically squeezed, particularly blue collar, white women, white women without a college degree. But, you know, I've talked to people who have done extensive focus group and polling who will say that there is a slice of those women, particularly those non-college, white women who still feel that they are -- that a man is more likely to keep them safe as president than a woman. They will say things like, well, I am fine with a woman as president, but I don't think leaders around the world would respect her, or I think he would be tougher. So, that is real. But I do think the biggest factor that we see running across all of these groups. And really, something else that underscores this is the consistency of his gains across all kinds of counties. 90 percent of the counties in the U.S. moved more toward the Republicans than in -- moved more toward him than in 2020. And that says to me that this was not an election driven by tactics or, you know, kind of who they chose as vice president, but really about a common experience across the entire society largely rooted in frustration over the higher prices that erupted in Biden's first two years.",

Look, the Beijing administration, for lack of better words, is playing it very safe.If we look at some of the messages, the wording in this congratulatory message from Xi Jinping to now President-Elect Trump, there's a lot of safe diplomatic words in there, phrases like win-win cooperation and mutual respect. These two men have a very complicated relationship. At one point, early on in the first Trump presidency, we saw them sitting together at Mar-a-Lago having chocolate cake. But then, other issues came up, such as China's response to COVID. And then, as you mentioned, this very thorny and difficult issue about trade and tariffs. That is something that weighs very heavily on Chinese citizens. In fact, we were looking yesterday on Weibo, which is essentially China's version of X. There was a lot of concern about tariffs and the potential for a trade war. Lynda, when we look at China's foreign policy, a big part of it is, if you do something to harm me, I'm going to do something to harm you back.

But beyond these economic issues, China may look at this Trump presidency in a favorable way in the sense that in the past we've heard Trump express his concern, his skepticism toward alliances such as NATO at a time when China has bigger sights on hand, namely Taiwan and the South China Sea. Perhaps this attitude from Washington of being anti-alliance or skeptical of alliances may empower China.

But if the judge rejects it, then the next question is, are we going to have a sentencing on November 26? I don't know what the judge is going to do that. We've never had a president-elect up for potential sentencing. I can see the judge saying on the one hand, we're going to finish out this process. He's been tried. I'll sentence him. And -- or I could see the judge saying, what's the point? He's now the president-elect. There is no way either way that he will serve any prison time. He's not going to be locked up now that he's president- elect during the transition period, especially on a state level charge. And he's certainly not going to be locked up while he's the president.

The cost of shelter costs have gone up quite dramatically. And even as, you know, we see the pace of those increases slowing, the bottom line is the level of prices are still nothing like they were in 2019 and people use it as a reference.

And there's no reason to think that would end the war. The only reason there's a war is because Vladimir Putin has chosen to start a war and continues it. So, if you want to end it, the first thing you have to do is convince Putin that continuing the war is too costly for him. So, what Trump has said is that he will call Putin and tell him to stop the war. And he has said that if Putin doesn't stop the war, then we'll give Ukraine whatever support it needs because it's going to get worse for Putin. And I think he's hoping that he can create the dynamics that causes Putin to decide, OK, it's done for now.",

He said that we're givingall of this money and we don't know what we're trying to achieve and how it's going to do that. And when it came time in January, February, March of this year, 2024, for the House of Representatives to actually approve the next transfer of aids to Ukraine, Donald Trump stood up next to Speaker of the House Mike Johnson and supported him and said, we need to get this through and pushed back on members of the House who are opposing it, such as Marjorie Taylor Greene. So, I don't think it's fair to say that Donald Trump is against this, but I think what he wants is a strategy and he wants to know how it's going to end the war. I think a second -- or a third component to that is he doesn't want it to cost U.S. taxpayers. The $61 billion that was approved last year was appropriated funds from the U.S. government budget, money that we're borrowing in order to give it to Ukraine. I think what President Trump would rather do is offer loans to Ukraine, a lend lease policy for Ukraine, such as we have for the U.K., in which they can borrow as much as they need, pay us back later and buy U.S. weaponry that they need in order to defend themselves against Russia. That seems to me a more likely approach where this would go.",

Know what the issue is, what you want to do about it, what capabilities you have, and are willing to commit so that you're ready. And then third, be proactive and make proposals about how we handle it. If you just sit back and wait and then are prepared to complain about something you don't like from the Trump administration, that's a recipe for failure. But if you do your homework, and if you're proactive, and if you're not making assumptions, but ready to engage, I think that's a recipe for success. And I do think -- I'll give you an example, the secretary general of NATO, Mark Rutte, did exactly those things in his phone call with Trump, his statement, and then the public statements that he made, I think he's posturing NATO in just the right position.",

And he's got a much tenser situation with China in the South China Sea with China really taking aggressive steps against many of its neighbors, not only Taiwan, but also Philippines and Vietnam. So, it's a ripe, full agenda right now. I think the sequencing wise, he needs to tell Putin to end the war and give Putin a little bit of time to do that. He's going to have to take the fight to Iran, if you will, hold Iran accountable for its support of these proxy groups and threaten responses there if they don't stop them and try to build strength and capacity for a longer-term challenge with China.",

Sources tell CNN that Chinesehackers gained access to the phone of one of Donald Trump's attorneys. The FBI told Todd Blanche the hackers got voice recordings as well as text messages. None of that information was related to the president-elect. Blanche is the second person who Donald Trump's orbit believed to be the target of foreign hackers. Rescue and recovery operations are underway in Cuba in the wake of Hurricane Raphael. The Category 3 storm slammed into the island Wednesday, causing a total blackout. Power has since been restored in some areas. Japan's iconic Mount Fuji finally regained its snow cap on Thursday. It's the latest snowfall on the mountain since records began 130 years ago. Snow usually begins to appear on the country's tallest mountain early October. Well, there was perhaps no business leader more committed to helping Donald Trump win the White House than Elon Musk. The world's richest person, not only endorsing Trump wholeheartedly, but also donating about $120 million to the cause. He campaigned across the country for the now president-elect and amplified Trump's message on his social media platform, X. And he has suggested that he could help the new administration cut government costs, a skill that Trump praised during the campaign.

There was no interest from oil companies. It wasn't worth it for them to go there. But just in case that changes, the Biden administration tried to shrink the footprint that the maximum lease area would be about 400,000 acres up there as well.
