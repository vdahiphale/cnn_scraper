The leader of Hezbollah issues a warning to Israel as the two sides launch cross-border attacks. CNN uncovers disturbing and graphic comments made by the Republican nominee for governor in the battleground State of North Carolina. Beijing breakups, the firms cashing in on climbing divorce rates in China. And 50/50 baseball superstar Shohei Ohtani approaching a brand-new kind of record. All that and plenty more coming up. But first, escalation in the Middle East. Israel says two of its soldiers have been killed after Hezbollah launched at least 17 attacks into Northern Israel. Earlier in the day, Hezbollah's leader accused Israel of crossing, quote, \"all the red lines\" and warned the reckoning will come. It follows the detonation of pagers and walkie-talkies used by the group's members in Lebanon earlier this week. As he spoke, Israeli warplanes flew low over the southern suburbs of Beirut, dropping flares. Israel also attacked what it called Hezbollah's terrorist infrastructure sites in Lebanon. From Beirut, Ben Wedeman has more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BEN WEDEMAN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  Final prayers for a Hezbollah militant, one of many killed in the spate of pager and walkie-talkie blasts across Lebanon linked to Israel. Outside, others pay respects to the family. The blasts killed dozens, including children and wounded thousands.",

We fire back with rockets and bullets. But there's no denying the attacks have taken a serious toll. Surgeon Ghassan Abu-Sittah (ph) has treated the war injured across the Middle East, most recently in Gaza. GHASSAN ABU-SITTAH, SURGEON:  So, the problem is we don't have enough equipment because of the sheer number. And more importantly, these are surgeries, these are injuries that will need between five and 12 surgeries in the next few years. WEDEMAN (voice-over):  In a televised speech, Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah conceded the group had suffered a major unprecedented blow and called it a mass terrorist event. While the speech was broadcast, Israeli warplanes roared over Beirut. Adding, perhaps, insult to injury. Yet, Nasrallah insisted, Hezbollah is unshaken. I say to Netanyahu, Gallant, the enemy army, and the enemy entity, he declared, you will not be able to bring the residents back to the north. He vowed Hezbollah will stop firing on Israel when Israel stops its war in Gaza. And then, Israeli warplanes returned, breaking the sound barrier twice over the Lebanese capital. (END VIDEOTAPE) WEDEMAN (on camera):  And the escalation continues. This evening, Israel launched more than 50 airstrikes across Southern Lebanon. Both Hezbollah and Israel have made it clear, neither will back down. Julia.",

I just wonder if the -- will have a wider impact, because there will be other organizations that are communicating via these tools in the region? And we can choose who we mentioned at this point.

There were also reports that not just Hezbollah fighters in Lebanon suffered some of the casualties, but there were others in places like Iraq that were part of the various PMS groups, the Iranian supported PMS in Iraq that were struck as well. So, yes, this is an interesting approach having conducted terrorist operations. The most important thing you have to do is to counter the terrorist is to interfere with and disrupt their communication systems. Because if you do this, they can't fight. They can't coordinate their activities. There are a lot left to be in signal -- symbol -- single cells, excuse me. And that's what Hezbollah and Hamas have been able to do recently, they've been able to synchronize their attacks, use large-scale attacks as opposed to independent terrorist operations, and that's what's made them so incredibly effective over the last year and a half.",

Lieutenant General Mark Hertling, always great to get your insights, sir. Thank you. Now, turning to a disturbing new development in the 2024 U.S. Elections. CNN's K-File Investigative Unit has uncovered shocking new details about the Republican candidate running for governor of North Carolina, the state's current lieutenant governor, Mark Robinson. The investigation shows Robinson posted on a porn site starting in 2008 where he described himself as a quote, \"black Nazi\" and wrote posts expressing support for reinstating slavery. Andrew Kaczynski is the senior editor of K-File and he joins us now. Andrew, great to have you with us. And I want to warn our viewers very quickly this report does include some disturbing and graphic comments. Just bring us up to speed on what you discovered. ANDREW KACZYNSKI, CNN K-FILE SENIOR EDITOR:  Julia, my colleague Em Steck and I found a series of highly disturbing post made on the message board of a pornographic website more than a decade ago, and we traced them directly to Mark Robinson. Now, we did interview Robinson today and he categorically denies making these posts. I'll get to that in one moment. But first, I want to walk people through just some of them. Take a look at this one right here in one post, Robinson called himself a quote, \"black Nazi.\" And when discussing then-President Barack Obama in 2012 wrote, quote, \"I'd take Hitler over any shit that's in Washington right now.\" It even goes beyond that. Another disturbing post. Robinson defended slavery, writing, quote, \"Slavery is not bad, and I wish they would bring slavery back. I would certainly buy a few.\" All of these comments and many others that you can read on cnn.com were made on the message board of a website called Nude Africa. And, Julia, in addition to these posts, he also expressed views on Nude Africa that sharply contradict his current policies as a socially conservative candidate for governor. For example, he has been vocally anti- transgender. But look at what Robinson wrote on the porn message board a decade ago, writing, quote, \"that he liked watching transgender porn,\" adding, quote, \"that's effing hot,\" while calling himself a, quote, \"perv.\" In another thread that was discussing the story of a woman who said she was raped by her taxi driver while drunk, Robinson wrote, quote, \"And the moral of this story, don't eff a drunk white bitch.\"",

Larry, I know you were listening to that. Let's talk about this first. I assume that the former president has been quoted as calling Mark Robinson Martin Luther King on steroids. What do you make of this investigation, that interaction, obviously with Andrew and his decision to continue to fight on in this race? LARRY SABATO, DIRECTOR, CENTER FOR POLITICS, UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA AND EDITOR, \"A RETURN TO NORMALCY?\":  Well, I would encourage people to read the article. I've read it and it's quite convincing, despite what the Lieutenant Governor had to say. I just returned from North Carolina midday today and I was talking with people about the politics of the race rather than this information, which I didn't have at the time. But what's important to know is Lieutenant Governor Mark Robinson was already losing. He's well behind, some would say way behind the Democrat, Josh Stein. Despite the fact that North Carolina normally leans Republican, not in every race, but certainly in presidential contests. This is -- this can only hurt Robinson more. He's probably going to lose by more on account of it. And that hurts Donald Trump. People say, well, how can that be? He's further down on the ballot. Because this is going to disillusion a fair number of Republicans. Some of them may not show up, others may not do the volunteer work that makes elections run and campaigns run. So, this is damaging. And the 16 electoral votes in North Carolina could be the electoral votes that determine the presidential race.",

She can win by millions and millions and millions of votes, Hillary Clinton won by 3 million and didn't win the presidency. What matters is the Electoral College. And as you said, correctly, 43 states are watching the only seven states that matter. They're the ones that are going to elect a president because all the other states, we already know how they're going to vote. They're already going to be blue or red. We could pick them today instead of waiting for November 5th. So, this is a campaign that is extremely close because the seven swing states are virtually tied.

It even moves farther even toward the to the west into Laos as well, where we'll pick up 150 to 250 millimeters of rain. Now, to some spot that, boy, this storm has just not left. They named it Boris, and it seems like it was two weeks ago, but even in Italy now, over 200 millimeters coming down. And if you want to kind of do this at home with me, you think about a meter stick about 39 and a half inches or so long. So, if you took about 100 millimeters, that's one-tenth of that stick. So, 100 millimeters is about four inches of rain. Here's what they had. Some of the spots picked up four inches of rain in about 12 hours. And so, Italy really got hit hard with this flooding. The thing is finally settling down, finally leaving the problems that it left behind, but it is still going to be a little bit of a rainfall event here for parts of Northwestern Europe, and they'll take the rainfall in Portugal. Because, really, they need the rain to help put out those wildfires, certainly. Still tropical season out here in the Pacific. We'll keep watching it. And so, will my wife keep watching you.",

It was the second such attack near a Japanese school in China in recent months. This man, like others in Shenzhen, denouncing the violence.

Now, in terms of what else we know about this attack, we know that Chinese authorities are currently investigating the motive behind this brutal murder. We still don't yet know quite why this occurred. We also know that locals in the southern city of Shenzhen have been leaving flowers for this young boy and his bereaved family members. We also know that Japanese companies are offering their Japanese employees a chance to go back to their home country in case they fear for their safety and their families lives. Now, there's also been an urgent demand for Chinese authorities to better protect the lives of foreign nationals in the country. Even though violent attacks like this are rare, there's been a spate of recent attacks in these past couple of months that have caused some concern. For instance, back in June, four college instructors from the United States were stabbed in China. Just two weeks later, a Japanese mother and her son were also stabbed at a bus stop. A Chinese bus operator who tried to intervene later died from her injuries in hospital because of this attack. Now, at his press conference on Thursday, the Japanese prime minister, Fumio Kishida, also described his grave concern about the safety of Japanese nationals. He said, and I quote, \"It is a despicable crime and a serious and grave matter.\" He also added, such an incident must never be repeated. We strongly urge the Chinese side to ensure the safety of Japanese people. So, again, a very sensitive and distressing time for both Chinese and Japanese people. Julia.",

But let's just remind everyone what's on the line here. An unprecedented 50-50 season never been done before in the whole history of the sport. 50 home runs and 50 steals in the same season. On Wednesday night, let's set the scene for you, Ohtani stealing is 49th base off the campaign to move to within one steal and two home runs. A magical 50-50 season. The two-time American League MVP had a quiet game, I think fair to say, by his own very high standard, striking out twice in the Dodgers 8-4 win over the Marlins. So, after last night, he was sitting at 49 steals and 48 home runs on the season. So, we get to this Thursday here in the U.S., over there in the Sunshine State and edging ever closer, and he would add to his amazing tallies, the Dodgers superstar stealing his 50th and then his 51st bases off the season. And there was a really special moment for the fans there to witness there, Julia, to celebrate the achievement of 50 bases taken. What happened? Well, the third base was removed in between innings and replaced with another. I think we can safely say we know where that base is likely headed. It's going to the Sports Hall of Fame, you would have to think. And then in a strange twist, Ohtani's stolen base moving him ahead actually of Dodgers manager, Dave Roberts, for second place for most stolen bases in a single MLB season by a Japanese-born player in MLB history. Ichiro Suzuki stealing 56 bases. That was back in 2001. Ohtani would steal second base in the second innings as well. But then, wow, the moment, the special moment, just a short while ago, Julia, another incredible moment for him, a really, really special moment for him, for the fans to witness then, for Ohtani smashing home run, number 49 of the season to right center field it went. He just smashed it, sending it some 438 feet in the process. The stats are coming in thick and fast, I can tell you. Shohei now matching the Dodgers franchise record of 49 set by Shawn Green, that was also back in 2001. I'm not hearing of any more home runs so far. We wanted to bring you this while we were on air. But look, if it happens, we'll get it to you. You can be sure of that, Julia. Incredible.",
