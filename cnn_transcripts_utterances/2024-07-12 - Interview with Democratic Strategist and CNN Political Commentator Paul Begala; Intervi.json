I'm Bianna Golodryga in New York, sitting in for Christiane Amanpour. Pressure is building for President Joe Biden to quit the race. And yet, he's made it clear he's not giving up on his campaign for re-election. Here's what he said in that much anticipated NATO press conference last night. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN, U.S. PRESIDENT:  There are at least five presidents running or incumbent presidents who had lower numbers than I have now later in the campaign. So, there's a long way to go in this campaign. And so, I'm just going to keep moving. Keep moving. And because, look, I got more work to do. We got more work to finish. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Well, now, at least 18 Democrats in Congress are calling for the president to withdraw from the White House race, including Jim Himes, the widely respected ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee. So, what now for Joe Biden and the Democratic Party? Strategist Paul Begala was a counselor to President Bill Clinton and is a long-time political analyst. Like all senior Democrats, he's wrestling with this unprecedented challenge. Paul, it is good to see you. And as we heard from Congressman Himes yesterday, clearly it was obvious that that statement was written before the press conference and he sent it once it finished. And he said as much afterwards in interviews that it didn't have as much to do with his performance in that one night, but he was looking at all of the other evidence, all of the other polling, the months of concerns surrounding the president's mental acuity and obviously his age. Let's play what he said, and I want to get your response. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

So, let's start there. REP. JIM HIMES (D-CT):  All I can do is look at the numbers right now. No president has ever won with a 37 percent approval rating. Look at the swing states, because this isn't a race that is decided in five or six states. And imagine that three months from now we get another performance like there was in the debate, right before the election. Do you want to take that risk? I don't. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

The president said that he has spoken and met withphysicians and neurologists in the past and that he would be open for another examination if they came to him and said that he should have one. He said that has not happened yet. But what is notable is people like Nancy Pelosi and even representative Clyburn, who incidentally today said that he is all in for Biden. And obviously his support for President Biden really helped save his last campaign in 2020, especially with the crucial black vote. But then he went on to say, just like Nancy Pelosi, that Joe Biden should make his own decisions about his future. And what I'm stumped on, Paul, is that President Biden has made his decision. He's been very clear. He's not saying, I'm listening, I'm thinking about it, I'm debating, I'm open to changing my mind. He said, I am all in. So, how should we be reading? How are you reading in parsing these words here from people who are real diehard Joe Biden supporters, people that have loved him and view that he did a very good job these last three and a half years?",

These are not swing voters. These are not Republicans. These are the most loyal people in Joe Biden's presidency. And they're clearly opening the door. You're exactly right. You don't -- you parse what Speaker Emerita Pelosi said when she said, well, he's got an important decision to make, after he had already said he made a decision. She's essentially giving him the permission. You know, and in addition to being the greatest legislative leader in all of American history, Nancy Pelosi raised five kids. I've raised four. And when they become adults, you start to learn that permission is more powerful than pressure. And so, I think very wisely, Mr. Clyburn, Speaker Emerita Pelosi, instead of pushing this proud, powerful man in which he would dig his heels in, they're reminding him of what a success he's been, and they're reminding him of the stakes, that more and more Democrats and grassroots Democrats, the majority of Democrats right now think he's too old to carry the fight to Donald Trump, and it's the fear of Trump that's driving our politics today in my party.",

Rarely do you hear them giving them and allowing them to take the car keys and not being concerned anymore about their ability to drive. But the president remains defined. It seems that he's focused on certain polling that benefits him. And I want to ask you about a poll that just came out today that does just that. An NPR NewsHour, Marist Poll said that -- it's a national poll and it's within the margin of error, but it shows the president leading Donald Trump 50 percent to 48 percent. And in response to that, Ron Klain, who was a very close ally and confidante of President Biden, served as former chief of staff, obviously, has helped him over the years and in his debate prep for the debate two weeks ago, he tweeted in response to this, with yesterday's press conference in this new poll, it's time to end the freak out and unite behind the Democratic nominee and the only person who has ever beaten Trump. How do you read all of these conflicting polls?",

He's tied, essentially, in an ABC poll and this Marist Poll from NPR. But here's the thing. Four years ago, he was ahead by 10. He won the election by three. So, polling has not been very accurate in the age of Trump. When Trump is on the ballot, when he's not, pollsters generally get it right. When Trump is on the ballot, there's very often -- not very often, always, this cushion of low propensity voters who we don't catch in our polls who turn out for Mr. Trump. So, again, Biden was leading by 10 four years ago. He won by three. It doesn't mean that same cushion is there. We don't know is the honest answer. But if it's plus one or minus one, plus two or minus two nationally, it's even closer in those swing states. And Democrats really believe, all of them, from the grassroots all the way up to George Clooney and Nancy Pelosi, that Donald Trump is an existential threat to our democracy. They don't just think he's got like bad tax policy, OK? They think he'll end the American experiment. I happen to think they're right. But that's why this is so dire for Democrats. Is there -- there's these terribly conflicting emotions. There's this terrible fear of Trump and certain knowledge in their view that he'll end the democracy, but then there's this deep love and affection for Biden. Biden has been at this a long time. He's a really good person. Every Democrat has had an interaction with him that has been wonderful and loving and empathetic. On top of that, he's been very impressive in his performance as president. So, this is the war that's going on in every Democrat's heart. And I suppose President Biden is listening to half of those emotions and not the other half.",

Well, now returning back to the United States and the expected political drama set to unfold at the Republican National Convention in Wisconsin next week. In many ways, the battleground state tells a story of the evolution of the GOP there. Republicans swinging more and more to the right to a full-on embrace of Donald Trump's MAGA policies. A close observer of this has been Charlie Sykes, founder of The Bulwark and a respected voice among never Trump Republicans. He joined Walter Isaacson to discuss it.

But also, I think he's also got to answer the questions about whether he is fit to serve for another four years. And, you know, to do that, he is going to have to give more long form interviews like he did with George Stephanopoulos, you know, hold these live press conferences like he did on Thursday and also have transparent and credible medical information, because, I guess, you know, my take on all of this is that if, in fact, Democrats believe, as I do, that Donald Trump poses an existential threat to our constitutional Republican system, then they need to ask really tough questions about Joe Biden.

I mean, the Wisconsin Republican Party was very skeptical of Donald Trump in 2016. You'll remember that he was defeated in the primary. He lost by double digits to Ted Cruz of all people. Not because people like Ted Cruz, but because Wisconsin Republicans looked at Donald Trump and said, no, this is not what we have in mind. This is not the kind of conservatism that we have. So, there was a moment back in, say, 2015, I believe, when Wisconsin Republicans really thought they were the wave of the future. You know, Reince Priebus was chairman of the Republican National Committee, Paul Ryan was speaker of the House of Representatives, Scott Walker was a candidate for president. And think about where they've come since then. So, we've seen this transformation of the Republican Party everywhere, but it's really dramatic here in Wisconsin.",

And the question is, what did they see? I think it was a combination of push and pull. I think it was a combination of disillusionment and disaffection from what they saw as a Democratic Party that was no longer talking to them. But also, there was something about Donald Trump's approach to immigration and other issues that appealed to them. He touched something that I think had been blatant in Republican conservatism for a long time. And I will admit that I did not necessarily see that coming. You know, I thought that the party was going in a very, very different direction. Donald Trump had a sort of lizardry instinct that, in fact, he could tap into these resentments and this fear, this sense that the forgotten American was being victimized, was being exploited, and he tapped into that in a very, very successful way.",

And the overwhelming reaction from Wisconsin dairy farmers is, we need immigration. We need people on our farms. So, it was, we're not a border state. But there is this sense, and it's been fed by Donald Trump and his supporters, and their allies in the media that this country is under attack, that it is under invasion, that you have brown people coming across the borders and they're coming for your jobs and your women. They're causing crime. And it is that sense of menace. So, what they've done is they've created immigration from being an engine of economic development and opportunity to a threat, to an imminent threat.

Wade, I mean, I'm sorry it's a cliche now, but they were the car -- I mean, they were the dog that caught the car. The fact that they were not prepared for creating a culture of life that would encourage families and mothers, and children I think is a major lapse on the part of the pro-life movement. And instead, they've emphasized very extreme and punitive measures. But I think that in Wisconsin, abortion will play the way it plays the rest of the country. We had a -- in fact, it's already had a tremendous impact here. This is a very evenly divided state. But a liberal Supreme Court candidate who ran on Roe versus Wade won by a landslide here in Wisconsin. So, that should be a really salient issue. In a state like Wisconsin the -- I do think that abortion is going to be more significant than immigration. But again, we're a very, very evenly divided state. And can I just say something about the immigration issue that I think has been underappreciated? And I don't know how this plays in Wisconsin, but I think that if the issue is, should we toughen the border and, you know, have more enforcement? I think there's going to be a lot of support for that. That that's not going to be necessarily a massive wedge issue. But one of the things that Donald Trump is pledging and that is in the Project 2025 and in the Republican platform and has been endorsed by other Republicans, is the mass deportation of illegal immigrants. Now, there's so much going on, it's sort of easy to pass that over, and I guess I sort of want to pause and go, wait, you are talking about forcefully deporting 10 million people from this country. I guess, if people begin to focus on that, if they begin to ask exactly how are you going to do that, what kind of roundups are we going to have? Is the military going to do that? Will police officers do that? Will there be detention camps? Will we be putting people in buses, in trains? How do you move 10 million people? Because potentially that will be one of the great humanitarian disasters of our time. And yet, we really haven't litigated that and debated that very much. I mean, is something like that, perhaps it's just Donald Trump is saying it because it's the symbolism. It's like the law.

I mean, he -- let's concede that he's had a successful presidency, but re-nomination, re-election is not a gold watch. 2024 is about preventing Donald Trump from regaining power. So, I will vote for anyone who will prevent Donald Trump from getting back in the White House, whatever the circumstances, no matter how reluctantly, because I think that that is the key. And I think that's the way that voters need to think about it, is that if, in fact, Donald Trump does post this existential threat, then it will be a binary choice, and it might feel good to indulge oneself by writing someone in, but in a state like Wisconsin, that election will be won either by Donald Trump or by Joe Biden, or whoever the Democrats nominate.

I wonder whether or not there will be people who will stand up and say, OK, we're going to support Donald Trump, but we're not going to abandon NATO, or we're not going to go along with some of these extreme positions here. You know, I think one of the things that has been the most disillusioning over the last nine years has not just been the bowing of the knee to Donald Trump, but it's been the willingness to change principles, to change positions that people have held through their whole lives because that's what they need to continue to be with the tribe. Will there be any indication whatsoever that this party wants to reach out to centrist voters or will this just be a doubling down? And unfortunately, this convention takes place in the shadow of the turmoil that's going on in the Democratic Party. So, this is, again, going to be a very optimistic, very aggressive, very triumphalistic Republican Party. This will be the gathering of the party that is absolutely confident that they will be in power next year. So, it's going to be interesting to see how they respond to that. Do they figure that -- you know, that because they are in a position to win this election, they should moderate and reach out to swing voters in places like Wisconsin, or will they see this as a ratification of everything that they have been doing since January 6th and double down? So, I'm going to be very interested to see how much and how willing they are to litigate the 2020 election, how they will react to all of that, and how much they'll talk about the future, because I'm not sure how they will balance that.",
