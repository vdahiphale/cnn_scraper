We'll discuss what it all means for the President and the election. Plus, Ron DeSantis using a CNN town hall to attack frontrunner Donald Trump on everything from the economy to abortion. But, is it too late for him to overcome the former President's massive polling lead? And I will discuss all of this and more with the Ragin' Cajun himself, James Carville. That's ahead. Good day, everyone. I'm Kasie Hunt to our viewers watching in the United States and around the world. It's 11 a.m. here in Washington, Wednesday, December 13, just 33 days until the Iowa caucuses, 327 days until Election Day. This is today's State of the Race. \"I'm here\", a defiant Hunter Biden spoke to reporters on Capitol Hill a short time ago, coming out swinging against what he calls a MAGA attack machine that aims to take down his President, his father, Joe Biden. Hunter was subpoenaed to testify before a House Committee behind closed doors this morning. He says he'll only do it publicly because he wants to correct the record. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) HUNTER BIDEN, PRESIDENT BIDEN'S SON: Let me state as clearly as I can. My father was not financially involved in my business, not as a practicing lawyer, not as a board member of Burisma, not my partnership with a Chinese private businessman, not in my investments at home nor abroad, and certainly not as an artist. In the depths of my addiction, I was extremely irresponsible with my finances. But, to suggest that is grounds for an impeachment inquiry is beyond the absurd, is shameless. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "Yeah. I think that this moment has political implications for both the Republicans and for the Democrats.In the immediate, House Republicans are expected to vote as soon as later today on that impeachment inquiry into President Joe Biden, voting to start that process formally. It's a process that's really been ongoing since Kevin McCarthy announced it in the fall. But, there is also implications for Democrats here, because as I have been reporting this out for the last several months, there has been some concern from Democrats on the Hill, that the White House, that Joe Biden, that they're not forceful enough in talking about Hunter Biden, that this is such a sensitive issue. And today, Hunter Biden really went out there and sort of tried to separate out the facts that he sees, one of them being that, on the one hand, he says he has made mistakes. On the other hand, he said his father's only crime here was loving him, trying to help him through his recovery, and that his father was never financially involved in any of his business dealings, either as a lawyer in his foreign investments. All of those things, he says, were totally separate from the President of the United States. And obviously, that is the crux of what House Republicans are trying to prove. They're trying to show that there is a link. And while they have yet to show a direct link between the President and Hunter Biden's foreign business dealings, they're arguing today, as they take this step to open the impeachment inquiry on the House floor, that this is going to help them get more information. This is going to help them bring in more witnesses. I also would point out, Kasie, there is sort of this separate issue because House Republicans are saying that if Hunter Biden won't come for this private deposition that they may move forward with contempt of Congress against him. I think one interesting moment here, and obviously Hunter Biden's lawyers are well aware of how this would play out in court, they're trying to argue he is willing to testify. He is just willing to do it publicly. I'm very curious how that plays out if this goes all the way to the court.",

But, as a politician, I like it. The thing that was missing, I can coach Hunter and the Democrats on the Hill. He is fighting a subpoena. Now, he should comply with subpoena, if you ask me, politically as well as legally. If you're subpoenaed, you should testify. And so, he is fighting it. But, he has pretty good argument that one of the guys subpoenaing him, House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan, was himself subpoenaed by the same Congress 600 days ago, and has yet to comply. Liz Cheney, the Co- Chair -- the Vice Chair of the January 6 Committee believes that Mr. Jordan, Congressman Jordan, was a material witness to the riot of January 6. They subpoenaed Congressman Jordan to testify. He has refused to do so for 600 days now. I think they should throw that into the mix. Again, I think Hunter had -- you have to testify if you are called. He has a right to take the Fifth. But, I thought this sort of pugilistic approach was pretty good.",

First, Biden has very little to lose Hunter Biden, because he is already -- was ready to plead guilty. So, these charges are now coming down, kind of bogus. There is nothing like mysterious about it. Nothing is going to do to implicate himself. Secondly, it was a very strong legal argument in many ways. It's like an opening argument to a jury, in this case, perhaps the jury of public opinion.

There is not a shred of evidence connecting Hunter Biden's bad behavior with the President of the Unites States, not a single shred. And the Republicans look like they're about to make 18 Republican Congress members, whose districts Joe Biden won, vote on an impeachment inquiry into Joe Biden.

The vote on this impeachment inquiry is set for tonight. The Republicans hadn't until now had the votes. They have managed to -- Paul mentioned these kind of moderate Republicans who had been resisting doing this because taking the vote would be a political problem for them. They seem to have decided that it's fine if they're going to go along with this. Why the change now? LAURA BARRON-LOPEZ, CNN POLITICAL ANALYST, &amp; WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT, \"PBS NEWSHOUR\": I think that their reasoning or the argument that they're making is that they're voting for this process of starting an official inquiry and that they can still vote against the impeachment if it comes to a vote on the floor down the road. And now, I think the Democrats are going to use this vote and run it in ads, particularly because when I've talked to independent voters or disenchanted Republicans and even Democrats, those voters say that they do find Hunter as sympathetic that they feel as though addiction, as Paul said, has hit a lot of families and that they feel bad. They don't like that he is being dragged through this process. Now, they think that, of course, if he committed crimes, which he has been indicted for that he should be held accountable for that, I will say that the White House -- also, Hunter going out and making this public statement, he is defending himself because the White House in a public capacity is not going to do that. They've made very clear that they are keeping this investigation totally separate. They have no heads up on what's going on with the Justice Department investigation. White House sources did tell me, though, that on Hunter's statement today that they thought that it was powerful and forceful.

And that's what the President says when he talks about this. I think that -- just to go back to what this looks like in the arena of the public and public perception, a lot of the Republican and Democratic pollsters that I've talked to say that, in focus groups when they bring up Hunter, voters are not focused on Hunter Biden right now at all, and that they don't think -- they don't see enough evidence that connects him at all to the President. So, right now, if anything, they just see him as this sad son who has a really sad story that should be held accountable for what crimes he may have committed, but they aren't.

But, that last year with COVID, I think it was mishandled dramatically. I went to the rallies with Donald Trump. He said he was going to build the wall and have Mexico pay for it, and that didn't happen.

If he stays in the race and is siphoning off eight to 15 points out of what she would reasonably expect to get there, it's going to make it very difficult, no matter how many Democrats and independents should choose to vote in the Republican primary, which to your point, I think -- that's a risky bet to get those folks to come out and participate in the Republican side.",

I mean, he has been rougher on Trump than Joe Biden has been. And it's not going to get him to 50 percent of the Republican Party, but he had hoped to do some damage. So, yes, long answer. The reason Joe Biden won the primary nomination of my party is that pretty quickly every other moderate in the race endorsed him, Amy Klobuchar, Pete Buttigieg, Beto O'Rourke, they all dropped out quickly and rallied around Joe.
