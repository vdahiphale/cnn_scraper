And what happens next week will be to use one wordA stream of former government officials, including the former president, his chief of staff, his lawyers, a top Justice Department official, campaign lawyers, all expected to surrender in what Fulton County, Georgia District Attorney Fani Willis alleges was a criminal conspiracy to overturn the 2020 election. A senior law enforcement official tells CNN former President Donald Trump is expected to turn himself in at the Fulton County Jail at the end of next week on Thursday or Friday. Trump's surrender and arraignment in Georgia are likely to look different from those in his previous three criminal cases. The Fulton County sheriff has suggested he wants to treat Trump and the others named in the indictment similar to any other defendant. That could mean that they would have mugshots taken and be fingerprinted. And all of this will happen just a day or two after the first republican debate, which the frontrunner is planning to skip, according to multiple sources. We've got a lot more to come on all of that. Plus, we've got a brand-new update this hour from the National Hurricane Center on Hurricane Hilary, and fears the storm could dump over a year's worth of rain on parts of the Southwest, including the Los Angeles area. So, stay tuned for that. Now I want to get right into it with CNN political commentator Van Jones, former advisor to George W. Bush and John McCain and executive producer of \"The Circus\" Mark McKinnon, and CNN contributor and former Nixon White House counsel John Dean. Gentlemen, thanks for staying up late. Great to talk to all of you. Really appreciate it. John, let me start with you first. You know Trump is now set to surrender for the fourth time late next week and this time the world could get a mugshot of a former president. You worked for Richard Nixon. Can you put next week into context?",

What we're seeing from this judge increasingly is that she doesn't intend to treat him any differently than the rest of the defendants. The thing that's unprecedented and fascinating about next week is that on the one hand, we're going to have a national republican debate where Trump will not be on stage, and yet just the following day, he will be in a federal courthouse where we may see a mugshot.

He's not going to be found to have broken any of these rules. He can just do and say whatever he wants. DEAN:  I've not seen the statement. You said it's from the campaign, which somewhat shields him from making a personal statement if the campaign issued it. He can theoretically deny that he had anything to do with it. But it's obviously done in his name. And there really is no line that he's not willing to walk up to, although I think he has been somewhat chastened recently, Jim, because he has backed off on holding this press conference next week where he was going to explain to the world how he had evidence that totally exonerate him from all these charges.

They have to admit that he lost the 2020 election, not just the election for his re-election, but he lost the House, he lost the Senate for the first time in 100 years, not since Grover Cleveland.

Trump is disqualified based on an original meaning of the 13th -- 14th Amendment, Section 3.

I wouldn't be surprised if we start to see state officials try to remove Trump's name from the ballot, especially in blue states, especially partisan, Democratic secretaries of state. Now, if that happened, there would be a legal challenge, and we would see it then go to the courts and it would start to be litigated. And then, of course, the question is, you know, this just takes one state secretary of state in one state to try to remove President Trump from the ballot and to get the go-ahead from the state Supreme Court, and then it goes to the United States Supreme Court.
