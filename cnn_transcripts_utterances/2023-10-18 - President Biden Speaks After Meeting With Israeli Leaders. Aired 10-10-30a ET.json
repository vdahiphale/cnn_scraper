      "sentences": "Yes, and that is kind of loomed, Sara, over this entire visit. It was something that the White House was dealing with as his plane was preparing to take off from right outside Washington yesterday. And it's something that he's been asked about essentially every stop of this visit today. Obviously it's a visit that is cut shorter because he's no longer going to Jordan to meet with the leader there and the president of Egypt. And instead he's about to come out here behind me and make remarks.And that will really be the culmination of President Biden's time here in Tel Aviv. It started out in that one-on-one with Prime Minister Netanyahu earlier this morning. And that is where he embraced those denials by Israel, saying that they were not responsible for that explosion of that hospital in Gaza City. And instead, just a few moments ago, President Biden said that it was analysis and data from his own Pentagon that he was using and that it was part of his assertion that he did not believe that Israel was behind it. Obviously, Israel has forcefully denied that. Authorities -- Palestinian authorities have said that they do believe the IDF is behind it. They have said it was not them. That has been part of this, but it's certainly not the only factor in this entire trip. And one big question that still remains is whether or not that humanitarian aid is going to be able to get into Gaza to those civilians who are still there and have not been able to get any of that and have seen obviously no power, no electricity, no internet for the last several days. That is going to be a big question for President Biden when he comes out here. It's something that his secretary of state has been working on going back and forth between several countries in the last several days. He's actually here in the room and has been in these meetings with President Biden. And so that will be a big question as he comes into this room. I should note, sitting behind me are several of the first responders from that day and several of the families of the victims and the families of the hostages that were taken and captured by Hamas. That has probably been the most somber part of the president's day, was when he was in the room with them here. And, of course, that is a moment where he talked with them. He shared some Irish poetry with them. And that is part of what he is going to address when he does come out here in just a few moments.",

      "sentences": "Yes. You know, one of the things that is happening, of course, is that everyone is taking to their sides as happens in this conflict more than perhaps anywhere else I have ever seen in the world. But you do have information that has come out.There are people questioning Israel when it comes to whether or not they were involved in the attack, partly because of what the P.M.'s office put out about those babies that they said were beheaded, which turned out that they did not have proof of. And now you've got Hamas. which has certainly said things that are absolutely not true, blaming Israel for this, and the rest of the Arab world really blaming Israel for this when Israel says it has evidence against it. How does President Biden sort of thread this needle? Because, you know, he's got to be able, for humanitarian purposes, to talk with, for example, the Palestinian Authority, to try and get some support from places like Jordan, the King of Jordan, in order to try and make this happen. How is he trying to do that? Is he having those conversations behind the scenes as well? I know you're very plugged in, Kaitlan.",

      "sentences": "Well, Sara, if you've been to Gaza as you have during times of intense bombardment, it is truly terrifying. There is a lot of chaos. There is a lot of confusion. There is a lot of panic. You see people running around trying to get to safety, not knowing where safety is.In the case of the Al-Ahli Hospital, it's clear that hundreds of people thought that that would be a safe place to go to. It's worth mentioning that Al-Ahli is in the northern part of Gaza. That is the area that the IDF had asked people to leave and evacuate from on Friday. But we kept hearing over and over again from people that we've spoken to, how can we leave our homes and go to the south when there are continued strikes on the south? There were strikes close to the Rafah border crossing yesterday. There were strikes in Khan Younis. On top of that, you have the fact that the humanitarian situation is rapidly spiraling out of control, even in the south where people have been urged to move to, no electricity, no water, very, very little food. The U.N. warning that maybe there are four or five days worth of food left in stores. And so you have an almost a paralysis whereby people just don't know what to do and it's always in those situations where civilians suffer the most, where they bear the brunt of the actions of both sides, and it's always in those situations where it is most challenging for diplomats to try to forge a path to some kind of respite or refuge for them.",

      "sentences": "All right. You have just been listening to President Biden here in Israel, in Tel Aviv, talking about many different things, number one, that he supports unequivocally Israel after that attack on October 7th and talked about his long history with supporting this country all the way back to the 1970s, right before the Yom Kippur War, talking to Golda Meir, who was the prime minister at the time.By the way, the timing of that and the timing of this, almost exactly the same, the anniversary of the Yom Kippur War, October 7th, when the attack happened here, that has really changed this nation and changed its position, as well as changed what it is willing to do to Hamas in Gaza. They are trying to, as all of the Israeli officials have said, rid all of Gaza of Hamas. I want to bring in our Kaitlan Collins, who was standing by and was in the room, our David Chalian as well, and our Clarissa Ward, who is here also in Israel with us. Kaitlan, I'm going to go to you first. What stood out to you in hearing from the president? I mean, this was another unequivocal support of Israel from the president of the United States.",

      "sentences": "And that terrorist group that he is referring to, Israel says, it was Islamic Jihad, not Hamas, but it is another group that exists there that does not believe in the existence of Israel itself.I want to go now -- thank you, Kaitlan, for that. Stick with us. I'm going to go now to David Chalian. David, can you tell us about just the significance that during an officially declared war that the president of the United States came into this country trying to get some humanitarian work done, coming to show solidarity, but just the significance of him being here as we have seen rockets coming into this country every single day and night throughout? Meantime, there are explosions going on in Gaza at the same time and a huge humanitarian crisis going on there. What's the significance of him being here now? DAVID CHALIAN, CNN POLITICAL DIRECTOR:  Well, Sara, you saw the president himself highlighted that he was the first president to visit Israel in a time of war. He wanted to make sure everybody understood that it is indeed a significant move. And I think it was so clear what he was doing throughout his remarks. The whole first half, as you and Kaitlan were discussing, was that complete repetition of that total solidarity with Israel, standing side by side in total support of Israel. And I think when you talk to folks around the president, what they believe that position does is allow him to go into the second half of his remarks, which was to call on the better angels and the humanitarian sympathies of the people of Israel and not to get too consumed by their passions and anger in response to the terrorist attacks, and that they keep in mind who they are as a people as he was trying to express the need for humanitarian assistance, for the ability for Israel to maintain its position by not -- or by urging some restraint. And I think when you look at the remarks and how they were structured, you see a president of the United States doing that very thing we've been talking about, which is threading a needle here. Obviously, time will tell. The future will only tell us if that is successful. But it's clear that's what the objective was in his visit and putting a button on the visit with these remarks.",
