      "sentences": "A warm welcome to \"First Move\", great to be with you on this summit Solstice Eve. It's also World RefugeeDay the yearly event intended to help raise awareness of both the plight and also the promise of those displaced around the globe. The U.N. says more than 35 million refugees crossed international borders last year alone due to war, famine and climate change. This is the day to mark their journey of each of them and every single one of them. Later on in the program, we'll discuss how refugees can enhance and strengthen the global workplace with Hamdi Ulukaya. He's the CEO of Chobani, and also the Founder of the TENT partnership for refugees, aiming to provide work and training support to the displaced, as well as Amazon's VP of people experience and technology for global operations Ofori Agboka. Amazon just won the 41 firms who have pledged to train and hire some 20 sorry 250,000 refugees across Europe over the next three years. Many of them Ukrainians of course, fleeing the war, and from refugees might to Titanic tall plight, a massive search and rescue operation now underway in the Atlantic for a missing submersible. The five people inside have less than a week of oxygen left. We have complete coverage of those dramatic rescue efforts just ahead. And in the meantime, Wall Street gearing up for a holiday shortened trading week a bit of consolidation. I think you can see that in the United States pre market after strong earnings last week led by tech stocks. Europe under some pressure to amid disappointment over government action or let's call it perhaps non action in China truly no bazookas from Beijing. China cutting two key lending rates for the first time in almost a year, but the cuts not as deep as many had hoped, suggesting perhaps that China does not yet believe more substantial stimulus is needed. The SHANGHAI COMPOSITE and the HANG SENG finishing the session lower this Tuesday. The NIKKEI eking out minor gains, I think we'll call that unchanged. It is a busy show coming up as always, but we do begin some 12,000 feet below the surface of the Atlantic. And just a short time ago, we got this update from the U.S. Coast Guard.

Good news, the weather seems OK, that's according to our experts in the CNN weather center. I want to point out two specific things that will go on though in the next few hours. One is that the U.S. Coast Guard says that finally, they will get some deep sea exploration in terms of rescue. Some of those assets are now going to the area. Julia, what's been going on so far is that they have been able to search mainly from the air. And they've been putting these sonar detectors on the surface of the water, what will happen today is that they will have some capacity to do some deep sea searching, especially when, as you heard, Jason say that they lost contact about an hour and 45 minutes into this journey. The problem with that is that at that point, that means that they would have been almost at the deepest depths of where they had to go in terms of the Titanic wreck. And that could be as much as 2, 2.5 miles beneath the surface. Having said that, I you know, I've heard people say that if they're floating around, why they've been found out. I mean, Julia, I've been in these waters this is an incredibly difficult search. Even if you are searching on the surface of the water, you know, it's about the size of a largest family van it's very difficult to find that in these waters. That is also why the U.S. Coast Guard and Canadian officials are calling on commercial vessels. Many of them with very varying degrees of capacity on board to also try and help out in this search. And right now, they know there is limited time here. If they are in the deep sea, yet there's limited time in order to get to these people and actually rescue them, Julia.",

They and the Harding family are very grateful for all the kind messages of concern and support from our friends and colleagues this according to a press statement from the company. Do we have any sense, Paula, of what may have gone wrong here? I think that's certainly what friends, family and all of us that are watching this, perhaps asking at this moment.",

This is aprivate company that endeavors to do this. They have done it successfully a quite a few times. But many people have explained to me, Julia, that when you're talking about this kind of deep sea exploration, this is uncharted territory. Not many people dive to these depths and that, you know, everything needs to go properly. Of course, they had emergency systems in place. But when you think of the fact that there hasn't even been like a GPS locator or anything that you can really pinpoint the location of this submersible, that is the problem. And at this point, we really have no indication. I think the best case scenario here is that they did surface and that because they lack all communication, it's just a search that must continue. And that can continue even beyond that 96 hour window because they could still be they still may have surface somewhere. But have absolutely no way of communicating with anyone. The best news so far for everyone here is the fact that the weather seems to be holding up because it can turn quite brutal quite quickly in the North Atlantic.",

      "sentences": "Are they Julia, well, these are showerheads drones as the Ukrainian say drones that aremanufactured in Iran, but were then given to the Russians that are now used by the Russians for sort of drone attacks in waves, especially here on the Ukrainian Capital. It's actually quite an interesting question that you asked, how easily are they to intercept because one of these drones is pretty easy to intercept, they fly very slowly, they don't fly very high. And they can't really evade fire that's coming from the ground either. But the problem is that the Russians use these drones and attack in waves. It's a swarm tactic, if you will, where several of these drones come at once trying to overwhelm the air defenses here in the key of region or wherever else, these drones are used. Now, if we look at the numbers from tonight, coming from the Ukrainians, they say that they detected 35 of those drones over Ukrainian airspace first and foremost, once again, here in the capital region of Kyiv. They say they were able to take 32 of those drones down. So that looks pretty efficient. It's unclear what sort of damage was caused by the three that weren't taken down. We don't have any information on that whether or not anybody was harmed by those drones. But you can see it is quite difficult for the Ukrainians. Those types of drones are often taken down by gunfire by machine gunfire coming from the ground. That's how they try to take them out, because the drones are quite cheap. And so wasting an expensive missile on something like that is certainly something that again, could be a problem in the long run for Ukrainian air defenses. But it definitely is one of those things where we see once again, a sleepless night for the residents here in Kyiv, where the air raid sirens were on for several hours, but of course this also part of the wider war that's unfolding. You were mentioning what was going on there with those attacks on Lviv in the west of the country. But also, for instance, on the City of Zaporizhzhia in the south east of the country as well. There were several missiles that were used to attack that city. That right now, Julia is of course a town that is very close to the currently most active frontline here in Ukraine, the southeast of the country, where the Ukrainians are trying to make those gains on the battlefield. They say that they are advancing in certain areas, but certainly it is very, very difficult. We see the Russians not only firing back on the actual battlefield, but of course trying to hit Ukrainian cities and Ukrainian infrastructure as well, Julia.",
