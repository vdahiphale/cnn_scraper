Tonight, officialshave just last hour updated us on the effort to find the sub that went missing on a dive to the Titanic wreckage. Those new details straight ahead. Then, gunman kill at least four Israelis in the West Bank and Hamas claims responsibility. And U.S. President's son pleading guilty to tax offenses. But Republicans say the case of Hunter Biden's misbehavior is far from closed. Now, just about 40 hours of oxygen left. That's the U.S. Coast Guard's grim assessment of the situation on board a tourist submersible has gone missing in the frigid depths of the Atlantic Ocean. U.S. and Canadian authorities are racing around the clock to try to rescue the five people on board. They've now expanded their search, scouring beneath the seas as well as on the surface. The sub lost all communications on Sunday near New Finland. It was heading to the wreckage of the Titanic, which lies at the depths of a crushing pressure, some 4 kilometers underwater. The U.S. Coast Guard gave this update a short time ago. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JAMIE FREDERICK, U.S. COAST GUARD:  Right now, all of our efforts are focused on finding the sub. What I will tell you is, we have a group of our nation's best experts and the unified command. And if we get to that point, those experts will be looking at what the next course of action is.",

I mean, even if you take into account, thatthey find -- they find the vessel within the next 10, 15 hours, to actually deploy some form of rescue apparatus to recover it in the remaining 15, 20 hours, to me it seems almost impossible. And the reasons for that are firstly, they don't know where it is, and they're still trying to locate it. If you imagine, it's a 6.7 meter submarine somewhere near the Titanic, which is a 290-odd meter ship with lots of broken wreckage around the area. It's a very significant search. The second reason is the depth of water. As you said, between 3,000 and 4,000 meters deep, and trying to get rescue assets down to that depth, hasn't really ever been done before. And the third reason is that, even if those assets are available, they're a long way away. So actually, even to deploy, it will be difficult to get those assets to the situation area within the 40 hours that they talk about.",

Otherwise, they'd have attempted to return directly to the surface. And so, that leaves him in a real predicament. So, if you turn on a set, they were on the ocean floor near to the Titanic, even though they've got 96 hours of -- all the stock-point of 96 hours of oxygen, actually, the temperature down there is roughly zero degrees Celsius. It's very cold, the living conditions for that period of time are very tough. And the one thing we don't talk too much about so far is actually carbon dioxide, which we probably try a lot on oxygen, but breathing out produces carbon dioxide, and if it reaches a certain level, that becomes a killer itself. So, a really tough environment. And my thoughts go out to those participants, but also their families, who must be hoping that this is going to be a recoverable situation, but the longer this goes on, the less opportunity there is to do that.",

We follow process, we follow procedure, and therefore managed to -- managed to deal with the incident. If you've got a certain amount of the crew that aren't capable of doing anything. And in reality, if you look at the submersible itself, there is not a lot you can do because you're in a sealed tube.

Hunter Biden also struck a deal to avoid prosecution on a gun charge. Now, this is on the heels of former U.S. President Donald Trump's indictment over his alleged mishandling of classified documents, making for a heated race for the White House. Let's go live to Paula Reid, who is in Washington for us this evening. And Paula, this investigation into Hunter Biden has been going on for some what? Five years now.

      "sentences": "Oh, yes, this investigation has been going on for about five years. And last Summer, eventhough we knew the prosecutors had looked into possible foreign lobbying violations, also possible money laundering, we learned that they had narrowed it down to a few potential tax charges as well as one charge related to a gun crime, and failing to disclose his addiction when he purchased a firearm. But then nothing happened for seven months, and in April, Biden's lawyers asked for a meeting with the Justice Department, which they got. They sat down with a Trump-appointed U.S. attorney overseeing this case and some career officials. And they made their pitch for why he should not be charged. They argued that he had paid back these taxes, they said that a recent Supreme Court case made it more difficult to successfully prosecute gun crimes like this one. But over the past few weeks, we've learned that negotiations between the two sides have really ramped up to try to settle on the deal to resolve the charges. Now, sources tell us the Justice Department is expected to recommend probation for Hunter Biden for the two crimes, the tax charges that he is pleading guilty to. There's also the gun charge, but that is likely to be handled through a different process called diversion. So as long as he complies with requirements set out by the court, in terms of not being able to own a gun, some drug compliance requirements, as well. Possibly having to submit to drug testing, things like that, that particular charge will be expunged. These are relatively minor charges, and it seems that his lawyers, they tell me, they're pretty pleased with this deal.",

Suffice it to say, still a very competitive mission ahead. The good news is the weather is good not area. I can tell you from being in those waters, that's not always the case. And the weather changes quite dramatically. But for now, forecasters tell us that it is really good searching conditions. I will mention that they've already searched well over 7,000 square miles. That is a large area. I had been saying prior that if this submersible had actually surfaced, that we shouldn't get too discouraged too early, because it is a difficult area to search.

So this transparency is going to be vital to all those business leaders, who will be there at the conference. These governments and the 50 different countries which will be attending, they are all looking for ways to share the burden of supporting Ukraine. And one of the important ways will be at the end of the war rebuilding businesses, getting the country's roads, buildings put back together, making it a functional country and less dependent on them for aid and handouts right now. The United States, U.K. and others are helping to pay the government's bills in Ukraine, helping with humanitarian support and massive military support. So that transparency is huge. And the other thing business people are going to want to know is that Russia is defeated and that there is a peace plan. So these are really early steps, because the fight is on.",

And it was my understanding, a few months ago, that such assurances had been provided to at least one other country. But I wasn't able to confirm that. So I think secretary Blinken is telling us here what has been understood in diplomatic circles behind the scenes. And certainly, the Ukrainians, who met with top foreign policy adviser to president Xi in February at the Munich Security Conference, felt in their conversations with the Chinese officials that they were being listened to and their concerns about platforms that were being used to sell equipment or to pass equipment to China from Russia (sic) for use in the war, that those concerns were addressed. So I think this is an important takeaway. But has China really shifted its position vis-a -vis its support, its economic support for Russia at this stage, which is huge for helping fund the war for President Putin. It doesn't appear to be. And there is certainly plenty of leverage available to China not to suddenly say, OK, no lethal aid and no help whatsoever. That's not in their strategic interest, it would appear.",
