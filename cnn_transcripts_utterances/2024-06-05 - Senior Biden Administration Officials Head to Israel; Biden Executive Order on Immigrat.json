She also talked about how she would check his car for drugs before their daughters used the car. CNN senior justice correspondent Evan Perez is outside a court in Delaware. Evan, what's the latest? EVAN PEREZ, CNN SENIOR JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT:  Well, we're on a break right now, Brianna, but the two witnesses certainly have the jurors' attention. Our team in there tells us that the jurors are paying very, very close attention as they heard the testimony from Kathleen Buhle first, his ex-wife. She really didn't spend that much time on the stand, as her relationship with Hunter Biden ended before this episode, before he bought this gun in October of 2018. And then, after she took the stand, we have been hearing from Zoe Kestan, who is going to continue her testimony after the lunch break. Now, the point the prosecution is using, these two women's testimony, is to drive home the point that Hunter Biden was a regular user of drugs, that he was struggling with addiction during the period that he bought this firearm, that he should have known that he did not qualify to buy this firearm, which is against obviously for him to -- to buy this gun was against the law. For -- on the part of the defense, they're trying to sow some doubt about some of the dates and some of the transactions. In the case of Zoe Kestan, she is someone who saw him using drugs, saw the -- the jury saw pictures of him in a bathtub with what appeared to be a crack pipe. That's what she said it was. And what -- the job of Abbe Lowell, to -- for him to do here is to have jurors have at least a little bit of doubt that, during that day, that day when he bought the gun, that he was not using drugs or that the prosecution doesn't have any proof that he was using drugs that particular day -- Boris, Brianna.",

And prosecutors always have to establish what the mental state of the defendant was. Now, here, the law says knowingly possess. And so the question is, well, he thought -- this is the argument for the defense. He thought he was no longer addicted or he thought he wasn't using anymore. Therefore, he was not knowingly possessing a firearm unlawfully. Now, that sort of strains logic a little bit. But this isn't about proving whether something did or didn't happen. It's about poking holes in the government's case. And it could be a successful way to do that. That's what defense attorneys and good defense attorneys do.

It's -- you got to prove few things.The prosecution's job is very easy, with one caveat. They have to not go too far. And if the prosecutors are seen as having vilified or targeted or abused or pushed on people who are addicted or seem to be callous or not caring about people who struggle with addiction, as millions of Americans do and probably people on the jury and their families, that's the kind of thing that can turn off a jury when a case is so sensitive like this.
