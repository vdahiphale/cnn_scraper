Right now, across the country, a massive bomb cyclone, as it's known, winter storm, plowing a dangerous path across central and midwestern states, bringing life-threatening cold and wind chills as low as negative 70 degrees. You heard that, negative 70. Snow and frigid temperatures disrupting holiday travel, forcing airlines to cancel more than 1,300 flights this morning across the U.S. This according to Flight Aware. Plus, overnight, a remarkable show of unity on Capitol Hill. If you missed it, it was quite a moment to see. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy handing Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Vice President Kamala Harris a Ukrainian flag bearing signatures of Ukrainian soldiers from the battlefield. Zelenskyy's mission on his historic visit and speech to Congress to make the case directly to the American public, as well as to lawmakers, about the need for sustained aid to Ukraine and that this is a war, not just for Ukraine, but for the free world, in his words. Did he succeed? We're going to discuss. Also, on Capitol Hill right now, senators are working to reach a final vote on that critical government spending bill to once again beat tomorrow's deadline and avoid a government shutdown. We're getting some positive signs this morning. Please do stay with us. We are following it all. First, our team of reporters covering the dangerous weather across the country. Two of the cities facing the brunt of the storm, Denver and Chicago. We're also live in Atlanta at the CNN Weather Center. We begin with CNN's Lucy Kafanov. She's in Denver, where temperatures now plunging at a record-breaking pace. You know, we were speaking yesterday, Lucy, and you were saying, hey, you know, it's warm for now but the temperatures are going to drop. Here we are, 24 hours later, it looks like the temperature has dropped.",

I's pretty hard to stand out here and it's quite painfully difficult to just be outside. And that's because the temperatures dropped from nearly 50 degrees, when I was outdoors yesterday predicting the bad weather, to below 11 right now. And with the wind chill it feels like minus 26 or worse.It was snowing all night. That, at least, slowed down. We got about four inches here. What I and my team are doing at this moment, Jim, talking to you is precisely what authorities are asking people in Colorado not to do. They're asking folks to stay indoors, to stay warm, to get out of this cold. Once in a lifetime, once in a generation storm this is being described as. Denver, today, is experiencing its coldest day in 32 years. And this is no joke. It is dangerously cold. Prolonged exposure in some parts of the state where windchills are 60 below zero could cause frostbite within minutes. I, obviously, am lucky enough to be able to get out of the street after this, go indoors and warm up. A lot of folks here in Denver and in Colorado are less lucky. That's why we have recreation centers, libraries, public libraries open as warm areas for people to get out of these frigid temperatures. The Denver Coliseum, where we were talking to you yesterday in front of, is now active as a 24-hour warming center. The temperatures not expected to increase until Friday. So this is going to be another 24 hours of bitter pain, Jim.",

The message is, this isn't just impacting people in the upper Midwest or in the high plains, this is really going to be a very widespread concern over the next 48 to 72 hours. Yes, some of the coldest temperatures exist off to the north. But even when you talk about places like Texas, Oklahoma, and Georgia, these areas are going to be well below what they normally would be. But, yes, the temperatures are peaking.For states like Montana and South Dakota, look at some of these windchill numbers. Minus 70. Minus 59. Again, the concern there is that frostbite sets in, in just five to ten minutes when you're dealing with numbers like that. Here, again, not much better. Denver currently, the windchill, minus 37. Des Moines, minus 34. Even Amarillo, Texas, minus 26. So, again, even places you don't normally think about being cold are dealing with this same blast of cold air. We also have the same system that's now sliding its way off towards the Midwest and into the northeast. This has a lot of snow for some midwestern states. Over towards the east, you still have some little bit of warmer air. So, we're dealing with that rain-snow mix for a lot of cities before the bulk of that snow on the backside begins to make its way into the northeast for tomorrow. So, you've got a lot of areas here that are dealing with blizzard warnings, winter storm warnings and watches. For today, most of the heavy snow will be into the Midwest. Places like Chicago and St. Louis, Boston and Washington, D.C., even tomorrow morning though, Jim, still looking at some pretty good rain showers.",

You know, you do combine middle of the night with widespread blackouts across much of the country.Here in Kyiv, where for much of this war the situation has felt relatively normal until recently because of the unstable power grid and the dramatically crippled power generation capacity, there are people that we've met and that we've spoken with who have electricity in the capital city for 40 minutes a day. We have to go to the tents to warm up to charge their phones, to connect to Wi-Fi. People who have to line up to get a hot meal that's cooked over a wood stove because they don't have the ability to cook in their own homes. This is the reality in the capital city. In, you know, arguably the area that is best protected in Ukraine. You get to some of these other cities where it being without power for days and days on end is a regular occurrence. And you have the dead of winter, you know, plunging temperatures and all of the associated risks and dangers that come with that, you know, they're having a hard time in some places keeping the lights on in hospitals, at critical infrastructure. That's how bad things are here. And yet you have Russia now, you know, after -- after, yes, a triumphant moment for Zelenskyy. Ukrainians absolutely proud of their president and glad that he's coming back with more money, with more weapons and more pledges for deliverables for this war effort. You have people dying on the front lines every single day here. They're holding the lines, but they're not making offensive gains. And the Kremlin is saying that bringing patriots in will only prolong people's suffering. They say they didn't hear anything from Zelenskyy's visit, from Zelenskyy or Biden supporting, you know - you know, or addressing Russia's safety concerns. Whether they're legitimate or not I guess depends on your point of view. And then they say that the west, the collective west, is basically bracing, Jim, for a prolonged confrontation with Russia. That could be the most alarming thing we're hearing out of the Kremlin. Although, frankly, not surprising.",

They're trying to jam this through the Senate in just a few days. But the United States Senate requires all 100 members to reach an agreement to have a vote. They do not have that agreement yet because there's a dispute over what amendments can be offered as votes, even though those amendments are likely to fail.But one amendment in particular, the Title 42 amendment that you mentioned, created an issue. Has over the last day or so. Mike Lee of Utah has pushed that amendment. And there's concern among Democratic leaders that that could actually pass and that could scuttle his chances in the House. So, Democrats furiously have been working behind the scenes to try to stave that off, offer their own alternative amendment on Title 42, to give their members something else to vote for. Not the Mike Lee amendment. And assuming then that both measures will fail. So, all these negotiations happening behind the scene. But it appears they are moving closer to locking this down.
