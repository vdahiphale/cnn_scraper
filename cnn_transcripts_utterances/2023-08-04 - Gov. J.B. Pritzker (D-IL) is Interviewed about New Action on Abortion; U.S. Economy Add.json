This is as a legal challenge to the state's near total abortion ban moves through the courts, meaning the law is not technically in effect but concerns over when the court might rule and how it might rule is causing those clinics to basically stop providing that abortion care. And this ongoing legal battle means those seeking an abortion are looking to neighboring states, and that includes, of course, Illinois, where the governor and the state legislature have continued to expanded abortion accesses after Roe v. Wade was overturned.I'm joined this morning by the Democratic governor of Illinois, J.B. Pritzker. And, Governor, good morning to you. You actually just signed a law on Monday that expands access across your state. What does it change? GOV. J.B. PRITZKER (D-IL): Well, a couple of things. First, we've created hotlines for both providers and for patients. If you're a patient coming from another state, you may not know where you can go. You may not know where you can stay overnight. You may not know what to do with your children while you're having a procedure done or seeking health care from a doctor in Illinois. So, we've got hotlines that are available for people to find out, and also for those who can't afford an abortion, whether it's a medication abortion or a procedure, we even have non-profit organizations that will support your effort to seek out your reproductive rights. And, unfortunately, we're seeing thousands pour across the border from just our neighboring states, and tens of thousands from across the country.",

And what it does is it - it penalizes anti-abortion centers for using what you deem deceptive practices or misinformation. You're basing this legally on a consumer fraud act that you have in the state of Illinois. You were sued immediately by a law firm in your state that calls it a blatant attempt to chill and silent pro-lifer speech essentially. And yesterday a federal judge upheld that. Upheld that.

They - there ought to be a private right of action for anybody that's dissuaded or told, you know, something that's false. That's the important thing.What they say to people, that's fine, as long as what they're doing isn't deceptive. And we have laws against that.

And it is President Biden who is protecting them.So I'm pleased about the messaging coming out of the White House and the work that he's done to protect women's rights. There's more to do. Unfortunately, we now have 15 or 16 states that have literally just cut off a woman's right to protect herself, to have reproductive rights exercised. And in Illinois, we are an oasis. If you look at the map, every state around us has outlawed abortion, and we're the ones who are protecting it. That's why we're seeing an influx of patients.",
