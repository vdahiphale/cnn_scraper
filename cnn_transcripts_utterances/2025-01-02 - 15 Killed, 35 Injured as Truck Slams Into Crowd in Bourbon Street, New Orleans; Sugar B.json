      "sentences": "Hello and welcome to our viewers joining us here in the United States and all around the world and streaming on CNN Max. I'm Paula Newton. And we do begin with breaking news in two separate New Year's Day attacks here in the United States. President Joe Biden says investigators are looking into whether there is any possible link between a truck ramming that killed more than a dozen people in New Orleans by a suspect with apparent ties to ISIS.And a Tesla truck explosion outside the Trump Hotel in Las Vegas. Multiple law enforcement sources tell CNN the suspects in both incidents had military backgrounds. We want to go first to New Orleans where the FBI is investigating the ramming attack and the historic French Quarter as an act of terrorism. Police say at least 15 people were killed when the suspect drove his truck down Bourbon Street at a high rate of speed at about 3:00 a.m. local time. Now, he's been identified as 42-year-old Shamsud Din Jabbar, a U.S. citizen and Army veteran. They say he made recordings on the drive from Texas, where he apparently was living to Louisiana and those recordings were about joining ISIS and killing his family. Now we should warn viewers, much of the video from the scene is incredibly graphic. Police say they found an ISIS flag on Jabbar's truck along with improvised explosive devices which they believe were made at an Airbnb rental in Louisiana. According to the FBI, a search is underway at a property linked to Jabbar back in Houston, Texas. Video shows the white Ford F150 making that sharp turn onto Bourbon Street, past police barricades and onto the sidewalk. The driver continued down the street for several blocks, mowing down pedestrians. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) (END VIDEO CLIP)",

RUSSEL HONORE, U.S. ARMY (RET.): I do have concerns, because on any given day, a determined terrorist can attack a soft target. You know, Brianna, when I woke up this morning at 5:00 and I saw killing in the French Quarter. I thought it was another mass shooting, which Jane can attribute to you. Every now and then, somebody will come down at a major event and street crime, somebody will get automatic weapon and shoot a bunch of people. That was my earlier thought. I said, oh, man, another mass shooting in the French Quarter at a bad time during a major event. But my perception, that's what it was. On the other hand, ended up being a terrorist attack. The police are well trained in trying to deal with street crime and gang type activity that may come to the French Quarter with a automatic weapon. We've had several of those incidents and they're well trained to respond to it. I don't think they were as focused as we should until today on the potential of terrorist attack using vehicles.

And if there's not, they're not going to waste investigative resources on it. For instance, you now have the evidence -- the exploded evidence of the device in the Tesla car, and you would have the unexploded IED in the -- in the for lightning in New Orleans. The FBI is going to compare those because bomb makers tend not to have 10 or 11 different ways they make bombs. They make them all the same way.

It's going to be people with heavy weapons or weapon of a vehicle which is a heavy weapon.And those that police are doing a fairly good job of that, better than you would expect. There probably needs to be more training, but I thought this was about as good a response as you can get. But before a response, you have to have a prevention and I wouldn't give them a good grade at all on prevention. They say, well, the bollards were nearing completion. That's political talk, meaning we didn't get it done. And that's frustrating for me because accountability and transparency says we learn from what we -- the mistakes. It's like an airliner crashes. Nobody tries to hide what the pilot's mistakes might have been or what the airliner manufacturers mistakes would have been, because that kind of non-transparency kills people.

The suspect, a doctor originally from Saudi Arabia, who'd expressed anti-Muslim far-right views. Like Magdeburg and New Orleans, other cities have experienced horrific vehicle attacks during holidays. November 2021, a suspect with a long criminal history drives an SUV through the annual Christmas parade in Waukesha, Wisconsin, killing six, injuring more than 60. Berlin, December 2016, a tractor trailer rams into a crowd at a bustling Christmas market, killing at least 12 people, injuring dozens of others. The suspect, a rejected asylum seeker, was later killed in a shootout with police in Italy. And the deadliest vehicle attack ever, July 14, 2016, Bastille Day in Nice, France.
