Crowds gathered in Tel Aviv earlier for a vigil to remember the 1,400 victims who were brutally killed, and to hope for the safe return, of course, of some 240 hostages still believed to be held captive by Hamas. Israel's Defense Minister says that remains a top priority, now that the operation in Gaza is entering a new as well as crucial phase. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

The Defense Minister saying they're at the heart of Gaza City. How does this shift the fighting?

One coming over our shoulders this way, and another salvo appeared to be heading towards central Israel. And that was the second salvo in probably about 20 minutes headed towards central Israel. And that other previous salvo coming out just before the prime minister was speaking, the IDF says that it is making gains inside of Gaza. That, it is, as you say, fighting in the heart of Gaza city. And this is significant because it is intense urban combat. But there's also reasons that indicate that -- because the interpretation through the fact that IDF casualties on the ground have been relatively light, there's an interpretation that says Hamas is actually hiding out in the tunnels, and not engaging directly with the IDF in the streets. We also know that the IDF is now using more precision-guided missiles, more low explosive missiles to allow the troops to sort of move in and move forward behind the curtain of fire. It's intended to protect the  troops on the ground. It's also intended to protect the civilians. And I think one of the interesting things that we heard from Prime Minister Netanyahu in his press conference a few minutes ago was that he indicated that the -- on the diplomatic front, the government is working around the clock to keep the window open, he said, for the IDF to finish their military mission. This, I think is another indication from the Prime Minister that we've been getting over the past 24 hours, that the international pressure because of the high civilian death toll is essentially collapsing the time that he has available for the military to take out Hamas. And if Hamas is hiding in the tunnels and not engaging, that makes it much harder. And to the situation the government finds itself in now, potentially is one where they may have to contemplate not being able to defeat Hamas  completely, as they have set out to do. That's not what they're saying, but it's perhaps what we're beginning to get a sense of, Isa.",

And later, Hamas took control through an election, and then overthrowing their political opposition in 2007. So, in a way, it would be going -- it would be a big step back in time, a big responsibility. But I think, at the moment, it's not clear that the Israeli government is going to be in a position to have full control over Gaza, have security control, be able to sort of have military raids in and out to make arrests the way that they would want to. To be in -- to be in a position to be able to administer Gaza. That is really unclear at the moment from where we stand, Isa.",

Well, the humanitarian crisis in Gaza appears to be growing more dire by the day.CNN's Salma Abdelaziz looks at the civilians caught in the crossfire. But first, a warning to you, some of the images in this report are graphic. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SALMA ABDELAZIZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Families are burying their dead en masse, with little time to mourn. Gaza is not a humanitarian crisis, but a crisis of humanity, the U.N's. chief says. A month of war has devastated the Strip. Israeli airstrikes have hit homes, schools, refugee camps and ambulances. And the IDF has claimed all legitimate Hamas targets. A siege has cut off food, fuel, water and basic supplies, and there are no safe places. The U.N. says 70 percent of the Strips' population forced out of their homes and desperate for refuge. The healthcare system is decimated. More than 60 percent of Gaza's hospitals and medical centers are out of service according to the Palestinian Authority. And the death toll, the U.N. says defies humanity. Israeli attacks have killed over 10,000 Palestinians since  October 7th, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health in Ramallah, drawing from sources in the Hamas-controlled enclave. Based on the ministry's figures, at least, one child is being killed every ten minutes. CNN calculations suggest Gaza becoming a graveyard for children, the U.N. chief says. The bloody conflict is spurring anger and action in capitals, from Berlin to Ankara, to London and beyond. The world is turning against Israel's war in Gaza. The global outcry getting louder. But the U.S. so far unable to stem the bloodshed. After a whirlwind Middle East tour, Secretary of State Antony Blinken failed to secure any pause to the fighting. And Prime Minister Netanyahu remains defiant. The IDF says it's dropping hundreds of bombs a day on Hamas targets, as Israeli ground forces push deeper into the territory with a stated aim of wiping out the group. The U.N. describes Israel's assault as collective punishment, and the youngest are paying the highest price.",

Cameron has worked tirelessly to try to tie Governor Beshear to President Biden. President Biden very unpopular in this state. He also has attacked Beshear for his position on public safety, and his response to the pandemic, arguing that the learning loss during while schools were closed was so substantial, and not enough has been done to work in concert with the Republican state legislature to address that learning loss.

One, just the declaration that this is a war unlike any Israel has seen one month into this. And they are, this country has unified in its defense. That is notable because Gallant and Netanyahu came from different sides and in effect are part of a unity government here. They were saying in clear terms they are setting aside their differences, as they fight Hamas today. That is important because, as you know, leading up to this war, there were divisions within the country. But as they are confronting Hamas in the wake of October 7th, it is a very different story. They are ready to fight. The final thing I will say from the press conference that stood out is that Gallant said this is a multifront war. They are fighting in Gaza now. But they are aware of the threat on the northern front. And we certainly found that when we were up in northern Israel. In terms of the threat from Hezbollah, there's great conviction in this country that, after they handle the Gaza threat, the threat from Hamas that they have every intention of taking on Hezbollah in the north. And that just portends quite a long war going forward.",

They are not really revealing intelligence that they might have, secondly, of what the locations are. They released some videos showing them opening tunnel entrances and entering the tunnels. It is not surprising. It's an enormous underground network in Gaza. They are confronting it. Confronting it is one thing but neutralizing it over time, given the depth and breadth of that tunnel network, is a different story. But they are making progress. The thing is, as they advance further into Gaza, they will run into more of that and more of the fighters. That also portends a long war going forward, with the potential for large Israeli casualties on the ground. We have already seen a fair number from IDF forces. But given the goal of this, which is to destroy Hamas, not just weaken it, again, that is a signal that this is going to be quite a long fight there.",

Joining us from southern Lebanon is our Ben Wedeman.Ben, how's that warning from Netanyahu being received in Lebanon this hour? BEN WEDEMAN, CNN SR. INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: It's not the first time the Israeli prime minister has made such a warning. I think they are accustomed to these warnings coming from the Israelis. Just to update you, about 40 minutes ago, there was a very large explosion south of here that shook all the windows in Tyre. All indications are that it was an Israeli airstrike. Earlier in the evening, we heard outgoing rocket fire from the area of the Lebanese border. It was today that the village of Aynata (ph), which is near the Israeli border on the Lebanese side, that more civilian victims of the violence along the border were buried. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) WEDEMAN (voice-over): A family, a village is in mourning. Samira Ayoub and her three granddaughters, Layan, 10; Taleen, 12; and Remas, 14, were killed in an Israeli drone strike on their car Sunday afternoon near the border with Israel. Their uncle, Samir, was in the car in front of them. \"Their mother was screaming,\" he recalls. \"'I want my children. Where are my children?' as she watched her children burning inside the car.\" The Israeli military told CNN the vehicle was a, quote, \"suspected transport\" for terrorists, adding they are looking into claims there were civilians in the vehicle. Clearly, there were only civilians in the vehicle. Every day, the border area is rocked by incoming and outgoing fire, enough to keep the area on edge, not enough yet to set off a full blown war. The ancient city of Tyre lies just 20 kilometers, or around 13 miles, north of the frontier. Pulling in his nets, Deeb says now is not the time to take risks. \"Us fishermen are not going far out to sea,\" he tells me. \"We stay close to shore just in case something happens.\" The normally bustling port in the heart of Tyre is subdued. \"Usually, this place is full of people,\" Mohammed (ph) (INAUDIBLE) fisherman says. \"No one's going out. Everyone is staying home.\" Elias' family has been making fishing boats for generations. He lived through all of Lebanon's wars and doesn't want to see another one. \"Everyone is scared,\" he says. \"Many people have gone elsewhere. Who wants to stay here and be bombed?\" Until or unless that happens, the fishermen mend their nets. Life must go on. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Helping us with all that is our senior political analyst, Ron Brownstein, who joins us now. Great to see you, Ron. Let's start with Ohio. Because Kyung Lah and I were speaking 20 minutes or so ago. And abortion rights are on the ballot. What role, first of all for our viewers around the world, does abortion and the ongoing fight around reproductive health care play in all of this? I know it's been a political issue for Democrats. RON BROWNSTEIN, CNN SR. POLITICAL ANALYST: Right. First of all, good afternoon. Abortion, when people have had the chance to vote directly on abortion, whether it has been in red states like Kansas and Montana or Democratic states like California and Vermont, every time they have had an opportunity to vote on abortion rights directly, since the Supreme Court ended the nationalized constitutional right to abortion in '22, voters have voted to uphold abortion rights. The odds are high that, in Ohio tonight, that streak will continue. Polling has shown the initiative, which would overturn a six-week ban on abortion, imposed by the state's Republican legislature and Republican governor in 2019, is likely to pass. The electoral impact, though, in terms of how abortion has played into broader elections between candidates, has been a little more nuanced. No question that it has been a powerful issue for Democrats in swing states, places like Arizona, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. But in the hardcore red states where the most severe abortion restrictions have already gone into place actually, places like Texas, Iowa, Tennessee, Florida, there has not been the kind of backlash that we have seen in the swing states. And certainly not the overwhelming votes we have seen when voters have had a chance to weigh in on the issue directly.",

On one side, there's broad dissatisfaction with the economy and broad disenchantment with President Joe Biden's performance. Virginia gives you a good example of that. It is a state that he won by 10 points in 2020. His job approval rating is now underwater. In recent polling by \"The Washington Post,\" voters give Republicans a double-digit advantage on which party they trust to handle both the economy and crime. Normally, you look at those numbers I just recited and say, it's going to be a big night for Republicans. But in fact, it is, at best, a toss-up and may be leaning Democratic, because the offsetting factor that was there in 2022 is still there in 2023, which is that a lot of voters, particularly in the suburbs, who are disappointed in Biden and disenchanted with the economy, are still reluctant to vote Republican, because they view them as a threat to rights that they cherish, such as abortion rights or even book bans. A core question is whether Democrats can continue to win voters who don't believe they have delivered for their interests by convincing them that Republicans are a bigger threat to their values and their rights. That worked in key swing states in 2022. Virginia will give us the best measure of whether it works again in 2023.",
