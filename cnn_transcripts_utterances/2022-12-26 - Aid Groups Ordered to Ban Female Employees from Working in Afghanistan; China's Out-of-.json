I mean, in some respects, you would think that it could be an easy problem to solve theoretically because the ban only applies to nongovernmental organizations both national and international. If you work with the software company in Afghanistan or if you work for the management consulting in Afghanistan, your women can still go to work.So, it is curious that it is just nongovernmental organizations that are targeted and these are the organizations that deliver life-saving services to some of the most vulnerable women and children in the country. So, we really hope that this situation will be resolve by the Taliban simply rescinding their decision over the next day or so. Every day that we can't get out to work, and we can't get out to work because we need our female colleagues to help us get access to women and children because you can't access young mothers or young children and education if you don't have female staff. Because as we know that culturally that's not appropriate in Afghanistan to have all male staff dealing with young women or children. So, every day we can't get back to work, thousands of people don't get life-saving services. We have mobile health clinics all around the country. They deliver critical services to 12,000 people every day. That means that yesterday 12,000 people, and I'm talking about mothers and children specifically here, didn't get those services and they are not getting it today and they won't get it tomorrow. So, we really need it an urgent review of the decision.",

And for them to really consider the well-being of their own women and children right across the country who need access to these life-saving services. So, I would say we are wholly dependent on their good will. I don't know that I'd call it leverage, but I think that's the only thing we can do is to repeal to their good will and to reverse this decision.",

And it's particularly serious because the country is in the middle of winter, the worst months of winter are ahead. There's a, you know, quite a significant food security crisis in the country.And that means that more and more children are presenting with severe acute malnutrition in health clinics to our nutrition teams right across the country. If a child has severe acute malnutrition, there is a 30 to 50 percent chance that they will die if they don't get the assistance that need. So essentially, we can't have a situation where children are dying because we don't get the care they need.

Visual evidence that clearly indicates that something is wrong.But also, we are hearing data from the individual cities. You know, a city like Guangzhou, big port city in China, home to 9 million people, reporting half a million new COVID cases every single day. Another city Dongguan, along with Shenzhen, big tech city reporting 250, 350,000 new COVID cases every day. All paints a picture that this is a surge in infections.",

And team Beijing noticed that that report actually made to air multiple times. It was not blacked out in China. Kind of underscoring the chaos even inside the propaganda apparatus inside China. There is no top down directive at this moment of chaos and confusion of how to report about the end easing of the zero-COVID strategy. There has been emphasis on good Samaritan stories, emphasis on positive stories. Like for example today Paxlovid now being available for people in Beijing being distributed. But people inside Beijing know the real deal. It's really hard to get that medication and the situation in terms of the COVID surge, it is getting worse in the next few weeks ahead -- Richard.

Polio was considered eliminated in the United States thanks to massive vaccination campaigns and highly more than 99 percent effective vaccine. The New York case was in an unvaccinated person and resulted in paralysis, which is a rare but severe outcome of the disease. Number four, life expectancy in the United States continue to drop.
