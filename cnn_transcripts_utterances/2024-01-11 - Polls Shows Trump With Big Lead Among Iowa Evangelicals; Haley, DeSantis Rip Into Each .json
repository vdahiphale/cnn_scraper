That is the critical conservative stretch of the state.Nikki Haley for her part, she is also beginning in Ankeny, where I am right now. That's just a little bit north of Des Moines, again, these fast growing suburbs of Iowa that will play such a critical role in caucus night on Monday. And Dana, the questions that you were asking at the debate last night, really many voters here are talking about that debate as they're trying to make up their minds between DeSantis and Haley. Yes, there are still some undecided voters, believe it or not, we still find them. But one other central piece of the electorate here, of course, in Iowa always, is the evangelical vote. All campaigns, to some degree, have been courting them. We talked to some voters and pastors about what they're thinking about the race. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

He is the President and CEO of The Family Leader and is one of Ron DeSantis's most prominent supporters in Iowa. Thank you so much. I saw you last night in the audience at the debate. I'm already back here in Washington. But let's talk about that debate. You saw it, you were there. It got pretty heated between Nikki Haley and Ron DeSantis. They were attacking each other. Didn't go after or address the differences between them and the far and away front runner Donald Trump as much. Was that a mistake?",

And then what you do is you give America a choice. Either the former president, Donald Trump, or a clear alternative, which I believe is going to be Ron DeSantis.So they first need to make the case about who can be that alternative. I do think Governor DeSantis did do a good job of where he does have differences with a former president and why he believes he's best positioned to win not only the primary, but to win the general election as well.",

And that just isn't the case right now. They're very appreciative of all the things he did while he was in office, whether it's standing up for the sanctity of human life, appointing three justices, moving the embassy to Jerusalem, the Abraham Accords, but then they always follow up with a but.But I believe we need to find somebody who can win in 2024 and then lead on day one and lead for two terms, and that's usually when they're landing for Ron DeSantis.

Isn't -- I mean, if I'm Donald Trump, I would say, no, a vote for Donald Trump is best for Donald Trump.",

And being a friend to him is that you'll pray for him daily, you'll cheer him on when he does what's right, and you'll be a voice of accountability and reason as you go through the process and move forward.I believe a lot what Vivek Ramaswamy is saying as he travels Iowa. The system, Governor Christie, Lynne Cheney they're just not going to let Donald Trump near the White House again. So therefore, we need to choose and I believe choose well so that we can win in 2024. I believe that is in the best interest of Donald Trump. So you stop a government being weaponized against him and you ensure fairness of justice versus weaponized justice. And I think it's best for our party. You need to bring -- have coattails with governors, legislators, but also Congress and senators as well. And so that's why I think, if you look at this analytically and you open your eyes, as Vivek Ramaswamy is challenging people all over Iowa to do, you have to come up with a clear alternative, which is best for America, best for Trump, best for the party, and I believe that's Ron DeSantis.",

That's what those hardliners are demanding. They're saying we should shut down the government if we don't get our way. Johnson has not gone that far. I asked him about that as well. He simply said all the options are currently on the table. They're reviewing all that. But Dana, if he does do that once again, we could face a shutdown fight. If he doesn't go down that route once again, we could face threats and calls for his ouster. Speaker Johnson, recognizing that Kevin McCarthy's job wasn't easy.
