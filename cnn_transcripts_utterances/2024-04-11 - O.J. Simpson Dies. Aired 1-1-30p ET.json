Simpson may be one of the most controversial people in our nation's history. Before his murder trial, which divided the country and essentially turned him into an outcast, he was a celebrated football star who won the Heisman Trophy in college. He was also an actor and a pitchman, universally loved by Americans, but that life as he knew it ended on June 12, 1994, when his ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and her friend Ron Goldman were found stabbed to death outside of her home in Los Angeles, the shock of their murders intensifying five days later. For hours, time stood still, as nearly 100 million Americans watched on TV at this, Simpson taking police on a low-speed chase 60 miles through Los Angeles in that white Ford Bronco.",

Let's talk with Diane Dimond. She is an investigative journalist. As we said, she was the first reporter at the scene of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ron Goldman's murders. And I think, Diane, we're kind of all transported back to 1994 when we are here seeing that O.J. Simpson died. Take us back to 1994 and when you arrived there and what it was like.",

Simpson's passing today, was that murder scene.My cameraman and I rolled up on the Brentwood apartment of Nicole Brown Simpson just as they were loading the bodies into a morgue truck. And the morgue truck pulled away. And there we were standing outside on the sidewalk, a long pathway going up to her front gate. And the pavers on the sidewalk were full of blood. There were paw prints from her dog, who had gotten loose after the murders and had gone down to the corner and started howling and alerted some neighbors. And we went inside the front gate. And I was stunned to see there was Nicole Brown Simpson's living room. It was all glass. The candles were still going on the hearth up on the fireplace mantelpiece. And there was a big picture of O.J. and their two children. And it was so eerie to be standing there literally in pools of blood. The police had gone. There was no police presence. There was some police tape, but we sort of ducked under that. And there I was standing where those two people had been murdered, and the candles were still burning on the mantelpiece. It was -- that's the first thing I thought of today when I heard about this news.",

It probably would have just been a slam dunk on DNA, because contamination doesn't make DNA more likely to match a suspect.It would make it less likely to match a suspect. And yet the defense was able to overcome that evidence, Areva. I wonder, as you look back on this, because it did reveal so much about what was going on in Los Angeles with policing, what was going on in the nation, how did the verdict age over time?",

      "sentences": "I don't think it aged well, Brianna.I think folks who had formed an opinion about his guilt back when this happened in 1994 probably still believe that he's guilty. Those that believed that this was a setup, that he was framed by Los Angeles police detectives probably still believe that this was a setup by the police department. And there's ample evidence, I think, for each of those positions with respect to this notion that this was a framing. One of the detectives involved in the case took blood, took a vial of blood from O.J. Simpson at the police department, put that vial in his jacket pocket, and then went to the crime scene. And that allowed the lawyers, the defense attorneys, to argue -- basically make the argument, suggestion to the jury that the blood at O.J. Simpson's -- or at the crime scene was actually smeared on by this blood vial that was taken from this detective. So, those kinds of mistakes make it very difficult for us to have any faith in the criminal justice system or in the evidence that was presented by the prosecution. But yet here we are. If O.J. Simpson didn't do it, there has never been anyone else identified as the murderer. So, for those folks that believe O.J. Simpson is guilty, they don't have any other alternative. There's never been any other person identified as a suspect.",

People typically would come home and watch the evening news, and they weren't consumed by what was happening live back then. But 95 million people tuned in to watch this chase. Then this trial goes on, and it generates mass interest. It gives birth to Court TV. It really boosts CNN; 150 million people tune in live to watch the judgments, the culmination of the trial, and it really boosts this cable television ecosystem. And you have then, soon after this trial, Rupert Murdoch, he launches FOX News in 1996. CNN really is solidified, and Court TV, again, becomes a thing. And then you also have this trial birthing reality television. This was a reality TV moments before reality TV was a thing. Of course, there's an obvious connection to reality television, being the Kardashians, but it boosts reality television. And then -- and so you have this media environment that is with cable news and reality TV. And then you have someone like Donald Trump, I think, that comes along. And you can really see the connections to where we are as a society today, in our politics, in our media. And you can trace a lot of that back to O.J. Simpson and the mass interest in his trial.",

      "sentences": "Yes, Brianna, that's actually true. It is all intersectional. I say that about sports often, but, for me, this is even more -- ithit home because I grew up in L.A. I remember the chase. I remember people running to the freeway to say that they want to send these messages to O.J. Simpson. And, just contextually, what I remember is that this, to me, was the very first time I can remember how divisive we were in public. The black culture was very excited about the fact that O.J. Simpson was -- quote, unquote -- \"not guilty.\" And I remember it being on the heels of Rodney King. And that whole entire community, at least from when I grew up there in Los Angeles, felt like it was it was them versus-us-type of campaign. We all know how it all turned out in terms of what people feel about O.J. Simpson. But his legacy is interesting in sports, to me, because O.J. Simpson was the very first, to me, black icon in sports that was accepted in mainstream media, where people really, truly appreciated what he represented. He was America's friend, if you will, the Hertz commercials that we talk about, that wonderful Colgate smile. He went to USC. He was a Heisman winner, which is the highest level of an award you can get as a football player. He was everything, and he was very intentional about being the type of football icon/player/star that America loved, because he was able to transition easily into the movies because people really love him. But it was a choice. O.J. Simpson knew, especially when he was coming up -- and I will wrap this quickly. When he was in the midst in the '60s in the '70s, they wanted O.J. Simpson to be a part of the civil rights movement, they being Lew Alcindor, known as Kareem Abdul- Jabbar, Jim Brown. They wanted him to be a part of that community. But O.J. wanted to be a superstar icon, which he was. And, arguably, this, to me, is one of the most, if not the famous case of someone going from a hero to someone who was a horror story, and not necessarily overnight. But you would have never thought this would have been the case.",
