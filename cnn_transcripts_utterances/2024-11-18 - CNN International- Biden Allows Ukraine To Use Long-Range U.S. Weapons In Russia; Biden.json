      "sentences": "Yeah. This came from the Kremlin, but also, Russian media have actually just come out of watching Russian state-run media, which obviously are up in arms about all this. In fact, at the start of their main talk show, they came out and said that the Biden administration, as they put it, has decided to continue the war in Ukraine, which Trump wanted to end. So, that's sort of the message that we're getting here out of Russia. You also heard and said about what the Kremlin spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, said about pouring oil into the fire.And so, essentially, it's two things that the Kremlin is trying to telegraph in all of this. One thing is that the Biden administration is trying to fan the flames of all of this, but also that Western involvement in all of this would be increasing. And I think that's something very important, because Russian President Vladimir Putin, in the run up to all of this, has said that this could lead to a direct war even, as he put it, between Russia and the West, between Russia and NATO, and of course, also between Russia and the United States. And the reasoning for that was, Rahel, that he said that he believes weapons like the ones that we're talking about, ATACMS, surface-to- surface missiles, that the targeting for those missiles cannot work without the help, as he put it, of Western specialists from the countries where these weapons are delivered from, obviously, in the case of U.S.-provided weapons, meaning specialists from the United States. And so, therefore the Kremlin is essentially saying that they consider strikes deep into Russia conducted by Ukraine using these weapons as strikes from NATO countries or the U.S. against Russian territory, which then could pit Russia and the United States directly against one another. And Rahel, we have heard from the Russians in the past various red lines when new weapon systems were delivered to the Ukrainians. But, one of the things that they did this time, and I think it just goes to show the campaign that we've seen from the Kremlin to try and dissuade the Biden administration from making exactly the decision that it has now made, they've even changed the country's nuclear doctrine, with the scenario that if Russia is attacked with long-distance weapons by a non-nuclear country, but aided by a nuclear country, which, of course, could mean the United States, that that could trigger a nuclear response from the Russians. So, certainly, some tough talk coming from the Kremlin, but they have not said what exactly their response would be and will be if and when these weapons are actually used, Rahel.",

      "sentences": "Well, Rahel, this has been under consideration for months, according to U.S. officials. In fact, when Volodymyr Zelenskyy was here in September, he presented a list of targets he wanted to hit with long-range ATACMS missiles to President Joe Biden. Biden didn't refuse or dismiss the request. The agreement was effectively that it would remain under consideration, and it would remain under discussion.At least part of the reason we are now seeing this shift, the U.S. viewed the deployment of thousands of North Korean troops into Russia as an escalation and one that merited some sort of response. So, this appears to be a part of that response, as Russia escalates with North Korean troops, the U.S. gives Ukraine the ability to use long-range missiles against targets in Russia. The expectation, according to a U.S. official, is that most of these will be used in the Kursk region, where Russia has amassed 50,000 troops, including some 10,000 North Korean troops, in what appears to be an attempt to take back the Kursk region from Ukrainian forces. So, that would be an environment rich with targets for a missile like this, and that would include headquarters logistics nodes, concentrations of Russian, and perhaps North Korean troops. This would allow Ukraine to better control the battlefield itself and perhaps hang on to that territory in anticipation of a potential push from incoming President-elect Donald Trump to go for negotiations. This would allow Ukraine to hold that and give them more leverage. It's worth noting that for months, we heard from the Biden administration and from defense officials all the reasons they're not going to change this policy, not enough missiles to make a difference. Ukraine has better long-range drones. Ukraine is using the missiles they do have to effectively hit Crimea. Those are the reasons we were given. It's unclear if those are simply now viewed as excuses, or if Ukraine will get more of these missiles to be able to hit targets, but here you see in the waning days of the Biden administration that policy change that Ukraine has wanted for a long time.",

But, now with the war being protracted and Russia expanding its efforts with the recruitment of tens of thousands of North Korean troops, administration officials say that they simply could not stand back and watch that take place.So, certainly, they're finding themselves at odds with other countries here on that very issue, but trying to burnish President Biden's legacy on these very many issues that have been close to home for him and very important for him on the world stage, even though Donald Trump may have different ideas, Rahel.",

They understand that he likes deals, that he is often nakedly transactional. They understand that bigger sort of alliances. Multilateralism are not really his cup of tea. So, they know the differences from Biden.And as your reporter just pointed out, there are already emerging sort of fissures between how Biden sees the world and Trump, and people are reacting to that. So, Argentina's President Milei reportedly has been trying to put a spanner in the works in one of the things that the G20 was trying to achieve, in terms of a tax on the super-rich.

And part of the reason behind that was that he saw an ideological sort of cohesion there in these rich countries. It fitted into his democracies versus autocracies framework.Trump actually is much more likely to pay more attention to the G20 than the G7. He attended the G20 when he was President in 2017, 2018, 2019. I think he will, in some senses, find common cause with many leaders in the global south, whether it's India, whether it's countries from Africa, many of whom actually are not that scared of a more nakedly transactional President, in part because they too are a little bit tired of what they see as American lecturing and posturing on democracy promotion or human rights. And in some senses, they don't see it as the worst thing to have a President who might strike a deal in Ukraine, even if it's not in Ukraine's favor, who might be more deal-based with them.

So, there is trepidation on a lot of these issues.Leaders around the world, as I said, they know Trump. They understand him. And they've spent the last four years poring over all of the books that have been written about him. They know everyone in his orbit. They have a real understanding of what he likes to hear, of how flattery often works, of how he likes to think of deals as deals that he has won or deals that he can put his name on. They understand.

There are people who are close to Wall Street who want him to go one way, and then there is Elon Musk and people on the outside who want him to go another way.There are some new names who are being floated in there. It just shows you how, as these number of roles is shrinking, the intrigue around them is growing. He also still has to fill his Commerce Secretary, Secretary of Labor, Housing and Urban Development, Transportation as well as Education. That's another one to watch, because Donald Trump has said he wants to eliminate the Department of Education.

So, Pete, obviously, holiday season is right here. Thanksgiving is a week from now, two weeks from now. Christmas right behind it. How is this going to affect people's holiday travel plans?",

      "sentences": "Well, we just got a message from Spirit CEO Ted Christie, in fact, a lot of consumers got this message into their emails, saying that the bankruptcy proceedings will not be complete until the first quarter of 2025 at Spirit Airlines. So, that should keep things relatively smooth, at least through the holidays. People love to hate on Spirit, but you should really care about this, even if you don't fly on the carrier, because it really changed the industry, ushered in the term ultra-low-cost carrier, which forced major airlines to introduce the notorious basic economy fare.The bottom line here is that this could really have big implications for every other U.S. airline in a competitive industry. So, this might lead to ticket prices going up on other airlines. Here is the good news. If you have a ticket or credit on Spirit Airlines, you will not notice any change for now. Spirit insists in a statement this morning that guests can continue to book and fly without interruption, and can use all tickets, credits and loyalty points as normal. Also no impact to workers. We're hearing from Spirit's flight attendant union that they will remain on the job. Their contract is in place. No changes to benefits or pay. So, no immediate job furloughs like we saw the airlines begin to do during the pandemic. Also, Spirit underscores that its vendors will continue to be paid through all of this. But, the big question now is, what will happen to Spirit Airlines in the long run? Remember, Frontier Airlines trying to merge with Spirit in 2022. [11:40:00] Just a few months after that, JetBlue tried to do the same thing, but its acquisition of Spirit was blocked by the Justice Department on antitrust grounds, and Frontier ended its merger plans with Spirit earlier this month. So, no apparent lifelines left for Spirit Airlines, saddled with about $3 billion in debt. It's really now on passengers to pay big attention here. A top airline consumer advocate, Rahel, tells me that flights could be eliminated in the months ahead. So, it's especially important to sign up for those alerts and check the flight status online. The silver lining I mentioned at the top, no big impact on Thanksgiving or holiday travel. Hard to believe that the Thanksgiving rush is only about a few days away now, Rahel.",

The case could have a major impact on whether Gaetz is confirmed to be Donald Trump's Attorney General. Now, Gaetz has denied any wrongdoing and has not been charged, but if the House Ethics Committee's report on Gaetz includes information from that civil case, well, its release could torpedo his chances of being confirmed. And we learned last hour that the House panel will meet to discuss the matter on Wednesday. Gaetz, you might remember, resigned from the House shortly after Trump chose him to be the chief law enforcement officer in the U.S.Let's dive deeper now into the story with CNN Senior Crime and Justice Reporter Katelyn Polantz.

The crypto industry plowed tens of billions of dollars into U.S. congressional races this cycle to help elect more pro-crypto lawmakers. This as individual billionaires with crypto interests spent millions to help re-elect Trump. Bitcoin, the world's largest cryptocurrency, hit record highs after his win, in anticipation of more pro-crypto policies from his administration. For a closer look now, let's bring in CNN Business and Politics Correspondent Vanessa Yurkevich. Vanessa, the last few years, to say the least, have been extremely volatile for crypto. What is the industry expecting or hoping for with this new administration?",

Crypto super PACs invested $131 million into congressional races this season, and they're saying that that ultimately resulted in 274 crypto-friendly members in the House and 20 crypto-friendly senators.Now, President Trump took -- won the election, obviously. Soon after, wow, we saw Bitcoin just skyrocket to new highs, crossing $90,000 per coin, per Bitcoin, for the first time ever. So, the industry really riding the high of the Trump administration that will be coming into office in January. But, President Trump wasn't always a crypto fan. He said initially that it was based on thin air, but in the last year or so, he has really warmed up to crypto, accepting donations to his campaign in crypto form. He spoke at Bitcoin 2024 in July. He has also surrounded himself with crypto-friendly advisors, including Elon Musk, Howard Lutnick, who some are saying might be the next Treasury Secretary, and other VC investors and crypto-friendly folks who have been advising the President on this. The President also, he started and helped create a business with his family called World Liberty Financial, which is a crypto business. I spoke to the head of U.S. policy at Coinbase. I wanted to hear what she thought about President Trump's administration and how the industry would be reacting to it. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KARA CALVERT, HEAD OF U.S. POLICY, COINBASE: I think what President Trump did was lay out a very robust and a very clear vision, and that, I think, was something we had not seen.

And ultimately, the crypto industry is going to like this, because currently you have Gary Gensler in place right now, and he is someone that has gone after the crypto industry, especially FTX head Sam Bankman-Fried.[11:50:00] He helped take him down. Of course, this is the gentleman who was defrauding millions of people, but essentially, the crypto industry looking for a partner that they can work with, looking for someone that will help bring crypto into the U.S. banking system.

Clare, we should sort of put this in the context of the Friday night game, which I watched a bit of it. Most people who saw it probably witnessed some technical issues.

Rahel, it really is going to come down to Netflix having enough computing power to handle all the people who are going to want to watch Beyonce and, of course, the NFL on Christmas Day, not to get too technical, but it means that the company is going to have enough -- need to have enough computers running in the cloud, ready to deliver the content for all the people who want to tune in. And it's clear that despite the fact that the company really hyped up this Tyson and Paul fight on Friday, the company didn't correctly anticipate how many people were going to tune in to watch. Netflix said that 60 million households around the world tuned in to watch the stream, and that meant that many of us, you and I alike, had issues, buffering. You had to log out of Netflix and log back in to get those stream to reload.Now, Netflix did acknowledge that it had these issues. It called the fight a mega event and said that its buffering systems were on the ropes. And we've seen these kinds of issues with Netflix in live events before. Last year, a Live Love is Blind reunion had delays and technical glitches. But, this is something that Netflix is really going to have to get a handle on, as it tries to make these live events a bigger part of its business. I can imagine there were some unhappy customers if people had signed up for Netflix just to watch this fight and then they couldn't watch all of it because of these technical issues, Rahel.",
