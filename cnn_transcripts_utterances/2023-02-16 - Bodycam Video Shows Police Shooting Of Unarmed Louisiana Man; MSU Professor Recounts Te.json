It is a Republican Mayor in a Democratic city and he said, he pretty much got that part wrong and he needs to be better about it.

So, it highlights the incredible -- how incredibly hard it is to make these life and death decisions very quickly, and maybe highlights why it is so important to effectively train officers to deescalate in situations, maybe make decisions not to pursue fleeing suspects when they're not known to be armed or seeking a position of cover to return fire or something like that because it leads you down a path into a situation where you have basically no time to think, no time to assess, and you're relying on gut reactions in an incredibly intensive moment and I think that's what you see on the video.",

You don't see their hands. You don't see -- it was like seeing a robot. It was like seeing something not human standing there and all I could see was this silvery, kind of a steel shiny weapon.

I just -- my intuition told me he is walking down the hall and he is going to enter through the door I'm closest to. [20:25:10] So, I threw myself at that door and I squatted and I held the door like this, so that my weight would keep it from -- and I was putting my foot on the wall and holding like this, so that he couldn't open it. All the time, aware that he could just shoot the door handle and open it, but the only thing I thought I could do was that, at least I'll attempt to stop it. And that lasted for about 10 minutes, it was an eternity, or 12 minutes. In the meantime, I told my students, and that I remember, I told the students just escape through the windows, just kick the windows open and escape through the windows. And the first line of windows closer to the rows of seats couldn't be kicked, I mean, it couldn't be broken, they are made out of very hard glass, probably for you know, insulation. So they attempted and they couldn't open those. But then the second set of Windows higher up, they were open and there was big enough an opening, so they start escaping that way. In the meantime, the rest -- there were quite a few on the floor, wounded and I had some kids that were very heroic and were helping those that were wounded. And some of them, I don't know much about how to -- you know, what paramedics do or what you do in a situation like that, but my students kind of knew what to do. So they were trying to cover the wounds with their hands, so they didn't bleed to death. I think, I'll be haunted by it. I definitely don't want to go to Berkey Hall because I couldn't go into that classroom after what I saw. I think the administration is going to move my class to a different building, same time, but a different building. I don't know if I'll be nervous every time I teach. I don't know if I will -- I don't know what the university is going to do. They're going to put locks in rooms so that you can lock the room from the inside. I think that's one of the things that might happen. I don't know if that means we're going to have to use gate cards to enter into a building and leave. But what does that say about our society?

According to his physician, the President remains healthy, vigorous and quote, fit to successfully execute the duties of the presidency. Joining me now is CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta. So Sanjay, let's talk about Senator Fetterman. How significant is it that he's going public with his battle against depression? DR. SANJAY GUPTA, CNN CHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, you know, Anderson, I think obviously, that's it's significant when a public figure talks about depression is going public with it. I think that as you and I've talked about so many times over the years, there are so many people who simply don't. They don't seek treatment because of stigma. So I think that, you know, just I think it's important for that reason. Keep in mind, his history now, back in May is when he had this stroke. And it sounds like was pretty significant. There are details about that, that we were still not fully given, but we know that he had a pacemaker and defibrillator placed at that time. It was last week that he was in the hospital again, because he went into the hospital for lightheadedness. There was no sort of additional stroke that was found at that point. He was discharged two days later, and now he's going into the hospital for depression. Something we heard, Anderson, that he has suffered from on and off for a long time. But his doctors, at least the doctors that are talking to him at Walter Reed where he is thinks that he should do well, should make a recovery from this.",

If you look across the board, I think about a third of people who have had a stroke do suffer some sort of clinical depression, diagnoseable depression, it could be for different reasons. One is it could be directly due to the impact on the brain from the stroke, what a stroke is, is a period of time, when there's a not enough oxygenated blood going to the brain, some brain cells could have died, that could be part of what's causing a stroke, or it could be more of a psychological impact from dealing with abilities that you have lost as a result of the previous stroke.So they could be tied together, it could be that he had previous depression that was then amplified by this.

You know, healthy and vigorous is the term that they use to describe him. They talk about the various medications that he's on, the most notable ones being Eliquis, which is an anticoagulant for his atrial fibrillation.He's also taking crest store for his cholesterol. But, you know, it's a pretty similar readout to what we saw about a year and a half ago. Biggest difference is that he had COVID in the interim. We had heard about the fact that he had COVID. They've described some of the findings at that point, his oxygenation, for example, had not dropped below 97 percent. That was notable. The neurological exam, that's something that the doctors did focus on quite a bit. It's interesting, because what they're talking about is that he seems to have this stiffness of his walking. If you see him walking, they were wondering why his gait has become more stiff. And they, you know, is this something due to Parkinson's disease? Is this something due to some sort of spinal issue? And at least according to the neurological exam, that was documented, he does not seem to have evidence of that. So, you know, those are some of the areas that they focused on specifically. He's had this history of having had brain operations in the past for aneurysms in his brain. That was a long time ago. The afib, the hypercholesterol, the stiffness of gait are sort of the main things that they're focusing on now.",

So they wanted the jury to hear him tell that investigator in that interview where he got his drugs, from Curtis Eddie Smith. As they wrap up their case, they want to make sure that the jury believes that only one man could have done this and that would be Alex Murdaugh, Anderson.",
