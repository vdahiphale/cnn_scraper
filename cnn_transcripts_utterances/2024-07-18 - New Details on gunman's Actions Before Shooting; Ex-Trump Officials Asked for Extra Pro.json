So, there is - because he's looking at the DNC dates, he's looking at the Trump dates, he's - he's - he's sort of searching all around.He then focuses on a relatively close event for him geographically, which is Trump's. So, we know that for - for reasons that might be, you know, psychological, historical for him, cultural, he's isolated, he's looking for a moment to get his headline. What's interesting is, he doesn't care what the headline is. I mean, in other words, his search history now is showing someone who's sort of scrambling for an ideology. And that's what's so, I think, new for this kind of political assassination attempt is, we generally have a motive relatively quickly. They either don't like the candidate, right, so - or they're trying to do something to impress someone, as say the Ronald Reagan assassination attempt. And so I think we're going to learn a lot more. And what we may learn, John, is that we can't put a nice bow around this. That this is something that has so many different motivations that we can't put it into a neat box. He's pro-Trump, he's anti-Trump. That it's a combination of things.",

I normally give institutions the benefit of the doubt because I know that in the heat of the moment it's very easy to judge from afar.Look, one of the reasons why she can't stay is because the conspiracy theories are now so ramping because of her and the Secret Service's sort of fumbling response, they're blaming all sorts of people. What I - what people need to pick up on in the Trump video that you just had, he said four times, how did this happen? And I've been watching and listening to Trump long enough to know exactly what he's doing. He is now feeding this conspiracy theory that the Secret Service purposely left him vulnerable. So, there's two things I would say. We need a leadership change. That should be done. She's going to testify next week. I don't think it's redeemable at this stage. I just - I'm sorry to say that. She is not redeemable. The leadership's not redeemable. Partially because she's now gone to war with everyone. And I'm not sure her story is going to stick. I mean she's - you know, the roof is slanted. Like, we - we don't have drones? Like, I mean, there's - there's 20 minutes between the Secret Service being told and - and - and Trump's getting shot. That's a - that's a long time. The second is, the Secret Service needs to determine whether it really needs all of its mandate. Right now it does two distinct roles. One is, of course, protective services. The other is, is it does financial investigations. That's a legacy because it - a mandate because it came originally from the Treasury secretary. It got moved to the Department of Homeland Security in 2003. And we might consider keeping it as a - as a law enforcement protect services agency only because it has to do that much better than we've seen in the past.",

(COMMERCIAL BREAK) [08:42:03] BERMAN: So, this morning, a marked change in how the president is said to be responding to calls to step aside. Multiple Democratic officials tell CNN, the White House and the Biden campaign are in a new place. President Biden is said to be more receptive. A senior Democratic adviser tells CNN, quote, \"it's still unclear where he's going to land but seems to be listening.\" With us now, CNN's senior political commentator and former Trump campaign adviser, David Urban, and CNN political commentator Paul Begala. And, Paul, I want to come to you first, not as a commentator, but as a bit of a player as the kids say in this whole thing, because I know you've been on the phone with officials for weeks now discussing President Biden's future.

I'm just telling you honestly. Just as a - I'm not advocating a point, I'm just analyzing it. So, the walls are closing in.The most important player her after the president is Nancy Pelosi. You know, it's like that Carrie Underwood song, \"Jesus Take the Wheel.\" I've been saying, Nancy take the wheel. And when Nancy steps in, things happen. But President Biden's the most successful first term president ever. It's because of Nancy Pelosi. Also Chuck Schumer. When - and now Hakeem Jeffries. When they weigh in, he has to listen. It's - it comes down to money, maps and polls. OK, the money has dried up. I can tell you that. I raised money for a lot of super PACs. It has - donors are on strike to the tune of somebody reported 90 million. It's more like 300 million that people are sitting on, saying we're not going to give. The maps are deteriorating so fast that the lieutenant governor of New York says it's now a swing state. People are talking about losing New Jersey, Minnesota.

SEN. JD VANCE (R-OH), VICE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I'm glad that this thing worked out. And I'm glad that I was still able to come to this breakfast because it's so good to be here among people of faith and so many good friends and supporters and people who've just been very good to me over the years. And I can't possibly shout everybody out. I saw, of course, Secretary Carson. I saw Ron Johnson. I saw the great Bernie Moreno, who will be the next United States senator from the state of Ohio. But I thought what I'd do this morning is just talk a little bit about how I think about my faith and my own faith journey just so you understand me a little bit better, and how I think about hopefully, you know, that we can integrate that into a governing agenda that will work for the American people. President Trump is an incredibly unique figure in American politics. Of course, he's the only person to ever come entirely outside the realm of government or military and run for president and do it successfully. And it's just such an honor to be on the ticket with him. It's such an honor to stand with him after what happened last Saturday. I'm sure that you've heard a lot of people say this, but you will never be able to convince me that that last second turn of a head was anything other than a miracle. I absolutely believe that. I was raised, as I mentioned last night, by my mamaw, who despite the fact that she loved the f-word, was a woman of very deep Christian faith. And, you know, she - she - she was in some ways what you might call unchurched. We went to church maybe once or twice a month. Sometimes less. Sometimes more. But she read the Bible every single day. She prayed every single day. She loved to watch Billy Graham whenever he was on the TV. And that was really my introduction to the Christian faith. And one of the things that -",

He expressed openness to a military strike on Iran is his 2000 book. And then more to the point, when he was asked by Howard Stern in late 2002, to about six months before the invasion, explicitly asked, are you for invading Iraq? He said, yes, I guess so. I wish the first time it was done correctly. Now, it is true that after the invasion in 2004, so more than a year after the war started, Trump did emerge as an explicit opponent.
