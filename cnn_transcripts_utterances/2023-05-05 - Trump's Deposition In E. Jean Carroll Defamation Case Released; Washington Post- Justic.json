My character is too good. Let me bring forward dozens of witnesses to tell you about this is not the sort of thing I would never do. He can't do that here. Why? Because that is not his character.

They were cases that were not heard by the court. So -- and they did report their income. I do want to mention, though, Jake, that Stephen Breyer, who did recuse, likely didn't recuse because he had gotten money from a subsidiary of the publishing house. It's because his family had owned some stock in the publisher. So this area is not of the magnitude of other things we've talked about.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) YEVGENY PRIGOZHIN, HEAD OF WAGNER GROUP (translated):  These guys here are Wagner men who died today. The blood is still fresh. Film all of them. NIC ROBERTSON, CNN INTERNATIONAL DIPLOMATIC EDITOR (voice-over): Russia's top mercenary is turning on Moscow again with a vengeance.

ROBERTSON: Wagner boss Yevgeny Prigozhin screaming at President Putin's defense minister and army chief of staff, accusing them of killing his troops in Bakhmut by starving them of ammunition. PRIGOZHIN (through translator):  We are pulling out of Bakhmut. We have only two or so kilometers left to capture out of 45.",

Until last week, he was Russia's deputy defense minister. It hints at a pending Wagner/Kremlin showdown. Ukraine's military spokesman says Bakhmut could be at a turning point if Russia doesn't fix its ammunition supply problem. He also says that Prigozhin cannot afford to continue losing troops at this rate. If he does, the spokesman says, Wagner will be destroyed. Prigozhin, he says, has no option but to pull out. Prigozhin's machinations having no impact on the fighting around the devastated city Friday. Both sides still feeding men into the front lines known as Ukraine's meat grinder. And the fighting not just on the battlefield. In Turkey, a Russian diplomat rips down the Ukrainian flag and is quickly punched at a parliamentary assembly intended to get both sides to agree to an extension to the U.N.-brokered Black Sea grain deal. Russia's diplomats also hitting out at the United States. Deputy foreign minister Sergei Ryabkov announcing the U.S. and Russia are on the verge of open-armed conflict, a further escalation of recent unsubstantiated Kremlin rhetoric claiming the United States directed Ukraine to fly drones over the Kremlin in an attempt to assassinate President Putin, an allegation both Kyiv and Washington categorically deny. (END VIDEOTAPE) ROBERTSON (on camera):  In a new development this evening, Ukrainian officials are saying that Russian-backed administration in the Zaporizhzhia region they control are busing civilians out of a number of towns and villages that are quite close to front lines. The Russian-backed administration say that those towns are taking heavy shelling at the moment. Ukrainian officials say that this looks like what Russia did before their offensive in Kherson, where they shipped a lot of civilians out, many of them children, took them to Russia against their will.",
