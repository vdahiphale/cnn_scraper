      "sentences": "The side by side comparison that Americans desperately need. That's tonight on NewsNight.Good evening. I'm Abby Phillip in New York. Tonight, a date for must see television right here on CNN. June 27th, that is when CNN will host President Biden and former President Trump for the first presidential debate. It is the earliest debate in the election cycle in modern history and it marks an end run, essentially, around the commission that normally sets the terms and the times that these things happen. The debate echoes history. There will be no audience, no opportunity for the crowd to make the venue home field for either Trump or for Biden. And it'll happen inside of CNN's Atlanta studios. It's just the moderators, Jake Tapper and Dana Bash, and the candidates. That's a throwback to 1960 when John F. Kennedy stared down Richard Nixon and his very sweaty lip. This is all what escalated this morning with President Biden daring over on X, going full Dirty Harry, then Trump responding. Then there was an offer and then suddenly a deal. It's a sudden surprise series of events that really I'm not sure anyone could have predicted and it injected adrenaline into this campaign that has been virtually paralyzed by courtroom drama, agita over Israel and it gives Americans a chance, a chance to conduct their own physicals of each man, to take the vitals on the issues that are vital to them. For the incumbent, the why and the why so early, is pretty clear. He wants to remind Americans of their choice, giving them a split screen, and also to avoid incumbent history. 1976, Gerald Ford trailed and Gerald Ford lost. In 1980, Jimmy Carter trailed. Jimmy Carter lost. 1992, George H.W. Bush, the same. 2020, Donald Trump trailed and then he lost. Now, the Biden campaign clearly has reason to do this but there is one Democrat tonight who thinks that the president should stay far, far away from Donald Trump. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA): I myself would never recommend going on the stage with Donald Trump, but the president has decided that's what he wants to do. I think the format he is suggesting is a good one.

Everybody always calls him Mr. Trump. So, we don't know what these two are like when they get there.But here's the thing that's interesting to me. When this debate call went out today, Trump responded, and he immediately agreed to the terms that Biden put on the table. That, to me, is very interesting, because, you know, when I was in my 20s, I worked for Mickey Cantor, who was one of Bill Clinton's debate negotiators. And Mickey Cantor would say very clearly, all of these things go into the mix, and you've got to decide what's best. These are clearly the terms that were best for Joe Biden and Donald Trump agreed to those terms immediately. I'm imagining his campaign, when they got back after he sent that tweet out, they have to now figure out how to make this work for them because right now it's working for Biden.",

The more Joe Biden talks, the better it is for him.And I think that if you're looking at how President Trump got to this place, it will be because of the fact that while Biden keeps trying to tell the American public that everything is working, that the inflation reduction plan was a success, they are feeling the fact that it has not been as successful as he would like them to believe. And so I think, issue by issue, forcing Joe Biden to have to defend that record without having to use the phrase, Donald J. Trump, I think, as he helps President Trump, and if he abides by the rules that Joe Biden asked for and he is unable to get over that very low hurdle, I think you're going to see a continuing of this trend of those voters in those swing states running away from the incumbent, Joseph Robinette Biden.",

What I will say is that it's a smart move, I think, the way that they have organized the witnesses and the way that they have weaved in a lot of the corroborating evidence. Now that Michael Cohen is the last witness, the jury has heard from others. And so when Michael Cohen talks about a particular conversation he might have had with Stormy Daniels or Keith Davidson or David Pecker or the recording, the jury has their testimony in mind so they can see whether or not it matches up. And for a witness, as you just mentioned, who has been convicted of perjury, who has lied under oath, who has a history of not telling the truth, that is essential to be able to use him as a credible witness. PHILLIP: Do you think they've sufficiently proven that Donald Trump directed these records, these business records, to be falsified, which is really at the heart of the charges that he's facing here?",

The fact that they needed to double the amount of money in order to compensate for taxes, income taxes, that Michael Cohen would pay in order to true up the $130,000 that he paid out of his own pocket is also something that's pretty persuasive.But it is clearly the one area that the prosecution is putting together through a certain amount of circumstantial evidence.",

And because he's never been held accountable in both impeachments and in multiple lawsuits and other criminal investigations, he feels like he's invincible. And he's not someone who learns his lesson. He's not someone who says, oh, I just skated past. I better correct my conduct. No, instead, he doubles and triples down. And whatever he has done before, he will do worse. And what he is planning to do if he becomes president of the United States again is the absolute destruction of our democracy as we know it. And I am not exaggerating. So while it may make hypothetical sense to be the big guy, as Mitt Romney said, and to pardon Donald Trump and show that you're bigger than that, this is not political. Joe Biden has had nothing to do with any of this. He's pointed a special counsel immediately after Donald Trump announced he was running for president. The other two cases are outside of the Justice Department. Notwithstanding all these allegations of politicization, there is zero evidence of it.
