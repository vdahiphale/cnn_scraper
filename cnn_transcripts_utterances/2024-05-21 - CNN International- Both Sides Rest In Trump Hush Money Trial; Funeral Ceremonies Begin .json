That's what happened behind closed doors when the jury was cleared from the courtroom, as well as any public that was in the room, and the judge had a talking to with Robert Costello in the middle of his testimony yesterday afternoon.But, really, as the primary defense witness, one of only two witnesses the defense called to present evidence for their case, he did two things. He said yesterday, whenever he was testifying and he was being questioned by Trump's lawyers, he said that Michael Cohen told him back in 2018 that he had nothing on Donald Trump, and Donald Trump didn't know about payments to Stormy Daniels. That was that testimony, essentially calling Michael Cohen a liar. And then, in the cross-examination today by the prosecutors of Robert Costello, he said that there was actually some discussion he was having over email with others about getting Michael Cohen on the same page, as say Donald Trump, Rudy Giuliani, others in the circle that he was working with. He says that he was not pressuring Michael Cohen. But, that point was made over and over again to the jury by the prosecutor questioning him today. So, that's the end of the evidence presentation. This set of evidence, the set of witnesses, 20 on the prosecutor's side, two on the defense, it wasn't just Michael Cohen. There were several other people, Stormy Daniels, David Pecker from the National Enquirer, testifying to Trump's motivations to conceal stories about women that would have been negative and the reason that he may have wanted to keep secret the payments to Stormy Daniels and others during the 2016 election. But, is that enough to convict him? That will be the question, and it's something that we're going to hear the defense talk about quite a lot in their closing summations next week, Rahel, when they argue to the jury, there just isn't enough evidence yet or presented or that anyone has to firmly say beyond a reasonable doubt Donald Trump had criminal intent to hide things in 2016.",

Iran is also observing five days of mourning after the President was killed along with his Foreign Minister and seven others at a helicopter crash. (VIDEO PLAYING) The body of the Iranian President arrived in Tehran with full military honors. Earlier Tuesday, thousands of mourners gathered in the Northwest city of Tabriz, that's not far from the crash site, as the coffins of the dead were carried through the crowds. Following all of this for us in Rome is CNN's Ben Wedeman. Ben, good to see you. Reaction to Raisi's death, of course, has been mixed.

So, it's not a very long list, and that does reflect to a certain extent the lack of friends Iran has outside of Russia, China, North Korea, Syria, and Hezbollah and a few others.But, it certainly doesn't indicate that a lot of heads of state are going to be going to Tehran to attend this funeral. And of course, this funeral will be followed on Thursday with the actual burial of Ebrahim Raisi in Mashhad, which is in northeast Iran, which, of course, is where he was born. Rahel.",

He was seen as perhaps the most ultra-conservative of the clerics who have been held this position as President of Iran. Within Iran itself, of course, what we're getting in terms of what we're seeing on state media is an outpouring of grief from the masses. But, the fact of the matter is, we know that many people were not great admirers of Raisi, that there were instances that appeared on social media from inside Iran of people actually celebrating his passing.And in fact, I can tell you, having attended the funerals of other Middle Eastern autocrats, that oftentimes when you show up to a crowd of people in the capital where they're mourning, you lift the camera and people will cry and wail and sing praises for the dear departed leader. And when you put down the camera, people tend to light up cigarettes and go back to chatting among themselves. Rahel.",

In the case of Vladimir Putin last year, it took the ICC's pretrial chamber about a month before -- between the time when the top prosecutor requested these warrants and when they were issued. But, once and if indeed they are issued, this could pose problems for the Israeli Prime Minister and his Defense Minister, Yoav Gallant, to travel to some of the 124 member states of the ICC. These are the countries that are parties to the Rome Statute which established the International Criminal Court.And we have already seen that the Russian President, Vladimir Putin, canceled the trip to South Africa over the past year for example, and that appeared to be over concerns that South Africa, as a party to the Rome Statute, would be under an obligation to execute that warrant and to arrest the Russian President. So, that is very much the scenario that the Israeli Prime Minister and the Israeli Defense Minister could find themselves, and the United States, notably, is not a party to that Rome statute. And so, it wouldn't necessarily limit those leaders' travel to the U.S., but it could limit their travel to several key European countries, for example. But, what is clear is that these warrants are certainly not having an impact on Israeli decision making, at least not yet. So far, what we've seen from the Israeli Prime Minister, his allies, as well as his rivals in Israeli politics is a lot of outrage and a lot of defiance, vowing not to change course in the war in Gaza, to continue to prosecute that war up until Israel achieves its goals of destroying Hamas.

Officials with humanitarian agencies say that there appear to be numerous challenges to getting that pier up and running in the fashion the U.S. military officials said that they hope to. They had hoped to get some 90 aid trucks per day in this first phase of the launch of this floating pier and ramping that up ultimately to about 150 trucks per day. But, today, there were just 14 trucks that managed to go across the causeway from that pier to land where the World Food Programme is that in charge of offloading the supplies and then distributing it. That is apparently due to security and logistics concerns related to that pier.And we're seeing security concerns and the expansion of Israeli military activities in southern and northern Gaza also impacting the flow of aid in several other parts of the strip. The Rafah border crossing remains closed more than two weeks after the Israeli military captured that crossing. [11:15:00] It is still closed today. And the Kerem Shalom crossing, which is also in southern Gaza, just a few kilometers away from the Rafah crossing, it is open in theory. But, UN officials have said that in practice, it is very difficult to actually get the aid from that crossing due to the ongoing fighting there between Israel and Hamas. So, the bottom line, according to humanitarian aid officials, is that not enough aid, not enough fuel, which helps power the hospitals in Gaza and also the trucks that are able to distribute the aid, there is simply not enough for what the situation in Gaza currently merits. So, there are calls from aid agencies, in particular the United Nations, for Israel to allow more crossings, more aid to go in and better conditions for that aid to enter.",

In addition, for people who were not taken to the hospital, they were actually treated on the tarmac, and you can see people were lying on stretchers, getting checked out just to make sure that they were OK.We understand that Boeing is in touch with authorities with Singapore Airlines about this case. The 777 is a very big plane. It can carry close to 300 people. This particular flight had 211 passengers, 18 crew members, has a very good safety record, Rahel.

      "sentences": "Wow. Just frightening. Those photos really speak volumes. Marc Stewart in Beijing. Marc, thank you.Let's take a big dig a bit deeper into this with CNN Aviation Analyst Miles O'Brien. Miles, let me first just ask your perspective, I'm not sure if you saw the monitor and saw those photos of the foods sort of flown around the plane there. It looked like a really scary situation. Your reaction. MILES O'BRIEN, CNN AVIATION ANALYST: I did see those pictures, Rahel, and it's quite dramatic. And a reminder that as we're hurtling along in the atmosphere, 12,000 meters above the surface, 10 percent -- within 10 percent of the speed of sound, that there is a lot of dynamic forces at play. We sort of sometimes think we're cruising along in our living room watching a movie. But, you have to remember that this can go sideways very quickly. And as you point out, clear air turbulence is something we do not know how to predict very well. Weather forecasting does not give us a good idea of when this is going to happen. And there is nothing on board an aircraft that can easily identify it for the pilots. SOLOMON: Well, contextualize that for me a bit more, Miles. I mean, certainly, anyone who travels any bit knows that turbulence is pretty common, but certainly not turbulence like this, certainly not turbulence that causes the death of a passenger and serious injuries presumably for these folks. How rare or common is this, from your perspective? O'BRIEN: It's becoming more common, and there appears to be a climate change link. As the planet warms, it warms in an uneven manner, both north and south and also at altitudes. And what that creates is, among these rivers of air, we call jet streams, it creates what's called wind shear, which means sudden changes in the direction of wind at any given altitude, and this is where the real clear air turbulence problems happen. That incidents of severe turbulence because of clear air turbulence is up 55 percent over the North Atlantic over the past 10 years. So, there appears to be a climate factor in all of this. On top of that, you've got many more people flying. And sadly, when people are sitting in their seats, they neglect to buckle their seatbelts. And I just hope everybody walking away from this realizes that if you had had your seatbelt buckled, you would have walked away from this.",

But, what about answering that the question of, well, did the aircraft withstand this turbulence as it was designed to? O'BRIENI don't think we have a fundamental problem with the 777. But, in the world of aviation, you've got to look at everything. And if on the ground they find some sort of flaw here in the way it was designed, we'll hear about it. But, I think what we have here is any aircraft flying into a situation of severe turbulence like that is going to have an upset, and it's up to us, as passengers, to be vigilant and stay buckled in.

You had planes that actually had damage from bullets as they're trying to leave the country. And so, that is why the airport was shut down. This was not safe to fly in or out. Officials did not have control of this vital lifeline in and out of Port-au-Prince. And so, up until now, diplomats leaving the country had to leave by helicopter, sometimes in the middle of the night, as U.S. embassy officials have done or have taken the dangerous drive to other parts of Haiti to fly out from there.So, this is certainly a good sign. Haitian officials tell us that the U.S. military was able to bring in some equipment -- communications equipment that will help with the preparations to bring in Kenyan soldiers, about 1,000 Kenyan soldiers that are expected to come in in the coming days or weeks, have long last to begin to take control of the security situation. That will be a very hard thing to do, because the gangs, not only control most of Port-au-Prince, most of Haiti, but they are just outnumbered, outgunned. The police force that is on the ground at the moment. So, while it is a positive step that people who've been trapped in Haiti now for nearly three months, have been able to evacuate and help will be able to come in. You're only talking about a handful of flights really every day. Secretary of State Antony Blinken just moments ago saying that Haiti is on the verge of becoming an all-out failed state.

It actually is quite a technical and detailed discussion that the lawyers have with the judge. It could get very dense. It is the discussion of arguments where the sides, the prosecutors and the defense, are working out the nitty-gritty of exactly how the judge can explain the case and the charges to the jury what they must find, what the DA's office needed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt to obtain a conviction, how the law is defined in these business falsification charges.

Among those appearing virtually is Rudy Giuliani, the former Trump attorney, former New York Mayor, and someone that the Attorney General's Office here in the state of Arizona said they had been trying to serve notice of what's happening today, which is the arraignment for three weeks.Now, agents had been sent to New York because they saw the former mayor livestreaming his program from New York, and then they saw that he was doing the same in Florida. So, those agents went to Florida. They tracked him to a particular address because they saw that he was livestreaming from that address. What those agents didn't know is that it was Giuliani's 80th birthday this past weekend and that was a party to celebrate it. He even was celebrating with a cake during that livestream. He was singing on the front lawn, New York, New York. Well, after he finished singing that song and he was heading home because the party was over, that's when the Attorney General's Office agents served him notice.",

That's linked to some one-time deals that allowed the company to go public earlier this year. The company generated less than $1 million in revenue. Former President Donald Trump owns a majority of the company.Well, from endless shrimp to bankruptcy filings, it's the latest development for the popular Red Lobster chain. The restaurants abruptly announced the closure of 100 locations prior to filing for bankruptcy. On Monday, that filing listed a timeline of what led to this point. Reasons included, lack of competition over shrimp wholesale prices, upper management issues and apparently not enough table turnover due to the endless shrimp promotion. Oh no, blame it on the shrimp. CNN Business Reporter Nathaniel Meyersohn here with all of the details. So, Nathaniel, we got through some of the reasons there. Walk us through how Red Lobster got here.",

      "sentences": "So, Rahel, this is quite a tale and a fall for the -- it's actually -- Red Lobster is the largest seafood restaurant chain in the world, and it really was a pioneer of casual dining in America. Let's go back to 2020. In 2020, Thai Union, which is a large seafood supplier, in 2020, Thai Union became the controlling shareholder, the largest shareholder of Red Lobster, and their claims that Thai Union really lacked expertise in the U.S. restaurant industry didn't know how to run a restaurant chain like Red Lobster. So, it really was focused on cost cutting, and so mismanagement really hurt Red Lobster.Then last year, you have the endless shrimp deal under Thai union. So, last year, Red Lobster did $20 endless shrimp. They made it a everyday promotion. And this just turned into a disaster for Red Lobster, and their claims that the Thai Union was really more focused on selling shrimp through Red Lobster than managing the business. So, that's kind of a point of contention right now. What was Thai Union's goal with this endless shrimp deal? Was it in the best interest of Red Lobster? And then, you also have to look at inflation. Inflation certainly played a role here, squeezing people's budgets. They're not going out to eat at casual dining restaurants as much. So, kind of a list of issues here. But, it really goes back to this 2020 deal from Thai Union.",

I mean, you think at one point it was quite popular, even more popular because of a certain pop star, Beyonce, who talked about Red Lobster. Everyone loved Red Lobster. But -- so, what happens now? I mean, what happens next? I mean, bankruptcy doesn't necessarily mean I'm completely closing all of your doors, or does it? What does it mean here?",

But, look, I think, Rahel, that shows kind of the popularity and the interest that people still do have for this brand, this kind of beloved brand. That really is the symbol of seafood in America. So, Red Lobster has closed some stores. They still have about 550 locations left. But, it doesn't mean that Red Lobster is going to disappear for good. Several -- there are lots of companies that will downsize during bankruptcy and still can emerge as a strong restaurant chain.So, I think what we'll see is Red Lobster will close more restaurants, maybe, 100 more restaurants or so, and it will operate its best and most profitable restaurants, and maybe it'll get new menus and some investment.

Nathaniel Meyersohn, good to have you today. Thanks, Nathaniel.All right. Let's take a live look at the U.S. stock market and see how things are shaping up on. Green across the board. The Dow, the NASDAQ, and the S&amp;P, all up, although muted fractionally, the Dow, the most among them, about one tenth of a percent. Things though, as I said, pretty muted, pretty flat after one Federal Reserve governor said that he wants to see several more months of cooling inflation data before cutting interest rates. Now, remember, we did get one inflation report that showed that but that was just one. Fed Chair Jay Powell also reiterating that stance from Jay Powell that rate hikes are likely off the table. So, a little bit of good news there. The rate hikes are off the table, but more inflation data is necessary. OK. Social media can be helpful in finding travel tips or new spots to visit, but it's also creating problems for places near some of those destinations. The latest of struggles is a small Japanese town with a view of Mount Fuji. Our Hanako Montgomery explains what some residents are doing. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) HANAKO MONTGOMERY, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): This view, once the perfect snapshot of Japan's old and new, now has a black curtain drawn. Overwhelmed by tourists blocking roads, littering, even trespassing onto private property to take selfies, the town of Fujikawaguchiko has now erected a black curtain to block the view and deter tourists, much to the locals' relief -- UNIDENTIFIED MALE (Interpreted): There have been many accidents involving foreign tourists recently.

Well, Kamakura, a seaside town just outside of Tokyo, is urging tourists to walk around instead of taking the train to ease congestion. Struggling to accommodate an unprecedented surge of inbound visitors, many encouraged by a weak yen, local tourist spots have resorted to taking matters into their own hands, even if it means curtains for an Instagram hotspot.
