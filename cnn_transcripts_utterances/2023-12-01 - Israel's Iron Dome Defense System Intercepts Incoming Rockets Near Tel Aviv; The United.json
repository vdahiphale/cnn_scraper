Israel's Iron Dome defense system is intercepting incoming rockets near Tel Aviv, just hours after the seven-day truce between Hamas and Israel came to an end. And in Gaza, explosions could be heard as Israel resumed combat operations earlier, saying that it struck over 200 targets this morning alone. Hamas says Israel refused all offers to extend the pause, a claim Israel dismisses as pure propaganda. Israel says that it is Hamas that violated the terms of the deal. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

But when you have these large explosions, which comes from these very large bombs when they're attempting to hit and destroy tunnels that are sometimes 50 to 100 feet under the ground, it makes a large crater. I mean, that's just the fact of kinetics and the operations. But I think what we're going to see Israel do, they've learned a lot from the first phase, the first six weeks of the operation. And unlike what they did in the past in terms of basically steamrolling the entire Gaza City, when they go into Kani Banyanis or into Rassafah later on, you're going to see them probably try and push the non-combatants, the Palestinian citizens, to certain areas of the town that don't correspond to where they have intelligence on Hamas operating. You know, it's going to be very difficult though, because Hamas purposely uses parts of cities and types of infrastructures to cover their movement. And Hamas wants to see the kinds of casualties that occurred in the first six weeks of the Israeli campaign because that brings more ire onto the Israeli army. That's part of their combat plan. Hamas wants to embarrass and have the world rise up against Israel. So, whatever Israel does in terms of attempting to move citizens around or attempting to be more precise and go slower in their operations, there are still going to be collateral effects and civilians are going to be injured and killed.",

I inappropriately use the word soldiers, thousands of terrorists. And these individuals have moved during the pause in the operations. They've maneuvered to different parts of the battlefield. They've taken hostages more than likely and bodies of hostages to those different parts of the battlefield. And as Israel attempts to expand their operation, it's just going to be increasingly difficult to go through these, what's expected to be 300 miles of tunnels, and some of them are 50 feet underground, some of them are 200 feet underground.

Because during that time, they can conduct maneuver. They can move around. They can strengthen their defenses. They can set up new positions. They can establish ambushes and sniper positions. All of those things weigh in the advantage of the defender, Hamas. For the Israeli force, it's a reduction in their momentum. They were starting to roll. They were killing and generating more intelligence from their killing of Hamas forces. And so -- and as you said, they had to reduce. They didn't completely eliminate their intelligence collection, but they did reduce it quite a bit. So, during that period, it's much tougher for the Israeli force to connect some dots. But at the same time, you have hostages coming out. And I would suggest the Israeli Defense Force probably has gained an awful lot of intelligence from those hostages. The only problem there is you have to weigh, you know, the military asking questions versus the psychiatrists asking questions of those recently released, because they are in a very traumatic state. And they will give some information, like where they were held, how much they were moved, how many soldiers -- how many terrorists were around them, what kind of food were they eating, what were the conditions? All of those will contribute to the Israeli potential for continuing the offensive. But it seems like through the entire truce or the pause, the Israeli forces have been chomping at the bit. They wanted to go back into action and destroy these thousands of terrorists that are threatening their citizens.",

Obviously, the UAE isstinging a bit from the criticism that a petro state is even hosting a climate change conference, given their sort of conflict of interests, especially with the CEO of the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company running the show here, as well. But this really stands in sharp contrast to the early pledges from other Western countries, including the United States, which donated about $17.5 million dollars into a lost and damaged fund. If you look at this $30 billion pledge, you break it down. Only $5 billion of it is going to developing countries that really need to adapt to the changes and brace for what's coming. Twenty-five billion of it will go into general climate investment around the world. You can see there some of the pledges so far. The U.K. kicking in $75 million, Japan $10 million, Australia -- I think was around $15 million or so. So, some Pacific Islanders and people from countries that are much more vulnerable and developing look at those pledges and say, we need hundreds of billions of dollars to mitigate the problem, at least according to U.N. scientists. Speaking of pledges, we saw a rather admirable one in the meeting just a few weeks ago between President Biden and President Xi in California, but it is notable that neither world leader, the world's largest carbon emitters, are not present at this summit.

A lot of trucks are making this journey here. On our way in, we saw several miles of trucks filled with aid waiting to get to this point. One driver tells us he has been waiting for nine days just to get this point. After they cross over from Egypt into Gaza, they have to go to Nizanah, where Israeli officials verify what's in these trucks, and the drivers tell us that can take up to three days. There's several hundreds of trucks waiting for that process before they can offload their cargo to aid trucks to distribute them across the enclave. So, the process between this section of the Rafah crossing in Egypt into the crossing into Gaza can be a while. We see ambulances coming in. Egyptian officials tell us, several hundred injured. Almost 400 have come in here since late October to bring in the injured from Gaza, to be treated at Egyptian hospitals. And some family members have been going back, as well. This is part of the crucial part of the deal, to release more hostages from Hamas. If aid can come in, the deal included 200 trucks that can come in every day. U.S. officials estimate that about 240 have been coning in every day, bringing food and water and medical supplies, emergency relief items, as well as shelter as the rainy season comes in Gaza, which often leads to some flooding, some displacement, as well. But this has been the crucial corridor for aid into Gaza, and there has to be a way to make that happen. Even if the truce is not extended, this has got to be a way to make sure there's more aid coming into Gaza. Egyptian officials tell CNN that this crossing has been open 24-7 since October 7th. But obviously, that is only technically because aid cannot just go through here into Gaza. It's going to go through Israeli checkpoint and that slows things down considerably.

So, that was the cardinal sin. And it's not just the last year, it's over two years. The former head of Mossad, Yossi Cohen, flew to Qatar and came back with money. Qatari envoys were driving to the Gaza, to the crossing points between Israel and Gaza, and bringing suitcases filled with dollars and money. So, the plan was at the government level.

The vote was 311 to114, meeting the two-thirds majority required for such an expulsion. One hundred and five Republicans, members of George Santos' own party, voted to expel him. Now, all this stems from a scathing report from the House Ethics Committee accusing Santos of using campaign funds for his personal purposes. This makes George Santos only the sixth lawmaker to be ousted from the House. He told CNN after the vote the House set a dangerous precedent. Let's get the very latest on the Santos saga which is over, it appears. We're joined now by Annie Grayer in Washington. Andy, there was some doubt as to whether this would even happen going into the vote. Walk us through the chain of events that happens now.",

He told me, quote, to hell with this place as he left the House floor and got into his car. So, we are not expecting to see Santos at the Capitol again, which has a huge impact on Republicans' very narrow majority in the House. They only had four seats the margin before, and now that goes down by one. But it was really up in the air until the final moments, Bianna. I mean, this morning, when House Republican leadership, including Speaker Mike Johnson, came out against expelling George Santos, there was question if the momentum was tipping in the direction that would keep him in Congress. But then the votes started coming in. And it was overwhelming to expel Santos. And that's, you know, that's where we are now.",
