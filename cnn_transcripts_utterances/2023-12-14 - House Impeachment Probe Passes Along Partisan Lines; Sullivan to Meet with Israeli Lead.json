Republicans voted along party lines unanimously to formally approve the probe, with zero support from Democrats. They denounced the investigation as a political stunt, a stun ordered by Donald Trump for revenge. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. JAMIE RASKIN (D-MD): After 11 months of this, no one can tell us what President's -- President Biden's crime was. REP. JIM MCGOVERN (D-MA): They know their whole impeachment inquiry is a sham, and it will evaporate into thin air when people realize what a pathetic joke it is. REP.

The U.S. -- Jake Sullivan in -- as part of these extremely serious conversations as they're calling it, he's expected to press the most senior levels, senior ministers in the Israeli government. So the prime minister, the defense minister, the war cabinet, on their efforts around civilian casualties. He wants to emphasize that the U.S. really wants to see them being more surgical, more precise when it comes to targeting Gaza, in order to minimize the number of civilian casualties. But guys, of course, this is something that the U.S. has pushed for for a very long time. We continue to see those civilian casualties mounting in a very significant way. At the same time, Sullivan is also expected to pressure the Israeli government on getting more aid into Gaza. Sullivan himself has been very vocal, specifically about the Kerem Shalom crossing, where I was the other day. That they want to see that crossing used for aid to go directly into Gaza. Right now, as you guys know, it's going in through the Rafah crossing in Egypt. And these meetings -- very, very important meetings as Israel continues with this high-intensity phase of the war -- comes after those very stark, pointed comments by President Joe Biden in which he said that Netanyahu needs to change tack in this war. He criticized the right-wing government for wanting retribution against Palestinians, for fully rejecting a two-state solution, and remarkably, Erica and Phil, the president saying that Israel is carrying out indiscriminate bombing in the Gaza Strip.",

And they want the same standards applied to the other side. And so this is really popular among Republican voters. It's not one of the driving forces, but they want to see their -- the Republican leadership fight back, so to speak. Now, does that mean that there is evidence? Does it mean it's the right thing to do? No. But this is absolutely something that is very popular among, especially those Trump supporters who feel like there's this unfair way of treating the different --",

And that's not really what the founders had in mind about impeachment. I mean, this was supposed to be a truly rare event. You know, we went a long, long way, you know, from getting to impeach -- one impeachment in the 1800s, up until -- until Bill Clinton, and now where are we? I think what's really driving this, in the end, is that Donald Trump was outraged that he was twice impeached and basically just demanded, I want an impeachment of Biden. He didn't really care about what the impeachment was over. So we've got a set of -- an impeachment inquiry in search of some -- some evidence and charges.",
