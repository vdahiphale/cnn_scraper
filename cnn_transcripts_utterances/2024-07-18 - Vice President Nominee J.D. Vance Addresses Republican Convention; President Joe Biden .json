With the apparent change in tune comes as more Democratic lawmakers call on President Biden to exit the race. On Wednesday, perhaps the biggest name so far, Adam Schiff, the representative from California, who's now running for the U.S. Senate became the 20th congressional Democrat to publicly make that call. There's also reporting from ABC News that the Senate's top Democrat Chuck Schumer has advised the president he should drop out. Schumer spokesperson called that idle speculation and it appears a driving force behind the movement to convince Biden to step aside is former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi as CNN's MJ Lee reports.

Vance strongly suggested that Donald Trump oppose the 2003 invasion of Iraq that Joe Biden supported. In reality, Trump expressed at least tentative support for that invasion before it happened. When Trump was asked by radio host Howard Stern, six months before the war, whether he was for invasion, he said, \"Yes, I guess so. I wish the first time it was done correctly.\" And then two months before the invasion, Trump said on T.V. that then President Bush a direct quote, has either got to do something or not do something perhaps but that's woefully (ph) sure, but it's not the words of an opponent of the invasion. Now, Trump did become an opponent of the war explicitly in 2004. But Vance's suggestion that Trump was on the opposite side of Biden on the question of starting the war of the invasion. And that's not true. There were other false or misleading claims as well. A former Trump adviser Peter Navarro falsely claimed that special counsel Jack Smith prosecuted him, Smith did not. Florida Congressman Mike Waltz blasted Biden for allegedly being focused on building electric military tanks. That's fiction. Biden has made no push for electric tanks, though the U.S. Army is moving toward some other kinds of electric vehicles. Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich claim no U.S. soldier was killed in Afghanistan in the nearly two year period. Under Trump, there was not a single two year period under Trump where no U.S. troops were killed in Afghanistan. Various other speakers depicted a country with rampant crime, rampant violence that didn't acknowledge that violent crime in the U.S. today is lower than it was in Trump's last year in office. Conservative commentator Kimberly Guilfoyle, a Donald Trump Jr.'s fiance declare that Trump handed Biden a booming economy. You might remember what things were like in January 2021 when Biden was sworn in, the unemployment rate was 6.4 percent. [02:15:06] And similarly, Republican National Committee Chairman Michael Whatley claimed the economy was stronger four years ago than it is today. There's just no reasonable basis for that claim. Four years ago, amid the pandemic, of course, there was 11 percent unemployment, nearly triple the current rate, the economy had just contracted shrunk by an all-time record for a quarter, an annual rate of more than 30 percent.

Well, I am sure that's going to be top of discussion as European leaders gather in the United Kingdom to meet with the new prime minister there. I don't think European capitals have ever dealt with a vice president who claims he comes descending from Hillbilly Royalty. And let's not forget, he is calling his future potential boss, cultural heroin, noxious, and things like that.But what we do know is that we can surmise, I think is that Mr. Vance will be the kind of pit-bull for Mr. Trump. He will try to shakedown countries like Ukraine, as Trump did earlier on. He will try to extract more spending for NATO from European capitals. And as those clips indicated, that you played, they'll try to shift attention I think from the Ukraine war to a little bit more to Israel, but especially to Taiwan and China. Now, let's not forget, I mean, the way Trump treated Ukraine when he was president was really obnoxious and terrible. He tried to compromise Mr. Zelenskyy, let's not forget, trying to get dirt on his opponent in exchange for aid to Ukraine. And the other thing we know very well from Mr. Trump's statement I mean says that he is going to claim that he can solve the Ukraine war even before inauguration day. And what we know from statements from Hungary's Mr. Orban is that, that will involve inviting Russia to the table. It will probably involve territorial concessions on behalf of Ukraine. It will mean stopping aid at Ukraine and a number of other issues that will not be in favor of Kyiv.",

Well, I think we saw this in the lead up to that NATO Summit in Washington, D.C., where leaders were working to their credit -- to their credit, very quickly, running against the clock to Trump-proof or future-proof aid to Ukraine. So that means for instance, setting aside tens of billions of dollars in aid that is not reliant on the United States or U.S. taxpayer that much.Also finally, getting what Ukraine needs in terms of advanced weaponry, those F-16s, more Patriot air defense systems, and also talk now of giving Ukraine the ability to strike further inside Russia. However, that is not enough for Ukraine to win this war. NATO has done things, for example, European leaders setting aside more weaponry, but also sending a senior NATO official to Kyiv, integrating Ukraine's system better with NATO. But things as you know, Rosemary, are very, very bad in Ukraine right now, not only on the frontline, but Ukrainian cities being struck relentlessly.

Several Republican lawmakers are now calling for the secret service director to resign.New video obtained by our affiliate WTAE shows someone resembling the shooter right outside the very building he would later climb to try to kill the former president. And that video was taken about an hour before the incident. Law enforcement tells CNN, the shooters phone contain photos of U.S. President Joe Biden, Donald Trump, as well as other officials and political figures, and sources in that secret service briefings say the gunman visited the rally site at least twice after the event was announced. Special Counsel Jack Smith is appealing the U.S. district court's decision to throw out the classified documents indictment against Donald Trump. Judge Aileen Cannon ruled Smith's appointment as special counsel was unconstitutional, warranting a dismissal of the case against Trump. The case will now be reviewed by judges from the Eleventh Circuit court of appeals. Our Kaitlan Collins spoke about it earlier with a key member of Trump's legal team. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",
