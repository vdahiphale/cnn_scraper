      "sentences": "Hello, Lynda. We know according to the U.N.'s humanitarian office that tens of thousands in northern Gaza have evacuated. We saw videos coming in. People gathering whatever belongings they could.Some telling us on the ground they're walking miles and miles on foot trying to make it somewhere safe. As you mentioned, there's an estimated 1.1 million people in northern Gaza. Not all of them will be able to leave. Some physically unable to leave and get to safety. Of course there are many hospitals in northern Gaza. That has struck real concern, of course, as we have seen last week, there has been continued airstrikes across Gaza. Not just in the north but very much so in the south. So for many now, evacuating to southern Gaza, there are questions around what they are evacuating to, whether there's infrastructure there to take care of them, to offer them shelter. The short answer is there isn't. We've heard from the U.N.'s Refugee Agency for Palestine, which runs a number of schools that have been offering shelter there in southern Gaza. They say they are at capacity. Of course, as we know, Gaza is under a complete siege now. No food, water, no electricity. And of course, as we have seen people fleeing, those airstrikes have continued. We have some distressing details, a statement from the Palestine health ministry in Gaza, which said yesterday that civilians had been struck while attempting to flee, including three ambulances. We have got video of this from the health ministry in Gaza. A warning to our viewers: it is distressing and graphic. Take a look. (VIDEO CLIP)",

Of course, it has been under a complete blockade and has been since 2007.That's the equivalent of the total number of bombs dropped and airstrikes carried out by Israel in the 2014 Gaza war, which of course, lasted 50 days.

This is a huge concern, of course, as the death toll continues to mount, as we continue to see civilians being pushed toward the south of Gaza. The infrastructure in Gaza before this war began was already crumbling. As we know, Gaza has been under a blockade since 2007 with limited movement, 80 percent of the population living in poverty. As you mentioned there. Almost half on the population are children.

Of course, they're also moving civilians out of the northern part of Gaza into the southern part. So what they're trying to do is, in essence, clear the city of as many people as possible. Then they plan to go in and try to rid the Gaza City area, at least, of Hamas fighters. If they can do that, they will effectively have broken the back of that organization. Now there's some question as to whether or not that will be possible. But that is at least the goal. There will be a lot of challenges when they do that.",

If there were peacekeepers or some kind of U.N. cease-fire or something like that, it would be a completely different issue.But first of all, it's early in this conflict. And neither side is willing to accept a cease-fire at this particular point in time. So the poor civilians are caught in the middle of all of this. What they're going to have to do, if they want to avoid what's happening in the north, they will have to move to the southern part of Gaza, near the Rafah crossing that goes into Egypt. Egypt, like you said has not opened the border to them, at least not yet. They have a lot of reasons for not doing so. But the humanitarian idea would certainly be to protect as many people as possible. And that would call for there being an opening in that border and a camp set up. But nobody has set up camps. There's no sanitation available for anyone that would come this way. That will further stress any social services available and utilities and the infrastructure we've gotten used to.

If it can do that, it will have achieved at least one of its goals to some extent. And that, I think, is what we'll see going forward.

Of course, Hamas also established a pattern in which they have conducted training like this for a very long time. So people got used to watching this kind of activity and thought it was routine and that they would never actually operationalize it.

I couldn't even tell what direction the shooting was coming from. I honestly couldn't tell if I was running in the direction of the shooting or away from it. One of my friends told me there was an incident, where we almost went to hide in a ditch. And in split second he yelled at us and said, don't go in the ditch. Just keep running.
