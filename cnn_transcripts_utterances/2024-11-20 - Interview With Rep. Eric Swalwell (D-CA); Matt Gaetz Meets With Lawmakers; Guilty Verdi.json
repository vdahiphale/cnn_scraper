We're literally listening to some of her former roommates give emotional testimony. When this wraps up, we expect the judge will announce Ibarra's sentence. He is an undocumented Venezuelan immigrant who showed no strong reaction as a judge announced the verdict earlier today. He was found guilty on all 10 counts, including malice murder, felony murder, and aggravated assault.",

And so you can only imagine what the pain is going through the family members and her friends who are in that room. Everyone there was speaking about her immense faith and they talked about her relationship with God. In fact, she wrote a letter to her future husband just a few months before she was murdered and talked about how she was working on being a better person and getting closer to God to put that in the center of life. When you put this all together -- and you see the camera now focusing on Jose Ibarra. He's shown very little emotion. A lot of time, when the family members have been talking, he has been staring down at that table in front of him. The father of Laken Riley, he was in there, and he was shaking so hard while he was speaking. You could only imagine the emotion and the pain that he was going through. But Laken Riley's mother was also just talking about her life has changed forever. Her best friend was taken away from her. To get you back to how this all started, back in February of last year, she went for a run. And she did that all the time. In fact, some of these young ladies were her running partners. And as she was running, she was attacked. The prosecution believes Jose Ibarra was the man who attacked her. And she fought for her life. But the prosecution also made the point that Jose Ibarra used a rock like a hammer and slammed into her head several different times, fracturing her skull, then dragged her off that trail, and then tried to sexually assault her. They found her partially clothed. The DNA evidence led them to this location. Then, on top of all that, they had video surveillance to show how he tried to hide different pieces of what was taken from that area. They even talked about gloves that were cheap, that were torn that they were able to pull evidence from. And a hat that he had that had DNA evidence on. The prosecution case was very solid. We heard a 911 tape that lasted more than a minute where you could hear the pounding of that rock. And it was very hard to listen to. At the same time, the defense really had not much to offer in terms of defense for Jose Ibarra. We never figured out a motive. And, today, the defense even tried to throw Jose Ibarra's brother under the bus, basically saying maybe he was involved in this case, but that didn't really stand. The judge in this case, there was no trial, there was no jury there,so he basically was able to say he found him guilty in all 10 counts. But, honestly, the victim impact statements have been gut-wrenching to listen to, the pain in this community. Laken Riley's sister got into Georgia. And now she walks around and she says she's in fear all the time as she walks on the campus that she was so proud to get into. You can only imagine what this family has been through -- guys.",

I immediately text her\"Just minutes after 2:17 p.m., a campus e-mail came out confirming my worst nightmare. Laken had been found unconscious and not breathing, Laken, the girl I met in middle school and became best friends with our freshman year of high school, the girl I couldn't imagine being far away from when it came time for college. So we both decided to attend the University of Georgia together, the girl who stuck by me and got me through some of my toughest times in life, as well as accompanied me during some of my best. \"The loss of her is something I will never be able to come to terms with. I will never be able to come to terms with the fact that I was sitting in class just down the road going about my day the morning this horrific event was taking place. I will never not think about the last time I saw her, the pink sweatshirt she was wearing, and the last words she ever said to me. \"I will never not think about all the things I would have said had I known it would be my last time seeing her and talking to her. Myself, everyone up here and the world has lost such a special person. Laken was intelligent, patient, loyal, driven, and kind. Her pureness and love for the lord were evident and shined through her in a way unlike anyone I have ever met before. \"She is in a better place, but it is not fair that the rest of us still here on Earth have to suffer because of this individual's actions. Because of this individual, some of my happiest days, such as the day I get married and have kids, will be forever accompanied by a feeling of grief, a sadness that Laken will not be there with me to experience them. \"Because of this individual, I have so many fun memories, but no one here to share them with. Because of this individual, I will be searching for the rest of my life for a friendship like the one I shared with Laken, but I know I will never find one, because ours was simply unreplicable. \"I am here today to support Laken. I hope to provide only a fraction of the support she continuously gave me during her time here on Earth. I miss her desperately and long for the day I get to see her again. Since February 22 of 2024, I will forever be changed.\"",

There are various factors that are taken into consideration at sentencing. And that includes the victim impact statements here, where Ibarra has been convicted of all 10 counts, two of which include felony murder and malice murder. The question is, is it going to be life without the possibility of parole or is it going to be life with the possibility of parole? That's what the judge is now going to make a determination. And, certainly, those victim impact statements can be something that he takes into account when he weighs the various factors as to sentencing. In addition to that, statutorily, victims do have the ability to speak in these sentencing proceedings in the state of Georgia and in most states across the country, giving the victims the ability to say their piece in the courtroom when someone is found guilty and sentencing is the next step. So there are multi -- there are various reasons for it, but it certainly could be a part of the sentencing determination. SANCHEZ:  Misty, just reading through some of these charges that Ibarra has been found guilty of, malice murder, felony murder, obstruction of a 911 call, felony tampering with evidence, along with being a Peeping Tom. I'm struck by the fact that the prosecution did not seek the death penalty in this case. Why do you imagine that is?",

      "sentences": "Yes, so the prosecution early on had filed a motion, because if the death penalty is being sought, the prosecution has to alert the parties in a pretrial filing.But months and months ago, before this case came to trial, they filed a submission that said the highest penalty they will be seeking is life without the possibility of parole. So they essentially took the death penalty off the table, which was a decision that was criticized by some because, in Georgia, as in most states, in order to seek the death penalty, there has to be what's called an aggravating factor. And an aggravating factor is set forth in the statute. So it could be a particularly heinous crime. It could be a heinous -- a particularly heinous crime while committing an underlying felony. And all of that, the pieces of that are all here in this case. It is prosecutorial discretion, which way to go, but there could be some reasons not to. And that really relates to the fact that, once death penalty is on the table, there is a heightened burden. There's more to the case than just the guilt phase. The penalty phase is also like a whole second trial. Given that prosecutors haven't sought the death penalty in recent years on other cases, it seems and it's likely that that was part of the analysis to move forward with just life without the possibility of parole and hopefully get a conviction without complicating it with going that next step and proving those aggravating factors.",

The House Ethics Committee is meeting behind closed doors, and they're discussing whether to release a potentially damaging report on its probe of alleged misconduct against Gaetz, including sexual misconduct and illicit drug use. Republicans on the panel are facing intense pressure, with some key GOP senators pushing to see the report, saying that the details will eventually come to light. And then you have the House speaker saying that it should not be released. Perhaps some details coming out like a lawyer for two women who claimed that they were paid more than $10,000 by Gaetz for sex, telling CNN that House investigators have -- quote -- \"numerous photos\" related to time they spent with the former congressman. As the Ethics Committee is meeting right now, Gaetz is actually on the Hill. He is there alongside vice president-elect J.D. Vance trying to shore up support for his nomination.
