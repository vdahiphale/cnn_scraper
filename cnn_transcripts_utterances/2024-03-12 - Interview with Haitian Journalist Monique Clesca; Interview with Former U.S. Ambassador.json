I've read -- I've talked to people way down and way up and pretty much all up and down the line, he had lost any confidence to get anything done. He's had two and a half years to do something and it just gotten worse and worse and worse and worse. So, Henry was never the answer. Now, do I have a silver bullet? God, I wish I did.

And Ambassador White knows about this because some of it happened while she was ambassador. And the United States knows this. The other countries knows this. So, it is not our gangs. No, there are gangs everywhere. But what has happened here is that the gangs were empowered a lot by politicians. That is one aspect. The second aspect is knowing these foreign countries validated this. They said, OK, you can stay in power. And we stayed in power for 30 months while we were saying, no, this should not happen. Now, the Montana Accord that came about in August 2021 proposed then a government that was a transition government. And we tried to push that before things got to that state, but it did not happen. Now, what is it that needs to be done? We need to be able to convince the International Community that has held power, and it must be said, they have held power in Haiti through our Ariel Henry and through the others. They put them there, and they held power. What we need to do is try to get a transitional government that can send a clear signal that they are not in cahoots with the gangs. They are not gangs in white ties. It is of the utmost importance that this be done. And once this government is in power, then to discuss with the gangs, because they must talk to the gangs once they are in power. It is not the ones who are not in power who must talk to the gangs. It is the transitional council that will come, that will have the responsibility, whether or not they lay their arms down. Some of them have apologized. Do they -- must they be taken seriously?

The Haitans -- they've done the Montana Accord. They came out with a March 9th Accord. They proposed five different groups of people who will be represented. You have to take a Haitian solution and put them in running what's going to be a response to this horrific humanitarian crisis. Right now, I don't care about elections. I think elections are something nice that we talk about. We don't have that -- right -- that is not in the future of Haiti for at least two years. We have to get in there and get the women and the children fed. People are dying. There are 5 million Haitians that are near starvation. So, how are we going to do that? I think one we're going have do, we do not like doing this, but I do think too bad we are going do it. We're going to have to start negotiating or talking to the bad guys. And we in the United States, although we like to say we don't, we have negotiated with bad guys all over the world for years and years. And you know, I was in Liberia ahead of USAID right after -- two years after the Civil War. Linda Thomas-Greenfield was the ambassador, I was head of AID. Sirleaf -- Ellen Sirleaf was president. And somehow, we managed together -- to come together with all kinds of help around the world to take this disastrous situation and make it better. So, it can be done. We've seen it be done. But first of all, first and foremost, we've got to get food, medical supplies, they're running out of water, and the inability to move at all anywhere without being shot in the streets. First and for most, we've got to get them supplies in there. And if we have to do that by negotiating with the bad guys, with negotiating Guy Philippe with who is back in Haiti and has a very strong voice, whether you like it or not, he is a player now. Barbecue is player. We need to figure out how we can work with them to start getting humanitarian supplies in there. I think we should start that today.",

At the time that I wrote that op-ed, which for lack of a better word went viral, I deeply felt that people in the U.S., people all around me, even some of my colleagues in the hospital were not taking the pandemic seriously. And every day, as I showed up to work, I could see the lines outside of our emergency rooms expanding. And I just knew we were going to get demolished, and we did. And I am glad that I wrote that piece in retrospect. In retrospect, the sky was falling. That is all I could think to myself that week -- this week, four years ago.

What did you write to your kids? DR. GRIGGS:  I wrote a short message after a really hard day in the hospital and a really hard case taking care of a critically ill child with COVID, and I wrote that my kids would hardly recognize me in all of my gear and personal protective equipment, but I just want them to know, if they lose me to COVID, that I tried really hard to do my job. And I think that was a sentiment shared by many health care workers, especially those of us in New York, in Boston, in cities around the globe that got hit really hard by the COVID pandemic, that so many health care workers were terrified. It's hard to remember how little we knew four years ago because we've had to spend so much of our lives in the interim thinking about COVID, how to keep ourselves safe, how to keep our children safe, how to keep our elderly relatives safe, our immunocompromised friends. But I really meant every word, and it was the first time in my life that I was showing up to the hospital every day afraid for my own life. And I really think that is a sentiment that was shared by many health care workers at the time.

And it was truly life-saving and game-changing of course to those who could afford to have it, and we know so many people in the developing world did not get it despite promises, certainly in the -- you know, under the Trump administration and with the E.U. What did -- now, when you look back and you see the actual graphs that show blue states there were higher -- you know, there was a higher survival -- sorry, in the Republican leaning states, there were higher deaths because people didn't want to get vaccinated. In the blue, more Democratic leaning states, there was lesser deaths because people did get vaccinated. When you think about the fear and the politics around even the cure, how do you reflect on that now? DR. GRIGGS:  It still kind of fills me with rage to think about how many people deny that COVID is serious and that the pandemic took a really traumatic toll on all of us, and that there's so much denial of science now to this day. I am so glad that I wrote this book for this reason because it is a living testament to the reality of what we lived through in 2020. I wrote everything down because I couldn't face the idea that people were denying that what was going down in our hospitals, which looked like a true horror movie, was actually happening. I still meet patients to this day, unfortunately, who are COVID deniers who want to believe that it was all a hoax. And that's why I think it's more important than ever for physicians like me to have their voices in the arena, arguing on behalf of science, arguing for keeping people safe. I think it's a really hard time. People have a hard time knowing what authorities to believe. But I'm really grateful in the power of science. I think the arrival of the COVID vaccine was a testament to the fact that there are a lot of parts of the COVID story that are actually a story of redemption. And my book is ultimately a story of redemption as well. It's a hard topic to think about. I'm not going to deny that. It was hard for me even to finish writing parts of this book because it was emotional to go back to those early days when we knew so little. But ultimately, this is a story of redemption, and I hope people find a piece of that in this book.",

So, as people may not recall, even though it wasquite recent, the entire reason that we were able to produce and distribute vaccines to all 50 states at the same time was that there was a general named Gus Perna, who was appointed to oversee Operation Warp Speed. He shows up in Washington with no -- really nothing. No plan, no money, he has three colonels, and he does these series of conversations to try and figure out how he's going to operationalize it. And it turns out the answer is A.I.-driven software. OK. And what A.I.-driven software is able to do at its best is operationalize excellence by creating and ingesting data from lots of different places. So, the challenge for Warp Speed was not just to be connected to all the pharmaceutical makers, but to the truckers, to all the state level agencies, all the healthcare providers, all the pharmaceuticals. So, you're talking about thousands of different data inputs. And so Perna sits down, and ultimately, he needs A.I.-driven software to ingest and integrate all that data in a clean way, and then turn it into an app, so you can actually make decisions based on information. And now, that is a very complicated thing. I'm going to reduce it just for a second. Think about plastic, right? So -- and you're trying to get vaccines to everybody. Well, you can make the vaccine, but what is the national state of the output and production of plastic, right? So, just that alone, to put the vaccine into vials requires a whole vision of a cosmos. And so, we did it, and it worked. But our politics have kind of buried that effort in the rearview mirror.

So, try telling a civil servant who is going to get raked over the coals that, no, no, no, we need you to approve appropriations and procurement for this product that will never be done, right? And so, it's a real challenge. And on top of it, of course, you know, look, our system has only gotten more complicated. We have more people, more spending, and we insert rules and regulations. We never take them out, ever, because that's really dull and unglamorous work. And it's hard to do. And so, what we end up with -- and Jennifer Pahlka, who's brilliant, sort of taught me through this in her mind, you get this kind of loop of absurdity and dysfunction. And it starts with procurement rules that are torturous and absurd. Then you hold public servants accountable for their ability to enforce absurd procurement rules. So, what ends up happening is you either get absurd and bad software, right, really bad software, or they take a chance, and then they end up in front of Congress. And each cycle of this drives more good, smart people out of government, and then you rinse and repeat. And so, that's why -- you know, as Eric Schmidt sort of said to me, he's like, basically, software -- you know, government is the perfect enemy of software. And so, we have to find a way, given that software is basically the most important noun in the American budget, we have to find a way to get the government to accept its role in providing software.

I mean, I think everybody would agree with that, butthere's a corollary to that stat, which, you know, ProPublica did some incredible work looking at the V.A.'s own inspector general reports, and it turns out that human beings were frequently misdiagnosing or ignoring signs of mental distress in veterans. I mean, to a really -- if you're an American who has any sort of patriotism, just a gut-wrenching degree. And the reasons, again, are that the system is incredibly complicated. You're losing track of who has what condition. So much of the work they're doing is still manual, let alone the stuff that's digital not being functional. And so, we have to get to a place. If we really value our veterans and their service, you know, they deserve a god view of their own care. They deserve to be able to log in and look at where they are, and someone on the other end deserves to have that same functionality, so they can see, oh, this is a person who has severe PTSD. How frequently are we checking in? And I would say that at the first level, an automated LLM that says, how are you feeling today, is not a bad thing, because any sort of even parasocial engagement that can ladder up immediately to a human when you detect distress is a positive. I'm not suggesting that that becomes the counselor by any means, but the system is so broken that just instituting some sort of basic check-in, some sort of order, can get that number down. And what I ultimately suggest in the piece, you know, steal from software, right? So, as I said, software isn't built all at once. You start with one small use case, and you learn from it. And we owe veterans the opportunity to learn and work with them first. And so, let's solve that problem. You know, if Joe Biden was going to give a State of the Union about A.I., and we wanted to sort of take our moonshot, why don't we reduce that number of suicides by half in one year? Could we do it? I mean, we manufactured and distributed vaccines in six months. So, I think we could. But we -- you know, Americans respond to big challenges and it's complicated. A.I. is very technical subject. People have natural fear and confusion around it. We need to set a really, really big goal and see if we can accomplish it.

I've heard a couple different ideas about regulation, some of which is about training data and what are people using to train their A.I. and how can we make sure it's not discriminatory and it's not stolen from creators. So, that's one area. Another area which is super ambitious is that in order to do large-scale artificial intelligence work, you need very expensive chips.
