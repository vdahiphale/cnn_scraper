I'm going to speak to the first humanitarian organization that has managed to get aid into the territory and who is helping those fearing for their lives evacuate out. That is coming up. Also this hour, the Kremlin is not commenting on the alleged Ukrainian assassination of Russia's Black Sea fleet commander.

The surge of migrants at the U.S.-Mexico border leaves Texas towns scrambling with more asylum seekers sleeping on the streets. The U.S. immigration court currently has a backlog of more than 2.5 million cases. U.S. lawmakers get back to work today after a long weekend, pondering whether the rest of the federal government should keep on working if Congress fails to pass new spending measures.

Rather, we're at Mexico's southern border with Guatemala. That is Guatemala over there. And that, if you look here, are folks crossing. They are waving at us. Migrants who have made the journey from various countries. We have met folks from Haiti, from Cuba, from Honduras. Ultimately, though, many of them tell us, if not all, they want to go north. By the way, that's the official crossing, that bridge, not many people using that. Instead, they come to this side, to the Mexico side and this is into a city that is called Ciudad Hidalgo. And they set up little encampments. You can see here, you've got folks with tents set up. They've got clothes hanging. They're cooking food. You see a lot of families, a lot of young children in particular. And the plan for many of them Is to be here in Ciudad Hidalgo, until they can find a way usually by bus or by car, to get to Tapachula, which is the largest city in this area, the state of Chiapas in southern Mexico. And many of them plan then to go meet with officials. And they hope to then claim asylum here in Mexico or at the very least, try to get transit documents. And that buys them time to stay in Mexico as they plan their way into the U.S. Most of them will tell you and they told me this directly, they want to enter the U.S. legally. But what you have noticed here and we have seen this in the past several months here in Mexico in particular, is the influx and the surge is a real strain on the resources for Mexican cities. And you notice that as you see a lot of these folks are really trying on their own, figure out how to find food, how to find clothes. And they are filling up cities like Tapachula, 15,000 to 17,000 right now -- that's the number of migrants alone in Tapachula. Huge numbers that plan to wait and stay. And so, essentially, if you look at the U.S. border as a river, you have cut it off in one part. At least, that is the intention from U.S. border officials. Well upstream, it is still flowing and it's flowing rapidly. And this is the impact. It's coming on over the banks. You've got migrants here who ultimately, yes, want to go to the U.S. But frankly, most of them don't know how or where they will end up.

In the small town of -- the chaos captured in this shaky cellphone video also captured this security forces opening fire protesters.

When this person started shooting, we saw him he was 30 or 40 meters away. I saw him aiming at us. I turned sideways to shield my children and I was shot. I could see only blood. I covered my eye with my hand. I felt like if I take my hand off, it might fall out of its socket. KARADSHEH (voice-over): Elahe is not alone. Activists say Iranian security forces we're using metal pellets and rubber bullets deliberately and systematically shooting the eyes and blinding more than 500 protesters according to rights groups. Many have shared their photos online but the regime's called them liars spreading propaganda. TAVAKOLIAN (through translator): I'm in pain, it burns and I'm dying. I don't want to be blind. KARADSHEH (voice-over): Elahe lay in hospital in this agonizing pain for hours, doctors reluctant to help her as security forces were hunting down the injured and those who aided them. After a surgery to treat her wound, Elahe stayed at home in a dark room for more than three weeks. TAVAKOLIAN (through translator): I could hear them from my room chanting slogans. Something was pulling me outside, to speak, to shout, to demand my rights. I felt like my fight wasn't over yet. KARADSHEH (voice-over): But she also wanted to save her eye. With the help of an Italian journalist, Elahe made it to Italy, where she's undergone more surgeries. It was too late. Doctors discovered that the pellets still lodged behind her eye had moved and were forced to remove the eye. She was fitted with a prosthetic but life has never been harder for Elahe. She still lives with the physical pain, the trauma, alone in a foreign country, now relying on donations and friends to survive and hardest of all, not knowing if she will ever see her children again. TAVAKOLIAN (through translator): I never regretted this and I never will. If I returned to Iran, I will do it again. So many say this revolution is over but it is not over. All across the country, women are now going out without hijab, because they are no longer afraid of them. This is our method of civil resistance.

But this undercurrent of civil disobedience, which those we speak to say will continue. I do just want to close with asking, because I think it is really important for our viewers to understand. Elahe, featured in our report, made her way to Italy, had the surgery completed there and is looking to find a life there. Many, of course, do not have her opportunity and have to -- will stay in Iran. What is their fate? We ask about how families cope. How concerned are you that these families become marked families? AMIRY-MOGHADDAM: They are, actually. We have been talking to people who have not only lost their eye, they have lost their job. Yesterday, I talked to a man who was the only person working in that family, taking care of the whole family. He was working at a restaurant. And he has not been able to work since then. So they are suffering in any ways imaginable. And this is -- you know, the Iranian -- this also shows another aspect of the Iranian regime's brutality because it is not enough that they have been injured or their family members are killed. They are suffering day-by-day. And of course, it is because the regime wants to give a lesson to people so that they never do it again. But I don't think they will succeed.",

U.S. President Joe Biden is taking an historic trip to Michigan, where he is set to join striking autoworkers on the picket line later today.

      "sentences": "Well, it's a significant trip for both Joe Biden and for former president Donald Trump, particularly whenyou look at the fact that Joe Biden has had lower level polling and particularly when it comes to economic policies. So when we look at what exactly this looks like, it looks like a general election. Right now it, looks as though we have two people running for president in 2024. Now, of course, former president Trump has to actually win the nomination to then run for president. But this is a clear pivot in that direction. And when we're talking to Trump's advisers, they are saying that this is because that Biden is actually visiting because Trump had already announced that he was going to come here on Wednesday. Now it is true that Trump did announce that first. We know that there had been a back and forth inside the White House. He'd been encouraged by some -- Biden had been encouraged by some aides not to go out to the picket line, to let it work itself out, not to be a part of the mediation. But as soon as Donald Trump announced that he would be heading here to Michigan, Biden decided that he would come as well. Now this is really an opportunity for both of them to show their support for unions. Biden himself has essentially built an entire life and political career supporting unions. It has been a cornerstone of his entire economic policy. Trump, his administration was far more pro business, not pro labor. It was anti union, according to some of these union leaders. But yet, still, they seem to be fighting for the same group of voters. These are working class union members and they are critically important here in Michigan. The reason why Trump's people think that there is an opening here is because of the fact that United Auto Workers, this critical auto industry union, has not yet endorsed. In 2020, they endorsed Joe Biden. They have not yet endorsed in this election. They believe there are cracks here in the system. They also believe that there is a difference between the leadership in these unions and the rank and file members. We did hear from the president of the United Auto Workers, who slammed Donald Trump's visit and slammed his administration. But we do know that these members of this union, at least some of them and their families, are going to be attending Trump's speech. And when you look back at the last two elections, 2016, Trump was actually able to get a record number of these working class union member voters in a way that Republicans had not seen in decades. Biden got some of that back in 2020. The question, is what exactly will 2024 look like? And when you look at the polling, the economic numbers for Joe Biden and how Donald Trump can sell himself, that is the question. Who is going to be able to get these working class voters?",
