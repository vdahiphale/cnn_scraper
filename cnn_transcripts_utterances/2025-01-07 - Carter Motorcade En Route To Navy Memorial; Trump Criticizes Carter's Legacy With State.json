But it's very, very difficult to criticize a government from within the government, but he created these protections to get rid of waste, fraud, abuse and corruption within the government.

He was a submariner. The only president who was sub-qualified. And when his casket arrives here in a hearse, it is going to be greeted by midshipmen from the Naval Academy, which is his alma mater from not far away in Annapolis. You can see them behind us, two companies of them, including the 15th Company, which he was part of when he was there in the Naval Academy. They will be here to meet the former president and the former Lieutenant. He will be - the - Jimmy Carter's casket will be transferred to a caisson, which is an honor that is available to all presidents, their family members as they are planning their funerals for those presidents. But it's not something that everyone chooses. Reagan chose it, George H.W. Bush did not. We are going to see it again today for President Jimmy Carter. It's a ceremonial version of an artillery wagon that traditionally would have carried supplies to the front line and would have brought back the dead and wounded. And it's now become this mounted escort to honor the nation's fallen, operated by the old guard of the 3rd Infantry Regiment, Caisson Detachment. And as we've been reflecting on the life of Jimmy Carter here in recent days, talking about how a peanut farmer ends up in the White House, there's a really appropriate detail about these soldiers who are going to carry his casket on horseback to the Capitol. The specialist, Chase Redfern, is going to be riding the section horse. That is the lead horse. It's a five-year-old Friesian named \"Bullet.\" And Redfern actually grew up farming in Iowa. Just a really interesting little detail that one farmer is going to be carrying another farmer to the Capitol with a large procession behind him, including family members who will be making this walk, Jake. One that is going to mirror the walk that Jimmy Carter himself made during his inaugural parade with his family.",

And it's quite extraordinary when you think that one of his biggest achievements there, which was controversial at the time in the 1970s. There's no question that it reached bipartisan support. Now, it is in the crosshairs of Donald Trump.But at that news conference earlier today, just 13 days before Donald Trump is indeed sworn into office, so many other headlines, including he said the Gaza hostages should be released before he takes office or all hell will break loose. He also declined to say if he would offer pardons for even the most violent offenders of January 6th and on and on a few other headlines. But Jake, it was Jimmy Carter who Donald Trump mentioned several times. And I'm thinking back to when Donald Trump was in office, there actually was somewhat of a conversation between the two men about relations with the North Korea and China. But Jimmy Carter also said, yes, he was looking forward to living to a hundred, but he was also looking forward to even more to voting for Kamala Harris, which he did in Georgia a couple months before he died.

They talked about how much political capital it was going to take for him to get that done. They brought a lot of senators, actually, and had them visit the Panama Canal at the time to try to help build support here on Capitol Hill. They actually felt like it worked.I watched a recent interview that Jimmy Carter's secretary of state did a few years ago. And just on that front, you know - but when Jimmy Carter pursued that as many of his aides were urging him not to, he felt that it was important because he didn't know if he'd have two terms. A lot of people said, wait until your second term to try to get something like this done. But he felt that it was important because it kind of speaks to the President Jimmy Carter was that he would do things that were not always politically popular if he thought that they were right. And, you know, looking at his time in the presidency and what that looks like as Donald Trump is preparing to retake power, there are several things that Jimmy Carter did that even norms that Trump then upended. He was the first president to disclose his tax returns. Every president after Jimmy Carter followed suit until famously Donald Trump did not and still has not done so. And so, it just speaks to how Jimmy Carter viewed that office and what it should look like. And also coming in, of course, at a time after Watergate, when there was such little trust in the executive office that he felt such a need to restore that after Richard Nixon left office a few years before in the shadows of Watergate and what that looked like. He also required rigorous disclosures from executive branch staff, because he thought it was so important that if you wanted to serve in the White House and you wanted to have a job, a taxpayer funded role, that it was so important that you were willing to be able to share that information and be transparent with the American people.",

His first impeachment may not have happened because we may never have known about his call with the Ukrainian President Zelenskyy had it not been for a whistleblower that obviously infuriated Trump so much at the time.
