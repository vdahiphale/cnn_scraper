I mean John and I have both been involved in prosecuting really dangerous people, powerful people, violent criminals, people accused of murder, mass attack. In a way that this is different because of the size and intensity of the following that this particular individual has. And John's right, the fear is really not so much with the mass gathering. I can give you my first-hand testimony. I was at Trump Tower yesterday. Maybe two or three dozen protesters. Mild. What protest should be, just cheering and signs. This morning I was there, as of an hour and a half ago, nothing. But the fear is always, as John said, that lone wolf.Remember, very shortly after the FBI searched Mar-a-Lago in August, a person stormed an FBI headquarters and was shot and killed. That's what you're afraid of.",

So, how much detail are they going to give us?And then the second thing, what are the charges? We've all been expecting charges relating to the business records relating to the Stormy Daniels hush money payments. If that's it, I'd be a little nervous for the D.A.

If you go back just a year and a half ago, most Fins thought they didn't really need to be in NATO, but as soon as Putin went into Ukraine, the position changed on that almost overnight, within the space of a couple of weeks. The majority of the Finnish people said, look, we want to become members of NATO. And the political leaders moved very quickly to make sure that that was going to happen. You talked there about that massive military capacity that Finland has those 270 odd 1,000 potential troops available there. They've been partnered with NATO for years. They've been training with NATO. Their equipment is compatible with NATO equipment. So, they're a ready force. So, when you hear NATO secretary general say this makes Finland safer and NATO stronger, that's the message to Putin that he just inherited a much bigger problem precisely because he went into Ukraine.

They're saying that Finland -- that rather Sweden is harboring terrorists, Turkish terrorists, the PKK, the Kurdish workers' party. So, this is something that is a contentious issue with Sweden because Sweden says these people you're asking for, they are in our country. We give them due process. And there's no need to extradite them as you want. But I think something that kind of -- a fly that flew in the ointment during those tense negotiations just in the past couple of months was a far right Danish politician having a protest in Sweden's capital, Stockholm, burning a Koran, and that really ticked off the -- ticked off the Turkish. So, at the moment, the talks between them are at a standstill. But the secretary general of NATO did say today he hopes that Sweden will be able to join by the early summer.",

But this should also mean more visitors to the state of Florida, which means, of course, more money for the state of Florida.Now, Sara, at the center of all of this is that special tax district that Disney has enjoyed for quite some time. And more specifically at the center of this is the board of the special tax district because up until recently Disney had appointed that board. Disney had very close ties with that board. That has recently changed. But what DeSantis' office has recently discovered is that that previous board actually gave Disney back some of its power. And so now you have DeSantis saying, wait a minute, you are trying to undermine us. I just want to read for you a comment that his office made after we heard from Bob Iger, saying, the Florida legislature and Governor DeSantis worked to put Disney on an even playing field and Disney got caught attempting to undermine Florida's duly enacted legislation in the 11th hour. So, what happens now? Well, DeSantis is calling for an investigation into that previous board. And as he has said recently, it ain't over yet. You ain't seen nothing yet.",
