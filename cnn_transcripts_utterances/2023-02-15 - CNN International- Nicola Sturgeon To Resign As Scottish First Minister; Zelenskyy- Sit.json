Just ahead, Nicola Sturgeon is resigning, a Scotland's first minister, saying her decision was not a reaction to any short- term pressures.Then, NATO defense ministers meet in Brussels, promising continued military support for Ukraine as a fierce fight for territory rages in the east of the country. Plus, miraculous stories of survival in Turkey more than a week after the devastating earthquake has killed at least 41,000 people. We'll have the latest. It really is the end of an era in Scottish politics. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon is resigning after eight years in office. She made the announcement earlier on Wednesday, adding that she'll stay in office until a replacement is found. Sturgeon was seen as the face of Scotland's independence movement and Brexit opposition as well. Neither of them -- neither worked out. As Sturgeon says, it's the right step to step down.

But this came out of nowhere all of a sudden. Journalists scrambling to be there for the announcement.So her reasons? She had several. A lot of it was personal. She said that she wanted to focus on Nicola Sturgeon, the person rather than the politician, but she also had a view on her party, what was best for them and for independence. And she didn't want to be making key decisions herself if she wasn't 100 percent sure she was going to be the one in power in months or years to come, because she didn't think that that was fair. So she'd asked herself, is this right for me? Is this right for her party? And she decided that now is the time to step down. But she also spoke about how the culture has changed and how it's made her question whether or not she has the will to continue.",

Relying heavily on open- source data, things like social media posts and on very high- definition satellite imagery to sort of piece together the fate of what they say is at least 6,000 children over the course of the now nearly year-old war. They say the number could in reality be much higher than this.Now look, we know Ukraine has been alleging for many months that the forced deportation of children has been happening in the thousands, perhaps even in the hundreds of thousands. The architect has alleged in this report of these policies in Russia has already been sanctioned by the U.K. and the U.S. But this gives a lot more detail of what happens to these children inside of Russia. They've identified 43 facilities, most of them preexisting summer camps, that they say are being used for the political reeducation of children, the ages, by the way, ranging from several months up to 17 years. And that ranges from cultural, patriotic types of education right up to military in the cases of two camps, including the use of firearms. And as you say Max, the State Department Spokesperson Ned Price unequivocal in his condemnation of these findings. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) NED PRICE, U.S. STATE DEPARTMENT SPOKESPERSON: The network of facilities which these children are sent is vast, spanning from Russia of occupied Crimea, across Russia itself, from the Black Sea region to its Far East. Putin seeks to rob Ukraine of its future by taking its children. Russia's system of force, relocation, reeducation and adoption of Ukraine's children is a key element of the Kremlin's systematic efforts to deny and suppress Ukraine's identity, its history and its culture.

Local media report another woman was rescued near the epicenter 10 hours later, and crews say they're still hearing the voices of trapped survivors. So many others are not as fortunate.

And rescue teams do say that they are still hearing voices beneath the rubble and there are so many thousands hoping for news of their loved ones, waiting for news that they may be pulled out of the rubble alive.But of course, as you said there, this is becoming less frequent and the window for finding survivors beneath the rubble is certainly closing very, very quickly. This is shifting now to more of a recovery effort. But there are still rescue teams from across the globe working around the clock. Our colleague Jomana Karadsheh in the southeast of Turkey currently around those rescue efforts. They are working day and night in order to pull out survivors. But, of course, this is now the operation to rescue people is coming to an end. And sadly, there are still thousands more people waiting for news of their loved ones. And of course, thousands of survivors, people impacted by the quake who have simply lost everything. Today, in Istanbul, the authorities are expecting hundreds of people from the southeast of the country impacted by the quake to be evacuated to the city. We spoke to one family who've been put up by a volunteer host family here in the city and we've seen this groundswell of support in Istanbul providing aid and donations to those impacted and that will be a real focus now, as well as, of course, the infrastructural challenges that the Turkish government now faces. According to authorities, there are some more than 50,000 buildings deemed unsafe which need to be demolished as soon as possible. So there is a huge challenge ahead for the authorities in the southeast. Of course, a lot of landmarks and important buildings in Turkey also damaged in the earthquake. But of course, the focus right now remains on that human suffering, the human toll that we have seen in the country. And of course, we can't forget the situation in northwest Syria. Now, we are still hearing voices beneath the rubble here in Turkey. There is still hope. There may be survivors pulled out further and later on today. But in northwest Syria, for days now, the White Helmets who have been leading on that search effort said they were not hopeful that any further survivors would be beneath the rubble. They are focusing solely now on the recovery of these bodies and of course, on getting aid into the country. It has taken days and days to get sufficient aid into northwest Syria, into that rebel-held territory and still it is not enough. It is simply too little, too late. And in fact, here in Turkey, there is a sense of growing frustration, many saying that the aid isn't getting to those in need as quickly as they would have liked. There are questions around the accountability behind this earthquake, many questioning whether there was enough done to prepare for a disaster of this scale. And as we understand it, the Turkish government still ongoing with its investigation into allegations of negligence within the construction industry. More than 100 people already identified as potential suspects and we have already seen arrests carried out. Max?",

At a news conference earlier today, she said that leading Scotland through the COVID pandemic was the toughest thing that she'd ever done and that she felt now was the right time to step down. A leading figure in Scotland's independence movement, Sturgeon says she will stay on as leader of the National Party, the Scottish National Party and First Minister until a successor is chosen.Let's get some perspective on what all this means. With me now from Edinburgh is Anthony Salamone, political scientist and founder of European Merchants. Thanks for joining us. She was the face, really, wasn't she, of the independence movement.

I suppose that movement is at a crossroads, not least in terms of potentially falling support for independence, but more the point that there is no obvious route to independence at this stage.Nicola Sturgeon decided to gamble by taking a case to the Supreme Court on whether or not the Scottish Parliament had the right to legislate for a referendum without the U.K. government's approval.

But at the same time, it's worth remembering that the strategy that Nicola Sturgeon pursued was entirely of her own choice. She decided to try to see whether or not she could hold a referendum without the U.K. government's approval, and that route was not successful. And so, in terms of where the Scottish National Party and the Scottish defense would go from here, it is unclear.
