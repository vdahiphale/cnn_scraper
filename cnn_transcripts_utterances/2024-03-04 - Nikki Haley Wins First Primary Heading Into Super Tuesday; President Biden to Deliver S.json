Just ahead, Donald Trump's last remaining Republican rival picks up her first primary win of the year. But with Super Tuesday on the horizon, will Nikki Haley be able to make up any real ground in the U.S. presidential race?U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris increases pressure on Israel, calling for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza. And long lines in Moscow as hundreds of people continue queuing up to mourn Alexei Navalny and lay flowers at his grave. Good to have you with us. And we begin here in the United States where a jampacked week of political events is about to unfold. Americans will cast crucial votes and hear a critical speech as they sort through the possible choices for the next president. Among them is Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley, who won Sunday's GOP primary in Washington, D.C. It's her first win so far. Super Tuesday is just a day away and all eyes will be on Haley to see if she can gain traction against Donald Trump. Fifteen states and one U.S. territory will hold Republican primaries on Tuesday, and Democrats will hold contests too. One of those states is Colorado. Trump's name is on the ballot, even though the U.S. Supreme Court is still deciding whether he's eligible to serve. The high court could announce an opinion in the coming hours, but there's no guarantee. Meantime, President Joe Biden is preparing to deliver his State of the Union address on Thursday. It comes at a crucial time as he's seeking to convince Americans to give him a second term.  So, let's discuss this with CNN senior political analyst Ron Brownstein. He's also a senior editor at \"The Atlantic\" and joins me from Los Angeles. Always great to have you with us.",

      "sentences": "Yeah, it sure seems that way. I mean, she's, you know, she's been very careful to say that she was in the race until Super Tuesday without making any promises for what comes after. I mean, she has made a point. There is a portion of the Republican coalition, particularly among individuals who lean toward Republicans, college- educated voters, more moderate voters who are still resistant to Donald Trump.It's probably around 30 percent of the party in kind of a neutral setting, maybe as high as she's been able to get as high as 40 percent in the states where she'll be able to spend time and money. I doubt that she's going to get much past that in many of the Super Tuesday states. There was a poll in Virginia that had her a little higher than that. But I think, you know, the point is not likely to change. And obviously, her coalition is not big enough to actually beat Trump for the nomination. So, I suspect that she will conclude that there's really not much to be gained by going on, but we'll see. She is obviously a very different candidate than she was earlier in the race when she went through very contorted gyrations to avoid criticizing Trump. She still doesn't go as far as Chris Christie or Liz Cheney, but she's certainly much more critical of him than she had been earlier. And she may want to continue to use the platform to do that.",

You know, four high quality national polls out this weekend with a very similar portrait of where we are.[02:05:00] Two of them with Trump ahead by four points nationally, two of them with Trump ahead by two points. He's ahead, you know, slightly. And I think even more importantly than the horse race, the head-to-head comparison, because it's not clear the voters are fully focused on the implications of a of a second Trump term yet. Are the findings about the approval rating for President Biden himself and the doubts about his ability to, you know, execute these duties for another term? Three of those four polls had him below 40 percent in approval. There are -- we saw in 2022, there are a substantial number of Americans who will say that I am disappointed in Biden's performance. I am disappointed in the economy, but I still am going to vote for Democrats because I consider the Republican alternative to extreme, a threat to my rights, to my values, to democracy itself. But Rosemary, there's not an infinite pool of those voters. And to go from an approval rating of 36 or 38 percent to a winning coalition in a presidential election requires a very large number of people to say, I don't like the job of the incumbent, but I'm going to vote for him because I like the alternative even less. He needs to begin improving his own standing with the public and certainly laying out a compelling agenda for what a second term might mean, which he's done very little of. At this state of the union would be an important step in that direction.",

I mean, there is kind of no council of elders, you know, if there's anybody who's going to convince him that this is not worth doing, it's as someone else has said, it's probably someone with a Biden at the end of their name, even Obama might not have that influence over him, given that he told him, you know, unceremoniously not to run in 2016 and that didn't turn out so well for Democrats.You know, I think there is a view in the Democratic Party, however, that beyond Biden, the party itself needs to be more aggressive in pushing at the vulnerabilities of Trump, which are still very real, even though they've been kind of overshadowed by the manifest vulnerabilities of Biden. So, you know, I think there's a desire for the groups working on the various issues, remember, Trump might be vulnerable, abortion, some of his immigration responses, which has obviously been an issue that has been hurting Biden, to become more forceful in making a case against him. But there's not that much anyone else can do it. Really is Joe Biden who has to meet the dual challenge of convincing people that he is physically and mentally up to another term, and that he has plans that will produce better conditions than voters, you know, believe they are experiencing now. Obviously, inflation is just overshadowing a lot of other positive developments in the economy. They can kind of highlight those positive developments and advertising in the key states. But as long as necessities of life are costing 15, 20 percent more than when Biden took office, it's probably going to be the contrast with Trump more than selling Biden's record that it's going to get him over the top if he gets there.",
