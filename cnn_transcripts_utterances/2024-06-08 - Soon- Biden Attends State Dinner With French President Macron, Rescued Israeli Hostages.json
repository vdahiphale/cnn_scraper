Right now, emotional moment in Israel after a dramatic rescue operation frees four hostages from Hamas.Family and friends reuniting with their loved ones after eight months of captivity in Gaza. More on that in a moment. But first, an important moment in the face of worldwide threats to democracy. Two of the world's oldest allies, the United States and France, coming together in Paris. President Biden soon to attend a state dinner at this hour at Elysee Palace. You see people in position, the band in position, the red carpet in position for guests to arrive. The guest of honor, the Bidens, for their arrival for the state dinner. All right. Let's begin with the breaking news underway in France. Right now, President Biden and the first lady soon to arrive there at the Elysee palace in Paris for the state dinner with the French President Emmanuel Macron. It's all part of Biden's high-stakes trip to France, aimed at strengthening the alliance with a critical U.S. ally. And reinforcing the commitment to support Ukraine in its war with Russia. We are looking at pictures right now of more guests arriving. CNN's Melissa Bell is in Paris for us. Melissa, what more can you tell us about the state dinner, how it will all play out, who are among the distinguished guests? We have been looking at folks are arriving there and the purpose behind this dinner -- the importance of the dinner.",

So, it had been a pretty important step in showing just how grieved -- a grieved France was by the move. So, there had been some rebuilding to do. But I think for both presidents, you're right. We've been talking a lot about why this visit and all the messaging that's come from in it matters to President Biden at this particular point, but remember that President Macron is also facing some pretty difficult elections this weekend. European elections are being held across the European Union. The far right is expected to do extremely well. We'll know by tomorrow night, who is -- which parties have done best. But here in France, Emmanuel Macron parties don't expect you to terribly well. So, these, this messaging mattered to him about the importance of the center holding in the face of more conservative forces. I think it was messaging that mattered to both president's domestic audiences. Fredricka.",

Frida, great to see you. I mean, there was so much symbolism over what has transpired during this five-day visit for President Biden, while in France. Is this the moment, this state dinner, is this the punctuation there? Is that, you know, its meaning, the punctuation of this relationship of reestablishing the commitment of the U.S., not just to France, but to all, you know, allies, NATO allies?

One is this Russian war against Ukraine, the other one is the possibility that a president, a former president, who is threatening to change the entire character of the alliance between the United States and Europe could return to power and all these -- all these commitments -- all these reassurances from President Biden are going to be not worth very much. There is a -- there is a story that Biden tells that when he met Macron after taking office, he told them -- he told them, Mr. President, or Emmanuel, whatever he called him, America is back and Macron responded, yes, but for how long?

The four hostages are now safe in Israel for the first time, since Hamas abducted them at the Nova music festival on October 7th. Emotional moments right there today as family and friends reunited with their loved ones. CNN's Paula Hancocks and Priscilla Alvarez are tracking all of the developments. Paula, let's go to you.

Now, we heard some of the details of that mission that happened in Nuseirat in central Gaza. From the IDF, we understand it happened at 11:00 a.m., a joint mission between the military, the security agency, and the police that they say was weeks in the planning. The Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu giving the green light for it to go ahead on Thursday. Now, they say it was focused on two buildings that they entered to try and rescue these four hostages. They say, they were under fire as they went in and as they left. But you see images of those hostages on board, the helicopters touching down in Israel. Celebrations, relief on their faces.

The man was in the street so the police officers get out of the car, helping get -- help him get out of those. And you see this man sort of waving his arms.

Now, when you look at the issue, overall, homelessness here in Los Angeles and really in California has been a challenge for politicians and continues to be a problem for both the city, the county, and really the state. And politicians may take different approaches to how they want to handle homelessness. But it is a problem that continues to be just front and center here in California. The council members said that after learning about this video, his staff drove around this area trying to find this man.
