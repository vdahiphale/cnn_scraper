I'm Kasie Hunt.President Biden is set to sign a long-awaited foreign aid package today. It passed with bipartisan support in the Senate last night. Forty-eight Democrats and 31 Republicans backing the bill. It includes $95 billion in much-needed assistance for Ukraine, Israel, and Taiwan. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy posted his gratitude on the platform formerly known as Twitter, saying, \"This vote reinforces America's role as a beacon of democracy and the leader of the free world.\" Yesterday, Senator Minority Leader Mitch McConnell didn't hold back in explaining why he believes it took so long to get the bill to the president's desk.

And so, this -- what -- is just one example of many examples of him saying one thing and then later saying something completely different. And it's not just -- I think the lobbying and the -- and the personal interactions he's had with people connected to TikTok has an impact. But I also think the fact that TikTok is now even more popular than it was when he was in office. It's popular among young voters. There is concern that a ban on TikTok could have a negative impact on President Joe Biden just because of the sheer popularity of the app. And I think Trump wants to take advantage of that by, again, saying hey, young people, if you don't want your TikTok taken away from you, blame Joe Biden.

But I would say we're on the outside of that and there is a huge role for civil society to play in curing this informational ecosystem right now.",
