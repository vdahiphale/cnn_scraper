Cross-examination is going to pick back up again in just moments after Trump's attorneys elicited some damaging admissions from Michael Cohen, Trump's former attorney, and fixer this morning, with Cohen acknowledging under oath, yes, that's correct, that he did steal from the Trump Organization. We will see soon after the defense is done with him how prosecutors are going to try to rehabilitate Michael Cohen and his reputation with the jurors who are sitting right there to his left, 12 of them, when of course they will be the ones who ultimately decide this case.CNN's Paula Reid and John Berman are back here with me outside of 100 Center Street where that break is happening right now. Eric Trump is already responding to Michael Cohen's concession in court that yes, by saying you know, I paid a certain amount for this when instead I really only gave this company $20,000, I did steal from the Trump Organization. Eric Trump says this just got interesting. Michael Cohen is now admitting to stealing money from our company.

When I've been in there, I've never seen that even on a day when two accountants testified and then went to individual pay stubs and invoices that it was deadly boring but significant.Every single one of his 18 jurors, the 12 jurors, and the six alternates were paying rapt attention. But the fact that during Todd Blanche's -- the end of his cross here before the break, that the jury seemed disengaged, that's a big question mark. Have they already made up their mind about Michael Cohen's credibility and they don't need to hear any more? Are they not buying what Todd Blanche is selling?

He was looking straight ahead as the testimony was happening last week. But this is information that already came out to the jury. I'm sure the prosecutors will likely point that out when they decide how they're going to address this because that's their first mode of opera.

It's because they're kind of working over their client, right, getting in points that are important to him. It's part of client maintenance. It's what's preventing Trump from having outbursts in the courtroom like he so often did during the civil litigation. It's not even apparent. Though Trump is really paying attention. We've seen reporting from inside the courtroom that even he has been sort of in and out of attentiveness during the course of Todd Blanche's cross- examination here.

This is not a linear or chronological cross-examination but that appears to be one of the things he is trying to say here. Cohen confirms he told the reporter that one of the reasons he should run for Congress is because he's got the best name recognition out there. I'm not sure that's true.

There are different checks, $35,000 each after he was already inaugurated as the president of the United States. This is where the crux of the issue. I would have had him sit down a long time ago. But here's the problem with how we began this entire day with the judge's decision to have the conclusion -- the closing arguments next week.Now, there's all that time for the jury to either A., sit with the fact that Michael Cohen is a liar and that he is now a thief and all these things. Wouldn't have been better for them as a defense, he will go right into it, essentially saying you've heard all of these different statements being made, all this, what haven't you heard, what connections have not been made. And now, the most reliable and who they choose to end with is this person. You have Cohen agreeing that $150,000 is the Daniels' payment and includes what he paid to Red Finch. Let me just revisit for a second for everyone to look at this, on the tablet, please, about the hush money trial payment and what we're talking about. Here's the breakdown we're talking about. $130,000 made to Daniels. 50,000 you're talking about, Jake, to Red Finch about the actual polling. Remember, they have this times two over here, right, to get the $180,000 plus 50,000 hours to the actual bonus of Michael Cohen. This is the breakdown. And what they've used up until this point to show this has been the notes taken by McConney about what this and how does it break down. Taken from of course, Allen Weisselberg. Now, this is so important. Every name being mentioned on cross- examination, Allen Weisselberg, Rudy Giuliani, Bob Costello, about even Trump's references and beyond, we have not heard from these people. Allen Weisselberg, we will -- we will not hear from my understanding. He's in Rikers and also will not be a cooperating person on these things. Also is this claim here, Blanche asks, did you -- but didn't you claim that $35,000 a month on your taxes? Did you? Blanche asked. Hoffinger objects. Now, they are side-barring. Now, first of all, we haven't heard much objection from the prosecution until now. One reason might be because they don't necessarily want to show that their feathers have been ruffled, that they're nervous in some way before the jury, and strategic in talking about these things. But up until now, you haven't heard much attempt to try to stop or slow down the traction being gained by the defense counsel here. But in any event, you have to go back, if you are the defense team, to what the prosecution has or has not been able to prove. And the money in the documents are so important.",

Any publisher would put that out there except for maybe Regnery, I suppose, but pretty much any publisher because it will make money. No, Sir Cohen says, testifying that he talks about the situation in his podcast and TikTok and they make money that's a -- you know, that would benefit you personally. No, sir. I talked about on my podcast, I talked about on TikTok, and they make money. And that's how I was viewing your question whether Mr. Trump is ultimately determined guilty is not going to affect whether I speak about it or not. I'm getting kind of confused about this. But in any case, it is clear that Michael Cohen will benefit financially. Blanche continues to press him on whether it will benefit financially as Trump is found guilty either way.

I have to say, first of all, what do you think about this revelation that Michael Cohen committed larceny by his own admission against Trump? And do you think that undermines the documentary evidence in this case, given the fact that part of the $420,000 is at stake, here is $60,000 that he stole?",

We -- the prosecution brought out a lot of that on direct. And just generally, that's what's known about him.I think the problem was that the prosecution didn't do a good job of having Michael Cohen explain why he did that. I mean, I think there's a good narrative there about the bonus. He felt like he was stiff, and he was owed that. So, there was -- there was a good story there that I think the prosecution didn't latch on to and the way they could, and then the defense capitalized and really struck some impressive blows with that line of cross. Now, with respect to the documentary evidence, I don't know if that's really going to carry the day. Todd Blanche is doing what any good defense attorney would do. And that's kind of chip away at every piece of evidence. They want to raise reasonable doubt. And the documents are just like the absolute heart of this case. Now, whether or not Michael Cohen fleeced a little off the top is actually irrelevant as to whether or not Donald Trump approved of the $130,000 repayment. So, if you believe Michael Cohen about that piece and the documents bear it out, then I think the prosecution can still prevail. But that's a pretty big if given the credibility blow.",
