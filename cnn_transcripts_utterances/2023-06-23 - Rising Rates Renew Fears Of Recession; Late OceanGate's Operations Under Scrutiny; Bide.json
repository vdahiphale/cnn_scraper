They are important and they're long lasting. The main events again related to all of this: Britain's mounting mortgage crisis. Top lenders agreeing to a one-year grace period on repossessions, that's the best answer they can come up to as mortgage rates go even higher. Investigators are scouring the ocean floor. They're looking for those clues about why the sub imploded. And on the start of the first summer weekend in New York, we envision the playground city of the future. The director of MIT's Senseable City Lab is with me. Live in New York. It's Friday, it's June the 23rd. I'm Richard Quest, and on a Friday as always, I mean business. Good evening, we showed you the red of the market and the reason, reality is setting in. Core inflation is not coming down as fast as had been hoped and it appears interest rates will need to go higher and stay there longer to squeeze out inflation. Central bankers now seem willing to risk recession much greater than before to bring prices back under control. And all three of the major indices are down. The NASDAQ will snap an eight-week winning streak for doing it. The Dow is stuck in the red all day. It's off over 280 points and it's on a downward trajectory. I wouldn't expect it to completely fall out of bed between now and the top of the hour, but you never know. The bad news in a sense in terms of inflation and lenders and interest rates is everywhere. In the UK, the government and lenders have just announced steps to protect homeowners from the mortgage crisis. It follows Thursday's rate increase by the Bank of England. Wherever we look business is stalling. The Eurozone Purchasing Managers Index is as good a gauge as any. It sank in June to a five-month low, 50 as the market separates growth from contraction. The JPMorgan Chase analysts have summed it up quite beautifully. They say Central Banks have tempered the pace of tightening in pursuit of a soft landing. However, they quote in their report this morning: \"Hopes for a painless slide in inflation back to target are likely to be dashed, requiring policy to turn sufficiently restrictive, to break the back of the expansion. Broad-based developed marketing tightening points to a more synchronized global downturn sometime next year.\" Rana is with me, our global economic analyst and associate editor of \"The Financial Times\" in New York.

And so in this case, it has already come out that Canada was involved, the Bahamas, it was actually flagged in the Bahamas. So already, you've got two countries' laws. There actually is a law for international waters and there is an act called the Death on the High Seas Act. But then you go back to where was this product engineered, designed, et cetera and the laws of that country will apply, because if you're making a vessel intended to be used by passengers, then the laws of that country will apply. So you have a patchwork quilt of laws, and then you get the ultimate \"aha\" and that is passengers can be asked in this case, we're asked to sign a waiver or release of liability, and in those documents, it can contain what is called a Forum Selection Clause.

The enemy of composites is water and damage, and it is very difficult to get the composite back to its original condition once it has become -- for want of a better word -- waterlogged. Water does damage to composite and that has been known for 30 years. So I think in the end, you will come down to a situation where it really wasn't innovation, there were known risks with composites and that's the kind of thing if it's egregious negligence, which means negligence beyond the usual kind, you probably cannot have the passengers waive that away.

The US views India as being a significant provider of some of the core components that they need to move forward, some of the -- as a source of producer -- a producer of source materials, but also, of course, for the technical expertise of the workforce that exists in India.

This climate finance summit in Paris has triedto attempt to lay the groundwork for just that. It was attended by leaders from 40 countries or so. They announced some progress. The World Bank, for instance, will let developing nations hit by natural disasters, pause their loan repayments. And over the next decade, it will expand its lending capacity by another $200 billion. President Macron said the financial help is long overdue. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

San Francisco's mayor says the city must be reimagined and she's encouraging investors today to reinvent the city's downtown by converting or even demolishing its buildings. The city has been -- has struggled after the pandemic. It's in a mass exodus of tenants and the downsizing of big tech. San Francisco is not the -- not alone. Many cities are trying to keep new identity to keep work life balances. Playground cities is the way of some calling it. The architecture to come up with that is Carlo Ratti. He's a professor at MIT. He's with me now. Playground cities. I love the idea because to some extent, that takes us back to what cities always were.

So we really need to play something similar. You mentioned, San Francisco, something similar to what venture capital does. I mean, trying something new small scale and let it evolve.

Without encounters in physical space, then our social networks wither little by little, you know, they become much weaker. And we really need to meet in physical space.
