I'm Dana Bash in Washington, where the state of our union is finishing a wild 2023 and looking ahead to a pivotal 2024.We are 15 days from the Iowa caucuses, closing out a seismic week in an already extraordinary Republican primary. In a new filing last night, special counsel Jack Smith argued that former President Donald Trump is not immune from prosecution over his actions leading up to January 6, just two days after a second state moved to strike Trump's name from the ballot, citing a 14th Amendment clause that bars someone who tried to engage in insurrection from holding any office. Trump's legal team is expected to appeal those ballot decisions by Colorado and Maine on Tuesday, a source tells CNN, though it's not clear whether any of it has dampened his appeal with primary voters. Even his rivals say they don't think he should be disqualified. Instead, this week, the Republican candidates turned their fire on Nikki Haley, who is still cleaning up her comments at a New Hampshire town hall about the causes of the Civil War. Here with me now is New Hampshire Governor Chris Sununu, who is back in Nikki Haley. Governor, I want to -- first of all, happy new year. Thanks for coming on. I want to start with what happened in your neighboring state of Maine. The secretary of state there said it was her duty to remove Donald Trump from the 2024 ballot because he engaged in an insurrection. You have been very critical of Trump's actions on January 6. What do you make of that decision?",

Trump should be on the ballot. Everybody understands that. This is a politician who I think has political aspirations down the road and trying to make a little bit of a name for herself. Everybody just hopes that the Supreme -- U.S. Supreme Court gets involved, overturns what Maine and Colorado are trying to do, make sure Trump's on the ballot in 50 states, and we move on.",

I can't tell you exactly where that's all going to go, but I can tell you, at the end of the day, as far as the Republican Party, they're not looking at it. They're not looking at the cases right now. They're not looking at the January 6, the election denial. They're really looking at what kind of moves America forward.

And at the end of the day, he's -- he's -- the only person moving is Nikki Haley. Chris Christie isn't going to make up 30 points in the next three weeks, right? Nikki Haley can make up five or 10 points and kind of give Trump that defeat that no one thought was possible in the next few weeks. And I think that's very likely to happen.

So, this becomes a test for the originalists and the textualists on the Supreme Court. And I think all of the justices from left to right call themselves textualists and originalists. The language of Section 3 of the 14th Amendment is very clear. It says, if you have sworn an oath to support the Constitution and violated the oath by engaging in insurrection or rebellion, you can never hold public office again. And the original purposes of it are equally clear, because, actually, when the language was first authored by the radical Republicans in Congress, it was very broad. And it said, if you have participated in secession or insurrection, you can never vote again. And when it got over to the Senate, they said, that's way too broad. Let's focus in on the worst offenders, people who'd actually sworn an oath to the Constitution and then breached the oath by trying to overthrow the government, and we will make sure those people never serve in office again. They can vote again. Donald Trump can vote forever as long as he lives. But he has disqualified himself. And we have a number of disqualifications in the Constitution for serving as president, for example, age. I mean, I have got a colleague who's a great young politician, Maxwell Frost. He's 26. He can't run for president. Now, would we say that that's undemocratic? Well, that's the rules of the Constitution. If you don't like the rules, of the Constitution, change the Constitution.",

And so I think that the urgency is for the Supreme Court to act. But I think it's going to be tough for some of them, if they want to keep Trump on the ballot, if they're falling for the argument that this is undemocratic. I mean, is it undemocratic that Arnold Schwarzenegger and Jennifer Granholm can't run for president because they weren't born in the country? If you think about it, of all the forms of disqualification we have, the one that disqualifies people for engaging in insurrection is the most democratic, because it's the one where people choose themselves to be disqualified.

There are a number of states where they are, frankly, purple to blue states where Republicans have the opportunity to hang on to governor's mansions. Take a place like New Hampshire, for instance. You had Chris Sununu on earlier. There's a chance that he could be succeeded by former Senator Kelly Ayotte. There's a lot of races like that that I think are going to fly way under the radar, but are really interesting to tell us about sort of the potential future of the, I don't want to say normal wing of the Republican Party, but, certainly, there are a lot that are very popular in places you might not expect Republican...

Is he out saying, Nikki Haley stole the New Hampshire primary for me? What does that mean for the following -- the contests that come after? Does that rile up his base? I think we have seen evidence it does. But as everybody is kind of anticipating what's going to happen in the next couple of months, I think that is a huge dynamic that isn't really being discussed that will have a profound impact on the outcome.",

We want to see how that progresses this year, as we have seen that during the Trump years. The other thing is the new and the old of Donald Trump. On the new, I think his campaign actually has been incredibly well-run so far. I think Chris LaCivita and Susie Wiles and -- they run a very disciplined operation. I think it's the best campaign they have had in three tries. The old of Trump, though, is that he reserves the right to pull the rug out at any time.",
