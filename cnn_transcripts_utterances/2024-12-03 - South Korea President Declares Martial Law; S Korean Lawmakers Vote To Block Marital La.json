A keen U.S. ally is reeling after its democratically elected president declared martial law. CNN is live on the ground with the latest.Plus, booze unwanted advances and an Islamophobic chant. Those are some. Only some of the new allegations facing Donald Trump's pick to run the Pentagon as Pete Hegseth attempts damage control once again on Capitol Hill. And what's the point of the moral high ground? Top strategists from both parties will debate the question many are grappling with in the political environment, where, right now, it seems nothing matters anymore. I'm Dana Bash. Let's go behind the headlines at Inside Politics. We're going to start with that breaking news, almost 7000 miles away that could have major implications here in the United States. The president of South Korea declared martial law, but moments ago, the parliament voted his move was invalid. We've been watching the scenes unfold against the backdrop, a major questions about the qualifications of Donald Trump's picks to lead the U.S. defense and intelligence agencies. CNN's Mike Valerio is live in Seoul, right near the National Assembly. Tell us what's going on right now, Mike?",

Bringing this back to D.C., Dana, why this is so important? One of the myriad ways why this is important.We have about 30,000 U.S. troops here in South Korea. Democracy in South Korea is paramount to continue the relationship in the alliance between South Korea and the United States. Showing you what is happening, a couple yards behind me right here. If you go down this street, Dana, and then turn right, you're looking front and center at the imposing, beautiful South Korean National Assembly. All of these white busses that you see on the right, they hold about two dozen police officers. So, how we started here, we have the conservative President of South Korea, Yoon Suk Yeol, stunning the nation earlier tonight. Addressing South Korea on television and saying, because of his words, paraphrasing here, North Korean elements within government and within communist sympathizers within government, he was declaring martial law. But how he was declaring martial law and what specific elements that entailed remained unclear, stunning so many people. So, whole multitudes of protesters, came a couple yards behind us to the National Assembly to say, we got to cancel this. We have to overturn this declaration of martial law, and that is exactly what happened. Members of the opposition party, the Liberal Democratic Party were able to come back and vote by a simple majority in the legislature to overturn martial law, still astounding to say here in South Korea. So, Dana, in terms of what happens next. We're going to see the tableau, see how the president response to this. But to bring in -- let's bring in -- bring in the South Korean perspective. We met you here on the streets. You're a South Korean 18-year-old university student. Just tell our viewers in the United States and around the world, what was your reaction when you heard the news at home of martial law?",

The Biden administration, according to the National Security Council, is already in touch with South Korean counterparts as they monitor what's happening here. This matters tremendously, not just because of the military presence, but also because of the alliance in the partnership between the countries, that is -- that goes well beyond just the military.As Mike pointed out, there are 28,500 U.S. service members in South Korea. That is one of the largest presences of U.S. troops overseas. And that matters a tremendous amount, led by a four-star commander Army, General Paul LaCamera. So that is one of those elements that matters critically here, and the relationship between the two countries essentially maintaining that democracy is an important part of maintaining the U.S. troop presence there. Now we haven't gotten details on what those conversations look like, or who exactly is holding those conversations between the U.S. and South Korea, but this is certainly something the U.S. will be watching very closely and trying to have whatever influence it can to essentially make sure the democratic principles that undergird the South Korean government are not toppled by this declaration of a of military control here. So, the U.S. is watching this very closely. There have not been any changes to U.S. military force posture in South Korea at this point, no major changes to speak of. Now look, part of that may be the hour. It's two in the morning over there, and this has only been unfolding in the last several hours. So, this is something we will still watch very closely here, until there's some sort of resolution.",

This after -- over the course of the past several weeks, North Korea has launched several missiles, including the intercontinental ballistic missile, as it tested and pushed its latest technology.The question, what do they do now? And that's something the U.S. is watching very closely. North Korea has effectively, traditionally launched off missiles or carried out some sort of testing of military weaponry as a message to the U.S. and to South Korea when there are military exercises or when they feel in some way they are being encroached upon and President Yoon's statement that this was effectively North Korean actors trying to push an anti-state, North Korean message that may be enough to trigger North Korea to carry out some sort of -- some sort of either launch or military exercise of its own. Now, in the past, it has been the U.S., South Korea and Japan, coordinating very closely when they see that, is that at risk, probably at this point, probably not at risk in any way. But those are the types of questions that we will look through, that the U.S. and the Pentagon will look through, depending on how all this plays out.",

They were just as surprised as anybody else here or folks on the ground at this turn of events.I mean, just so extraordinary and unexpected that you could see the president of South Korea in year 2024 declaring martial law. That hasn't existed in that country in a number of decades since the late 1980s when the country was still under military dictatorship. The White House really hasn't said much. Oren referred to the NSC spokesperson, National Security Council spokesperson, saying, we are monitoring the situation. We are in touch with the ROK government. I just had a senior administration official telling me this is obvious. They are seriously concerned by the development. So again, I think they're just taking in what has happened and trying to process and trying to figure out what exactly their public, you know, statement and position should be. There's definitely a moment and it is coming quickly where President Biden, I think himself, needs to address this and needs to address it directly. This is a president who, of course, has talked so consistently and so frequently about the importance of protecting democracy here at home and democracies around the world and the U.S.'s role in preserving those institutions. And he will have to weigh in on how he is processing these scenes, you know, and scenes prompted by somebody who has been an ally and a leader that he has met with multiple times and really rolled out red carpet for Yoon Suk Yeol, yeah.",

The fact that this kind of thing could happen in the streets of Seoul, for folks who are in my parents' generation, certainly my grandparents' generation, this is what they lived through --(CROSSTALK) I was born in South Korea. The very last year that there was a military dictatorship. And soon after I was born, there was the first democratic presidential election that elected Roh Tae-Woo. And obviously, the country has evolved and developed so much since then. But we now talk about South Korea as one of the most important democratic countries and a vibrant democratic country in Asia that we look to and point to often as a model. So, just seeing these headlines, seeing these scenes, knowing that this is possible. I think, just in and of itself, in the context of South Korean history, is important.

      "sentences": "Yeah. The geopolitical moment within which the president-elect will be taking office is extraordinary. And I say that because, you know, to MJ's great point and to Bres's great point as well. You know, President Yoon has been an extraordinarily close ally of the Biden administration for all of his domestic turmoil and foibles, of which the administration probably doesn't want to weigh in too much.He has been critical to their Indo Pacific strategy. The relationship that they were able to establish between the Japanese leader Kishida and President Yoon was really an underappreciated success, I think diplomatically, of this White House. And that might give some window into the reticence you've seen of them to come out and say something more forcefully. Although, I think to MJ's point of what I've talked to is just stunned that this actually happened. However, this underscores the fact. This isn't just a South Korea issue, this is leaders across exactly the alliances of the United States, the critical kind of pillars of western democracy are in bad shape right now. I mean, you think about President Trump -- president-elect Trump is about to head over to France, where Emmanuel Macron government is falling apart, and there's about to be a no confidence vote. And I think the fact that the president-elect is taking power at a moment where he clearly feels more emboldened than he has ever felt based on the electoral results, based on what we've seen on Capitol Hill with his nominees that are not in any way healing to kind of a traditional norm in terms of what they represent. This president-elect is coming to power, not just thinking he can do what he wants and what he said he plans to do domestically, but also internationally. And South Korea is not an insignificant piece of his kind of broader geopolitical strategy, which diverges very sharply from the norms of the United States. Now that's what he ran on. That's what he was elected on. Do your thing, man. But this is a very different moment than it was in 2017.",
