We're told the grand jury that will make that decision will hear the case today. Sources telling CNN, a former state senator from Georgia who was subpoenaed to testify arrived just last hour.Sources also say Fulton County DA Fani Willis is expected to call multiple witnesses as she wraps up her 2020 election interference case and seeks charges against possibly more than a dozen people. What's key to understand this morning, the nature of this case and the potential legal risks for Donald Trump this time around and how that might be different than his last three indictments, because these are state charges in part. CNN's Sara Murray is live outside the courthouse. Sara, all this activity that's happening inside Donald Trump is posting brand new attacks against someone who was one of the witnesses.

That was the number that Donald Trump called Brad Raffensperger and said, find me more votes than that. This trial is taking place or this grand jury, these hearings are taking place in Fulton County. That is where Atlanta is.And very briefly, Sara Murray mentioned Coffee County. That's all the way down here in the southern part of the state. You can see Donald Trump won that with nearly 70 percent of the vote. There's just over, you know, 15,000 voters in that county. But it was in that county, there now appears to be these evidence, text messages and e-mails between Trump campaign officials and officials in this county talking about seizing and cracking open the voting machines there. All right, with us now to talk about all this is CNN contributor John Dean, former Nixon White House counsel. John, if we can, I want to start in Fulton County, where former Lieutenant Governor Geoff Duncan is going to testify tomorrow. And we just saw that social media post from Donald Trump. I'll read you the beginning again. I'm reading reports that failed former Lieutenant Governor of Georgia Geoff Duncan will be testifying before the Fulton County grand jury. He shouldn't. He then goes on to say, I barely know him, but he was right from the beginning of this witch hunt, a nasty disaster for those looking to the election fraud that took place in Georgia, et cetera, et cetera. You have the potential defendant in here talking about a witness testifying, saying he shouldn't. What are the potential problems there, John?",

I will show you what's going on here. Just in the last several minutes, about 20 to 30 protesters showed up. There's a whole other separate issue going on in the city right now with a police, fire, and training facility. Those individuals who are protesting the building of that facility have used this scene and this atmosphere outside in front of the Fulton County Courthouse to bring their own issues.The main headline, though, today, as it relates to the Fulton County investigation and the efforts by Trump and his allies to overturn the 2020 election, is that there is no credible security threat here outside of the courthouse. We have seen some dramatic increase, though, in security preparations over the course of the last several weeks. What am I talking about here? These metal barricades, these plastic barriers, we're seeing more presence of -- a heavier presence of sheriff's deputies with long guns and tactical gear. Law enforcement sources tell us there's a lot of things that we don't see happening. We can only assume that means snipers on the rooftops and other security measures that are in place here to make sure that nothing happens. There's a lot of legitimate concern about things going down here, if only because of the lack of gun laws, if only because of the large contingent of Trump supporters. And he has encouraged them to take to the streets and use really explosive rhetoric, calling this investigation politically motivated, calling Fani Willis, the district attorney here, racist. All of that has led to credible threats against the safety of Fani Willis, who's had to change her security detail. We're now seeing these security preparations here. This main street in front of the courthouse has been closed down to vehicle traffic. There is still foot traffic in anticipation as the grand jury hears evidence against Trump. And we wait for Trump's potential for the arrest and indictment. Kate?",

What's more is only 3 percent of the burn area has been searched so far using cadaver dogs. Officials say it could take months to search the entire fire zone. Today, extra search crews and 20 additional dogs are being brought in to help in the search with so many people still missing and unaccounted for. Now the state's largest power company is facing a lawsuit for not cutting the electricity when forecasters warned of the powerful wind gusts that fueled the flames.Those winds were so strong, Hawaii's governor said it created what he's called a fire hurricane. And the flames were moving 1 mile every minute. He's ordered now a comprehensive review of what happened in the early hours of the fire disaster. CNN's Mike Valerio, he's in Maui for us. He's been there, really, since the beginning. Mike, tell us what you are -- what you're, I mean, it's still obviously just after 5 o'clock in the morning.

So when people come up this ridge, we're on a cliff about a thousand feet above the Pacific Ocean to this entry route into the disaster zone.They pull over and they talk to us about the need for accountability. And Kate, I can't tell you how over the past few days more and more people, an ascending chorus of people have said that something needs to happen with the power company. Changes need to be made like have been made in California after the campfire in 2018, when 85 people died, so specifically that leads to this lawsuit that you mentioned. Over the weekend, three law firms filed a lawsuit on behalf of a couple who live in Lahaina. And essentially it accuses the utility here, Hawaiian Electric, of failing to shut off power during these dangerous conditions. With wind gusts at the, you know, peak, the crescendo of this crisis reaching 80 miles an hour, 130 kilometers an hour, claims the company's failure helped cause the fire that led to deaths and injuries. And what it's saying is that in California, for example, if there is high wind danger, PG&amp;E, the main utility for a huge portion of the state, now turns off parts of its power infrastructure. Because when you have the threat of live energized wires potentially crashing to the ground, that could set off a spark. So anguish and accountability are tied together. Listen Kate to what Susan who passed through this checkpoint a few hours ago, had to say on that front. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) [11:20:15] SUSAN SLOBODNJAK, MAUI RESIDENT: When I drove through on Friday, I had no clue what I was going through. I got so -- everything's gone. I lost friends in know, they were going back to get their animals, you know, when she died. So I mean, you know, it's really sad because people come over here, you know, I heard there was a snorkeling boat looking at Lahaina town. Give them respect, you know. It's so bad. This is, you know, people died here. You know people, I mean it's not just a vacation -- it's not just a place for vacation, we live here. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

This is the line that the fire department on this part of Lahaina held. They decided we're going to keep it here this particular neighborhood, most of it survived as a result. But let me show you the contrast right here. This is the home of Archie Kalepa. He is a legendary surfer, lifeguard, a waterman hall of famer on Maui, 9th generation Hawaiian family from the Lahaina area.And you can see what the spirit of Ohana or family in the islands means as everybody on Maui and from around the islands began flooding donations here. So they've set up a command post, improvised first responders here, all volunteers, all people from the community and they've created several of these pods around the burned area of the fire zone. You can see all the diapers and critical supplies, the water and food and people just coming in here and it's sort of a self-organizing system. Archie has great leadership experience as a lifeguard extraordinaire and it's all coming to play right now. People trust him. He does say that the state and federal response is getting a bad wrap. Let me ask you about the immediate response right now. There's a perception as we've been outside of the perimeter that there's no federal or real official state response and most of the work in the front lines are being done by people like you. Grassroots, just improvised first responders. Is that fair? What's really happening? What do you need? And what's the story? ARCHIE KALEPA, MAUI RESIDENT: I don't think that's fair. I don't think that's fair because this is a crime scene. This right here is a crime scene. And so what people don't understand is the government has to do due diligence before they start moving in. So they're at 30,000 feet. They're looking, evaluating about how they need to come in to begin to facilitate this operation. At the same time, they have to figure out how to take care of this operation. And so, you know, that is not easy.",
