      "sentences": "And welcome to THE LEAD. I'm Jake Tapper.And we begin today with multiple breaking stories, all of which will have wide-ranging impacts on the 2024 election. Moments from now in Florida, former President Donald Trump will welcome the House Speaker Mike Johnson to his Mar-a-Lago resort. The two men are holding a press conference in which they will discuss they say election security, though we should note, the last time the two teamed up on this issue, they worked to try to undermine the 2020 election. So skepticism may be warranted. We are told the two Republican leaders are expected to highlight the issue of non-citizens voting in federal elections. And if you're thinking, doesn't federal law already ban non-citizens from voting in federal elections, you would be correct. It is true. But some municipalities allow non-citizens to vote in some local elections, like the mayor of Tacoma Park, Maryland. But that said, the Republican Party is seizing on this issue to try to make a larger political issue for the run-up to November. We shall see how allegiant to the facts of the matter, Mr. Trump and Mr. Johnson will be. This Mar-a-Lago meeting comes as both men are staring down their own political challenges. Speaker Johnson facing a threat to his leadership from some of Trump's most loyal followers on Capitol Hill, the MAGA caucus, and Trump -- well, on Monday, Mr. Trump is set to become the first former president in the history of these United States to face criminal trial. Mr. Trump allegedly tried to buy the silence of former adult film star and director Stormy Daniels to cover up a dalliance. He tried to do that before the 2016 election. He's accused of. He denies this. But after months of trying to delay a trial for falsifying the business records to cover up that payment, it appears that Mr. Trump and his legal team are running out of options. The Biden campaign for its part, will, also during our show today, go on the offensive. They say over what they believe will be a winning issue for the president who is struggling in the polls, abortion rights. Vice President Kamala Harris today has been dispatched to Arizona to slam a ruling earlier this week by the state's top court that revived a 160 year-old near-total ban on abortion. The period that this law was passed was a period when women could not vote, or in many places in the United States owned property. It's a period when historian say the age of consent in Arizona was ten. We will bring you all of these events as they unfold today. Let's begin with CNN's Kristen Holmes in Palm Beach, Florida. And, Kristen, Donald Trump and Speaker Johnson, they have a history of teaming up to push out falsehoods about the elections at least to the 2020. What can we expect from today's Mar-a-Lago event?",

And I will say it is not just the mayor of Tacoma Park, but also some local school boards across the country. They also allow non-citizens to vote.But it is not a wide-scale issue and certainly not an issue in federal elections. Something that are the kind of elections that someone like Donald Trump or Mike Johnson would be focusing on. Now, I did get some pushback after talking on CNN about this issue earlier from his team, Donald Trump's team, where they said, this is also about preventing in the you char non-citizens from voting. But again, there is not much data that shows that this is a wide-scale problem in any capacity. However, we are looking at in an election year, an election year in which immigration is a top issue and we know that Donald Trump and Republicans are seeking to stoke fear around this issue. They are say that it is connected to both crime and now the election as well, Donald Trump has grown as far as to say that Democrats actually want to have undocumented immigrants coming over the border so they can help them in the 2024 election, although Republicans have put forward, lawsuits or legislation and various states and they don't want non-citizens voting. But again, Jake, as we have said, it's not a wide-scale problem this does seem to be an opportunity for Johnson to appear side by side with Donald Trump at this time.",

Not only that, let's try to weave it in to the issue that you do -- that you talk about every day, immigration, which is of great concern to voters. So if we can find a way so that we're not just talking about the 2020 election, looking at the past, but actually tie it to an issue that you're trying to fuel your candidacy with this time round. Imagine how appealing that could be for Trump, but, Jake, the statistics you point to are significant. And I think this gets lost all the time. When were talking about voter fraud or vote -- problems in voting, what we should be talking about is where that is widespread and has actual impact on outcomes, 0.0001 percent is not that, that's not an actual problem.

In terms of defending Israel, we've learned from two U.S. officials that the U.S. will also do what it can to intercept any Iranian launches or Iranian proxy launches at Israel. We have seen some of that over the course of the past few months where U.S. Navy ships in the Red Sea have intercepted Houthi drones, or rather Houthi long-range cruise and ballistic missiles targeting Israel. It is also possible that U.S. forces in Iraq and Syria with their air defenses, could try to intercept some sorts of launches that Israel, depending of course on where they came from.

We're also expecting him to talk a lot about non-citizens voting in our elections. Foreign nationals, undocumented immigrants voting in our elections, that is extremely rare. It's only allowed in some small jurisdictions, some cities. But on the federal level, it's illegal. Right-wing groups, left-wing groups, they have studied this extensively. I looked at a study where there was a billion ballots examined over 20 years and there were only 100 examples of undocumented or non-citizens voting in our elections. So, it just doesn't happen, Jake. Mail-in voting, furthermore, it's safe and secure. Lots of Republicans do it all the time. It's just not a controversial way to cast a ballot. And also, Jake, Donald Trump has claimed that Democrats made fake ballots in 2020. That's also just a total lie -- Jake.",

If you only remember one thing about Mike Johnson 2020, let it be this, hours after the insurrection on January 6, he was on the House floor and cast votes to throw out Biden's electors from Pennsylvania and Arizona. If he had his way, that would have disenfranchised 10 million voters. The will of the people in those two states would have been cast aside.Before January 6, Jake, Mike Johnson urged the U.S. Supreme Court to nullify the results from four states that Trump lost. He rallied his fellow House Republicans to sign onto an amicus brief for the court, urging them to throw out the results from four states. The court said no. And also Jake, it was Mike Johnson promoting some of the wildest conspiracy theories, not just garden variety claims about mail-in voting, but those crazy claims about dominion voting machines, flipping millions of votes. It wasn't true then, it's not true now.",

I mean, here's the interesting thing, I remember serve -- when I was serving on the committee, you know, my colleagues, my Republican colleagues would come up. And, of course, a lot of them would quietly say, good job. You know, like, I can't do it because of my district, but I'm glad you're doing it.But a few of them would say things like, you know, we just need to move on from 2020, we just have to look forward and move on. The irony of all of this is the ones that aren't moving on from 2020 right now is Donald Trump. And it's because Donald Trump is scared to death about these court cases. So it is in his interested, at least in his mind, to continue to try to shift the public narrative to convince people that the election was stolen. The interesting thing, and, of course, it wasn't, what you'll see is probably two different things between Johnson and Trump. Trump will come out with all these outlandish comments as the prior reporter announced, you know, everything from stolen election, you know, illegals, voting or whatever, what you'll see from other members and maybe this includes Speaker Johnson is like this concern about how the rules changed at the last minute. And what they're doing, Jake, because politicians are really good at signaling multiple things to multiple groups at one time, they're signaling to the election was stolen crowd that oh, yes, I have concerns about the election but they're also doing it in a way that's not embracing full-on Donald Trump-ism. And that's where they need called out, like do you agree with Donald Trump's statements, that illegals voted in the millions or are you saying something totally different?

Of course, Biden was legitimately there is zero evidence of widespread voter fraud as Attorney General Bill Barr said publicly in December 2020, and yet Republicans continue to believe that the 2020 election was illegitimate because Trump's, as it was, and its amplified by the Speaker Johnsons and the Fox Newses and all that.

That's it. That's all you have to agree on.What Donald Trump, frankly, now, Republicans have done, is convinced a significant amount of the party that even that basic compact -- that basic contract we have to have the self-govern is invalid and it's false. And that is really dangerous, especially in a country that we're proud of, the fact that we were founded on revolution. We believed that we know taxation without representation. And now, these Republicans are playing with fire, convincing their base that in fact their voice isn't heard.
