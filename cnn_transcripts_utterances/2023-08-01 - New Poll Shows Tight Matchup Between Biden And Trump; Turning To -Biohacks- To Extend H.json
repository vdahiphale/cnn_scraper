And as we all well know, no president is elected by popular vote. However, it does give us a good snapshot of where things are kind of playing out right now and how they are playing out. And if you're President Biden and his team, you're very happy to see this number, which is the Democrats who support President Biden. He has seen that number now go up to 45 percent. At this time, last year, it was at 26 percent. So again, that is news that is very welcome to Biden and his team as they start to see Democrats coalescing around the president who is now running for reelection, John.
