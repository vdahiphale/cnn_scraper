More details this hour after eight Israeli soldiers were killed in Rafah, Gaza a short time ago. The IDF revealed that soldiers' armored vehicle was hit by a side bomb while they were targeting terrorist infrastructure in a neighborhood in northwest Rafah. It's a stunning incident for Israel and one of the deadliest days for the IDF since October 7th. A short time ago, people gathered for a moment of silence to pay their respects for the eight lives lost. CNN's Oren Liebermann is joining us now live from Haifa, Israel. Oren, what are you learning?",

      "sentences": "Fredricka, as you point out, this is one of the single deadliest incidents we've seen against Israeli soldiers in Gaza since the beginning of the war. A total of eight soldiers were killed. One of those has been identified to this point, a captain who was with those eight soldiers who are part of a combat engineering brigade.The IDF says this is still under investigation, but according to what they know now, there was an explosion from what they call a side bomb near their armored personnel carriers. So an armored vehicle. Now they don't explain what a side bomb is, whether it was something affixed to the vehicle itself or a strike at the armored personnel carrier that came from the side. Regardless, the IDF says there were materials carried by that combat engineering unit as they were moving early in the morning at about 5:15 this morning. And that may have also exploded, perhaps triggered itself by the side bomb. That in and of itself is a problem because those explosive materials carried by the combat engineering unit are not supposed to explode. So all this is under investigation to figure out exactly what happened here, to try to, first, make sure this never happens again, but also get a better clarity on how it happened. The IDF says the explosion was so large that it became very difficult to identify and locate the soldiers. Meanwhile, the Al-Qassam Brigades, that is Hamas' military wing, say they laid a complex trap for the IDF unit there in northwest Rafah. They say first they targeted a military bulldozer and then when the rescue unit came in in an armored personnel carrier, that's when they attacked the armored personnel carrier. Again, for the IDF, this is still under investigation. Meanwhile, as you point out not only one of the single deadliest incidence of the war, but it's also one week since the rescue effort in which four Israeli hostages were rescued. So all of that is kind of mixing together here. And Daniel Hagari, the rear admiral who is the spokesperson for the IDF, pointed out first of course lamenting the loss of lives, but also saying in terms of the rescue effort, unfortunately, not everyone can be rescued like that again, perhaps not anyone can be rescued like that again. And meanwhile, once again, we see anti-government protests in Tel Aviv, in Jerusalem, and in other places. So that is the status as we look around here on a Saturday night.",

You heard our Oren Liebermann reporting on what's been described as a sizable explosion that perhaps this is part of a complex trap.

First, luring in the bulldozer and armored bulldozer and its crew, destroying it, and then waiting to ambush again, an armored personnel carrier with IDF soldiers who came to rescue them, and then they ambushed them as well.So clearly more details to follow, but this is the nature of urban combat, where you're fighting, you know, 360 degrees and above and below you in Gaza where you have enemy coming out of the tunnels beneath them. So there'll be much to learn in the coming days about what happened. And I'm sure the IDF would be taking actions to make sure it doesn't happen again, because as we know they could do to conduct operations in central and northern Gaza, and the ongoing operations in Rafah remains.

I think it brings them together. Look, I'm frankly not confident, I don't believe that Hamas wants to cut a deal because -- or that a deal is possible between them and Israel because the two key things that they want are in contravention of one another.Hamas wants Israel completely out of Gaza, and they want the war to end. They want a permanent end to the war. And Israel doesn't want either of those because they want to continue the conflict. They want to get rid of Hamas and they want to make sure Hamas never comes back to govern, to rule Gaza once again. And those two key aims are in conflict with one another. And, you know, Hamas is never going to give up the most important leverage it has, which are the hostages, which interestingly, and we've talked about this before I think, nobody knows how many of those hostages are still alive. Could be 75 we think is the best number, but could be far fewer. And I hate to say that, but, you know, Hamas is playing their hand pretty aggressively when it comes to these negotiations.

The view is if Donald Trump wins, Putin will be in a better situation vis-a-vis the conflict. Now, I say all that, but it's important to note also that this peace conference in Switzerland began with a great gust of wind to its back. And that was coming out of the G7 Summit where the G7 leaders took an aggressive stance, a more aggressive stance against Russia with regard to committing to provide military and economic funding for the next 10 years. And by the same token took a more aggressive stance with regard to China, criticizing them in multiple accounts with regard to their supply of dual use items to the conflict. And then also took them to task with regard to economic matters that affect the G7. So very interesting confluence events from the G7 moving into this peace conference.",

The U.S., in a similar show of force, revealing that the USS Helena, a fast-attack nuclear submarine, is now in Guantanamo Bay. And we've now gotten an exclusive first-hand look at the Russian forces in Cuba.Here now as CNN's Patrick Oppmann. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) PATRICK OPPMANN, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Several hundred Cubans wait in the broiling sun to tour a Russian warship. Russian diplomats told me the public would be allowed to visit the Admiral Gorshkov, one of the most modern warships in President Vladimir Putin's navy, capable of firing hypersonic missiles that travel at more than 6,000 miles per hour. It's the first of three days the ship will receive visitors. A rare opportunity for people here to see up close a frigate belonging to Cuba's Cold War-era comrades. We're going to get in line and see if we're able to get aboard. (Voice-over): After nearly three hours waiting, having my Cuban resident I.D. card run through a database by police and passing through metal detectors, we are told to board the Gorshkov. Just next to us is the nuclear nuclear-powered submarine Kazan, the first of its kind to come to port here. The visit of the four Russian ships, the largest Russian convoy in Cuba in years, is not a threat to the U.S., both Russian and Cuban officials say. But the U.S. is closely tracking these ships and their movements. A sign in English by the gang plank to the Gorshkov says the ship's, quote, \"main purpose is combat operations against enemy surface ships and submarines,\" although none of the vessels were currently carrying nuclear weapons, the Cuban Armed Forces Ministry said. Hello, I say in rudimentary Russian to the sailors aboard the Gorshkov. We are only allowed on the main deck and Russian sailors watch our every move. A deck above us were sophisticated communications equipment is visible. A soldier armed with an assault rifle keeps guard. Cuba, good? (Voice-over): These sailors could be fighting in the war in Ukraine and seemed to enjoy the peace and tranquility of the Caribbean. Sailors show me anti-rocket defense systems and a cannon they say can fire 23 kilometers, nearly 15 miles. After only the briefest of tours, we're told it's time for us to disembark. We say our goodbyes to our Russian hosts. As we leave, this Russian sailor count us one by one to make sure no one stays behind to learn the secrets of a Russian warship stationed just 90 miles from the U.S. coast.

We've got a heat dome, that area of high pressure that's going to set up across the Southern and Central Plains this weekend, but it moves it to the Midwest and the northeast as we go into the workweek.Now we're looking at more than 360 daily records falling. Those are both daytime highs and overnight lows because we get no relief at night with temperatures sitting up near 80 degrees for a lot of places, again, up in the Great Lakes and then going into the northeast. So just incredible. The heat risk is on the extreme side. This is a map that goes to show where we need to be the most worried about heat sickness, where we really need to watch out for those signs and symptoms. And you can see that they're extreme heightened levels from the Midwest up into the Great Lakes there, across Chicago. And then by Wednesday it's up in Ohio and upstate New York, really watching out for some of these signs and symptoms especially in children, elderly, and pets. Temperatures swelter in Atlanta, looking at some middle 90s through the weekend. Temperature is getting to the upper 90s in St. Louis, 98 degrees is your forecast for Sunday. Chicago, 98 degrees on Monday, not quite a place that you think about getting extreme triple-digit heat, but we're getting close to it by Sunday and Monday of this week, even lingering into Tuesday. Average for Chicago this time of year is 81 degrees. So the overnight low temperatures will be closer to that daytime average than the daytime temperatures with these overnight lows sitting up near 80 degrees. So, again, getting no relief at night. And a place like Chicago given, really think of it for extreme heat. But their summer is warming since 1970, June, July, August has a 1.5 degree fever. And what that means is that we find more warm above average days in the summer season. Eight of them, eight more days above average in summer in Chicago. And again, we find these trends at night that these temperatures continue to get even warmer at night. And that's even worse for heat sickness because you don't get any opportunity to cool off.",

You think about, wow, Babe Ruth hit home runs here. Mickey Mantle hit a ball there. In Rickwood Field, there's been over 130 Hall of Famers that either coached or played in that ballpark. So you just feel that presence.And then we went to Willie's old neighborhood. I travelled around with his son, Michael. It was really, really special. And I think Major League Baseball is going to do an amazing job honoring Willie and all the Negro Leaguers that came with him to the big leagues.",

He also -- that's the talent.

The world's best golfers are battling some high temperatures and a brutally tough Pinehurst course as they arrive for this year's third major title.
