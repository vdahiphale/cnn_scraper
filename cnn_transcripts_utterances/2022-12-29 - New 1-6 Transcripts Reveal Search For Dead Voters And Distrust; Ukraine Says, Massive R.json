Ukraine condemning the strikes as senseless barbarism.And Congressman-elect George Santos now faces federal and state investigation for fabrication and outright lies. Now, even a claim he made about his mother is under scrutiny after he linked her death to 9/11. Welcome to our viewers here in the United States and around the world. I'm Wolf Blitzer. You're in THE SITUATION ROOM. Tonight, we have a new window into the previously unseen testimony in the January 6th investigation. The House select committee going public with a significant new batch of transcripts, including the panel's interview with Donald Trump Jr. CNN Political Correspondent Sara Murray is here with me in THE SITUATION ROOM. She has been going through all this new material. Sara, this round of transcripts involved some members of Trump's inner circle. What are you learning?",

I mean, we've reported on how important the Mark Meadows, Trump's former White House chief of staff, texts were for this committee, and we see it again in the committee's interview with Donald Trump Jr. He is texting Mark Meadows during the riot while it's unfolding, saying we need an oval address. He has to lead now, talking about his father. It's gone too far and gotten out of hand.So, the committee in their interview with Donald Trump Jr. follows up and says, sort of explain this, explain this text. And he said, Don Jr., I think the gravitas of the situation and Oval Office address, an address to the people of the United States, it would do a lot more than a tweet. Even if they say the exact same thing, sometimes you have to do it in person. So, Donald Trump Jr., who is not with his father while this was happening, was trying to make it clear to Mark Meadows the urgency of the situation that his dad needed to act. Now, we also got some interesting revelations from the Christina Bobb transcript. She was member of Trump's legal team. She is recounting a conversation she had with South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham, who was very eager apparently to help the Trump team with their claims of election fraud. So, in her recollection of this conversation, she says, the senator said to her, just give me five dead voters. Give me, you know, an example of illegals voting. Just give me a very small snapshot that I can take and champion. Now, obviously a small snapshot, five dead voters, that was not going swing the election into Donald Trump's favor, but that's what the senator was looking for to be able tout the publicly. After the rioters stormed the Capitol, Senator Lindsey Graham eventually voted to confirm the election results.",

She took issue with Sidney Powell, who became a member of the legal team and was kicked off the legal team, as well as Rudy Giuliani, who was the former president's lawyer, essentially saying she didn't necessarily believe that these people were looking out for the former president's best interests, Wolf.",

ZOE LOFGREN (D-CA):  Well, it looks like an excuse for promoting the lie rather than evidence that the lie was true. And, clearly, in the end, it was clear that the ex-president was pursuing, you know, a strategy even he knew was false. He knew he lost the election and he lied about it and he talked millions of people into believing it. You'd have to ask the senator whether he believed it or whether he was part of the conspiracy.",

And so what is happening is that the discussion is becoming about the transcripts and not about the report.And there is, as we start to look through all of the content of these transcripts, for example, some of the information that's in the transcripts from the former acting secretary of defense, the former army secretary, there is a real disconnect between some of the problems that those individuals described in their depositions before and their interviews before the committee and the lack of accompanying recommendations in the actual report. The report itself is over 800 pages. And so what I'm observing is that I think that so much of the committee's focus is on these transcripts and sort of some of the narrative that's around it or the dynamics or the politics or the atmosphere versus substance of what could have been more in the committee's report.",

But the recommendations as a national security lawyer, particularly with respect to the security situation in Washington, the lack of security on January 6th, 2021, and the potential opportunity that the committee had to make recommendations to make sure there was never such a security situation again, I think the committee falls flat in terms of its recommendation.",

But I do think for the Justice Department, it is important to have the full body of evidence. We've seen that with folks already gone to trial. They want to know what did you tell other investigators. Did you say something that we need to hand over, because maybe it's exculpatory, or did you say something where you tied yourself into a knot?

Thank you very, very much.Just ahead, we'll go live to Ukraine to witness some of the destruction from Russia's deadly new missile barrage and hear from residents who escaped with their lives. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) [18:15:00] BLITZER:  Tonight, parts of Ukraine are reeling from a deadly missile bombardment, one of the biggest air assaults by Russia since the war began. CNN Senior International Correspondent Ben Wedeman is on the scene for us in Kyiv. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BEN WEDEMAN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice over): Dawn breaks and the strikes begin. Phone video captures a Russian cruise missile heading toward Kyiv. Russia fired nearly 70 missiles, plus drones at targets across Ukraine. Air defenses managed to take down most of them. But this Kyiv suburb did not escape unharmed. The mayor of Kyiv says that all 16 missiles fired in the direction of the capital were successfully intercepted, but as a result of those interceptions, debris fell to the ground in this location, massive destruction. A 14-year-old girl was injured as well as her mother and a man nearby. Tetyana was at work. That girl, her granddaughter, and Halena (ph), called her desperate for help. She was really scared and in hysterics, Tetyana says. She cried, grandma, the house was hit, it's on fire. She told me, my mother is unconscious under the rubble. Not for the first time the crews worked to clear the rubble of homes and lives shattered by war. Serhii lives just down the street. How is it possible that we do this to each other, he asks. I understand that this rocket didn't target this place, but how is it possible to shell peaceful people? In another part of Kyiv, 79-year-old Leonid is still in his bathrobe. He was jarred awake when missile debris smashed into the ground next to his house, setting his son, Alexander's (ph) car on fire, shattering windows and walls, ripping trees out by the roots. Yet he remains stoic. I was born in World War II, so I'm very calm about explosions, Leonid says. Today, I was only worried about my son. His son is fine. Ukrainian officials insist Russia's target yet again was the country's energy infrastructure. Kyiv Mayor Vitalii Klitschko is blunt.",

By the same token, the Ukrainians want the Russians out of their country. They want the Russian military out of their land. And there is no indication that Putin is ready to do that.So, I don't think it's going to be on the diplomatic table. I think it's going to be on the battlefield. The battlefield will determine. And there I think the Ukrainians have the advantage.

Those areas were basically taken by surprise in some tactical incidents. And that kind of a surprise is the lucky break that the Ukrainians need.I also think that the introduction of something like the Patriot can be helpful, and perhaps other weapon systems as well, some that we have not necessarily talked about that much, like the JDAM, the direct attack munitions that use GPS-guided systems to make the so-called dumb bombs smart that will increase their ability to use as guidance systems and make their targeting much more accurate. When that happens, that's going to be a really big deal and that can really help the Ukrainians. I would also say, Wolf, look at the battle around Kreminna.

The House committee is expected to release the documents in the morning.CNN national correspondent Kristen Holmes is here with me with a preview. Kristen, Trump has fought for a very, very long time to try to keep his tax information secret, but now it's about to be made public. KRISTEN HOLMES, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  That's right. What we know so far is after a years' long legal battle, the Democratic-led House Ways and Means Committee will be releasing Trump's taxes tomorrow morning. What we're expecting to see is six years of returns. This is from 2012 to 2020. It will include his personal tax returns, the federal, as well as some of his business tax returns. It would also include IRS audit materials. Now this is a huge deal, because as you said, Trump has spent decades shielding the public from his financial information. In fact, when he was president, he became one of the first presidents in modern history not to release his tax returns. And in part, this is because he was protecting his image. He built an entire brand on the idea that he was a wealthy and therefore successful businessman. If you remember, when he was running for president, he ran in part on that idea. That if he could successfully run a business, then he could successfully run the nation. And now the question is what is actually going to be seen when this committee kind of pulls the curtain back on all of this. Now, we do have some information. We have the Joint Committee on Taxation which has done an analysis of all of this. One thing they've looked into is his income tax. We have the numbers. 2017, he only paid $750 in income tax. 2018 and' 19, he paid $1.1 million. And in 2020, he paid zero dollars in income tax. The other interesting thing, the committee raises questions about his charitable donations and if they were really looked into enough because so many of them were paid for in cash. But again, Wolf, this is a big deal. This is something he has protected for years. And we'll see what they yield.",

But even in the United States, certainly around the world, also huge. But in the United States, there are several generations of people, including me and maybe you as well who really had never heard of soccer until they heard of Pele. That is when he signed with the New York Cosmos in 1975 and at the age of 35 came to play in the United States. And at that time, American kids, boys and girls were not playing soccer the way that they are now at age 4 and 5. There weren't the organized leagues. If anything, boys were playing baseball. Girls were playing tennis. So, all of the sudden we were introduced to this incredible magical player Pele. And we got a chance to see what soccer was. In many ways, Pele was Johnny Appleseed. He brought soccer to the United States. We talked about the men's World Cup recently, the U.S. men's national team, of course, the incredible successfully U.S. women's national team, Wolf, none of that happens, or at least it happens in a very different way, certainly not accelerated by, of course, Pele. It would have been a very different story. But, Pele brought his love of soccer to the United States for those three magical years in the mid- to late 1970s. That introduced, generations of Americans to the game that at that point we didn't know much about. So, an incredible historical figure in sports and throughout culture, and, of course, a great loss to the sports world and to everyone in general.",
