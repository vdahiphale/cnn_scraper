(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SALMA ABDELAZIZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Kevin Spacey was brought to tears as the jury found him not guilty of all nine sexual offense charges against him. This brought to an end the nearly four-week trial in which very serious accusations were brought against the award winning actor, including seven counts of sexual assault and the most serious offense rather of causing a person to engage in penetrative sexual activity without consent. This potentially could have resulted in a decades' long prison sentence but, of course, now Kevin Spacey found again cleared of all these charges, found not guilty on all nine counts. Kevin Spacey appeared to leave, he spoke to reporters outside the courtroom, thanking the courtroom staff, thanking the jurors, saying he was humbled by the decision. But what played out over the course of these four weeks was absolutely riveting, not just for the city but for all of those who followed this case. Prosecutor bringing forward the accusations of four men dating back to a period between the early 2000s and 2010s when Kevin Spacey was the artistic director of a theater not far from this courtroom, the Old Vic Theater. The prosecutor, he painted Kevin Spacey as she says, as the sexual bully, who quote, \"delight in making others feel powerless\". Kevin Spacey of course, hit back at this during the trial, admitting that he is a big flirt in his own words, saying he was sexually promiscuous, saying he did enjoy the company of young people, but of course, saying that didn't make me a bad person, denying all these charges, maintaining his innocence throughout saying that he had looked forward to the opportunity to his day in court to maintain his innocence. Of course in his mind, in Kevin Spacey's mind he has accomplished that. These incidences all surfaced in the wake of the #metoo movement, so this could potentially be seen as a blow to that movement. But for Kevin Spacey, today he feels he is victorious, and looks to try to get back, reclaim his award-winning acting career. Salma Abdelaziz, CNN -- London. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
