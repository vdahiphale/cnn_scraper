Well, the Big Board pulled, but you can seethe Dow is off about one quarter of a point or about 75 points right now. Those are the markets and these are the main events. The Biden administration under pressure to expel Jair Bolsonaro from the US after supporters of the former President stormed government buildings in Brazil. We will have a live report. In Hong Kong meantime, tearful reunions as China lifts border restrictions. And Rolls Royce celebrates a record year as the super-rich just keep on spending despite economic anxiety. The CEO joins me live. Live from New York, it is Monday, January 9th. I'm Rahel Solomon in for Richard Quest and this is QUEST MEANS BUSINESS. We begin in Brazil where the President is vowing to punish rioters who he says carried out a terrorist attack on the government. The Justice Minister says that about 1,500 people have been arrested since Sunday's violence. That's when crowds stormed the Supreme Court, Congress, and presidential palace. The supporters of former President Jair Bolsonaro claim without evidence that last year's election was stolen from him. After touring the damage, President Lula da Silva called the riots barbaric. Police say they've now cleared out the camps of Bolsonaro supporters in the capital. Condemnation out of the attacks has flooded in from around the world. President Biden releasing a joint statement with the Mexican and Canadian leaders saying they support Brazil in safeguarding its democratic institutions. We are also expecting to hear from Mr. Biden in the next few hours. And several US lawmakers calling for former President Bolsonaro to be sent back to Brazil. He has been in Florida since the end of his term. Democratic Congressman Joaquin Castro told CNN why he is a danger in the US. Listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. JOAQUIN CASTRO (D-TX): I stand with the democratically elected leadership in Brazil, and he basically use the Trump playbook to inspire domestic terrorists to try to take over the government. And you're right it looks a lot like January 6 in the United States. And right now Bolsonaro is in Florida and he is actually very close to Donald Trump. He should be extradited to Brazil.

He has never conceded that he lost the election, the runoff election on October 30th, and even though he was not actively telling his supporters to protest, he wasn't doing anything to dispel the notions and the lies flying in Brazil about what had happened during the election.

There were fires. There were even policemen who were in horses that were thrown off their horses. So it was a very, very grave situation in Brasilia, Brazil's Federal capital. I myself am in Sao Paulo right now, which is our financial capital. But I have lived in Brasilia for almost three years and I can say that the streets are very calm and the calm of the streets in Brasilia were transformed into a huge riot. We could see through the footage where the policemen were not able to prevent the invasion through the barricades, the barricades that were already in the Planalto, which is where all the three powers are established. So it is a very grave situation in which the damage will be -- there will be a lot of time for the damage, all the damage, to be recuperated. The fact of the matter is that right now, at least 1,500 people have been detained either for investigation or even been arrested. The President of the three powers, the executive power, the legislative, and also the judiciary power had a note today earlier this morning, a statement in which they condemned what they called acts of terrorism, vandalism, criminal, and coup-like activities. Also, even though the Parliament was completely -- part of the Parliament is completely destroyed, I mean, inside the rooms, the paintings, chairs, the Congressmen decided today that there will be a Parliamentary Inquiry to decide who will be held accountable, who will be held responsible for all this situation. So the authorities have already been speaking today, one day after the storming the ransacking of Brazil's Planalto, to actually Brasilia's -- the Federal capital Governor Ibaneis Rocha was taken away from his public position today, for a period of 90 days by Supreme Federal Court Minister Alexandre de Moraes and the Secretary of Justice and Security was also fired. That was also yesterday. So the authorities have now been moving in the sense to first decide who will be held accountable for all this situation as Rafael had already brought here to this discussion. Former President Jair Bolsonaro, and his supporters believe without proof that the electoral system was rigged, and that has been one of the claims of the supporters so that they are in these camps around Brasilia and all around Brazil, but the fact of the matter is that it will be -- it will take a lot of time for all the situation to be calmed down to normal. And now, authorities are deciding how to proceed regarding everything that has been destroyed, but also how to proceed so that this does not happen again.",

You know, they say that they could still get a soft landing here in the United States, they only see a one in three chance of a recession, and yet, David Solomon, the CEO of Goldman Sachs is going forward with this pretty significant cost cutting. A person familiar with the matter telling CNN that about 3,200 people at Goldman Sachs are expected to lose their jobs this week as part of this cost cutting move. It is no secret that Goldman Sachs, like a lot of other banks on Wall Street, they've been hurt by this slowdown in dealmaking. You know, IPOs, M&amp;A, SPACs, debt offerings, you name it, all of them have come down sharply. Goldman Sachs investment banking revenue fell by 57 percent year-over-year in the third quarter. So they are preparing for, you know, the potential that there won't be a big rebound in deal making, and that maybe there is more trouble ahead in the economy. So, you know, it feels like, Rahel, every day we are hearing about another round of layoffs. This week, it is Goldman Sachs; last week, Amazon, Salesforce, Stitch Fix -- so you've got to wonder whether or not we're going to hear from more Wall Street banks that they're planning to cut some costs, too.",

This may not necessarily be a good time to be trying to raise more money through selling stock.

Younger ones are now able already in early ages to accumulate quite some fortune, and to run a proper business far easier than it might have been 15 years ago, where you needed to have real estate or investments into machinery and so on. So, I think that demographic change within the ultra-high net worth individuals also underlined our success in a way that far more younger ones are now belonging to this group of ultra- high net worth individuals as ever before.

Then obviously, we introduced also the right product. It started with Wraith (INAUDIBLE) then later followed by Dawn, the beautiful convertible.

The S&amp;P is off, we'll call it about flat.  The Dow is off three-tenths of one percent. But take a look at the NASDAQ, it's now off about half a percent. You might remember earlier in the show, it was up about one percent. So, off of that high. And if you can afford a Rolls Royce, you're probably not too worried about high inflation.
