The suspect in this New Orleans attack is believed to have -- his last known address is believed to be just beyond those police lights you see behind me, and that's why investigators have been here. They've been very tightlipped as to exactly what they've been doing and what they have found at this point. But it wasn't until late last night, as I mentioned, that we understand that they began the search process of the residence here. The FBI say that this search is connected to that investigation in New Orleans. But we've learned a lot about this suspect here in the last 24 hours in various court documents that describe a man who was facing financial troubles in court documents related to a child support case that was filed by the mother of two of his children. The suspect talked about being in debt -- credit card debt and businesses that were losing money as well. And in a YouTube video he talked about how he was born and raised in the city of Beaumont just east of the Houston area and right on the Louisiana border. But several neighbors I spoke to yesterday who live in the area just around where this suspect lived say they didn't have much interaction with him. Just the typical hi and bye that you would -- you might say to a neighbor you didn't know particularly well. But investigators here are continuing. We hope to learn some more here throughout the day as to exactly what was found.

Clip from Sony Pictures \"It End With Us.\" WAGMEISTER (voiceover):  Baldoni and his team saying the newspaper was party to a \"vicious smear campaign\" by Lively who filed an earlier complaint accusing Baldoni of sexual harassment on set and retaliation during the promotion of the film. It's just the latest salvo in an ongoing dispute between the two actors that erupted during production of the movie in which Baldoni plays Lively's on-screen abusive husband. The complaint filed by Baldoni and a total of 10 plaintiffs, including his producing partners and publicist, states the Times \"relied almost entirely on Lively's unverified and self-serving narrative, lifting it nearly verbatim while disregarding an abundance of evidence...\" Lively's original complaint was filed with the California Civil Rights Department almost two weeks ago and was first obtained by The New York Times. It alleges Baldoni and his team tried to destroy Lively's reputation after she raised concerns about \"repeated sexual harassment and other disturbing behavior by Mr. Baldoni.\" The Times published their article December 21 highlighting excerpts from the civil rights complaint, including text messages from a crisis P.R. manager for Baldoni that say, \"...we can bury anyone.\" The New York Times telling CNN they will \"vigorously defend against the lawsuit,\" saying \"Our story was meticulously and responsibly reported. It was based on a review of thousands of pages of original documents, including the text messages and emails.\"",
