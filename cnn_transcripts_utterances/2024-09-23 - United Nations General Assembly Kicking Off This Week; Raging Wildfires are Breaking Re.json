The right answer here is sea turtles. They face a number of dangers like prey and pollution, and all seven species are endangered. With sea turtles facing so many threats, efforts to protect them are underway. One island on the coast of Georgia has become a safe haven for sea turtles. During nesting season, only red lights are allowed on the beach at night because other light colors can be disruptive to hatchlings. CNN`s Elisa Raffa gives us a look at the most robust sea turtle conservation effort in the country. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ELISA RAFFA, CNN WEATHER ANCHOR AND CORRESPONDENT (voice over): A trek from sand to sea. (On camera): Someone got stuck in a footprint, but he made it out. (Voice over): Leaving behind their own tracks as they follow the glow of the moonlight. (On camera): We don`t want to use any other type of white light that could disorient them or confuse them. (Voice over): The red lights guide experts on nighttime patrols as they check on nest.",

We are just about to get on to Driftwood Beach. RAFFA (voice over): Scientists and students have been monitoring the beaches of Jekyll Island, Georgia for more than 50 years. Today, Davide Zailo and his research team continue that work on one of the most robust sea turtle conservation programs in the country. (On camera): Sea turtles really respond to temperature, so the experts here do a lot of patrols late at night and early in the morning, when those temperatures are coolest. (Voice over): More intense storms and higher seas could flood these nests more often, eroding habitats moms need to lay these eggs.",

Now that we know exactly where that egg chamber is, we`ll put a flag here. Grab some managed materials. And we`re going to put this right center over this nest. RAFFA (voice over): A mom can lay more than a hundred eggs at a time, but for every 1,000 eggs laid, only one hatchling makes it to adulthood, an increasingly difficult feat due to climate change.

RAFFA (voice over): Eggs incubating in an environment temperature cooler than 82 degrees hatch male, hotter than 88 degrees hatch female. As our climate warms and many more eggs are hatching as female, creating an imbalanced gender ratio for an already endangered species.",

RAFFA (voice over): Reducing plastic, regulating coastal development and paying attention while boating and fishing are huge steps that help these little ones take more of these steps. These tiny but mighty turtles waddled the Earth with the dinosaurs, now facing their toughest test of resilience against our warming climate and changing coast to find their way back home.
