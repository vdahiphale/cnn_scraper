Let -- you know, first, there's time to figure out what happened -- I can give you a rough scenario of where mistakes were made. I'm not trying to blame anybody.But there's no question that there were -- you know, we face an unprecedented situation because there were massive fires in other parts of the island that drew resources. And the way Maui is set up is that each area has a fire department, and when there's a fire going out of control, units get sent to other areas to help out. But they keep -- obviously, keep some back. But the problem here is, the biggest fire that was out of control was up in Kula, and I have a feeling that a lot of fire -- a lot of the resources from, not just Maui -- from Lahaina but from elsewhere in the island were up in Kula. And then Lahaina exploded, and whoever was in charge needed to make a crazy, awful decision which was, do you sacrifice Kula, which is up on Haleakala which is the bigger part of Maui and it's a residential area, but it's very spread out. It's large lot. Very spread out. Lot, you know, big -- you know, often multiacre properties and not nearly as densely populated. Do you sacrifice Kula and pull everything back to Lahaina, or for some reason it appears that they really focused on containing the blaze in Kula first. Then I don't know what the protocol is and I don't know what decisions were made. I don't -- you know, I have -- I understand that the --",

It just has to go through other means, like subpoenas or cooperation orders. There are all of these other areas.

Josh, their faces are -- some of them covered. They're -- they've got their hoodies on. Hard to see them. Has there been any movement on identifying any of these suspects? JOSH CAMPBELL, CNN SECURITY CORRESPONDENT:  So, no key leads that we're aware of by police and that's because, as you mentioned, it's so hard to investigate these. The suspects were clad with masks. These smash-and-grab operations typically happen without warning. The people are out of there within a minute or so. But nevertheless, that investigation is under way. Just to set the scene for our viewers, this was Saturday afternoon here in the Los Angeles area. You had shoppers out at a mall. You had employees just going about their business.

So, this new filing yesterday from Hunter Biden's legal team shows that they're not just going to go quietly on this move by the special -- by David Weiss now, the special counsel, to scrap what plans they had in place. So, they're saying that they believe, Biden's team believes that this deal they had on a gun possession charge is still valid and binding. So, they're arguing to the judge that that should still stand. That was a 24-month period where a gun felony charge would be dismissed if Biden agreed to certain conditions. They're saying that is still in place.Now, prosecutors in a court filing on Friday told the judge that they had reached an impasse on both this gun deal and a plea deal relating to two tax misdemeanor charges. So, they were telling the judge that they don't think that this deal still exists. So, the judge who questioned this deal at the hearing last month, who said she thought it might be unconstitutional is now giving prosecutors until noon tomorrow to weigh in. Now, all that said, one of Hunter Biden's attorneys, Abbe Lowell, was on CNN Friday and on some other programs over the weekend. Where he's saying that even though there's the appointment of the special counsel, he thinks they'll end up where they were, and that is trying to resolve these charges short of a trial. He was on CBS's \"Face the Nation\" yesterday and was asked if a trial is inevitable. Here's what he said.
