I'm Michael Smerconish in Philadelphia.I've often wanted to make a point about post catastrophe pressers only then change my mind due to concerns about decorum. But not today. I'm talking about what often follows a school shooting, an air disaster or instance of terrorism. Too often they become opportunities for grandstanding politicians when all the public wants is the latest information and to know whether we're safe. Twice this week we needed that knowledge. First, after a 42-year-old suspect drove through a crowded street in the iconic French Quarter of New Orleans on New Year's Day, killing 14 and injuring dozens. And again hours later, after a Tesla Cybertruck exploded outside the Trump International Hotel in Las Vegas, the briefings that followed became a study in contrasts. New Orleans was notable for politicians sharp elbows. Las Vegas for a sober, straightforward delivery of the latest information. New Year's Day in New Orleans, there were two briefings actually. In the first, the mayor of New Orleans, LaToya Cantrell, referred to the event as terrorism. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MAYOR LATOYA CANTRELL, (D) NEW ORLEANS: First of all, we do know that the city of New Orleans was impacted by a terrorist attack. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Perhaps her word choice explains, doesn't justify, but explains what occurred at the second briefing that day. Wednesday afternoon, a gaggle of politicians and law enforcement representatives assembled.You had a number of sheriffs, the police chief, state attorney general, plus the governor, a U.S. senator, a member of Congress and a representative of the Sugar Bowl, which by the way was prudently postponed for a day. Sadly, because of the amount of tragedy and gun violence in our society, we've become accustomed to seeing these types of events in which politicians gather round a podium, some sporting outerwear that displays their names and or the insignia of their office, even if we already know who they are. This time, there were nine different speakers at this press conference. The FBI special agent in charge said the truck attack was an act of terror. And there was gratitude, expressed, appropriately so, for the cops who valiantly took down the terrorist. But there was also lots of praise for one another and their respective agencies. Essentially, these folks were congratulating one another for doing what they've been hired and elected to do. Things took a worse turn when Louisiana Senator John Kennedy was invited to speak. His contempt for federal investigators, I thought, was palpable and I believe invited conspiracy thinking. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. JOHN KENNEDY (R-LA): Did talk to the Secretary of Homeland Security a little while ago, and I told him that with all the respect I could muster, I need to tell the American people the truth and the people of New Orleans the truth and the people of America the truth. I will promise you this, I will -- when it is appropriate and this investigation is complete, you will find out what happened and who was responsible, or I will raise fresh hell. And I will chase those in the federal government who are responsible for telling us what happened like they stole Christmas. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

But as for the aftermath, it was too many people with not enough to say to justify their presence.Now compare Las Vegas, because there on New Year's Day, a Tesla Cybertruck exploded outside the Trump International Hotel. The 37- year-old male suspect died by suicide and was an active member in the military. So far, investigators have found no direct connection between the Vegas blast and the terrorist attack in New Orleans. They apparently both use the same app to rent their vehicles and each served in the army, including stints at Fort Bragg. On Thursday, I watched Metropolitan Police Sheriff Kevin McMahill lead a Las Vegas briefing. And what a difference in comparison to New Orleans. The sole speakers were Sheriff McMahill, the FBI special agent in charge of Las Vegas, and the Assistant Special Agent in Charge of the ATF. In other words, no politicians, no personalized garb, no sharp elbows, no self-congratulations, no partisan jokes about the media, just cops and prosecutors dispassionately telling the public what it needed to know based on the best available information.

They've intentionally said, look, I don't want to get married. I don't want to have kids. Maybe I don't want to do what my parents did.Then you just say, sure enough, like the old people can roll their eyes and say, oh, young people today. But that's just them doing it differently. But that's not what the data suggests. The data suggests that actually, men in particular still want to have children. They still want to get married. They still want to form families. It's just that for some reason they're not able to. And I think that's a mixture of it speaks a bit to your -- the segment you just had with James Carville. It's a mixture, as always, of economics and culture. This is partly just, you know, young men in particular feeling like they're not -- they're not doing as well economically as they -- as they need to. But it's also, I think, this has to be said that there's a growing gap in many ways between young men and young women. We see that in politics. We see that in culture. And one thing, I think, we know for sure now is the -- a battle of the sexes is not great for the dating market. And you're seeing some of that playing out. Now, a third of men under 30 are not dating. Twenty- four percent of men still living at -- living at home in their 20s, as you just pointed out. And so, we're seeing something that -- honestly, Michael, I didn't used to worry about this delay. I'm now worried about it because I do think we're moving from this is just happening later to it's just not happening.",

So, I know you've talked a lot about on this show about vocational training, apprenticeships, the fact that male wages have flatlined over the last 20 years. This is not -- as you've said, it's not just an issue for men, it's an issue for our society.And the second thing is that we just need to lower the temperature around some of these cultural issues, some of these political issues that, I think, have really driven a wedge between many young men and young women. And so, we've got to find a way back towards each other. This chasm that we now see opening up between millennial men and millennial women, I think, that's an underlying factor that is driving a lot of the trends you've just described here is that -- the thing is about men and women is that typically they're going to form families together. And so, if both sides aren't doing well, that's a problem. We have to rise together. And right now, it looks like it's the economic and social prospects of young men that are the big issue facing us.",

What's enough to kind of form a family?There's no question, as Rachel's essay in the \"Wall Street Journal\" points out, that to some extent, this is just about our expectations of what's necessary to form a family are running kind of way ahead of where they need to be. But I think there's something going on here that is a bit deeper than I'd perhaps thought earlier, which is that we haven't created a culture in which it's easy enough for men and women to kind of form these families, to buy a home, to start out in life. And so, for a long time, I've just been looking at this and thinking, look, maybe this generation is just hitting pause. It will be fine. As this data is coming in, I'm worried that we haven't hit pause. For many of them, it's a stop. And back to your earlier question, Michael. This is not what most of them say they want. Like most men and even women want to have kids. They want to get married. They want to -- they maybe want to have a family later than their parents, maybe differently. They still want to do it. And right now, there's something about our culture and our economy that's just making that harder than it needs to be. And God knows it's hard enough anyway without making it harder.",
