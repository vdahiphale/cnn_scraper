House, Senate, governor, and what we found repeatedly was Republicans shifting their positions or downplaying them. In some cases, these changes have been settled. But in other cases, they've been rather overt with candidates reversing course on supporting outright abortion bans, or even denying they ever opposed it.I now want to walk our viewers through some of them. Lets take Kari Lake. She is running for Senate in Arizona. Now the Arizona Supreme Court this week ruled that an 1864 law banning nearly all abortions in the state must be upheld. But back when Lake ran a failed bid for governor in 2020, listen to what she said about the law. (BEGIN AUDIO CLIP) KARI LAKE (R), THEN-ARIZONA GUBERNATORIAL CANDIDATE:  I'm incredibly thrilled that we are going to have a great law that's already on the books. I believe it's ARS 13-3603. So it will prohibit abortion in Arizona except to save the life of a mother. And I think were going to be setting the -- paving the way and setting course for other states to follow.

She opposes it. Just like President Trump, Kari is opposed to the territorial law and is calling on the state legislature to fix the issue.Her focus is on saving babies and helping women through protecting IVF, baby bonuses, child tax credits, and paid family leave. So she now says she opposes that territorial ban, even though she previously did say she supported that she even knew the state law's exact statue. So that is just a complete 180 on the issue. Now, there's also Mark Robinson. He's a lieutenant governor in North Carolina and he's now running to be governor. Now, he repeatedly backed a ban on abortion without exceptions for rape or incest before the Dobbs decision, and once regularly labeled abortion as a murder and genocide, and even compared the anti-abortion movement to the abolitionist movement to end slavery. Listen to Robinson at one event in July 2020. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MARK ROBINSON (R), CANDIDATE FOR NORTH CAROLINA LT.

Now, look at this comment he made on Twitter in January. He said post-Dobbs decision. It's a state issue. I don't support a national ban on abortion. So, just -- he said one thing and he said the complete opposite and something that's really interesting about all this, Jim, is we're seeing a lot of these candidates and as you saw Kent right there as a great example, who are citing state laws in trying to get around discuss -- discussing this issue. But in theory, they are getting elected to positions where they could change the law.

One source saying that they're reading as many as 100 cruise missiles, that can mean a number of different things.

That would be a very significant move by Iran. But there are a number of different scenarios that we could see. We've also heard intelligence officials and experts talking about the possibility of proxy groups in neighboring countries carrying out waves of attacks using rockets, missiles, drones against military targets inside Israel because this is a retaliation against an alleged diplomatic post, Iran could carry out attacks against Israeli embassies around the world.
