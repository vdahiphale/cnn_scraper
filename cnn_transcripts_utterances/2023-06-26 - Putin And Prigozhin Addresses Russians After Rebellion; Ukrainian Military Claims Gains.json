The Wagner boss, Yevgeny Prigozhin, now speaking out today claiming he was not attempting to overthrow Russia's military. The march to Moscow he says was actually a, quote, \"protest.\" He still continued to insult the Russian military though.Well, back in the United States, President Biden made his first remarks about the mutiny emphasizing that the west had nothing to do with the Russian revolt. Our Matthew Chance is inside Russia tonight amid this seismic shift. He's there. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MATTHEW CHANCE, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): This is the last time we saw the Wagner leader, departing the Russian city he had essentially taken over at the weekend, amid cheers from supporters. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) CHANCE (voice-over):  Now Yevgeny Prigozhin is speaking out for the first time since agreeing to call off the armed rebellion that shook the Kremlin to its core. In an 11-minute recording, Prigozhin denies aiming to challenge the Russian president. YEGVENY PRIGOZHIN, LEADER OF WAGNER GROUP (through translation):  The purpose of the march was to prevent the destruction of Wagner and the prosecution of those who made a huge number of mistakes in the course of the special military operation due to their unprofessional actions. Society demanded this and all the soldiers who saw us supported us. CHANCE (voice-over):  But on Russian state television damage control is already in full swing after a weekend of mayhem. Prigozhin's armed rebellion has failed the presenter says. Russians stood in a united front for President Putin, she declares. But few doubt have weakened events of the past few days have left Russia's leader. But now for the first time since the rebellion ended, Vladimir Putin has addressed the nation, too. In a short speech, condemning the rebellion as treachery, something Putin has in the past said he would not forgive. VLADIMIR PUTIN, PRESIDENT OF RUSSIA (through translation):  They wanted Russian soldiers to kill each other, to kill military personnel and civilians so that in the end Russia would lose and our society would split, choke in bloody civil strife. CHANCE (voice-over):  What will become of Yevgeny Prigozhin now, whether he will be prosecuted or not remains unclear. Although he did appear to confirm for the first time that he may indeed take a Kremlin offer to head to Belarus and resume Wagner's operations from there. That may no longer be on the table for a once loyal Putin ally. He appears to have made a dangerous enemy in the Kremlin. (END VIDEOTAPE) (On camera):  Well, Erin, officials in Belarus who I've been speaking the throughout the course of the day are refusing to confirm reports that Yevgeny Prigozhin is already there. So, we're none the wiser about that. But Belarusian opposition figures who I spoke to as well say it would be foolish of Yevgeny Prigozhin to think he was safe and protected in a country that is essentially run by Alexander Lukashenko who is one of Putin's closest allies.",

There's no question that his power is now weakened. There's no question that a lot of people around the country, the elites, various governors, various people in the social -- in the security services are probably asking themselves, if Prigozhin can really get away with this, with challenging state power like this, what can I get away with.

And that's when we got the first on the record denial from the White House that they had no involvement with this coup.That's also why over the weekend, we saw the White House being strategically silent on this matter and why the President explained today that he coordinated with U.S. allies to give Putin and the Kremlin no excuse, no opportunity to try and blame the West for this. Now, interestingly, Putin, in his remarks earlier today, he did not directly blame the West. He did say that this was exactly what Kyiv and its Western allies would want to see inside of Russia, but he didn't directly point the finger. And so that is interesting in and of itself.

As you said publicly, U.S. officials weren't saying much, but their messages to their Russian counterparts in these diplomatic channels were essentially threefold. First of all, they expected Russia to make sure that the safety and security of the U.S. embassy and U.S. personnel in Russia was upheld. And secondarily, they were telling them that the U.S. had nothing to do with this.They really wanted to make sure that Russia knew that U.S. had no involvement in Prigozhin's march towards Moscow. And then the third thing, of course, was they were making sure that Russians knew the United States did not want them to use their nuclear arsenal. And State Department spokesperson Matt Miller did not describe how Russia responded to these messages when he was at the podium today. But what he did say is that this was a conversation, so indicating, therefore, that the Russians were actually engaging, responding in some way, shape or form, not just ignoring that these messages were coming through.",

He said, if the indictment of Mr. Trump on espionage charges, not to mention his now almost certain indictment for conspiring to obstruct Congress from certifying Mr. Biden as the President on January 6th, fails to shake the Republican Party from its morbid political senses, that it is beyond saving itself, nor ought to be saved.

He's an expert.The politics of this, that he is right about, I know politics. And our last CNN poll, 23 percent of Republicans said they could never support Trump for the nomination. Now he's the dominant candidate with the rest of the party. But when you're losing 23 percent of your party, some number of them will bleed over the general election. Now, Trump got 94 percent of Republicans against Joe Biden. It still wasn't enough. He lost. So he's eroding with his own party. He's eroding with independence. Judge Luttig is right.

This includes building a wall at the southern border. Of course, if this sounds familiar, it's because we've seen this movie before.

I mean, look, he said that were going to build a wall and Mexico was going to pay for it. While we did build a portion of the wall, it was never finished and Mexico didn't pay for it.And so Ron DeSantis is trying to highlight that Donald Trump did not fulfill these promises.

My own sense is it's not a smart strategy for DeSantis to try to out Trump Trump among Trump voters on a Trump issue. I think a far better strategy is what Chris Christie is doing, which is not to say Trump wasn't Trumpy enough, but saying Trump wasn't for you.Trump neglected you. He's in it for himself, and you're suffering. He betrayed you. I think it's a far better argument to make it about the voters. But Mr. DeSantis, Governor DeSantis, seems to hell bent on out Trumping Mr. Trump, and I just don't think he's going to be able to. Maybe his wife will change her name to Melania or something.

Now, we've been seeing iterations upon these drugs to get better levels of weight loss. Another one is called Mounjaro that's already on the market for type two diabetes. That one has gotten up to 21 percent weight loss in clinical trials, compared with about 15 percent for Wegovy, which is approved for obesity.Now, if you're looking at this new medicine, it's also from Eli Lilly, and it's called Retatrutide. That's the sort of chemical name for it. It doesn't even have a brand name because it's only in mid stage trials. They've seen 24 percent weight loss over even a shorter period of time, 48 weeks, than these drugs that are already on the market. And that one mimics three different hormones. And so you're sort of seeing that turbocharged amount of weight loss in this trial. Now, all of these medicines are injectable drugs given once a week. Right now, we've also been seeing some new data on pill versions of these drugs, which produce about 15 percent weight loss, too. So this field is dramatically opening up right now.",
