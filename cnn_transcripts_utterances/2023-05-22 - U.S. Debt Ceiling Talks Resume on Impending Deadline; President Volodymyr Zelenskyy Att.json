Just ahead on \"CNN Newsroom,\" down to the wire, the U.S. has 10 days before it could default on its debt. President Biden returning to Washington from an all-important meeting with Kevin McCarthy in the coming hours.It was a bountiful trip to the G7 for Ukraine's president, heading home with pledges of military aid as the bloody battle for Bakhmut reaches a critical stage. Plus, a historic mission, SpaceX and Saudi Arabia's first female astronaut into space. Hear her message to the world aboard Axiom-2. Good to have you with us. Well, with the G7 summit now behind him, U.S. President Joe Biden is back in Washington to face his most pressing issue right now, the impasse over the U.S. debt ceiling. In the coming hours, President Biden will meet yet again with House Speaker Kevin McCarthy to try and strike a deal on raising the country's borrowing limit. McCarthy says he had a productive phone call with Mr. Biden, as the president was returning from Japan on Sunday. There's only about 10 days left until the U.S. could potentially default on its debt. And to date, there have been no real signs either side is willing to budge. Well, at the G7, President Biden even took a swipe at Republicans warning they could try something outrageous as the clock ticks down. CNN's Arlette Saenz has the latest.",

The two men did speak on Sunday as the president traveled back fromJapan. And negotiators from both sides met on Capitol Hill on Sunday evening. But each side still remains incredibly far apart in their approach to solving this debt ceiling and budget issue. The president, in a press conference in Japan, warned about the stakes of this moment and said that Republicans need to come off their, quote, \"extreme positions.\" And that ultimately, a bipartisan deal is necessary and Republicans need to compromise.

That is likely one of the issues the president and McCarthy will need to discuss in their meeting here at the White House.But this all comes as the treasury secretary is once again repeating her warning that the U.S. could default on its debts as soon as June 1st. If that were to happen, that would have widespread and potentially catastrophic consequences for the U.S. economy and the global economy at large.

And of course, there is a very real economic potential catastrophe here. But there's also a political catastrophe if President Biden can't show that he is the person who can get Kevin McCarthy to bend in negotiations and to understand how important this is and not, frankly, to conflate two different things, which are what do you want the budget to look like on the one hand versus are we going to pay our debts, which is the debt ceiling, on the other hand.",

And so, Kevin McCarthy understands he does have some cards to play here, but as you said, this is something that Republicans, and frankly, there's a little bit of this across both sides of the aisle, but they care a lot about when they have a democratic president and they think that they can try and extract promises for the next budget when they are having to negotiate this.",

In fairness, there was a lot of diplomatic light work done in advance. But by virtue of having all those leaders there together, it gave a focus point to bring an agreement to a conclusion.And President Zelenskyy spoke in a press conference afterwards, not just about the importance of the F-16 aircraft to help give the Ukrainian air force better reach, better able to tackle the threat of the Russian forces, but he said that he -- by virtue of being there in the room, face to face with the leaders, he gets better results that way. So, bringing everything together, bringing allies and partners together, showing unity to Russia that they unify behind Ukraine was important. But for Zelenskyy, I think just having this meeting, being there in person with so many allies are a bolster. And certainly, that's what we hear on the ground here. We've talked to commanders and troops at the frontline, the F-16 very important for them. And knowing in this very, very hard fight against Russia, a much bigger enemy in this hard and tough fight, they know they've got allies and partners in the rest of the world that are supporting them. But I think the other takeaway from the G7 was that President Zelenskyy was able to meet with people like the prime minister of India, the leader of Indonesia as well, and try to break the Russian narrative of victimhood, that Russia is the victim of western and NATO aggression, to put it plainly to these leaders and say, look, Russia has invaded our territory. And this is going to be very important when President Zelenskyy is looking at these nations around the table at the United Nations, ultimately trying to get a peace deal agreed with the U.N. And for these other countries, to put some kind of pressure and bring some reality to bear on Russia. So, the takeaway for Zelenskyy, a big trip, a big reach around the world, a big diplomatic reach, and take away successes. When those F- 16s actually arrive and are in service, not clear. But for Zelenskyy, a good trip to Japan. Nic Robertson, CNN, eastern Ukraine.",

I don't see him pulling out of Bakhmut if the Russians are not there to take over his position.So, I'm not sure what exactly he means by pulling out of Bakhmut. But he clearly does have his own political agenda. He's got ambitions to challenge Putin and ultimately put himself into a position of power.

I think that we are heading into essentially a Ukrainian Russian conflict into 2024 that will increasingly focus on Ukraine's ability to seize Crimea.The Russians will try to fight a defensive fight. They will continue to rattle nuclear sabers to warn of escalation. I think it's really important that the United States and its western allies do not allow Russian nuclear threats to intimidate them into winding back support for Ukraine. Ultimately, what needs to happen is for Ukraine to impose a decisive defeat on the Russians, such that the Russians are visibly routed for the entire international community. Their forces basically sent reeling and running back to the border. That's what needs to happen. But at the same time, the west does need to ensure that its deterrent strategy vis-a-vis Russia, is strong enough so that Putin or whoever is in charge in the Kremlin at that point is not tempted to reach for tactical nuclear weapons.

In recent weeks, he has been asking the surrounding suburbs around the city of New York to help and to share the \"burden\" of having to provide shelter and resources to migrants that continue to arrive here in New York City.In the last several days since the expiration of Title 42, the city has continued to see a record number of arrivals in the city every single day. According to city hall, they are seeing hundreds of people arrive per day. The city has set up the Roosevelt Hotel which you see here behind me as a welcome center. A place where migrants can arrive and be connected to resources and eventually be placed in shelter while migrants figure out their next move. Now in the meantime, Mayor Eric Adams is asking the federal government to step in and for neighbors around the city of New York to help out. (BEGIN VIDEOCLIP)",

The two people injured remain hospitalized, one in critical condition, the other stable. Police are asking anyone with information to come forward. They're offering a reward of up to $25,000.Minnesota has joined a growing list of states that are tightening gun control laws. On Friday, Governor Tim Walz signed new legislation into law that includes red flag measures. They allow the temporary removal of firearms from a person who poses a risk to themselves or others. Walz was joined by former Arizona Congresswoman Gabby Giffords who has focused on gun control since she was shot back in 2011. The governor told CNN that the new laws were not about restricting responsible gun owners but about keeping people safe. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV. TIM WALZ (D-MN): We've seen it across the country, Newton to Uvalde and it goes on and on every single day. And we know that there are things like these two pieces of legislation make a difference. And so, if we make an impact on one of the shootings or if we get the firearms out of the hands of someone who is going to commit suicide, which we know especially for men, it is what they will do. It -- that's a win. And these things have nothing to do with a threat to the Second Amendment. This is totally about safety of our children and our citizens and as a 24-year veteran and a lifelong hunter and gun owner, I'm not impacted negatively at all on this. And I think we need to take that narrative back, responsible gun owners that do believe that you can -- you can have them responsibly. We need to lean into it. So, I'm just proud that Minnesota were finally able to do it. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

A grand jury handed down its indictment on Wednesday saying yes indeed, Bryan Kohberger should be put on trial. And because of that decision, the path to a jury trial is no longer up in the air like it was before. There will be an arraignment and Kohberger will likely enter a plea.So first, we're going to be watching to see how Kohberger pleads to four counts of murder and one count of burglary. Most likely he will plead not guilty. But there's always a chance that either side could ask for more time and the plea is entered later. Second, the judge is expected to entertain arguments on a gag order, which has limited what information we know about the case. Because right now, all of the lawyers involved here, including those representing victims, families and witnesses cannot say anything publicly about this matter. Nothing at all, except for what is written in court documents. One of the victims' families wants to make the gag order less restrictive. And this matters because six months later, we still do not know what prosecutors think is the motive here. We still don't know what investigators think could link the suspect to the four victims. Information is very tight, and a less restrictive gag order could increase what we know. But farther ahead, we'll see if there's a potential timeline. Will a trial date reset or just a status update put on the calendar? And then finally, will the state of Idaho seek the death penalty? After ko Berger enters a plea within 60 days, prosecutors need to file written notice if they are going to seek capital punishment. So, a lot of things to watch all of a sudden. Now that we know this high-profile case is indeed headed towards trial. Mike Valerio, CNN, Los Angeles.",
