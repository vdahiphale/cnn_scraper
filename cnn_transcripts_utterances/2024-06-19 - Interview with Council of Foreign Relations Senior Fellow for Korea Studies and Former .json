I'm Bianna Golodryga in New York, sitting in for Christiane Amanpour. A pact between dictators. Vladimir Putin has wrapped up his trip to North Korea, where he was greeted with much fanfare. There, he signed a comprehensive defense deal with Kim Jong Un. Speaking after lengthy talks, Putin did not rule out \"the provision of mutual assistance in the event of aggression against one of the parties to this agreement.\" Here's the Russian president. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) VLADIMIR PUTIN, RUSSIAN PRESIDENT (through translator):  Today, we held substantive negotiations on a whole range of practical cooperation. This includes political, trade, investment, cultural spheres, and the security sphere as well.

You know, don't even get me started on that subject, but I think when we're talkingabout the diplomacy and Russia entering the chat of this conversation, it's being met with deep concern. That is the exact verbiage that South Korean security officials are lending to this topic of conversation when they were meeting with their Chinese counterparts yesterday to discuss their collective security concerns that affects both China and South Korea. So, you know, interestingly enough, we have President Yoon Suk Yeol who was asked at a May 9th news conference what he would do, how he would feel if Vladimir Putin visited Pyongyang and had this bromance moment with North Korea's leader Kim Jong Un? And he was very careful. He said that South Korea actually, in the relative scheme of things, has pretty good relations with Russia. And Russia, in fact, says that, of all the not so friendly nations, South Korea is one of the best. South Korea, notably, is not sending lethal munitions to Ukraine. Vladimir Putin went out of his way last week to say that just -- make it known that he appreciates South Korea not sending those lethal munitions. So, long story long, Yoon Suk Yeol, the president here in South Korea, is trying to walk a fine line. He's saying that a lot of these Russian moves are making him uncomfortable. They're going to try to work with Russia in areas where they can cooperate. So, a lot of deep concern, a lot of tightrope walking. We're waiting for the dust to settle for perhaps some more clarity on whether or not this is a new autocratic version of NATO Article 5. And we're just going to have to wait over the next 24 hours how this is officially received.",

Sue Mi Terry, thank you so much for joining us. First, just your response to this visit, in some sense, a historic one, given that it's been 24 years since Vladimir Putin has visited the hermit state. And yet, we have no readout of what this mutual defense pledge really entails. There have been several past iterations of a similar type of pledge, the most recent in 2000, and that one, the only clause was that they would be calling each other and contacting each other in certain emergency situations.

      "sentences": "Yes, it does appear that Vladimir Putin has crossed the Rubicon here and trying to rehabilitate himself ever. The global stage years tocome whenever the war with Ukraine does end. And given this new alliance with North Korea, as you mentioned, some 10,000 containers of munitions have been transferred already, ballistic missiles also. And as you note, that the real concern here is, yes, that is a short-term benefit for Vladimir Putin now on the battlefield. But longer-term, do you think, at this point, at this stage, Vladimir Putin is willing to transfer technological insight and know-how to North Korea? North Korea right now is in the process of developing hypersonic missiles as well. That's something that Russia has already boasted of achieving before. Is this something that should be concerning for Washington? S. TERRY:  I think the Washington -- the Biden administration is very concerned about this as the South Korean government, the Yoon Suk Yeol administration. You know, they're all questions about how much really can - - you know, what can -- what Putin was willing to do. And there are some arguments against that, right? The munitions, the artillery shells that North Korea is providing Russia are -- they're archaic. They're not the most sophisticated kind of shells. So, is Putin really willing to, you know, go as far as providing military technology, sensitive technologies to North Korea in return for this? But it's increasingly looking like -- increasingly it looks like he's desperate. And so, we cannot rule it out. And if you remember, if you recall, after Kim Jong Un visited Russia and met with Putin in September of last year, only two months later, North Korea successfully launched a satellite when North Korea failed to do so the previous two times in the past year. So, even if Russians did not directly help with technology, they were certainly involved in terms of giving guidance and advice and sharing their know-how. So, this is a definitely a concern. I think it was intentional that the Russians and North Koreans have not explicitly stated exactly what kind of help and aid that they're talking about or transfer of technology, but Putin himself said it's -- you know, they will share military technology. I think he's -- that was his phrase. Well, the question is, how sensitive? What kind of sensitive technology? But it is definitely a concern, and I'm sure the Biden administration is -- you know, this is one of the top concerns right now.",

So, South Korea, not for lack of technology, but has not pursued a nuclear weapons program. Are they going to be thinking twice about that and questioning real security promises from the United States if we do see further development and alignment between Russia and North Korea on this front? S. TERRY:  You're absolutely right. There's already been a talk, increasing talk about whether South Korea need to develop their nuclear weapons too, or at least bring tactical nuclear weapons back to South Korea. There are conservatives, there are hawks, there are people who are very concerned about that, because North Korea's WMD threat has been growing in the past few years. Ever since the collapse of the Hanoi Summit, North Korea has not been interested in returning to dialogue, and they've been advancing, modernizing, diversifying their missile capability, and so on. Now, you add this development between Russia and North Korea, and now let's add another development in November, this year, there's a presidential election in the United States.",

He made over 120 times since his 1990 Playboy interview when he talked about potentially reducing troops or, you know, our troops presence in South Korea. So, I think South Koreans are very nervous for a whole host of reasons, and it has to be in the back of their mind, even though there is -- you know, they say for now that they're not going to pursue their own nuclear weapons capability, this is something that has to be on the table for the South Korean government.",

Here's what he said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ROBERT O'BRIEN, FORMER U.S. NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER:  They changed tax and then we had some cordial diplomacy with them. And keep in mind, they promised to denuclearize, they promised to end their nuclear program on the peninsula. Now, that did in fact end up happening and President Trump had to walk away from the Hanoi Summit when Kim Jong Un tried to, you know, go back on that deal. But -- so we didn't have much progress after that. But keep in mind, there was no nuclear testing during the entire Trump administration because we showed strength coupled with some tough diplomacy.

This space I'm in is on the site of a warehouse where enslaved people were held before they would be taken up the street and sold in auctions. And I do think it's been great to have Juneteenth help us begin to reckon with this long history that has so profoundly shaped America. I see Juneteenth as sitting between two other American holidays, Memorial Day and Independence Day. And for me, Juneteenth is an opportunity to remember and honor the 10 million black people who were enslaved in this country between 1619 and 1865 and to also celebrate the emancipation of 4 million people who finally won freedom following the civil war. There's so much we have to reckon with about this history that we really haven't done in the United States. And so, I'm thrilled to have spaces like this to help begin that process.",

And of course, because these states were at war with the United States, most of the 4 million people who were impacted by the Emancipation Proclamation didn't actually get free. They were behind enemy lines. They were still captive by those trying to preserve slavery. After the Civil War, the Emancipation Proclamation should have taken effect all over the country. The passage of the 13th Amendment further confined that, but there were still places in this country where enslavers refused to tell enslaved people that they were free. When federal troops got to Texas, the word finally got out and people celebrated their freedom, even though it was months after the war had ended and almost two years after the Emancipation Proclamation had been declared. The term Juneteenth became a way of celebrating that belated announcement, that delayed announcement of freedom, and I think in the African American community, it has become a day of remembrance for emancipation, not just for those who got the word late in Texas, but for all of the nearly 4 million people who had been held in bondage, who had suffered in these forced labor camps, who had been constrained and abused by slavery, to now finally have an opportunity to move towards something that could be identified as freedom.",

      "sentences": "I actually think it is a time to reflect on the tragic and painful history of slavery in America. We had 246 years in this countrywhere people were held in bondage, they were subjected to unbelievable abuse and degradation. We created narratives about enslaved black people, where we said that black people aren't as good as white people. We created a narrative of racial hierarchy in this country that was defined by slavery. Slavery in the United States was a permanent, hereditary condition, and that's something to mourn. Six million black people died enslaved. They never had the opportunity to be free like other immigrants that came to this country. That's something to mourn. The abuse, the selling of half of all enslaved people from their families. The sexual violence, the humiliation, the horrific physical violence, all of that is something to mourn. But emancipation was something to celebrate. That 4 million people persevered despite the hardship of slavery, that 4 million people found faith and joy in the midst of so much agony is an incredible legacy. And then the most important thing is that enslaved people in this country learned to love in the midst of sorrow. And despite the horrors of enslavement, created generations of family and kinship. I'm the descendant of enslaved people. I would not be here if my great grandparents hadn't found a way to love despite all of the horrors of slavery and create a new generation. And we are the heirs of, yes, a lot of that trauma and abuse and degradation, but we also are the heirs of people who learned to persevere, people who were resilient, people who found a way to resist, people who knew their humanity and their dignity despite what the law said about them. And that is something to celebrate. The strength and power of enslaved people, I feel, empowers me, energizes me. And I think both of those realities can be contained within this holiday. The grief, the mourning of people who were treated horrifically, abused, and denied freedom, but also the power, the capacity of people to love despite all of those hurdles, that's something to celebrate.",

I mean, you know, the black community is much more diverse than it's ever been in the history of this country. We have black immigrants from Africa. We have people from the West Indies. We have people in different economic situations. And so, if a candidate gets 92 percent of that vote, you'd have to say that candidate is doing very well with that community. I can't think of a white community -- a white candidate that could claim that kind of success with any other community -- ethnic community in this country. There is shifting because I think the community is shifting. We have more people who are African-American who are affluent. But I'm still actually pretty amazed that the African-American community still votes with largely one voice. There is an alignment with the values and the norms that emphasize equality and freedom and opportunity. There is still a really powerful instinct in the black community in this country to help the poor, to help those who are marginalized, to respond to the challenges that we face when we throw people away. And I think that's the really overwhelming narrative. There is some movement, I don't disagree with that. And I think what any candidate has to do to maintain support, to get support from the African- American community, and again, it's not a single perspective, is to reinforce these values and norms that we talk so much about. We're still not free yet. There's a presumption of dangerousness and guilt that gets assigned to black and brown people. And it doesn't matter how wealthy you are or how kind you are or how talented you are, you can go places where you have to navigate a presumption of dangerousness and guilt. And our political and elected officials need to help us eradicate, eliminate that burden because it's unfair. I'm a lawyer. I'm a middle-aged black man. I've got all of these degrees. I've won cases at the Supreme Court, and I still go to places where I'm viewed as less than, where I'm presumed to be the defendant or presumed to be dangerous just because of the way I appear, and that's a heavy burden.

What was createdfrom the remnants, the leftover, the least desirable portions, as it were. You really -- talk about resistance, you really resist that narrative. You want to say more about that? Why you think that that's not really quite right and why you push hard against that? B. TERRY:  Well, I think in general, in the popular imagination, there are these very reductive ways that we think about black food, specifically food in, you know, the United States. And so, as you mentioned, there are kind of these two strains that I've seen people talk about. They even talk about the antebellum survival food, upon which many enslaved Africans relied. And, you know, people often talk disparagingly about that food. You know, I've heard it referred to a slave food. And as you mentioned, there are -- this kind of history of often plantation owners giving enslaved Africans, the worst parts of the animals, the animal viscera, or the discarded parts of the vegetable. And one, you know, let's not mention the fact that there were free black people, every Black person in the United States, a person of African descent, wasn't enslaved. But the other thing is that the institution of slavery wasn't a monolith. So, maybe in the Deep South, the Black Belt it was more of a paternalistic system in which every need of enslaved Africans was provided by plantation owners. But it -- you know, the institution of slavery looked different the way that enslaved Africans might grow food, cook it, and eat it in the Coastal Carolinas, look different than it did in Mississippi, Alabama, and Tennessee, and that look different than it did in Louisiana, and that looked different than it did in Bahia, Brazil. And so, to reduce it to just slave foods, you know, erases this history of enslaved Africans, maybe having a garden in which they could grow their own food for their families or having a day off where they can hunt for protein. But the other strand that I see are the kind of big flavored meats that we might find in a soul food restaurant or the, you know, sugary desserts or overcooked vegetables. And here's the thing. I'm not denying any of those things. Chitlins and pig's feet and red velvet cake and macaroni and cheese, all these things are part of this very diverse cuisine that we have. But when I think about the type of food that my grandfather and his parents and, you know, so many of our ancestors, they were growing and eating things like nutrient rich collards, mustards, turnips, kale, dandelions, sugar snap peas, pole beans, sweet potatoes, black eyed peas. These are the type of foods, Michel, as you know, that any Western trained physician or, you know, dietitian or nutritionist would say we should all eat. And so, I simply want to uplift and highlight those nutrient rich, healthful foods that are part of our tradition so that we have a more holistic understanding of the type of foods that we've grown and eaten historically.",

I'm sure you've kind of heard or seen the stereotype of the self-righteous, dogmatic, judgmental vegans, right? The people that are wagging their finger at you because you're not eating a vegan diet, even though they just converted to veganism like the week before. So, that was me in high school. And, you know, one of the powerful things that really helped transform my habits and attitudes and politics regarding food was a hip hop song. The song \"Beef\" by the hip hop group Boogie Down Productions, one of the seminal hip hop groups. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "What made you become a chef?B. TERRY:  It was really the politics of food that moved me towards, you know, just going to culinary school and thinking about using food as a kind of transformative tool. And it started when I was a doctoral student in history at NYU, when I was doing research on the Black Panthers. They were, you know, doing all these programs around health, like addressing medical apartheid and doing -- testing for sickle cell anemia. But the one that transformed me the most was their free breakfast for children program This was started in 1969 in January of that year. And by the end of the year, it had spread to every major city that had a Black Panther chapter, and they were feeding over 10,000 children every single day. And I just remember this kind of, like, moment of clarity. I was on the subway one morning going to the village to teach a class and I saw these kids on the subway eating red hot Cheetos and candy bars and sugary donuts and they were drinking sodas and energy drinks. And I realized that these kids, as my mentor, Raj Patel would say, they're being stuffed and starved. They're eating a lot, but they're empty calories. And I realized that the type of -- the spirit of the activism back in the '60s and the '70s, we needed it now. And so, I want it to be a food justice activist to make an intervention. But I didn't want to just, you know, be in the realm of like ideas and politics. I wanted to do something that felt practical, that felt immediate, that felt like it was giving young people skills. And so, I started an organization be healthy that use cooking as a way to wake up these young people to the realities of our food system, but also give them the skills so that when they were adults, they would actually be able to make meals from themselves, go shopping, prepare the food, and then, you know, really have this kind of sustenance-based approach to taking care of their -- themselves and their families.",

Iknow, like, thinking about, like, one of your first books, \"Afro-Vegan,\" you know, a lot of people, I think, might have been surprised that somebody like you even exists. B. TERRY:  That book was published a decade ago. We just celebrated the 10- year anniversary. And it's been so encouraging, I have to say, to see so many people who are, I'll say, open to eating more plant-based foods, even people who aren't necessarily trying to embrace a full-on vegan or plant- based diet. What I've seen are people are open to doing meatless Mondays, or people are open to doing, you know, one meal a day that has, you know, a vegan meal and no animal products. And what that says to me is that more people understand the -- I mean, look, the data is out. We know that having a more plant centered diet, it's more nutrient dense, it tends to be more helpful and people just feel lighter. And that's -- you know, Michel, you've seen me on this journey for a decade. And I just want to say that that has been my approach. You can start with the heady intellectual ideas or the politics, but a lot of times when you start there, people run away. But my approach has been starting with the food, because I think a lot of people have these negative perceptions of what plant-based cuisine is. And what I've seen is when you serve people delicious food, that's devoid of animal products, they're often surprised and it makes them more open to eating this type of food. I will say that one thing that has been a little frustrating to me is that it seems that a lot of people feel like, you know, spending their dollars in alignment with their values is enough. You know, if I just go to the big corporate market and I buy all this, you know, vegan and organic food, then I'm doing my job. And I think that is important to spend our dollars in alignment with our values. But I also think that we need to think about the larger structural reasons that many communities don't have access to healthy, fresh food. They don't have access to supermarkets. So, I always encourage people to think about, well, how can you get involved with your community to ensure that everyone has a human right to healthy, fresh, affordable, and, you know, plant centered food?",

Are there one or two stories or essays that really stands out to you or recipes for that matter that really stands out to you? B. TERRY:  We put that book together in nine months. And we started working on it in 2020 when the -- U.S. was kind of reckoning with the ways in which we've treated African-Americans historically and contemporaneously. I knew that I saw an anthology like black food that brought together scholars and chefs and artists and activists from around the globe as something that I do later in my career. But in that moment, I realized that there was a sense of urgency to do it then because it was revealed there was a lot of racism within the publishing industry. And, you know, there was a lot of highlighting of the ways in which, you know, authors of color and black authors were having a harder time getting their work published. And so, I just felt like this was the moment and I reached out to friends around the globe to be a part of this book and I couldn't be more proud. My favorite aspect of the book is the artwork. Every chapter starts with a piece of art that I got permission or either had artists kind of create our original piece that really encapsulated the ideas and the content within. And, you know, I just -- as an educator, I'm always thinking about the multiple ways that people learn. Some people who've been formally educated there, they can dig deeply into, you know, a heady intellectual essay, but then some people might be more moved by an image that really just speaks to, you know, these issues that we're covering. Some people might be moved by the poetry in the book. Others are just going to see it as a book that they use in their kitchen. So, when I wrote the book or when I conceived of it, I said, I want this to book -- be a book that moved from one's kitchen to their nightstand, to their coffee table. And the response has been so tremendous. And you know, here we are, what, three years later after book is being published, and we're still talking about it, and I hope that we're still talking about it 30 years from now.",

And to be clear, this recipe -- this cookbook has, you know, dozens of recipes, but they aren't all vegan. And it was a decision I had to make as an editor to really give the contributors a space to, you know, write or contribute the recipe that made sense for them or told their family's story. I love Nicole Taylor, a good friend of mine who actually has a book about Juneteenth that's brilliant, \"Watermelon and Red Birds.\" She does this cocoa baked fish recipe and people would think cocoa and fish, but it's absolutely brilliant and scrumptious. There are a lot of good, you know, drink recipes, Toni Tipton-Martin, the cookbook author and editor does a recipe. I think it's a whiskey sour. So, there's just so many great recipes in there.
