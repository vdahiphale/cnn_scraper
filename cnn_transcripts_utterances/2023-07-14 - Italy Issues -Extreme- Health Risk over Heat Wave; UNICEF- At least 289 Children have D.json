We explore the dangers of these extraordinarily high temperatures. Weeks after the abandoned Russian mutiny by Yevgeny Prigozhin, Head of the powerful Wagner Group; President Vladimir Putin dismisses the group saying, \"It simply does not exist\". And one of the biggest Hollywood shutdowns in decades, actors are joining writers on the picket lines after talks with major studios and streaming services fail it marks the first time actors have stopped working on movie and TV productions since 1980. The world is feeling the heat like never before in fact, the UN is using the words out of control to describe the climate crisis today. After the world saw its highest temperatures for three days running last week, around 100 million people and a heat alerts across the United States. The U.S. government just releasing a report saying the earth saw its warmest June on record. And for a third month in a row ocean temperatures hit a record high. In Europe 15 Italian cities are under extreme heat risk alerts for this weekend. And earlier, Greece had to shut down the Acropolis in Athens. And as you can see from this rescue, the intensifying heat is a health hazard looming over all over this. The humans last big study of climate change. It tells us we have to cut emissions by 43 percent soon to limit global heating. Barbie Nadeau is in Rome, where it is downright sweltering. She's on the ground for us.

But I think over 114 new green tech startups launched and a total of $618 million towards venture funding. But the data also revealed that climate tech also represents less than 5 percent of venture funding in the region, which of course is significantly less than the global average of close to 20 percent. So this represents an opportunity. And my belief is that the more we can debunk the myth, the greener something is, the less profitable it is.

It's sensor costs have come down, you know, you're generating large amounts of data which can actually be crunched using ML and AI that didn't exist earlier. And hence you get to better smarter outcomes. Today, markets are hungry for solutions. Companies are hungry for solutions which will not come from within large corporates, they will come from the innovation world and governments are ready.
