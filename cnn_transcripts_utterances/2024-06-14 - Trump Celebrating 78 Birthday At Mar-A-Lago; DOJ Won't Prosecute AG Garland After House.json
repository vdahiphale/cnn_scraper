New information from the princess of Wales, saying she's making good progress after her cancer diagnosis, and the big plan she announced for this upcoming weekend. There remains one outstanding mystery, however. Plus, hundreds of comedians walk into the Vatican. This is not a joke. It actually happened earlier today. What Pope Francis told Fallon Colbert, Conan, Chris Rock, Whoopi Goldberg, Julia Louis-Dreyfus and others in the star studded cast of characters. But first, the U.S. Supreme Court ruling on several major cases today, but not on the January 6 immunity case, which could have a big impact on the upcoming presidential election. How this frees up Donald Trump to focus on debates and running mates. (MUSIC)",

There are now 144 days left until the presidential election and just 13 until the very first presidential debate between President Biden and former President Trump, which will be we here on CNN. And any day now, we could get a major decision from the U.S. Supreme Court. The justices are weighing whether former President Donald Trump is immune from prosecution for his actions while he was in office. That ruling is critical if Trump wants to clear the remaining legal clouds hanging over him. Those clouds, including the investigation into the January 6 riots, as well as allegations over what he may have done with classified documents he took with him after he lost the election. And while we are watching to see what the highest court in the land does, Trump's main opponent is across the Atlantic Ocean, President Biden, just moments away, from leaving Italy after the G7 summit of world economic superpowers, after wrapping up meetings with other world leaders and a private conversation with His Holiness, Pope Francis. Former President Trump has spent the last few days surrounded by House and Senate Republicans. They sang \"happy birthday\" and presented Trump with a birthday cake, a day before the birthday. And he received this early present, a handshake from Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell, one of his most vocal critics within the Republican Party. Mr. Trump also indicated to a Fox reporter that his vice presidential pick was probably someone who had been in the room with him. BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

This is called Trump 47. This is the club of some of his biggest supporters in Florida. And, Jake, I do want to add one piece of new reporting that we have just gotten it and its how he spent the de before his birthday, you mentioned that upcoming debate. We did learn while he was in D.C., held a, quote/unquote, policy session with close advisors, as well as Senators Marco Rubio and Eric Schmitt. They are not saying this was debate prep, but acknowledged that sessions like this will inevitably help Donald Trump when it comes to that debate. One thing on the agenda that they spoke about yesterday, talking about democracy and what they believed to be the inevitable questions around January 6, his role, the attack on January 6. So, clearly, trying to put in some of the legwork here. Again, Donald so Trump's team saying this is not debate prep that Donald Trump is not going to prep for that debate in two weeks. Instead, he is going to sit down for interviews, hold these policies sessions as well as take questions from voters -- Jake.",

It says this is a long-standing position and uniform practice. The department determined that the response of the attorney general to the subpoenas did not constitute a crime, and therefore will not be brought to a grand jury. And there will be no prosecution. So, not a huge surprise as you pointed out, Jake. But what happens next, we don't know, right? The Congress could try to do something like inherent contempt, something that was done in 1934 where they locked up a former member of the cabinet to a -- or, a member of the administration at the time, and they locked him up in the Willard Hotel. Could they do that with Attorney General Merrick Garland? We'll see what they tried to do next, but for now, right now, this is the final answer from the Justice Department.",

We know it was discovered during, quote, major abdominal surgery.What do you think are the possibilities here? DR. SANJAY GUPTA, CNN CHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, there's a lot of possibilities and I got to tell you, I mean, several doctors have been texting me an email me telling me what they think, but the reality is, we don't know, and it's speculative. I mean, there are so many things that would fall under major abdominal surgery -- uterus, ovaries, colon, liver, you know, all these things. What we do know is what you see on the screen there. She did have that operation back in January. Now, this has been going on for some time. Originally, it was thought to be non-cancerous. So what happens is they do the operation, and they're looking under the microscope at the tissue and that's probably when they discover that its cancerous and subsequently, as you know, Jake, and February is when she started this chemotherapy and, you know, so several months now. Depending on what the type of cancer is, what the type of therapy is, that time type of chemotherapy can last several months, six to nine months, with some degree of frequency. People -- as Max was just saying, some people may feel just fine one day, but even hour to hour, surely day-to-day, it can change their level of fatigue. Their mood even, the overall impact on their body. But again to your question, Jake, we just don't know and that's -- that's been, you know, we'd been speculating.

Because we don't know what kind of cancers, we don't know what stage if cancer is. We don't know what the chemo actually entails specifically, that makes it just -- it's just challenging, Jake. Again, I could speculate. A lot of doctors have been speculating. I just think it's probably unfair because we don't know enough information, and that's okay.
