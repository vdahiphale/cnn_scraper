The earliest general election debate in history right here on CNN. Every minute between now and Thursday night is essential to these candidates and everything they do and say between now and then tells a story.This morning, the Biden campaign is releasing a new ad blasting Trump for the Supreme Court decision to overturn Roe versus Wade. This is the second anniversary of that decision. Donald Trump is both mocking President Biden for his debate preparation, but also noticeably shifting on how he is setting expectations. We're joined now by CNN's Arlette Saenz and Alayna Treen. Arlette, let's start with you and the White House, the Biden campaign, what are they doing this morning?",

We'll speak at two events in Maryland and Arizona to highlight the two-year anniversary of the Supreme Court overturning Roe v. Wade.And this morning, the campaign is also releasing a stark new ad attacking Trump over his position on abortion. The ad features a Louisiana woman named Kaitlyn Joshua, who says she was turned away from two emergency rooms when she experienced a miscarriage at 11 weeks, in part due to Louisiana's abortion ban. Joshua, in this ad, directly blames her experience on Donald Trump. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Democrats saw success in the midterms in large part due to the issue of reproductive rights after the Dobbs ruling came down two years ago. And that is something Biden's team is hoping to replicate in this November's election. Now, the president is spending time with his advisers at Camp David to run through potentially mock debates in preparation for his showdown with Donald Trump. And this issue of abortion rights is one that the Biden campaign is eager to raise in the days ahead of the debate and on that debate stage, as they believe it presents a real stark contrast with Trump and what he has said on abortion, including his appointment of conservative justices on the Supreme Court that led to the overturning of Roe versus Wade.",

That is exactly how Donald Trump views this issue.And, look, his comments at that conference are very common for what we've seen with Donald Trump when he's in front of a group where he knows that they care very much about the abortion issue. A lot of evangelicals helped him get into the office in the first place in 2016. He tries to tout what he did more so. However, I know that in the lead up to the debate this week, they have been discussing Donald Trump and his campaign as well as senators vice presidential contenders, policy experts, they've all been meeting with Donald Trump behind the scenes for what his team is dubbing policy discussions, abortion has been a key focus, because they know that this is an issue that Republicans are more vulnerable on, something that you saw Donald Trump address there on Saturday. Now, as for the debate in itself, I will tell you that unlike what Arlette just laid out about the Biden camp and potential mock debates, that is something that Donald Trump is not engaging in. Instead, we really saw this week keep up a very aggressive campaign schedule. His team argues that Donald Trump's version of preparation is speaking at these rallies, doing media interviews, taking questions. However, again, we do know that, of course, Donald Trump is preparing. As much as they are trying to downplay the amount of preparation he needs, he is huddling behind the scenes with key people talking about these exact same issues that they think he's going to have to sharpen his rhetoric on. The other thing I think that's very important to keep in mind as we look ahead to Thursday is the expectations game. Donald Trump and his team for months now have tried to paint Joe Biden as this week and feeble candidate, someone who they argued would not even be able to stand up on stage for the 90 minutes allotted for this debate. However, we've really seen them change that language in recent days. They're trying to raise the expectations for Biden, knowing that they don't want to set a low bar for him on Thursday. And so we're seeing a lot of that play out particularly this week. I think you're going to see a lot of Donald Trump's advisers and surrogates really trying to change those expectations. We saw a lot of them on Sunday as well trying to argue that Biden is a worthy debater, something Donald Trump himself has said. And so we're going to see a lot of that messaging this week as we look forward to Thursday. We certainly heard it from Doug Berman -- sorry, Burgum, you're not running, who talked a lot about that on the Sunday shows. And he is, of course, a V.P. contender. Alayna Treene.

At least 15 police officers and four civilians, including a priest, were killed in a coordinated series of attacks in the cities of Derbent and Makhachkala. The total number of victims remains unclear and so far no group has claimed responsibility for the attack. Russian state media says that counter-terror operations following the incident have been completed and several suspects have now been charged under a terrorism act.CNN's Clare Sebastian is live for us in London with more on this story.

      "sentences": "Well, I think the main questions are, is that how could this happen again? This is just three months after the worst terrorist attack, the deadliest terror attack that Russia had seen in two decades, the attack at the Crocus City Hall in Moscow, that concert hall, where more than 140 people were killed. You'll remember that ISIS-K, the branch of the Islamic State in, Afghanistan claimed responsibility for that attack. But that did not stop President Putin laying the blame at the door of Ukraine and the west as well.I think the other question and the important piece of context here is that Dagestan is a very turbulent region in Russia's south. It borders Chechnya. We've seen flare-ups of violence over the years and decades, including terrorist attacks, terror attacks even originating in Dagestan, you remember, the Boston bombers in 2013, they had lived in Dagestan. And we've seen ethnic tensions flare recently fanned by the war in Gaza. In October, a mob stormed the main airport in Makhachkala when a flight from Tel Aviv landed. There were some pretty tense and terrifying scenes there for several hours. So, the fact that synagogues were among the places targeted here is raising questions in the region that also has an ancient Jewish population. And all of this, as you say, of course, the very last thing that Putin needs as he tries to mobilize the whole of Russia to prosecute the war in Ukraine.",

We haven't seen that many hearings in this case where it's the prosecutors coming to Judge Cannon and asking for something, but that is what is going to be happening in the afternoon today.But, John, first this morning, it's part two of the Donald Trump test of the special counsel's authority. So, what Trump and his co- defendants have been trying to convince the judge of is that the special counsel is illegal and doesn't have the authority to prosecute him because it's not in the Constitution the way it's operating. Now, the Justice Department has pushed back and said they've been using special counsel's for years, this is absolutely something that even other judges across the country have signed off on. But on Friday, it was a full day of hearings about the appointment of Special Counsel Jack Smith and the oversight that the attorney general has of that office. Today, it's about the money. Is the money that's funding the office appropriate under the Appropriations Clause of the Constitution? Is Congress allowing their money that they're assigning to the Justice Department to go to something like this, the sort of argument that has really kicked up a lot in politics, too? On Capitol Hill, there have been people questioning this as well. So now it's going to be the judge's attempt to look at that. And then, John, in the afternoon, we do get back to that prosecutor's request where they want to put a gag order, limit Donald Trump's speech about law enforcement, because he has spoken in misleading ways about how the FBI searched his house at Mar-a-Lago, saying he was falsely in danger at that time. He wasn't even in Florida when it happened. Prosecutors want to put a stop to that through the judge, have her change his conditions of release, so that they are protecting the integrity of this trial and those FBI agents that could become witnesses as well.
