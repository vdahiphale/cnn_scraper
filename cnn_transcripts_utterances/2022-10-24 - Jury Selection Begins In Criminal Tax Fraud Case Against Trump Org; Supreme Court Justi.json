      "sentences": "Well, good afternoon, Bianna and Victor. The former president has not been indicted in this case. And he's not expected to be implicated in any wrongdoing when trial testimony gets under way.This is one of the most significant pieces of the many criminal investigations that have been circling around the former president. This is the company that he's built from the ground up, now on trial, like you said, on those nine counts, including grand larceny and tax fraud. The Trump Organization has pleaded not guilty to those charges. During the course of this trial, we're expected to hear testimony from several Trump Organization insiders, including its former CFO, Allen Weisselberg. He's on paid leave from the company. But he's expected to testify and answer questions by both the prosecution and the defense in this case. Now, it's important to remember, jury selection is just under way right now. They brought in a panel of 130 prospective jurors. Just after the lunch break, they dismissed half of them. And they were dismissed for things such as medical reasons, scheduling, and some biases they may express. Now the selection is under way in earnest. The judge is going to be polling the jurors until they're able to get a group of 12 jurors who are unbiased and several alternates. The judge is signaling that this is going to take more than one day. He told the lawyers they should be prepared to seat a new panel of jurors tomorrow, that they will swear in. Ultimately, what's at stake here, if the Trump Organization is convicted, they could face a maximum fine under the charges that they're faced with in New York State of $1.6 million. That's not a tremendous amount of money for a company at this size. The bigger question will be if there's any collateral damage if the company is convicted. Will they have trouble finding business partners or any financing? But that is some time away when -- as they work to seat a jury now on the questioning just beginning again now that we're back from lunch -- Victor, Bianna?",

Justice Clarence Thomas has halted a lower court order that said a Georgia grand jury could seek testimony from the Senator as to an ongoing investigation into interference into the 2020 election.Specifically, investigators wanted to talk to the Senate about phone calls he allegedly made, asking for information about absentee voting in the state, as well as possible voter fraud. In the original subpoena that went to the Senator, it is dated November 17th. So Senator Graham asked the Supreme Court to just put that subpoena on hold while these larger legal issues continue to play out. [14:34:59:] And they have granted him that. This is a temporary hold while the full Supreme Court will consider some of these bigger questions. The Senator has insisted that anything that he did in the state of Georgia after the election, that it was part of his job as a Senator, as constitutionally protected activity. But lower federal courts have disagreed with that. And they have held that, in fact, this grand jury can speak his testimony on some of the issues that it is examining. We expect, over the next couple of weeks, the Supreme Court has asked those Georgia investigators to respond to this by Thursday. And over the next few weeks, we'll see what the Supreme Court does next. This is a temporary victory for the Senator.",

We understand that he will become prime minister officially tomorrow after he goes to see King Charles III. And around noon, he'll make a speech, just a meter or so behind me, behind the podium here at 10 Downing Street. And we'll learn about how he wants to define his premiership and what he'll be standing for. Even though is those respects, he has also had a fairly conventional path to power. He attended a prestigious school, Winchester College here in England. And then went on to Oxford where over half of Britain's prime ministers have been educated. And then onto Stamford for an MBA in the finance industry. And he was only elected as a lawmaker only seven years ago. Even though it's, as you say, Brianna, a definitely a known quantity, but still quite untested in the historical arc of prime ministers. And we have a lot to learn about how he's going to approach governing, whether he'll invite a broad church of cabinet members, and how he'll be able to approach this divided party, this economic calamity that's befallen the country being exacerbated by Liz Truss. And also trying to restore any shine that's been dulled on Britain's international reputation over these last weeks, as, from several quarters of the country, has been ridiculed and becoming a bit of a laughingstock in terms of its politics.",
