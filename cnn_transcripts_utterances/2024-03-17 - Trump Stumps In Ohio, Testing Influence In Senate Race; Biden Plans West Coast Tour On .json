Both Donald Trump and his team think Ohio is a state that they will likely win come November. Instead, this speech was all about boosting his endorsed primary candidate for Senate in Ohio, and that's business this man, Bernie Moreno. Moreno is currently locked in a messy three-way primary with two other Republican candidates and Donald Trump's visit here was really an 11th hour decision to try and help earn as many votes for Bernie Moreno as he could. But look, even though this visit was not necessarily about boosting his own campaign, the speech that Donald Trump gave was very much a typical campaign and general election campaign speech. And at one point, he actually made a very interesting comment that I have yet to hear him say on the trail thus far, and that was predicting that if he were to lose reelection, that it would be a bloodbath in the country.

And the community in turn helps empower the police so that they can then do their patrols. But for many of them, it's about setting these up to block what is not far from here, and that is an expanding gang territory, one that has been trying to encroach on this community, in particular, many times over the past year or so. And it got to a point where community members, according to one police commander, had to take justice into their own hands. And they were able to take into custody 14 suspected gang members. They then executed those gang members right in the middle of the street. It was a very public display, but for them it was to send a message to other gang members to keep out of their community. It hasn't stopped the gangs from trying to push further and further in. But for the folks who live here, they say everyday life has gotten increasingly difficult. We see a few street vendors, but not many. When we were here three weeks ago, many of the sidewalks were filled with street vendors. Folks now simply don't have things to sell. And so, they've resorted to trying to secure as best as possible using the police's help some of the supply lines, trying to bring water and food into areas like this. I asked some of the community members how is it that they're able to stay afloat. And he said we rely on each other. Essentially, they will have some of these community members go door to door collecting food, maybe some money, some water. And then that provides some sustenance for the folks who are securing these communities. If you ask who's in charge, they look around and they say no one. That's why they've taken matters into their own hands. If you ask what do you need, what can help, Haiti in this moment, the first thing that most folks have told us is for the international community to not intervene in the way they have at the past. Instead, they want help in the form of aid. They also say that they need some sort of security backup. What that looks like they didn't really articulate.

But that cold front, once it slides through, we are talking bitter cold temperatures. Yes, some that would remind folks maybe say more of January or February. Take a look at this. Cincinnati and Cleveland looking at high temperatures on Monday that are more typical for early February. Memphis and Huntsville, their high temperatures more like what you would see in mid-January.
