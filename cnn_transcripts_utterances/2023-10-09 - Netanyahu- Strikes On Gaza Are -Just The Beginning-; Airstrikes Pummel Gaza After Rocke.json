You could see the buildings absolutely flattened. Hamas retaliated by firing more than 100 rockets at the coast. This was the scene in Ashkelon, north of Gaza, even after the Israeli air defense system intercepted most if not all of the rockets. Cars on fire, debris and littering in the streets. At least 900 people have been killed so far in Israel by Hamas terrorists, according to the Israeli army. Of the 900, the vast majority appeared to have been civilians. The Biden administration says at least nine were U.S. citizens. The barbaric nature of Hamas has been on full display over the last few days with Hamas terrorists kidnapping children, killing the elderly, and there are reports of young women raped. The terrorist group announced in the last few hours that that they will begin to execute the civilian hostages that they took and broadcast videos of those executions, those murders, if Israel continues to attack Gaza civilians in their homes without warnings. That's the words of Hamas. Throughout the next few hours, we will be speaking to family members who are desperately waiting for news about loved ones who were kidnapped by Hamas. Among the nine U.S. citizens killed in the terrorist attacks is Deborah Mattias (ph), a mother died shielding her son from bullets. Mattias' father told CNN today he was on the phone with her when she was killed. Deborah's husband Shlome (ph) who was an Israeli citizen was also killed. They're son was shot in the stomach but is expected to recover. There is still no clear number as to how many U.S. citizens are missing or have been taken hostage. Jacob Ben Sr. (ph) believes that his daughter Danielle was kidnapped. Danielle is an Israeli-American citizen. Her family says she was born in Los Angeles, but largely grew up in Israel. Danielle was working at the music festival along the Gaza-Israel border. The festival that was attacked by Hamas terrorists early Saturday. These disturbing images show some of the carnage and terror that Hamas unleashed -- shooting attendees at point-blank range, taking these largely young people hostage. Israeli rescuers say they found at least 260 dead bodies at that site. Danielle's family has not heard from her since Friday. Our coverage starts with CNN's Clarissa Ward. And, Clarissa, you were on the ground earlier in Sderot and saw rockets firing over your head as the Israeli military pounded Gaza with rockets. Now it is night here in Ashkelon, just north of the Gaza border, are you still seeing rockets firing into Gaza?",

Hamas videos of the start of their assaults from Gaza were published within hours of its launch. Malevolently bold in execution, Hamas targeted Israeli machine gun nests and command posts, they knocked out the Israeli military communications and crippled command and control. They swept into Israeli territory and launched a wave of atrocities, killing at least 900 people in the worst Israeli setback in 50 years. Once a branch of the Muslim Brotherhood, Hamas, a Sunni movement, won Palestinian elections in 2006 on a platform of social reform and resistance to Israel. Driven by corruption and incompetence, rivals Fatah launched attacks immediately against the movement, which denies the right of Israel to exist at all. In the end, Hamas won control of Gaza, and its grip on the enclave of around 2 million people tightened as Israel and Egypt largely sealed it off, causing intense humanitarian problems. Hamas responded with waves of rocket attacks against Israel that got worse as the years went by. Israel counter attacked from the air, and with ground assaults that left thousands dead, and Hamas still in charge. But Iran's influence has been key to Hamas's military power.",

I mean, just horrifying things, and I don't think we know the full extent of it yet. I mean, there's more to come in the days and weeks ahead. You can't exist. They have to be eradicated. And you pointed out the difficult challenge. This is going to be incredibly painful. This is going to be incredibly difficult. And it's going to be horrifying, the price to pay. But even more horrifying is allowing a group like this to continue to be a viable group operating from a space that they control. I wish, you know, in an ideal world, people will tell you that there is, but I just don't -- I don't see any other option. It's a terrible option, but it remains the only option. And I think the blame will squarely be on Hamas for using people, human beings as they have for a long time, the way Hezbollah does as well, as shields. They deliberately put their missile launchers, their headquarters are operationally near places they know where civilians are going to be. Israel is in a very difficult spot here with no great options, but only one option that actually serves their national interest. And I just don't see any way forward.
