      "sentences": "Well, Wolf, the White House, and Biden campaign officials clearly see an opportunity here to seize on border security, an issue that has typically been kept at a distance for this White House, and use it against Republicans, especially after that failed Senate border bill when Republicans walked away from it. But this is not where the White House was even three months ago. Again, this is an issue that they have grappled with over the course of the Biden administration, particularly as there were surges of migrants crossing the U.S. southern border and one that sources tell me would get very tense within the walls of the White House when it was discussed, especially as it became a political liability for President Biden.But the pivotal point here was that Senate border bill. That was a bill that White House officials and Senate negotiators had worked on for months that included some of the toughest border security measures in recent history. Including, for example, that emergency authority that would have allowed the Homeland Security secretary to shut down the border if certain triggers were met. So, the president, while he is going to meet with Border Patrol agents and law enforcement here, he's also going to deliver remarks where he intends to hammer Republicans on this point because it was them who walked away at the encouragement of former President Donald Trump. Take a listen to what we may hear from White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre this morning. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KARINE JEAN-PIERRE, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: The folks who are getting in the way here are Republicans. They are getting in the way. And they are doing it because of what Donald Trump is telling them to do for their own -- for his own political game. And so, this is where we are right now. So, the president's going to take it directly to the American people. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "All right. Going back to our top story right now. At least 104 people are dead, and 760 others injured in a chaotic scene in Gaza City earlier today. Eyewitnesses say hungry civilians swarmed around aid trucks coming into Gaza when Israeli tanks and drones started shooting at people in the street. As the trucks tried to escape, some people were run over and killed in the chaos. The IDF, the Israeli Defense Forces, tells CNN that the incident is now under review.I'm joined now by Democratic Senator Chris Coons. He's on the Foreign Relations Committee. He's co-chair of the Biden reelection campaign as well. Among other things, Senator Coons, first of all, thanks for joining us. You were just in Israel last week as part of a major congressional delegation. What's your immediate reaction to this awful incident we've been reporting on in Gaza earlier today? SEN. CHRIS COONS (D-DE): Wolf, this is another heartbreaking incident in which civilians are being killed. The humanitarian crisis in Gaza is out of control. And it is time for us to take strong steps to address this challenge both with our close ally Israel and directly through American efforts to deliver badly needed humanitarian aid, whether by air or by sea. I was just in Jordan visiting with King Abdullah, who has successfully air-dropped badly needed food and water into northern Gaza from the back of a C-130. My friend known to many of your viewers, Jose Andres, has also been successfully delivering relief into Gaza by air. I recognize there are real concerns about the possibility of Hamas taking some of that. But at this point, the conditions are near starvation. And the chaos that is unfolding on the screen right now to your viewers of starving people assaulting an aid truck is going to only get worse. In the recent meetings I had in Israel and the region, I was pressing for a ceasefire. The month of Ramadan, the holiest month of the Muslim calendar begins in just about 10 days. And I think there is a critical opportunity here for hostages to be released, for humanitarian aid to get into Gaza, for the conflict to come down both on the ground in Gaza and throughout the region, on the border with Lebanon, in Iraq, in the Red Sea. There are Iranian proxies in all of those areas who are attacking Israel or attacking American troops or attacking civilians shipping. A ceasefire in Gaza would reduce all of those tensions. And I urged Prime Minister Netanyahu to take the opportunity here to extend his hand and to secure the release of some of the hostages who've been trapped beneath Gaza by Hamas for 145 days.",

The Supreme Court has looked at immunity for presidents in civil situations but never looked at any kind of immunity or shield -- what immunity is as a shield from prosecution in a criminal context. So, it's an important question.And as we know, Donald Trump has his presidency really posed unique challenges to the legal system.

And they phrased it in a particular way, Wolf. They said from criminal prosecution for alleged acts that would relate to official duties.
