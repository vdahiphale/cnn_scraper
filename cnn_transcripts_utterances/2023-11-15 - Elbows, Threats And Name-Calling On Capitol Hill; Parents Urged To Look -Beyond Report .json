Part of the reason I'm not telling the full story is because bees don't mean what parents think they mean these days.And so, I want to take a look at we have some graphics to show you the disparity the disconnect between, between report cards and actual performance. So nearly nine in 10 parents think their child is on grade level for reading and math. Nearly 80 percent say their children receive B's or better, and even 36 percent of parents who say they know their child is below grade level say that those children still are getting mostly B's or better. So that gives you the first kind of instance of the disconnect. Here we see the national report card showing actual academic achievement in 2022. You would think that a B and up would mean proficiency. But in fact, only about a third of fourth graders and eighth graders were proficient in reading and 36 percent of fourth graders in math, only 26 percent --",

She's Tim Scott's dropped out, that helps her, Jamie Dimon back meeting with her. That's a good sign. Lots of things happening happen for her. I've said for a long time. She's the last best hope for anybody to take on Trump. It's unlikely, but it's possible.And here's how she does it. She just she's got to do is run a strong second, you know, why I think, which I think is very possible now. Then she wins New Hampshire, which I think is very possible. And she's very likely to win South Carolina. That would be a pretty good strength as for suddenly, to be a Man Who Would Be King moment where suddenly Trump's base ceases bleeding.

The anti-Trumpers have just been unable to consolidate. And everyone's excited because Tim Scott got out. He was it 2 percent like, great, give her the whole 2 percent. She still trails by 40 points nationally. And she's still for all the radical abortion things that the Republican Party is doing right now.So, I think she's having her boomlet moments, she's having her moment that, that it's been happening for a long time very rational people want her to be the nominee.
