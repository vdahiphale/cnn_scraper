      "speaker": "GUPTA",
      "sentences": "Yes, so let me give you a little bit of context here. First of all, when you look at recommended screenings, there are only four cancers that actually have routine recommended screenings now, breast, cervical, colorectal, and lung. And that gives you some idea of how well they work in terms of actually finding cancers, which isn't bad. Breast cancer, 61 percent, as low as lung cancer, three percent. People are screened for lung cancer if they have a 20-pack year history of smoking, meaning they smoked at least a pack a day for 20 years or two packs a day for 10 years. Some of those screening tests are better than others.But I think what is interesting, there's obviously lots of other cancers out there that don't have recommended screening tests, like prostate cancer, for example, but there are screening tests out there that can be effective. I think there's two messages here. One is if you look at the data more a little bit closely, you still see that there's a lot of people who simply aren't getting the screening tests. They're just not doing that. So the tests are not going to work, obviously, if people aren't doing them. And we also need better screening tests. So more people need to get screened and we need to do a better job of getting screening tests out there that are even more effective at picking these cancers up. I don't think the answer should be, feel discouraging that these don't work or that we should just stop doing it. I think if anything, just the opposite, we've got to lean more into these.",

So it's quite possible, Kaitlan, those numbers did go down even in terms of people actually going and getting screening tests during the pandemic. Hopefully they go back up again. But I think, again, people see this 14 percent number today. Think of it as a rallying cry as opposed to discouragement with regard to screening tests. They can work. They have saved lives, lots of lives. My mom found a breast cancer on a routine mammogram. I think she's here today because of that. There's a lot of people who have stories like that.

So, if that's true, and we all want our immigrants to come here legally, then the President and Congress need to pay attention to the laws that we have so that they can have an easier way for immigrants to be able to come here, the one that come and work.America has been trying to deal with this border problem, with enforcement of all the policy. I've been chairman of the Board of Trade Alliances. It's a financial organization dealing with trade issues. We've had this issue since way back in 1986 when President Reagan gave amnesty to many illegals that were here. And nothing has changed because the laws haven't changed.

If you talk to Border Patrol, they'll tell you this. Mayor -- I used to be Mayor. I'm sorry. Judge, 28 people are coming in between the ports of entry, two are very bad criminals, and 28 percent of our economic immigrants that simply want to comes and work. Can you please tell me which are the two bad ones and which are the other 28 not so bad? We don't know. So, we have to go after all of them.So, one way to reduce the flow of immigrants that our people have to be pursuing is to give them an easier path to come here, the ones that we do want, and eliminate having the volumes that they're having to deal with. With this amnesty program, what is happening and what will happen here, it was lifted, they're going to have to redeploy people that are in between the ports of entry, because they only have so much time to come and administer to those people by law. So, that means that they're going to take people out of -- in between the ports of entry, where the danger is, where most of the danger is and put them here to administer asylum seekers. To me, that's not a plan that works. And that's why I would like the president to come here and see it for himself and provide the leadership that we need to finally, finally quit trying to solve the border problems with enforcement on the policy, because that hasn't happened over 35 years.

He will join us live to talk about that ahead. HARLOW: I cannot wait for that. But let's begin with the so-called Twitter files. Elon Musk has claimed he wants to bring transparency to Twitter. And well, it's not totally what's happening. But cue the birth of the Twitter files. Let me tell you more. Musk selected a handful of journalists unaffiliated with major credible news organizations with whom he has shared internal Twitter systems and communications that seemed to focus on some of Twitter's most high- profile and sometimes controversial content moderation decisions. These files which the selected journalists then tweet out, appear to call into question the integrity of the company's former leadership while also riling up Twitter's right-leaning -- some of them right- leaning users. This week, former CEO Jack Dorsey responded to the Twitter files acknowledging, yes, there were mistakes made, but saying he believes \"there was no ill intent or hidden agendas and everyone acted according to the best information we had at the time.\" Dorsey added later, \"As for the files, I wish they were released WikiLeaks style, with many more eyes and interpretations to consider. There's nothing to hide.\" He went on to say, \"Only a lot to learn from.\" But Dorsey is not fond of the attacks on his former colleagues. And he says if you want to blame, direct it at me and my actions or lack thereof. So, let's bring in our friends and colleagues, CNN Senior Media Reporter Oliver Darcy and CNN Correspondent Donie O'Sullivan. Thanks, guys very much for being here. And Oliver, we'll get to your reporting in just a minute on these. I would though, like to begin with, I think what is maybe the most talked about Twitter file? What are they called? Is that right? OLIVER DARCY, CNN SENIOR MEDIA REPORTER (on camera): The Twitter files, yes.",

So, the Twitter files though, they really showed the, I think, messy content moderation that was happening behind the scenes. And I think we're seeing -- and it's probably no surprise, but we're seeing that not everyone agrees it's on the same page when they're making these complex decisions.I will say on this specific Twitter files drop, I thought what was really noteworthy was that Elon Musk's handpicked reporter Matt Taibbi said that there was no evidence of government involvement in trying to suppress the story. And that was a big claim that Elon Musk had made earlier when he was hyping these Twitter files. I think that's very important to point out here.",
