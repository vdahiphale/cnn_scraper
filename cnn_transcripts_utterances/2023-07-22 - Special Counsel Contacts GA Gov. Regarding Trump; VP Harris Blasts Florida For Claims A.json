Our colleague Kaitlan Collins confirmed that Smith's team was in touch with Governor Kemp this week.Now, Kemp's office is not saying much, and the timing of a possible FBI interview or grand jury appearance is not clear right now. But Governor Kemp is a key figure in this investigation. That's because in 2020, Donald Trump privately and publicly pressured Kemp to overturn the election. In Georgia, Trump wanted Kemp to interfere with the vote counting, block certification of the results, and convene a special session of the legislature to appoint fake Republican electors. Now, beyond Governor Kemp, the special counsel is also in the process of scheduling interviews with additional witnesses. That includes a potential interview with a former Trump lawyer and an interview with a longtime ally of Rudy Giuliani. All of this comes as possible indictments are looming. Smith sent a target letter to Trump last week signaling that he might be charged with federal crimes for trying to overturn the 2020 election. The grand jury sitting here in Washington, D.C. is expected to meet in the coming days. Then, separate from that, there's the Mar-a-Lago, where Trump is already facing 37 felony charges for allegedly mishandling classified documents and obstructing the investigation. Trump denies wrongdoing, and he pleaded not guilty. Just yesterday, a federal judge in Florida set a new trial date for May 2024. Now, Jim, that's pretty late in the Republican primary schedule. By then, Trump might already be the presumptive GOP nominee. Special Counsel Jack Smith wanted that trial to take place this December, leading to probably a verdict that would come before the Iowa caucuses. But that's not going to happen. The trial is now set for May, though, of course, further delays are always possible. And Donald Trump's team is pretty optimistic that they can kick this thing past the 2024 election. With just one or two more delays, they might be able to do it. Jim?",

Congressman, thanks very much for being with us. Good evening. Florida's new education standards say students will be taught, among other things, how slaves learn skills that could ultimately be used for their benefit. Now, we have to say in no uncertain terms, slavery was evil. There were no benefits from it, full stop. But let's talk about this. You just heard Florida Governor Ron DeSantis say a few moments ago, trying to explain what's going on in Florida and to, I guess, go back at the Vice President that somehow people who were enslaved and working as blacksmiths might be able to use those skills after they weren't slaves anymore. I'm trying to make some sense of this. What's your response to what Florida Governor DeSantis had to say about this? CEDRIC RICHMOND, CAMPAIGN CO-CHAIR, BIDEN-HARRIS 2024: Clearly, factually, he's wrong. Slavery was an abomination. It was utterly evil, and it had zero redeeming qualities. But I think that it further illustrates how far this Republican Party and these candidates are going to the right and to cater and pander to extremists in order to get support. And I think that Governor DeSantis, his campaign has been floundering.

We take Senator Manchin at his word that he's not looking to run.But the one thing I will remind the American people is that in 2016, the third party candidate, Jill Stein, made the difference in Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin. And that's what gave us Donald Trump. And if you look at what Donald Trump gave us, besides the chaos and the bullying, he gave us Amy Coney Barrett. He gave us Justice Kavanaugh, Justice Gorsuch, which rolled back reproductive rights for women, which just rolled back a formative action. So the stakes are too high to make a mistake in this election and to get distracted by possible third-party candidates. So I think people are going to go back and look at what's at stake. They're going to look at what happened in the Hillary Clinton race with the third party candidates and the Russians pushing those candidates. And I think that people are going to look at Joe Biden and Kamala Harris's record and say that they deserve to be reelected because they kept their head down, met the challenges, kept promises, and they made the country a better place.",

There's one other feature and it might be related to El Nino, but there's been very little Saharan dust that's been blown out onto the Atlantic, those trade winds have been weaker than normal that might be related to El Nino. And so there's been so little dust, that that does normally reflect some of the sunlight back to space. And since it's not there, that means that the eastern Atlantic, the eastern tropical Atlantic is quite a bit warmer than it normally would be. That means those hurricanes encounter warm ocean temperatures earlier in their trajectory. Though the western Atlantic is typically much warmer, but because the eastern Atlantic is so warm right now, those storms can begin to intensify earlier, and that, you know, creates a scenario where they can become much stronger by the time they make it to the Caribbean to the US East Coast.

The US team beat Vietnam, three-nothing, as the Americans chase their third world championship -- World Cup Championship in a row.And the US as a new women's superstar in the making. Forward, Sophia Smith really standing out, scoring the team's first two goals in a World Cup debut. The US team plays in the Netherlands on Wednesday. As the Women's World Cup begins, the gender pay gap is alive and kicking. A new CNN analysis finds that female soccer players on average will earn about 25 cents for every dollar men earned at their World Cup last year. And joining us now to talk about this as journalist, Macaela MacKenzie, she covers women's equality in sports and she is also the author of the new book, \"Money, Power, Respect: How Women in Sports are Shaping the Future of Feminism.\" [19:0:08] Macaela, great to talk to you. Thanks for coming on. Important topic. The Women's World Cup is just starting, but female players found out they may not be paid the $30,000.00 that they were each promised. What do you know about this? What can you tell us?",

      "sentences": "Yes, so this is really significant, Jim. And it really underscores some of the nuances in the fight for equal pay.So you know, on the surface level, we have these kind of easy to understand numbers. There's a $330 million pay gap in prize money on offer by FIFA to players of the Women's World Cup versus the Men's World Cup. So as you said, that's 25 cents on the dollar, which is this abysmal pay gap especially compared to the global gender pay gap, which is about 77 cents on the dollar. But going deeper is how this money is distributed to players. So FIFA had initially said that this prize money would be for the first time paid directly to the players instead of the actual federations who would then distribute the money however they saw fit. That meant that every player who showed up at the Women's World Cup this year would make at least $30,000.00, which is a really significant amount of money for a lot of these women. It might be the most money that they ever make professionally in countries especially where they don't have a professional league to play soccer year round. FIFA has now backtracked on that and said that they will return to their original plan of paying the federations directly. That's problematic for a few reasons. Namely, that nearly a third of federations around the world don't pay their women's players and those who do may not distribute that prize money equally. So this was one of the really significant things that we saw in the agreement signed by US Soccer in its men's and women's players last year, not only did that guarantee equal pay, and many equal benefits between both the men's and women's players, but they also became the first Federation to guarantee an equal distribution of any prize money earned by either team. Most players around the world, you know, don't have that contractual guarantee.",

You know, some of the biggest professional athletes in the game, have been fathers for years and that is, you know, really sort of a footnote in their career, whereas for women, you know, it's much different and that is something that we're seeing the US women's national team highlight as well.
