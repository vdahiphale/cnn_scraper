Now, we`re going to take an in depth look at a new program in Los Angeles, aimed at helping to provide shelter for people experiencing homelessness. Our Jake Tapper recently traveled to L.A. the second largest city in the U.S. to meet with the mayor and some of the folks utilizing this temporary housing to learn more about the program. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JAKE TAPPER, CNN ANCHOR (voice over): This is the sound of someone`s entire life essentially being thrown in the trash. In the middle of recent record- breaking rain in Los Angeles, the city is today clearing an encampment for unhoused people. Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass campaigned on fixing the city`s homeless crisis. This is theoretically part of that fix. MAYOR KAREN BASS (D), LOS ANGELES: This is exactly why I ran for mayor. This is the reason why -- TAPPER (voice over): Mayor Bass took me to see the cleanup firsthand, getting people out of tents and onto buses and into temporary housing.

TAPPER (voice over): In a remarkable new study, researchers at the University of California San Francisco surveyed thousands of the homeless in California. Nearly 90% of participants said high housing costs were a barrier to their moving into permanent housing. And the majority of those surveyed did want to get off the streets.",

TAPPER (voice over): Major factors to finding housing are high rents and low income. Then, of course, there`s also discrimination and bad credit. Some people don`t even have ID. Some have been evicted before. Many are dealing with addiction or struggling with physical or mental health problems. The number of people experiencing homelessness in a single night went up 12% in the United States in 2023, in part because COVID programs preventing evictions and housing losses came to an end.
