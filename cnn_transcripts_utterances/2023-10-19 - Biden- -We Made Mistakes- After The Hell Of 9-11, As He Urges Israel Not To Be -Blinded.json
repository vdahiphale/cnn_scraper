For 20 months, the war in Ukraine has not spilled, out of Ukraine's borders, with tiny exceptions here and there, a missile that went over the border, into Poland, for example. But we're not even 20 days, into the war, between Israel and Hamas, in Gaza. And we're already seeing the regional amplification of that, and protests at most of the U.S. embassies, across the region. We saw the USS Carney, a destroyer, in the Red Sea, intercept, three cruise missiles, and a number of drones that were launched from Yemen, according to the Pentagon, by Houthi forces, and potentially targeting Israel. So you're seeing that spillover. And for the U.S., and certainly for Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, the linking chain here is Iran. The Houthis are backed by Iran. A number of Iranian proxies, in Syria and Iraq, have attacked U.S. forces in the past. We've seen similar attacks, over the course of the past 48 hours, though the Pentagon hasn't yet attributed that. So, you see the concern, not only of --",

But even if they did want to negotiate, it's not clear to me that they actually have control, of all these hostages. So, I think it makes the whole process tragically futile. If Hamas were serious, or any of the other parties in Gaza, that have hostages were serious, about negotiating, I think they'd be doing things, right now, that they haven't been doing. They'd be allowing Red Cross, or Red Cross an access, they'd be up -- to the hostages to make sure that they're safe. They'd be allowing medical supplies, to get in. They're doing none of that, which tells me their intention was never really to negotiate, but to use the hostages, as human shields, of sorts, and to really almost like a deterrent, against Israel, slow things down, slow the process down, make Israel think twice, about coming into Gaza. I think Israel's going into Gaza. I think they're going in soon. And tragically, Kaitlan, I just I don't think this hostage crisis is going to get resolved, before then.",

One of the concerns, among humanitarian officials that we've heard from, is if you send 20 trucks in, to an area, where there's hundreds of thousands of people, who are desperate, for food and clean drinking water and shelter? And they think these are the last and only 20 trucks coming in? There's no telling the chaos that 20 trucks can cause, among hundreds of thousands of people. If the message is there's 20 trucks coming today, there's going to be 50 more tomorrow, and 100, the next day? That can be more orderly.

The Minister of Economy said, \"Look, from the political side, we've already given the green light to the Military. It's up to the Military now, when they go in.\" So, the decision's taken. I was also speaking with the Agriculture minister, who also used to be a head of one of the security services, here, fought in Israel's Military, on many occasions. And he said some interesting things, about what Gaza will look like, after this Military incursion, because that's something everyone's been asking. One of the things he said, \"Look, we know that the defenses -- we know that the Gaza border, at 67 kilometers, about 50 miles long, along that whole fence line. We know that that was a security weak point. We're going to radically change it.\" He said there will be a big buffer zone, a no-go zone, effectively a kill zone. No one will be allowed in that area. And that will be there, to protect and make Israel safer, and stop incursions, coming out of Gaza. So, that's one change. But in terms of the overall security change? And this would be a very big difference from where we're at today. He says that the security, in Gaza, the access, for the IDF, in the future, will be like it is, for the IDF, in the West Bank, at the moment, meaning they can go in and arrest people, whenever they want to, on their terms. Sometimes, it's a firefight. But it is nothing like it is going into Gaza. So, what they're talking about is a big force that's going to take a long time, to take substantial control, inside Gaza, to completely eradicate, as they say, Hamas, from the streets, and from the community there. So, this new future, he said, for Gaza, is one where they will need to build a new authority structure there as well. Now, there is no indication of how likely this is to be successful. But this is the first time, we've heard, from senior government officials, about their vision, for what it looks like, after the incursion. Right now, everyone really looking for any indications that the incursion is about to happen here. From Sderot, we've been able to see this evening, tank rounds fired in towards Gaza, heavy machine gun, flares. We haven't seen that before. And the area it was happening in, if there was to be an incursion, that would be one of the places, it would happen. Early days yet.
