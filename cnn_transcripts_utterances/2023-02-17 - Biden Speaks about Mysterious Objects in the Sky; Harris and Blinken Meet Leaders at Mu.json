It's last known location, somewhere over Alaska on Saturday. This as President Biden has now spoken on the U.S. shooting down a Chinese spy balloon, as well as three other objects. He says he makes no apologies for the first one, but is now asking his team to device sharper rules for dealing with other unidentified objects.

      "sentences": "Well, President Biden made very clear yesterday that the U.S. intelligence community believes most likely that these three unmanned aerial objects that were shot down between Friday and Sunday are indeed benign in nature and also making clear that there's no evidence to suggest that there is any kind of rise in these kinds of unmanned objects above U.S. skies. Instead pointing to the fact that the U.S. really widened its aperture on its radar systems which led to capturing -- spotting some of these unmanned objects. And ultimately the president, on the advice of the military, deciding to shoot them down.But what's really interesting here is the decision for the president to actually speak out on this publicly and deliver those remarks. For days White House officials deliberated the possibility and the wisdom of the president delivering these remarks. There were concerns early on about making this a bigger issue than it was by having the president speak on this. And they also wanted to make sure that there was enough information. But I'm told that by yesterday President Biden believed that it was the appropriate time to deliver these remarks. He believed that the U.S. government had enough information about these unmanned objects and also wanted to put these findings in context for the American public. I'm told that the president was especially adamant about included details of his tasking to the U.S. National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan about the steps that he's going to take going forward, setting up this government-wide interagency process that's going to look at new protocols for identifying and handling some of these unmanned objects. Those protocols and that government-wide effort also includes looking to improve the inventory of unmanned objects and also updating rules and regulations for the launching and maintaining of unmanned objects. Those are all details that the president provided. What the president was also trying to do here was to talk about the U.S./China relationship, trying to reassure Americans that while that spy balloon launched by China was indeed a violation of U.S. sovereignty, something that the president said he makes no bones about the fact that he decided to shoot that spy balloon down, he also wanted to reassure the public that this doesn't upend the U.S. relationship all together. And I'm told that that is why the president, yesterday, also ad-libbed this part where he said that he does expect to be speaking with the Chinese President Xi Jinping. I'm told, though, that there is no call actually in the works at this point. No firm plans for a call. But the president wanted to signal his intent to continue those conversations.",

And the police chief tells me that he's actually doing a review, not only of this video, but all administrative procedures moving forward because they still have to decide what's going to happen to the officer after he faces these charges. So many questions still left to be answered, but you can understand why this community was taking a deep breath yesterday, especially after this video was released. So hard to listen to.",

Several other officers are potentially facing termination and disciplinary matters. And then also there could potentially also be more charges according to the DA as they continue their investigation. And also we're still waiting for more video and audio that the city is expected to release from that night. Of course, the video from the incident has already been released, depicted just horrific events surrounding and the beating of Tyre Nichols and now these five men facing charges, murder charges, assault charges and kidnapping.
