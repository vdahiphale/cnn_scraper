And ask yourself, what would be your response? What would be a response if a candidate for Canadian prime minister started calling anyone in Canada who opposes him, who criticizes him, calling them vermin? Vermin that he would reach out and expunge from the fine nation of Canada? What would you say? No doubt, you would be shocked. No doubt, he would be disgusted.

Single story buildings demolished, blown up. Villas demolished, blown up. Stores demolished, blown up. The soldiers you are with, the IDF troops with us said, look, we've been in those buildings, or at least some of those buildings we found rocket propelled grenades. This was an area that Hamas was using to attack the troops, because they went in. This is what they said they have discovered. When I talked to the senior commander who is there with us about the level of destruction, he said, look, this is Hamas hiding among the people. We went on that coast road with missing all destruction. The road turned to dust, unchanged into an armored vehicle to go right into the center of the area around the hospital, the edge of Jabalia camp. There was still intense fighting around the hospital, tanks firing. We have to take cover several times from gun fights going on. We went there to see the top IDF spokesman, Admiral Daniel Hagari. He wanted to show us the connection to the idea of believes there is what Hamas and hospitals and schools. One of the first things he showed us was a tunnel entrance that was connected, he showed us, by power cables to solar powers on the top of the Hamas leaders house. We can see the solar panels, see the cables going down into the tunnel. The tunnel was very close to the hospital. There are big diggers in the street, despite them trying to find the tunnel connection to the hospital. We said that was under investigation. When we got to the hospital, the back of Rantisi Hospital, he said they arrived there five days ago that it was still occupied. They negotiated with the hospital officials to evacuate all the patients and staff in the hospital. That happened. But when they said they are going to get in the hospital, they were taking fire from Hamas. They blew their way into the back of the hospital, and he showed us in their weapon caches that they found in places, evidence that appeared to indicate ropes around chairs, women's clothing, and other things that indicated that Hamas may have been holding hostages there, including guard duty in this underground part of the hospital. That's breaking conventions of international humanitarian law when it comes to protections of hospital. That's according to International Committee of the Red Cross.",

So, Admiral, obviously, the innocent patients, innocent doctors, innocent nurses, innocent people, in any hospital should be protected 100 percent. But U.S. intelligence, according to the sources who spoke with me says there's a command node under the hospital, Hamas command node under the hospital. Hamas people gather in the hospital.

They deliberately put in place the people of Gaza at greater risk by how they -- by how they operate and conduct themselves. And so, it's a tough problem set for the Israeli defense forces.Legitimate targets are terrorists and Hamas leaders, of course, and their ability to continue to conduct plant resource organizations are also legitimate targets. But, when you bury those targets inside civilian infrastructure, particularly a hospital, where there's innocent patients and little kids. You have severe issues that need looking after, it makes it much harder for any military force to go after those targets, because the hospital itself ought to be, as president said, ought to be protected.
