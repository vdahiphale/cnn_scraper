I mean, we didn't even know if Baquer Namazi would still be alive. You know, he was 79 and had lots of medical ailments when he became a hostage in Iran, even the Iranian government's own doctors felt compelled to let him out because they were afraid he was going to die.They kept him a hostage in Iran for many more years outside of prison, they won't even let him leave, despite the fact that his sentence was commuted. And he could have died at any time. And the fact that he's 86 years old now, you know, I think he's been staying alive all this long to be able to reach this moment to be able to hug his son again and freedom to be able to be reunited with his family.",

Talk about what he -- what his mission is, now that he is now having his first breaths of freedom.",

      "sentences": "Well, I think this is his mission, because he has been and will be a case study example of like the worst that can happen to you if you're an American detained somewhere in the world, because of how many times, you know, he and his father were left behind by Democratic and Republican administrations. The reality is, is that there was no difference in outcome. And the policies of Barack Obama and Donald Trump when it came to the freeing of American hostages, Siamak, you know, and Baquer detained at the end of the Obama administration, and they were detained at the end of the Trump administration. And it doesn't matter whether you're talking maximum pressure or engagement, the outcome is the same. And the reason is because no government in the world has ever decided to, you know, lead a multilateral effort to create draconian disincentives for countries that engage in hostage taking. And I would urge President Biden today, immediately after this extraordinary moment has happened to announce to the world that he's determined and will work multilaterally around the world and state sponsored hostage taking as a practice.And the only way you do that is by going after the incentive structure for regimes like Iran that engage in these kinds of behaviors. The reason they do it is because it's profitable every single time, there are no consequences if you do it. And all you have to do is wait, and eventually it will be paid out. It's a logical, rational and reasonable thing to do. And the only way it's going to be ended as a practice is if 30, 40, 50 countries around the world come together and say, we're going to take an attack on one is an attack on all policy. And if one hostage is taking -- taken dozens or even 50, 60 countries around the world would take action against the hostage taker, all of a sudden, then the cost could actually outweigh the benefit, and maybe hostage takers would have to reconsider their perspective. But, you know, we've been doing this the same way since '79. And even earlier in our country's history. And we have to change it in a dramatic and meaningful way.",

But this is a woman who was a loyal wife and mother.And you know, she stayed there when both her husband and her son were in jail, when her husband got out. She took care of him until he could go abroad. But she refused to leave until Siamak was able to leave the country. And she stayed there for years and years and years since until this day came and until she could finally leave the country with her son. And what she's been through as a mother is beyond what anybody can imagine as a mother as a wife.

Unfortunately, in getting prisoners back, whether it's Democrats or Republicans, we've always ended up having to strike some kind of deal. Sometimes it's prisoners for prisoners. Sometimes it's prisoners for releasing money. The nature of the Iranian case is a little bit unusual, because after the Iranian revolution happened, the Iranian government had paid for all kinds of things that have not yet gotten delivered, including arms from the United States.And, you know, that was part of how the Iran deal came together in 2015. That did until President Trump pulled out of it, at least freeze the program in place. So everyone has to make these deals.

Maybe that moment will come.But I guess having released them from the prison, they then had to show the United States they were planning to follow through.
