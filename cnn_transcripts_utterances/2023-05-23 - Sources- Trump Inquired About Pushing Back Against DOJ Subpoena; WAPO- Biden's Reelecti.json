We're also learning the attorney representing Trump in the Justice Department probe into the classified documents found at Mar-a-Lago took highly detailed notes about their conversations. And sources tell CNN, the notes include details about Trump's desire to push back to fight the Justice Department effort through subpoena to recover those documents. Those notes, this is the important part, now in the hands of the Special Counsel. CNN's Katelyn Polantz is here to break that down for us. Their evidentiary value, I assume, is rather large. KATELYN POLANTZ, CNN CRIME AND JUSTICE Yes. So, John, you have a criminal investigation. And what is crucial in any criminal investigation is how good is your evidence. The evidence here appears to be very good. It is very detailed, to the point where members of the Trump team were surprised at how detailed these notes are. And these are notes that speak to exactly what the Justice Department wants to do as they investigate whether or not Donald Trump himself was trying to obstruct their investigation. So in May of 2022, he and his attorney were -- received the subpoena saying you got to get back all the classified records that you have in your possession, anything marked with a classification on it. Give it back to the grand jury. And then these notes are Evan Corcoran's defense attorney and they cover detailed conversations directly between Evan Corcoran, Donald Trump, the types of conversations that when the Justice Department sought these notes, when they went to court to fight to get access to them, they believed would show Donald Trump trying to commit a crime. And they have these notes now, and they are quite, quite significant in the fact that they will be so detailed, and we also are getting a little snippet of what the substance of these notes are. And we can see that Donald Trump or at least we're hearing from our sources that Donald Trump was raising the possibility. Do we have to comply with this subpoena? We don't know how that fits, but it certainly does factor into this obstruction investigation.",

I think the critical aspect to me here, and we don't know this yet from the details, is whether or not this is evidence that Trump was basically admitting to his attorney.Yes, I know, I have classified documents, and I don't want to give them back. That would be a very helpful thing to the Justice Department. Now, Trump's defense to this, I'm just asking for legal advice. And I want to know, can I push back on the subpoena or not? I will say one thing, it strikes me as a little bit unusual that Corcoran's notes are this detailed. When I was a prosecutor, the prosecutor has different styles, but sometimes you don't want to take a whole lot of notes, because you're always worried that some may try to get them to question, you know, what kind of contemporaneous thoughts were going on there. So it's possible. Corcoran was doing this as a little bit of a safety net for himself. Knowing that this is difficult client was kind of volatile, he may have been really documenting his contemporaneous notes at a time. That level of detail reminds me more of an FBI's agents notes than it does contemporaneous notes.",

And when we asked about Donald Trump, the mood did change. The views, the emotions people described were worse.Even one voter who said they would be panicked if Biden were reelected.
