The Defense Department reminding us all that, quote, military members must stay at their jobs because threats don't take a holiday.Joining us now for more on this is retired Army Major Mike Lyons.

I think that's the number we would like to have kept in Afghanistan, frankly, you go back four years at this point.But that 2000 number gives enough center of gravity for the commander on the ground there to control a very large border between Syria and Iraq. And given what's happened in Syria now and given what appears to be so far a peaceful transition into this new government, the fact that the Iranian military proxies have been destroyed fundamentally, and the fact that the Turkish military has been involved and we're protecting the Kurds there. All of these things are putting in favor that the United States is doing the right thing by staying inside of Syria with that number. Two thousand troops gives us that commander on the ground enough to influence the situation as well as project enough American power should the situation get out of hand.",

But if you listen to those around him that are whispering in his ear, Michael Waltz and national security adviser, and I think even Pete Hegseth, they're talking about making sure that ISIS does not re emerge. I think that's going to be their top priority, and the only way that doesn't happen is if you have US Troops there on the ground in that small number, in that small footprint.So I don't think there's going to be any change between the Trump administration and what's happening right now. I think they'll have to be more transparent with that number. But I do think that given Russia is no longer a key factor in Syria right now, be a disadvantage if we decided to leave that area right now and leave it to the forces that act there. We have to protect our Kurdish partners that are there as well. So there are so many things that are saying we need to stay in Syria right now. And I think the people around the incoming president are going to be whispering that in his ear. I don't think you're going to see a lot of changes.",

I can't go into the specifics of proposals because, you know, these are closed door negotiations. But I think it's interesting that that is the talking point that they are putting out there.When they presented to us, they are mischaracterizing what they already provide to us, saying that workers make the equivalent of $30 an hour already, which is just not the case. You know, when you look at our wages, they're combining things like our Spotify premium benefit and our lira mental health benefits. And until grocery stores start accepting, you know, my Spotify premium benefit for currency or my landlord puts my lira towards my rent, those you can't say that you're paying your workers $30 an hour.

This year, people hiking, attending concerts, just being in their own homes, they have died for from heat. In fact, heat is the deadliest type of extreme weather. And climate change is making those heat waves longer and more severe. Heat also means warmer oceans, leading to these supercharged hurricanes like the ones that we saw this year. And that comes with our own health consequences as well. Imagine using a computer by only using your mind. That's just the beginning of what brain computer interface, or BCI technology, combined with artificial intelligence is now hoping to do. Companies like Synchron and Elon Musk's Neuralink, they have begun implanting BCI devices into people's brains to help people who are losing motor function still be able to perform daily tasks. Earlier this year, I met Mark. He's an ALS patient who has mostly lost the ability to use his arms. And we saw firsthand how Synchron's Stentrode device helped send messages on his computer and even play a game like Pong.

That's what Murthy said.It's no secret that diet plays a major role in our health. And while we know the benefits of healthy food, the harms of ultra processed food are now coming into clearer focus. Ultra processed foods make up nearly 70 percent of our country's food supply. Numerous studies have found that consuming higher amounts of these foods raises the risk of obesity, but also the development of chronic conditions like cancer, cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, depression. It probably even shortens lifespan.  Researchers are now trying to figure out if ultra processed ingredients are all created equal.
