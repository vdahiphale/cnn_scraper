It is Tuesday, May 7th, 9 a.m. here in London, 11 a.m. in Gaza, where the Israeli military says it's taking control of the Gaza side of the Rafah border crossing.A video from the Israeli military shows tanks moving into the crossing, which is one of the main supply routes for humanitarian aid to Palestinians in the enclave. Also in Rafah, video shot from the Egyptian side of the border shows explosions from apparent Israeli airstrikes. Hospital officials say 15 people, including a child, were killed in that bombardment. But this was a scene in Rafah just one day ago. Celebrations in the streets after Hamas announced it had agreed to a ceasefire and hostage release proposal. But later, word came that what Hamas agreed wasn't the framework negotiated by Israel and Egypt. Here's what Hamas did agree to, a three-phase plan. First, Hamas would release 33 hostages, specifically women, children, the elderly and the sick. Israel would gradually withdraw its forces from parts of Gaza, release hundreds of Palestinian prisoners, halt reconnaissance flights for 10 hours a day and allow increased humanitarian aid into Gaza. The second phase would include a sustainable period of calm in Gaza. Hamas would release the remaining hostages, including civilian men and IDF male soldiers. The third phase would involve a three- to five-year rebuilding plan for the enclave. Now, the White House says President Joe Biden spoke with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Monday. Mr. Biden relayed his concern that a ground offensive in Rafah could put innocent people in danger. CNN Global Affairs analyst Kim Dozier explains why Mr. Netanyahu thinks that taking Rafah is necessary. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

But also, this onslaught, this threatened onslaught, seems to have goosed Hamas into blinking and saying yes to a ceasefire deal. Of course, now we know it's their terms, as they see them, that are acceptable. This is also a way to give Netanyahu a black eye, because now it's on Israel, it's on Netanyahu to say, oh, well, this isn't the deal that we signed up for after you see all these celebrations in Gaza, etc. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Now, we understand that Israel is sending what they're calling a working-level delegation to Cairo to continue talks on some sort of ceasefire, on some sort of agreement for the release of Israeli hostages, or rather hostages in Gaza. But what's clear is that the Israelis do not want to agree to anything that comes with the suggestion that there's going to be a long-term ceasefire.Now, one of the phrases we're hearing time and again when people are talking about some sort of agreement is a sustainable period of calm. That would indicate the war could be coming to an end, and that's something clearly Benjamin Netanyahu, the embattled Israeli prime minister, doesn't want to admit to because the Israeli goal continues to be, in addition to the release of the hostages, the destruction of Hamas. The Americans have told the Israelis that that might not be a realistic goal in this war, but short of that, if Israel is incapable or fails to destroy Hamas, this could lead to the collapse of the Israeli government, a coalition that Benjamin Netanyahu cobbled together that includes extremist ministers who have said that any sort of premature end to this war means an end to his government -- Max.",

And on this day, Xi Jinping is wrapping up his visit to France. He is heading next to Serbia.But in the next hour or so, as you mentioned, Xi Jinping will soon be meeting once again with the French president, not in the Elysee Palace, but in the Pyrenees for some informal one-on-one time, which will be quite in contrast to those more formal talks in Paris, where Xi Jinping was challenged on those issues, trade and the war in Ukraine. And as expected, in Paris on Monday, the EC president, Ursula von der Leyen, really took Xi on and took a tough line on trade. Tension has been rising over unfair market access, you know, for products like French cognac, trying to get into the Chinese market, and subsidized Chinese exports like EVs, which are just overcapacity and flooding the market. Now, Xi Jinping agreed that trade friction should be addressed through discussions. And we also learned this afternoon that state media is reporting that an MOU with Airbus was signed to deepen further aviation cooperation and introducing more investment between France and between China. Now, on the issue of Ukraine, Xi Jinping told Macron again that China won't sell weapons or military parts to Russia. Xi Jinping also backed what Macron is calling for a global Olympic truce to take place during the upcoming Paris Games. And French officials are hoping that this is a sign that China will, yes, use its leverage over Russia to reach a truce in Ukraine. Xi Jinping is going to be traveling to Serbia next. He is scheduled to touch down in the early evening or 12 p.m. Eastern time, which will, again, be just in time for the 25th anniversary of the NATO bombing. And in a signed letter in a Serbian media outlet that was just released, Xi Jinping described the relationship between China and Serbia as being, quote, forged by blood. Back to you -- Max.",
