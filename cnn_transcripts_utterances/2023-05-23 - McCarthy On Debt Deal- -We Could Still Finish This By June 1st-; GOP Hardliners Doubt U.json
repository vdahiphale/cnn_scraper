The president, now speaker called their latest debt ceiling meeting productive, and they say a sign of good progress. But Kevin McCarthy's morning after update is rather bleak. Nowhere near ideal he says. This is the treasury begins checking just how long agencies can pay their bills.Plus, legal quicksand for Donald Trump. His words at a CNN townhall push E. Jean Carroll to seek more damages and his instructions about how to handle classified documents, recorded in detailed notes taken by his lawyer and up in the hands of the special counsel. And battleground states, swing voters dread, just dread the idea of a Biden-Trump rematch. But their focus group take on what happens if there is one, well, it's quite revealing. Up first for us though, debt ceiling negotiators back at it on Capitol Hill right now. The Biden team arriving at the Capitol last hour. They are now with Speaker McCarthy's team behind closed doors. Both sides say there is good faith, yet both sides also say there is little progress. This morning, the speaker telling fellow House Republicans the two sides are nowhere near agreement. And because of that, he said, \"I need you all to hang with me.\" But it's an important, but the speaker says there is time if the White House gives ground. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY (R-CA): We could still finish this by June 1st in a timeline. We met again last night. We're not there yet. It really comes down to this. Why are we in the problem? People spend too much money, and the Democrats want to even spend more than we spent last year. That is not going to happen. (END VIDEO CLIP) KING: Progressives though, are warning the president, they won't accept major spending cuts, the time crunch, more pressing by the hour. The treasury secretary says June 1. That's nine days away is when the checks likely start bouncing. Let's get straight up to Capitol Hill with CNN's Lauren Fox. Lauren, again, it's an interesting, how do you read this? Everybody says there's goodwill, but everybody says there's no real progress.",

And they made it clear, they need to see some clear concessions from the White House when it comes to spending. They don't want to just three spending levels. They want to cut spending going forward. That means returning spending levels to something like fiscal year 2022 levels. That's what this country spent last year.Meanwhile, House Speaker Kevin McCarthy right now on the floor of the House of Representatives were watching for him just in case he comes out and wants to offer any more context about his comments privately to Republicans this morning that they are nowhere close to a deal and that he does need his conference to hang with him. So far, we are seeing evidence that many Republicans trust him. They believe that he's going to cut the best deal he can with the president. They also argue that they are confident that he is going to get a deal that looks a lot like the one they passed a couple of weeks ago, John, but this is a significant moment for the speaker. It's a significant moment for his speakership and whether or not Republicans continue to hang with him as we move closer to the deadline remains to be seen. John?",

Jeremy, let me start where Lauren just ended. These House Republicans saying, they think McCarthy can get something pretty close to what they passed. What they passed in the House takes big Biden administration achievements off the books. What they passed in the House, would restrict spending cut, future spending way beyond what the president said he's willing to accept.

And the question is, is everybody in the room has to then believe the deadline is real.However, listen to some key House Republicans here. The treasury secretary says June 1, maybe there's a day or two. But she says June 1. Everyone should lock in on that because at that point, the United States is on the edge or at default, can't pay the bills, deck economic crisis at home, economic crisis around the globe, but some Republicans say, I don't buy it. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. MATT GAETZ (R-FL): I don't believe that the first of the month is a real deadline. I don't understand why we're not making Janet Yellen show her work. I no longer trust like the Obi-Wan Kenobi of wrong answers on the economy to be able to tell me when the default occurs. REP. CHIP ROY (R-TX): The fact is, we're going to have cash in June. The fact is, we're not going to default on our debt, that's just completely false. We've got the money to do it. So, everybody just needs to be patient. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

So, I think the serious people who are negotiating this do see a flashing red light. They do seem to think that Janet Yellen knows what she's talking about, when she says June 1 is a serious deadline. And at that point, there will be a problem in terms of cash on hand. But listen, this, I think is ending up the way a lot of people thought it wouldn't. Because of the people we heard on screen, that sort of hardliners in Kevin McCarthy's caucus, the ones that he empowered in so many ways.

Trump said that. And to think that it isn't impacting a number of these hardline conservatives, is, I think, you know, a mistake to think that it wouldn't impact them, because they are essentially saying that they don't think that a default would always have the catastrophic impact that all these economists are warning that it would have. And what it would do is, it would mean Medicare cuts, cuts to veterans, Social Security paychecks don't go out.

Another thing in Steve's reporting, and who knows if this works. I don't know if the old rules apply anymore. Normally, voters are focused on here and now, not a process. But DeSantis is going to make the argument to Republican voters that you don't want Donald Trump because he can only serve one more term, right? He can only serve four years because he already was president. You want an eight-year Republican presidency, or at least the prospect of it. And one of the twists on that is that he talks about Donald Trump thinks, naming three justices to the Supreme Court that overturn Roe v. Wade is an asset for him. Ron DeSantis says, well, what about Justice Alito and Justice Thomas, they're getting up there. You might have to replace them and for that you want a two term Republican president. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV. RON DESANTIS (R-FL): So, it is possible that in those eight years, we'd have the opportunity to fortify justices Alito and Thomas, as well as actually make improvements with those others.

Donald Trump obviously talked about the Supreme Court. That was one of the reasons why I think a lot of people ended up rallying around him. He put out that big list in May of 2016 of the justices he would appoint. So, he's trying to do that now.But again, it's six-three. I mean, they dominate the court already. They've overturned Roe v. Wade, and you have Donald Trump taking credit for that.

So, we can get the kind of Supreme Court that we want to have.That's maybe a more palatable argument. But I agree with you that that's not ultimately the core concern for Republican primary voters.
