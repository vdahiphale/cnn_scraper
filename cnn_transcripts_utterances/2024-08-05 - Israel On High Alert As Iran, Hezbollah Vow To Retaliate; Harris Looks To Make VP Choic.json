Now it's sort of counterintuitive to many of our viewers, why would he do that? Well, there's a simple explanation for that. The first is to distance himself from October 7th and to portray this or to, you know, fabricate this new narrative, according to which this is not just a terror attack by Hamas on October 7th, but this is a regional war.

But you know, there's some in the middle ranks and the lower ranks, they don't have access to that level of corruption. They don't -- and you know, their families are living on the local communities just like everybody else. They see the despair around them so there's a possibility that some of those might break. Look, I don't think that you're going to see an uprising anytime soon from the security forces in Venezuela. But what I think it is a possible -- possibility to think about and certainly hope for and work for, is that if the order comes from on top to shoot and kill and repress peacefully demonstrating citizens in the streets of Caracas or elsewhere in the country that those folks with the guns will think twice and frankly won't shoot nor kill their own citizens. And if that happens, then you could get a different game because if the regime can't actually control the streets, then that's when its real survivability is at risk. And so I think that's the issue we need to be thinking about and working toward. If the people simply refuse to kill their own citizens who are peacefully protesting and I think we have the right to expect that as well.",

In fact, earlier, we once heard Hasina invite student protesters to engage in unconditional dialogue with her because she said she wanted to sit with them and to (INAUDIBLE) to really hear their grievances. She also said she wanted the violence to end.But those very same students she once said she wanted to engage with, she's now calling terrorists amid their calls for her to stepdown. Now student protesters did reject her invitation because they felt that essentially it was far too little, far too late. When the supreme court scrapped most of those government quotas last month, we did see the protests subside and stop momentarily, but clearly it wasn't enough to quell peoples anger entirely because protesters believed that Hasina and her government should be held accountable for the numerous deaths and injuries we've seen from these demonstrations, which can often turn very violent and deadly. Now, these student protest leaders have also called on citizens to engage in civil disobedience, to stop paying their taxes, to stop paying their utility bills, for example, to stop taking public transportation. They're also again urging Hasina to resign and for her and her government to be held responsible for these deaths. So like you said, Michael, we're really seeing these student protests turn into a wider anti-government movement. Take a look at how some of these demonstrations are once again flaring up in Bangladesh. And they're becoming very, very deadly. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",
