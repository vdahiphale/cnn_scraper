And also finally the day votes will really be counted here in this Senate runoff. Polls are open across the state in this fight between incumbent Raphael Warnock and his Republican challenge Herschel Walker, the result critical to the balance of power in Washington, specifically in the Senate. Will Democrats have a clear majority with Raphael Warnock winning or will Republicans maintain some bargaining power if Walker wins? We're also focused on Capitol Hill. You're taking a look at live pictures inside the Capitol Rotunda, where congressional leaders are gathering right now to honor the heroism of so many members of law enforcement on January 6, presenting them with Congress' highest honor to those who defended the Capitol during the attack nearly two years ago now. We'll bring that to you live when it begins. But let's start in Georgia, Amara Walker live. What are you hearing from voters today?",

I spoke with the COO of the Georgia secretary of state's office, Gabriel Sterling, a few moments ago. And he told me the average wait time across state, across 2,700 polling locations, is just over a minute. Compare that to early voting wait lines and it is a huge difference. He says about 400,000 people have already cast their ballots as of this morning. And he does estimate about a million plus turnout overall today. Will it be 1.1 million or 1.4 million, that is hard to predict and it remains to be seen. But a ton of interest in this runoff. Early voting numbers breaking records, 1.85 million ballots were cast during that shortened voting period. The bottom line is turnout today will be key. And of course, both candidates, Raphael Warnock and Herschel Walker, are hammering this message home. Listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) HERSCHEL WALKER (R-GA), U.S. SENATORIAL CANDIDATE:  The best thing I've ever done, including the Heisman trophy, Horatio Alger (ph), all the thing, best thing I've ever done is run for office right here.

Republicans should be at parity with Democrats going into Election Day. But the turnout today, absolutely is important. They're keeping an eye on the weather and the rain has stopped by and large at least here in Atlanta. The sun is shining in other parts of the state. So that is giving them hope.

Of course, a downside for him in the eyes of some voters are that heis a Democrat and he is tied to the Biden agenda. That is at the heart of the Herschel Walker campaign message, saying that a vote for Raphael Warnock is a vote for Joe Biden. So that is the question here, when you boil it all down. The Democratic majority of the Senate is in place. But is it going to give the president and the White House some more breathing room here? And Herschel Walker, he's really running on who he is, as a football great from Georgia. But by and large he's running on someone who he said would be a Republican through and through, would vote a straight Republican ticket and would be sort of a -- a check on the Democratic agenda here. So when you break it all down, it is quite simply that. What the views are of the Biden agenda. And former president Trump also plays a role in this because he recruited Herschel Walker to run in the first place. But it is really astounding, as much as Joe Biden and Donald Trump have been at the center of all this, neither of them have been here at all because they're also viewed as a detriment by both sides.",

Let me play this for everyone.(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP) JOE BIDEN (D), PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  It really is critical because, look, all of the things that Reverend Warnock has supported are things that the people of Georgia care a great deal about.

So he stayed away at the request of the Herschel Walker campaign.But he did call into a telerally last evening. And that is where those words came from. But look, Senator Warnock would Democrats and Chuck Schumer more breathing room. Democrats like the idea of that. So as Georgia voters have the last word on this 2022 national campaign at least, what type of a message is it going to send going forward? Trump-backed candidates have really been -- independent voters have soured on them in state after state. That is one of the reasons that Republicans did not win control of the Senate. So the outcome of this race tonight is about more than Herschel Walker and about Raphael Warnock. It's going to say a lot about Trump and Joe Biden going forward as we head pretty quickly into the next election.",

January 6 was a day of horror and heartbreak. Yet it is also a moment of extraordinary heroism. Staring down deadly violence and despicable bigotry, our law enforcement officers bravely stood in the breach and ensured that democracy survived on that dark day.

Regardless of your political affiliation, you responded like you do each and every day, without hesitation, with courage and an unwavering duty to uphold your oath. You were confronted by individuals engaged in heinous behavior with the intent of causing you harm and destroying our democratic process. You did not give up and you did not give in. And, yes, with you were vastly outnumbered. But you were determined. Exhausted and injured, it was your blood, your sweat and your tears that mark these grounds where we stand today. And you endured this without reluctance. This commitment to our nation is a reflection of your spirit and serves as an enduring reminder that adversity is also an opportunity.

KEVIN MCCARTHY (R-CA), MINORITY LEADER:  I appreciate the House and Senate for agreeing to use the Rotunda to honor the Capitol Police and D.C. Police. Today we pay tribute to their service and sacrifice on January 6th. These brave men and women in uniform stood strong in the line of duty for our country. And we're forever grateful for that. This Congressional Gold Medal commemorates their courage, professionalism and patriotism. There is no more fitting place to show our gratitude than the Rotunda of the Capitol, a room that is a symbol of a sacred building, the symbol of a great nation, a symbol of freedom and self-government here and around the world. The Capitol Police and D.C. Police are valued members of this community. But they're also members of another community, the community of law enforcement, the brotherhood of law enforcement. By awarding them the Congressional Gold Medal, we're not only honoring them for protecting our nation and community on January 6th but we're honoring them for the essential brotherhood as well. To all of the law enforcement officers who keep this country safe, thank you. Putting on the badge means putting yourself in harm's way to protect others, to keep the country safe. These brave men and women are heroes, heroes who protected so many from harm on that day. Heroes who live out the code to protect and serve, heroes who do the noble work. Too many people take that for granted. But days like today force us to realize how much we owe that thin blue line. We're forever indebted to them for their heroism. Today we take an important step toward repaying the debt by presenting them a Congressional Gold Medal. As Congress' highest honor, this award says that the service and sacrifice of these officers will not be forgotten. I hope every American will see this award and feel the gratitude for every law enforcement officer who answered the call of duty every day but especially the Capitol Police and D.C. officers on January 6, because that is what is great and grateful nations do.
