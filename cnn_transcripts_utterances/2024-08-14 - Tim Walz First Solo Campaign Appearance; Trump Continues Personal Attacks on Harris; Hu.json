Stop talking about all the things you're talking about. We go through this over and over again, every couple of weeks, it feels like. And it seems like Donald Trump feels very clear of the kind of campaign he wants to run here. It's the kind of campaign that worked for him in 2016. It is not, at least according to the most recent polls, working as well for him at this moment against Kamala Harris. We'll see what happens here with it.

John Kerry had come to national prominence at a young age as a vehement opponent of the Vietnam War, which he criticized not just as a mistake, but as a crime. He accused Americans of committing atrocities. People remember -- in 2004, that was a memory. Then in 2004, he campaigned as a war hero. And so, the question you ask is, wait a minute, you have denounced this war is like equivalent to Genghis Khan's -- literally, Genghis Khan's depredations against humanity. And now, you say, but elect me because I was a hero in Genghis Khan's army. How does that make sense?What J. D. Vance is -- it's just pedantic.
