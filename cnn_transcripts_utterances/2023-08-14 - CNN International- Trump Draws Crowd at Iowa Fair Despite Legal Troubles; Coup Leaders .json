And if you're just joining us, let me bring you up to date with our top stories this hour.Hawaii's main electric provider, Hawaiian Electric Industries, is now facing a lawsuit claiming the company kept power lines live during high winds driving the destructive fires responsible for at least 96 deaths. The fire in Lahaina is now the deadliest in the U.S. in over a century. And Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis is expected to present her case to a grand jury in Georgia and possibly bring at least a dozen indictment, including fourth round of charges for Donald Trump. Even with the threat of a possible fourth indictment hanging over his head, former U.S. President Donald Trump is making a big show of confidence at the Iowa State Fair. The fair is a major event on the campaign trail and although he drew large crowds over the weekend, Trump still faces competition from his chief rival Florida Governor Ron DeSantis. CNN's Steve Contorno has the latest. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

      "sentences": "The campaigns of Florida Governor Ron DeSantis and former President Donald Trump clashed over the weekend at the Iowa State Fair, where both Republican candidates tried to build support in what is going to be one of the most important GOP contests on the nominating calendar.Now, for Governor DeSantis, this was an opportunity to turn the page after a difficult stretch in his campaign. He has cut staff. He has cut spending. And he has now refocused his efforts on some of these early nominating contests, trying to win back support and convince Republican voters that he will be a better nominee for the party to take on Joe Biden in November 2024. RON DESANTIS, U.S. REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: We need to leave this country better off than we found it and we are in danger of being the first generation that turns over less opportunities to our kids than the opportunities we've inherited and that is unacceptable. CONTORNO: DeSantis spent most of Saturday at the fair where he was flipping pork chops and playing fair games with his family. Meanwhile, Trump reminded people why he is the Republican frontrunner, he showed up for a few short hours, but still brought a huge crowd and many people were there to hear him speak. And when he spoke, he talked a lot about the legal troubles that have dogged his campaign but continue to make him popular among Republican voters.",

These charges against President Bazoum is just one example. And we don't know specifics about what this means.But last night a military spokesman said that President Bazoum would be prosecuted for, quote, high treason and undermine the internal and external security of the country. Now, you will remember that President Bazoum is being held captive in the basement of the presidential palace and he says he's being deprived of food and medicine and human contact. But last night in this statement the military spokesman said that he denied these allegations and said President Bazoum had been allowed to see doctors regularly and also saw a doctor on Saturday. Now, the talks -- some of the talks that you mentioned were brokered by a prominent Nigerian cleric -- Islamic cleric -- who led a delegation to Niger over the weekend and had talks with General Tiani. He says he's ready to talk to ECOWAS. But we've heard this before. And it remains to be seen whether these talks will go ahead. But ECOWAS, as you know, has threatened force if President Bazoum is not reinstated. It doesn't appear with charges coming that he will be reinstated. And so, the stakes are upping in this what looks to be a tense standoff -- Bianca.",

Stephanie Busari live from Lagos, thank you.Ecuador's presidential debate began on Sunday with a moment of silence for slain candidate Fernando Villavicencio. His absence was also marked with an empty podium on the stage. Villavicencio, and anticorruption candidate, was assassinated on Wednesday after a campaign event in Ecuador's capital. And his party is now nominating a candidate to replace him for the second time in two days. They've chosen Christian Zurita, a journalist who previously worked with Villavicencio. On Saturday, the party had put out Villavicencio's running mate Andrea Gonzalez Nader as his replacement but they changed their minds. Worried about an obscure election law that might keep her from being qualified and she's already registered as a vice presidential candidate. She still plans to run for that post. Needless to say it's been a tragic and terrifying couple of days for Fernando Villavicencio's running mate. Andrea Gonzalez Nader sat down with CNN's Rafael Romo for this exclusive interview. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ANDREA GONZALEZ NADER, ECUADORIAN VICE-PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I think any other Ecuadorian is at the risk of getting shot right now in the street. RAFAEL ROMO, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): She was supposed to be there, as his running mate, Andrea Gonzalez Nader, should have been right next to Ecuadorian presidential candidate Fernando Villavicencio when he was shot last Wednesday as he was leading a rally in Quito, the capital.",

The second I got to that fire, I immediately turned around and I knew it was going to be bad with those winds. And you just see everything being caught on fire and people running for their lives. You know, kids screaming babies being handed off to other people. It was something out of a volcano or like a war movie.Only thing that I could do is race back to the house to save my wife and the dogs we were looking after. You know, got the dogs, my wife got in the car and we didn't know where to go. The smoke and fire was heading towards the north, so we wanted to go south, and they had roadblocks preventing us from going south. They kind of got pushed into the Lahaina area where it is a very small town and everybody was just stuck in traffic. And we had abandoned our car on the sidewalk, run for our life in the other direction since we saw the direction we're heading to was already on fire, to our side was on fire. And then once we noticed that the direction, we're now running with all these dogs is on fire, we were stuck in the middle. Only thing that we could do is jump in a van for a little bit with some of the dogs that we were able to get. And you know, when we jumped in the van, the van was actually filled with propane tanks. So at that point we decided to throw all those propane tanks, get, you know, away from the seawall where we knew we had to jump. And over the course of 12 hours, we were hiding in the seawall, jumping in and out of the water, dodging where the flames and fires were. Even in the water we're getting burned and dunking underwater. There's times where we thought we truly were going to die. I remember calling my mom telling her that I love her, my brother, my daughter that's only four years old. You know, telling her that I love her and thinking this is my last call. And now right on that last call all those propane tanks went and it's, you know, it was intense. It was a very intense day. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
