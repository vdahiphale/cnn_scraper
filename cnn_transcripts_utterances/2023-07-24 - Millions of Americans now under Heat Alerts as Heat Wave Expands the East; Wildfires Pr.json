But for some who maybe work outside, it is impossible to avoid the heat. They have to be outside. And those people are being reminded to wear the appropriate clothes, to take water breaks, to be in the shade, to stop working when you feel dizzy or when you begin to feel sick.And it is very important to point out the significant impacts of these heat waves, starting with hospitals, for example, who have reported an increase in some of the patients that they're seeing, heat-related illnesses and heat stroke, for example, in some of the hospitals in the most affected areas. And then there's also the economic impact of all of this. A recent study showing that it costs the U.S. about $100 billion a year, and that's only in productivity loss alone. That's what the extreme heat is costing the U.S. and many of the industries the most impacted being agriculture and construction, but really there is no industry or business that is immune to this. Think about for example a food truck and being in a kitchen when it's extremely hot. Think about pets or animals at the zoo and the people that actually work at the zoo.

But police was just telling me now that they are preparing for possible further evacuations as well. Now on the island of Rhodes, thousands of people have left the island, thousands of tourists, some have been moved to other destinations. We have to understand that this is also the absolute peak season of the summer, which means the island is pretty packed. All the hotels were very busy and it's been an incredibly difficult operation from what authorities are telling us. Some people left on foot, they left just with their passports in their hands and they were moved to some larger cities. Some of them have by now already left the island. And some of the travel agencies and the travel lines have suspended services for now. So as you understand for the economy of the island, this is also a very serious issue. But luckily so far we've had no casualties. We have no reports of serious injuries of any kind. But this is a very ongoing situation. A number of other fires have broken out in Greece just in the last 24 hours alone. This is because the country is pretty much a tinderbox right now.

Well, this could be an historic week for former U.S. President DonaldTrump, who's facing the possibility of a third criminal indictment this year, this time for trying to overturn the 2020 election. Even Trump himself believes the indictment is coming. The question is when? A third indictment could also be a game changer in the battle for the Republican presidential nomination, but some of Trump's Republican challengers are shrugging off his role in the January 6 insurrection among those questioning the case against him, his former vice president Mike Pence. You would recall of course, Pence was whisked away to safety that day as writers chanted hang Mike Pence after believing Trump's claim that Pence had the power to overturn the results but refused. Here's what Pence told CNN about it on Sunday. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MIKE PENCE, FORMER U.S. VICE PRESIDENT: While his words were reckless, based on what I know, I'm not yet convinced that they were criminal. President Trump was wrong on that day, and he's still wrong in asserting that I had the right to overturn the election. But what his intentions were, and as you know, criminal charges have everything to do with intent, what the president's state of mind was. And I don't honestly know what his intention was that day, whether as he spoke to that crowd, as he tweeted during the riot itself. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

The Russian capital now for the fourth time being targeted by drones, the first one was of course in early May when drones targeted the Kremlin itself.This, according to the mayor of Moscow, was two non-residential buildings, one really quite close to the center, an area adjacent to the Russian Ministry of Defense where they say debris was found. They had a road closure there which appears, according to a local traffic map, to have been lifted. And then in the south of the city, a non-residential high-rise business center was apparently hit, although Russia is saying that it averted those drones from hitting its target.

      "sentences": "Well, Rosemary, just to remind viewers that this part of the judicial overhaul is to do with reasonableness. The government is trying to pass a law that would prevent the Supreme Court from blocking government decisions on the ground of whether it deems them reasonable or unreasonable. So that's what they're voting on. These votes are due later today. And if these votes go ahead, then the government, the governing coalition, with 64 out of 120 seats in the Knesset, is going to get this bill passed.It seems incredibly unlikely, even if there are one or two dissenters, that it would not be able to do so. The question is, will this vote actually take place? Because there is a huge amount of pressure going on right now to try to reach some kind of compromise, not just from the protesters that you see out on the streets, not just from tech workers and some business groups, which are striking today again to put more pressure on the government, not just from reservists, who are some of whom are refusing to serve if this bill gets passed. But you've even got pressure from no less than President Joe Biden, who for the second time in a week has said in a statement that he shared with CNN that a compromise needs to be reached. He said, given the range of threats and challenges confronting Israel right now, it doesn't make sense for Israeli leaders to rush this, adding that the focus should be on putting people together and finding consensus. And actually, President Isaac Herzog, fresh from a visit to Joe Biden in the United States, went straight from the airport, from his plane, to meet with Netanyahu when he was still in hospital last night. He then met with leaders of the opposition as well as they tried to reach some kind of compromise over this judicial overhaul. According to reports, it seems to be that one of the sticking points is how far down the road each side is prepared to kick the can of the rest of these judicial overhaul measures. For now, there is no agreement. And of course, the other interesting question is, Rosemary, what happens if this bill is passed? Because usually the president would have to sign it into law. In theory, he could refuse, but that would be unprecedented. And the Israeli Bar Association has already said that if this bill is passed, that it will file a petition to the Supreme Court to block it from coming into effect. So effectively, the Supreme Court would be asked to perhaps block a bill that is designed to prevent the Supreme Court from blocking bills. It's all very complicated, and we'll have to see how this vote plays out later today, Rosemary.",

So this is not just a judicial overhaul. This is an attempt by the Israeli government to gain unlimited power, and they are saying so openly. You know, you listen to the Netanyahu supporters, and they basically say, hey, we won the elections. That means we can do anything we want. Any restriction on our power is undemocratic. They don't understand the meaning of democracy. And they are trying to now to grab unlimited power. And this is why you see something which was really unimaginable in Israel.

The coalition members are openly saying, and this is not a secret, they intend to annex the occupied Palestinian territories without giving citizenship to the Palestinians. The reason they go after the Supreme Court is because they know it will block it.But once the Supreme Court is out of the way, we are very likely to see an escalation in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. This government is led by zealots who believe in an ideology of Jewish supremacy. You know, and Netanyahu has been warning the world for years about the dangers of a fundamentalist regime with nuclear weapons.

They also went on to say, quote, \"The State of Texas actions violate federal law, raise humanitarian concerns, present serious risks to public safety and the environment, and may interfere with the federal government's ability to carry out its official duties.\" Now, officials have been talking for months within the administration as to what actions, if any, could be taken by the Justice Department as they watched with concern the actions the Texas governor was taking along the Texas-Mexico border. Those floating barriers have, for example, posed a potential drowning risk to migrants who are crossing. Now, the Texas governor in a tweet said that it is the sovereign authority to defend our border. So he is standing firm on his position to keep those barriers. But again, he can reply by Monday afternoon as to whether or not he will take them down. If not, the Justice Department says in their letter they're ready to take the Texas governor to court.

CNN and the Archive define a mass shooting as one that injures or kills four or more people, not including the shooter. This weekend, we have seen several smaller scale shootings around the country. One at a hospital in Oregon, one at a bar in Florida, four incidents in New York City, and a series of shootings in the city of Chicago, which killed at least six people. A senior general and the U.N. command says conversations are now underway with North Korea's military about the U.S. Army private who suddenly ran into North Korea last week. There are still no details about Travis King's whereabouts or condition nearly a week after he bolted across the border from the truce village at the DMZ. King had been facing transfer back to the U.S. after being convicted of assault in South Korea. But military officials say it's not clear why he willfully crossed into the North without any authorization to do so. Travis King is far from the only American held by North Korea over the years. Experts are looking at how Pyongyang treated earlier American prisoners to try to figure out how they might be handling King. CNN's Brian Todd has that part of the story from Washington. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BRIAN TODD, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Army Private Travis King joins a sobering list of Americans who've been held by the oppressive Kim regime in North Korea. One of the best known among them, college student Otto Warmbier, arrested in 2016 while on a tour of North Korea for trying to steal a propaganda poster from his hotel in Pyongyang.",

Scarlatoiu says it's possible that another high- level American could be sent to North Korea to get Travis King out, but he says that all depends on whether King actually wants to leave.

The center-right People's Party is set to come in first, winning 136 seats in parliament. But in order to govern, a party or coalition must have a working majority of 176 seats in the 350-seat legislature. And because no single party won enough seats to form a government on their own, the tough task of trying to build a coalition must begin.Journalist Al Goodman joins me now from Madrid.

There may be a period, the horse trading is expected to start now, this day, the day after the elections, which had some surprises, but it did keep, according to the left, it kept the far right Vox party out of a potential conservative government. That's where it stands right now.But then there will be a pause and the political parties will reconvene as parliament sort of opens again in mid-August. And then, there are consultations between the party leaders and the king of Spain, the head of state, who will then suggest a leader to stand for investiture and to vote. This is a process that happens all the time. The current socialist prime minister, Pedro Sanchez, who did better than expected in the elections and currently has a coalition government, his socialist party, a grouping of other leftist parties nationally, and some nationalist parties from Catalonia that's around Barcelona and the northern Basque region, and City of San Sebastian is one of those. They've been giving him support. But I just talked to a senior leader of the Socialist Party who said that a chance for Sanchez to repeat is not impossible, but it's going to be tough this time because these nationalist parties are going to demand a higher price. In fact, we heard one of the nationalist party leaders in Catalonia last night saying that our importance is Catalonia. We don't care about the government of Spain. So a lot is going on there. Now the leader of the main Conservative Party announced to his followers he's going to start to make consultations and see if he can try to form a government. But most political analysts say his natural partner is this far-right party, and he doesn't really have a lot of other close friends in parliament, in other parties, that would come to his aid. So, right now, the numbers look like the socialist prime minister might be able to do something. The conservative leader who actually got the most votes, but far from a majority, has an even tougher time. Rosemary.",
