      "sentences": "Well, first of all, Boris, why we're here. So this guy is accused of lying to his FBI handler, telling that handler that Burisma executives over in Ukraine had told him that they only hired Hunter Biden so that his dad, Joe Biden, then vice president, could protect them from an investigation.He says he was told that Joe and Hunter Biden each got $5 million. Now, a DOJ lawyer in here today said, listen, the paper trail makes it very clear that this guy, Alexander Smirnov, just made that up. Now Smirnov appeared in court today, heavy rimmed glasses. He's got an eye condition apparently, beard, looking a little disheveled, handcuffed at the waist, very polite. Lots of \"Yes, your honor, no, your honor.\" And his lawyers were trying to argue that he should be released. They said, listen, we will hire private security so you know he worked but run, he'll wear a tag, at which point the judge said, yes, tags can be cut off. And the lawyer made a big point. He said, listen, you know, GPS tracking works. We know that because this guy was rearrested at our office. Obviously, you could track him to our office. The DOJ hit back and said, listen, the reason we arrested them at your office, not his home, as we know, he has nine firearms in that home, including an assault rifle. The judge very politely listened to all the arguments, but clearly was never going to let this guy out. He has been remanded in custody, awaiting trial. So the other point that the DOJ made that was interesting is, you know, they said, listen, this isn't like historical lies. He was lying as late as last September, claiming that the Russians were hacking a phone from a Kyiv hotel room where Hunter Biden was calling Joe Biden. Again, the DOJ saying that that is just not true. And they say this guy is a flight risk. He has known connections with foreign intelligence, including the Russians. They can resettle him anywhere. Also, he has access to money. And they claim he lied about the money. They say he has access to more than $6 million. And also, even though he gave up his passports, he could get a new Israeli passport. He's a dual citizen. His lawyer said, listen, listen, none of this. No, no, no. You need to let him out because we need his help, you know, working on his case. This is like Bernie Madoff. This is a voluminous case. Bernie Madoff was allowed out to work with his lawyers. You should let this guy out to work with his lawyers. The judge having none of it. He's still in custody -- Boris?",

Health officials there have identified another two infected kids, making eight total reported cases in Broward County so far. This is according to state data.A quick warning for you. We're going to show you images of what some patients endure when they get the measles. It's called the measles rash. Now, here's an example of what can develop from one of the most infectious diseases known. If someone with measles coughs or sneezes, the virus can just linger in the air for up to two hours. Despite this, Florida's Surgeon General Joseph Ladapo is opposing CDC guidance. He's failing to direct unvaccinated students exposed to measles to stay at home. CNN health reporter, Jacqueline Howard, is on this story. Jacqueline, tell us more about how the state surgeon general is responding to what's quickly becoming a crisis in Broward County?",

      "sentences": "Well, that's just it, Boris. What the CDC recommends when there is a measles outbreak is that unvaccinated children who've been exposed to the virus should stay home for 21 days. That's the CDC guidance.But what's happening in Florida, the state's surgeon general sent a letter to parents and guardians just last week saying, quote, \"That the DOH, the Department of Health, is deferring to parents or guardians to make decisions about school attendance.\" So they're leaving it up to parents to make that choice of whether to keep their kid at home, whether that child is vaccinated or not. But the concern here is that unvaccinated kids are at a high risk of getting infected and spreading the virus. That's why there's this concern right now -- Boris?",

We know that, among unvaccinated people, if they're exposed to the virus, 90 percent of the time, they will get infected, they will get sick.That's why getting vaccinated is so important. We know the vaccine is 97 percent effective. And we also know that among unvaccinated people, if they do get measles, one in five will end up hospitalized. We know that measles is often associated with pneumonia, encephalitis. All of these concerns you see there on the screen are complications of measles. And that's why this is concerning. And, Boris, the cases and Florida are not the only measles cases we're seeing in the country right now. We know that, so far this year, there have been at least 35 cases reported across 15 jurisdictions. And many of these cases are in pockets of communities where we do see low vaccination rates. So the takeaway here is that getting vaccinated is really important to help contain the outbreaks like this that were seeing really at this time -- Boris?",
