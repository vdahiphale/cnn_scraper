But this time, by firing 200 or so laser beams at a pellet the size of a pea, they were able to extract more energy than they put into it.Now, this means that, who knows, maybe by mid century we'll have fusion plants dotting the country side. This is step one. Step two is to scale it up, scale it up so we could energize an entire city with a fusion plant. Then step three is to commercialize it. And by mid century it could help to save us from global warming and another energy crisis. So, this is a game-changer.",

If we're looking out 20, 25 years, as to how quickly we could harness this power. That was one of the first thoughts I had, is, okay, this is great that it happened, how soon could we see it in practice? So, you talk about building those necessary, I guess, power plants, for lack of a better term.Would other things need to change? And I say that in thinking about this push for electric cars, where we're seeing you can't obviously go to the gas station, we have to build charging stations. What else would we have to ramp up? What would change?",

So, an electric car in the long-term doesn't really help you in terms of reining in carbon dioxide. But now we're talking about sea water. Hydrogen from sea water would be the basic fuel for a fusion reactor. No carbon dioxide, plus no meltdowns and no accumulation of large quantities of nuclear waste.I mean, this is the ideal source of energy, no meltdowns, no nuclear waste and energy from sea water. And so this is a game-changer. But it will take a few decades to commercialize it. So, don't expect the fusion plant to open up in your backyard any time soon. HILL:  Okay. But we're looking at it, is there enough sea water to support this? I know there is a lot of water on the planet, but I also know how fragile things are at the moment. Oh, we may have lost Dr. Kaku. But we always love having him on with us so I'm sure we'll be getting him back soon. Jim?",

He talked about insulin payments and hje talked health care premiums and the like.So many of the things that his team touts as success have been drowned out by really high inflation numbers, he hasn't been able to seize that narrative. And today with cooler than expected inflation, you could see the team trying to do that. 7.1 percent inflation, guys, that is much better than we've seen over the past few months but it's still a problematic number.

We hope that the worst of the inflation is in the rearview mirror.We also know, Jim, that there is a lot of interest rate hikes that haven't worked their way through the economy yet.

Last hour, I asked Congressman and Marine Corps Vet Seth Moulton for his reaction to that program possibly going away. Have a listen.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. SETH MOULTON (D-MA):  It is a betrayal not only of our Afghan allies but of our own troops, of our troops, like myself, who made that promise, that if you come and work for us, if you put your life on the line for America, we will have your back. They're risking lives, not just Afghan lives but American lives by this anti-immigrant, frankly, outright racist approach to this problem. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

We move them. We try to keep them safe. It is not a veteran out there that will say, yes, just leave them behind. It is not our problem. It is not how we operate and that is not how we -- SCIUTTO:  The trouble, of course, is that, I mean, even the folks who have been approved for special immigrant visas, there is an enormous backlog, some 50,000 primary approved applicants and their family members still waiting to get on a flight. And when those flights are running, they stopped for the World Cup. It is only about 250 people a week. It could take four years to get just those folks out.

I can't keep doing this. I can't put my life on hold. Every other volunteer is probably doing, putting their lives on hold. So, we're asking the government to create a program. Look at the guys that fought with us. They're not qualified for SIVs. They don't qualify. So, create a program and make them eligible. We have the vetting capabilities. If I vouch for someone, if a veteran has vouched you for someone, if a civilian has vouched you for someone, you know, go with that. Start there. And start with small amounts.
