I thought it was going to be plane, but your answer is train. Train travel surges in the late 1800s required local time to be standardized into time zones. Now the news about a new sleepover train service gaining popularity in Asia. Lots of folks are opting to travel from Beijing to Hong Kong by overnight high-speed train. The new line was launched this summer, and it`s not quite as fast as flying, but these trains do have the benefit of being able to board in one city, get a good night`s sleep, then wake up in another. CNN`s Max Burnell shows us what it`s like to take a trip and a snooze on the new sleepover service. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

It takes just 12 and a halfhours to complete the 1,200-mile trip from Beijing, cutting journey times by around half compared to previous sleeper train services. And while it`s not quite as fast as flying or daytime bullet trains, what it does offer is a night`s rest. The journey from China`s capital begins at Beijing West Railway Station. Running Friday to Monday, the sleeper is perfect for a weekend break. The train, which can travel at over 155 miles per hour, is made up of 16 carriages. Sleeper cars have cabins that accommodate up to four passengers, while those who can do without a bed can opt for regular seating. And there`s a dining car offering a range of food and drink, perfect for late night snacking. The service runs on a section of high-speed track in Hong Kong, which, when it opened in 2018, marked the first time Mainland Chinese laws were given jurisdiction in the territory. And while that caused some controversy, arriving well-rested by train is likely a welcome alternative for many to navigating China`s notorious flight delays. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

We`re talking AI robots thatcould clean your room, fold your laundry, take out the trash, even pour you a cup of coffee each morning, although it might initially come with a hefty price tag. But I want to pose a question to you. As you`ll hear our Kristie Lu Stout explain, some of these robots could be autonomous, but others might have the ability to be controlled by a person helping you do your daily chores, even from across the globe. Would you do it? If so, why? If not, what would be some of your biggest concerns? Here`s Kristie with an inside look at a company working on humanoid robotics that might one day be living and working in some of our homes. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) KRISTIE LU STOUT, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): How do you take your morning coffee, milk and sugar, maybe a latte? How about prepared by a humanoid robot? For those daily tasks no one likes to do, tech companies want to be the first to take them off your hands and into the hands of human-like droids. 1X is a leader in the home robot race. Its prototype, NEO, able to handle, as the company`s CEO puts it, the simple things. BERNT BORNICH, 1X CEO: There`s nothing simple in robotics, but the laundry, tidying, general cleaning, and everyday kind of household tasks, right? And in addition, it`s going to be a great companion. You can talk to it, have good conversations, it can teach you things, it can be entertainment. STOUT (voice-over): And it all comes back to AI. In NEO`s case, an AI brain and an engineered body, working together to make the household companion feel more humid than humanoid.",
