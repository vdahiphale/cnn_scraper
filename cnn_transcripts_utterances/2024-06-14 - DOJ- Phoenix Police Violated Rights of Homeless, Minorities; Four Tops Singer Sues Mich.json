Their targets, according to the DOJ, homeless people and minority communities.CNN's Josh Campbell is joining us now with more details on this. This is a shocking report.

DOJ coming in nearly three years ago, opening a civil rights investigation.Finally, coming out with this blistering report for the Phoenix Police Department. I'll show you some of what their findings were. They essentially claim that over this period of time, since 2016, some of the data they've been looking at, that officers have flouted federal civil rights laws and using excessive force. They claim that officers at times had delayed rendering aid to people that they had shot. They had continued to use force against people who were already incapacitated. And then they also described this whole kind of mischaracterization or misunderstanding about the whole concept of de-escalation. Apparently, according to DOJ, within the Phoenix Police Department, officers are essentially trained that escalation leads to de- escalation, which obviously, you know, runs counter to what a lot of policing experts have been calling for. Now, they've talked about additionally, as you mentioned there, Sara, violating the rights of the homeless. DOJ says this is the first instance where one of their patterns and practice investigations have actually focused on police treatment of the homeless, which could, you know, serve as a warning to departments across the country, particularly as cities try to deal with surges in the homeless population. And then finally, mass racial disparities. They talked about over- policing of minority communities, pointing out that, for example, for low-level moving violations, black motorists were cited or arrested 144% more times than white drivers. Hispanics cited 40% more in circumstances. And I know, Sara, for you, this is so important, because you and I have covered so many of these protests that have happened around the country. Often we see the police there trying to ensure the safety of attendees. In this case, DOJ claims that officers were violating the rights of peaceful protesters. In one instance, they claimed that an officer had fired a less-than- lethal weapon at a protester, hitting him in the groin. And then officers essentially celebrated that by creating memorabilia of that incident, you know, firing this non-lethal round at this man's testicle. So all this taken together, just a really scathing report. The assistant attorney general for civil rights, in announcing this report yesterday, explained why DOJ felt they needed to step in. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KRISTEN CLARKE, ASST. ATTORNEY GENERAL FOR CIVIL RIGHTS, DOJ: The police department claims it was unaware of these significant racial disparities, but longstanding and frequently voiced community concerns about discriminatory policing, as well as overt displays of bias within the police force, should have spurred the department to analyze its own data. Instead, the police department turned a blind eye to the data. This is one instance where we can't count on the police to police themselves. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

The Department of Justice is hoping that the city will willingly come to the table and try to institute reforms.If that doesn't work, that will then potentially lead to what is called a consent decree, that we've heard in various cities around the country, where a federal judge is brought in to essentially mediate. If that doesn't happen, both parties have to agree to that. If that doesn't happen, DOJ says that they will go to the courts to try to seek action to actually seek these reforms, Sara.",

They have hits like, \"I Can't Help Myself,\" \"Sugar Pipe,\" \"Honey Bunch,\" and \"Baby I Need Your Loving.\"Mr. Morris says that -- in his lawsuit, he checked in on April 7, 2023, at Ascension Macomb-Oakland Hospital. He was brought in in an ambulance, suffering from chest pains and breathing issues. He has a long history of heart issues, and while there, he told staff that he was a member of the Four Tops and had security concerns because of stalkers and fans. Mr. Morris claims that a white security guard at one point told him to sit his black behind down, although he did not use the term behind. And rather than any staff give him the benefit of the doubt or check his story, the lawsuit claims the doctor in the emergency room took him off oxygen and put him in a restraining jacket for an hour and a half while he conducted a psychological evaluation. And it wasn't until he could convince a nurse to watch a video of him singing at the Grammys that they believed his story. Now, Morris' claim says that the hospital blatantly refused to provide him with medical treatment due to his race and or perceived mental disability. Instead, he received a deliberate misdiagnosis and received a lower standard of medical care based on his race that amounted to racial discrimination and delayed his actual diagnosis. In a statement to STAT News, it's a medical journal. The hospital said it would not comment on pending litigation, but says we remain committed to honoring human dignity and acting with integrity and compassion for all persons and the community. We do not condone racial discrimination of any kind. Morris says he suffered seizures and ended up having to stay at the hospital for five days because he was too sick to leave. And after all of this, they offered him a $25 gift certificate to a local supermarket, which he declined. He's now asking a jury. It's a federal lawsuit. He's asking a jury at some point to give him at least $75,000, if not more, if they find even more.",

Lots of people talking about lots of things that you guys all discussed in the meeting with Donald Trump yesterday. On abortion specifically, we heard quite a few things I wanted to ask you about. Speaker Johnson said that Donald Trump told you all to exercise your conscience when it came to abortion policy and talking about it. And Nancy Mace said that Donald Trump told you all you need to talk about abortion, quote, \"correctly.\" She says that was his word, not hers, and pushed you all to support exceptions for rape, incest and the life of the mother. Do you support those exceptions for any abortion ban? REP. BYRON DONALDS, (R) FLORIDA: Actually, I do. And I think the way the President is talking about abortion is incredibly important. Also, what he said is that at this point with where we are in the country, this is going to be a matter for states. Every state is going to make their decision. California is going to have their law. New York is going to have their law. And many states are still going through that process. I will tell you, a lot of voters, I know they're concerned about abortion. It's obviously a very personal topic. But what happened with the Supreme Court back in 1973 was not the appropriate way to deal with such a personal and, frankly, divisive issue in our country amongst Americans and in our politics. The path we are on now, where every state is coming up with their own rubric, their own levels of restrictions, actually respects all the people within a state and allows for the body politics to fully engage on one of the most divisive and personal topics that happens in our country. So the path we're on is actually the appropriate pathway. What President Trump is talking about is basically making sure that the states, leaving it in the hands of the states, not really bringing it to the federal level because the states really are the laboratory for democracy.

It's not something, you know, frankly, as a kid growing up or even going through college, started my career even early in politics, I never thought I'd be a part of. You know, I think if you're going to ask specifically for me, you know, I'm a younger member of Congress. Obviously, I'm a black man in America. But it's not those two things aren't really the key thing. I think I resonate with voters across the board.I'm really a generation that focuses on common sense and weaves conservative principles into that common sense framework that a lot of Americans are asking for. They really, really need and they desire. And so I think it's -- I think I help expanding the political map, if you will, and really having voters, whether they're independents or Democrats, really start rethinking their politics and seeing somebody like me. And actually, some of my contemporaries on Capitol Hill right now who are younger, who have a much more common-sense view that in some respects, you could say that a lot of us were the future of politics. And so I think that's what I bring. But at the end of the day, Donald Trump is going to make that decision. I'm a support his decision no matter what he decides to do. I just want to win and have a great America. That's all I want.",

But I think that you also have this phase in our politics where people are fully supportive of Donald Trump. And then also in the background are thinking about, you know, what's going to come next, what's going to come after? So we'll see what happens. Convention is a couple of weeks away.
