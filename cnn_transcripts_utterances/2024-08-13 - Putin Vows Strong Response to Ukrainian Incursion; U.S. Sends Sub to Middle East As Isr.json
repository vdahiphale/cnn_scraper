      "sentences": "Welcome back to CNN NEWSROOM. Here are some of the top stories we're following today.Elon Musk hosted a virtual rally for Donald Trump on X Monday night. It got off to a rocky start, though, with technical glitches delaying the feed for nearly 40 minutes. During the conversation, Trump made several digs at Vice President Kamala Harris, including calling her a third-rate phony candidate. Hot, dry and windy conditions in Greece continue to fuel the wildfires, but officials say the situation near Athens is improving. More than 19 square miles have already burned, sparking evacuations in towns near Athens. The dangerously dry conditions are expected to last through the week. And street artist Banksy strikes again, this time with a rhino spray painted on a wall in Charlton, London. This, if you're keeping count, is the eighth animal-themed piece in recent days across the city. Banksy posted this rhino mural on his official Instagram account. Now, several Caribbean islands are under warnings and watches for tropical storm Ernesto. It's moving towards the Leeward Islands, with top-sustained winds around 40 miles per hour or 65 kilometers per hour, but it will likely get stronger in the days ahead. After the Leeward, Ernesto is forecasted to impact the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico later today. As of now, the storm isn't a threat to the continental U.S., and it's expected to turn to the north while over the ocean. Now Russian officials have confirmed dozens of communities in southwest Russia have fallen to Ukraine a week after its surprise incursion, and tens of thousands of Russians are being evacuated. A Ukrainian military chief says Ukraine now controls about 1,000 square kilometers in Kursk. The Russian president claims Ukraine is trying to improve its negotiating position. Vladimir Putin asked, without any apparent irony, how Russia could negotiate with people who indiscriminately strike at civilians and threaten nuclear power facilities. Ukraine's president said Russia brought this war to others, and now it's coming home. Our Clare Sebastian's been following the latest with us. I mean, this is clearly an embarrassment to President Putin. We saw that, I think, in the manner of his response. What can Putin do here? I mean, this has really exposed his flaws, but also that of the military.",

As for the whole idea of whether this is Ukraine strengthening its negotiating position, obviously, his sort of comments after that about how, you know, how can we negotiate with people who are indiscriminately targeting civilians? Obviously, that, you know, is a well-worn strategy of taking the accusations leveled against Russia and deflecting them onto Ukraine. But that is something Ukraine has talked about as well. President Zelenskyy say that this is potentially this, along with improved long- range capabilities, will be a way to force Russia into peace.",

They weren't invited to the last one.So those two things together, potentially telling. But of course, we don't know, as you say, how long they're going to be able to sustain this. Russia is bringing in reinforcements. And I think the big question for Ukraine is how successfully they will have been able to stretch out Russian forces to weaken them in other parts of the front line. Right now, the analysis is on the eastern front that the dynamic is pretty much the same. Russia still has the initiative there and still able to inch forward.",

Clare, thank you.Now, a new study finds cancer deaths among men could nearly double worldwide by the year 2050, from almost 5.5 million in 2022 to 10.5 million. And cancer cases could surge by 84 percent. And most of those increases are expected in men 65 and older. CNN's Meg Tirrell has the details. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

The largest increase in cases by 2050 is expected to be seen in mesothelioma, which is a cancer that's mainly associated with asbestos exposure. And the largest increase in cancer deaths is expected to be from prostate cancer.Now, the researchers are advocating that societies need to prepare for this by increasing their health care infrastructure and increasing access to health care. They also advocate for universal health care coverage so that people can access the care that they need. And on a personal basis, there are a few things we can all do to reduce our cancer risk. Don't smoke, limit your alcohol intake, eat healthy, get exercise and protect yourself from the sun. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Over the weekend, Hamas issued a statement urging mediators to implement the ceasefire plan put forward by U.S. President Joe Biden and the U.N. Security Council last month.Meanwhile, the U.S. is sending a guided missile submarine to the region in anticipation of possible attacks by Hezbollah and Iran on Israel.

      "sentences": "It's rare that the Pentagon talks publicly about its submarine fleet. The ballistic missile subs, the guided missile subs, the fast attack subs, they all operate and near complete secretly. So it is a big statement when Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and the Pentagon publicly announced that the USS Georgia guided missile submarine is headed to the Middle East as the U.S. prepares for an Iranian attack on Israel and perhaps a conflict that could spark a wider region in the war.This is very much in and of itself a message of deterrence to Iran and its proxies, but it's more than that. To this point, the U.S. has described its force movement in the region as, quote, defensive in nature. But guided missile submarines that are armed with land attack cruise missiles and anti-ship missiles are not defensive. They are offensive weapons with powerful ways of attacking adversaries. That's the threat the U.S. is putting on the table by publicly talking about the movements of the USS Georgia. It is a warning to Iran and its proxies that the U.S. has significant forces in the region. And should Iran decide to escalate the situation, the U.S. may well be prepared to use those forces. But it's not just the USS Georgia. Austin also ordered the USS Abraham Lincoln carrier strike group, which was in the Pacific Ocean just a couple of days ago, to speed up on its way to the Middle East. And that will add even more to the U.S. forces already there. There's the USS Theodore Roosevelt carrier strike group. There's an amphibious ready group in the Mediterranean Sea. Additional fighter squadrons, including advanced F-22 fighters, all of that already in the Middle East as the U.S. prepares to see what Iran and its proxies will do and on what scale they decide to act.

      "sentences": "And on that, when we talk about a response, we know that there is a huge push now to get all parties back to the talks for a ceasefire negotiation. There's actually a bit of a diplomatic rollercoaster going on in the lead up to those talks on Thursday. Hamas have come out and clearly quite said that they want to return to the deal that was on the table in July, that they, and we're hearing that they will be there for the talks on Thursday.It's still not clear, though, what Israel and Netanyahu want. What do you think that the parties here coming to the table are willing to revise their positions at this stage? What's your feeling on that? EL-GAMAL: Yes, that's a really important question, because obviously the progress made on the ceasefire negotiations is directly tied to the level of tension in the region. Negotiators believe, and the U.S. and other countries in the region believe, that if you are able to get a ceasefire deal signed, then that lowers the temperature a little bit when it comes to the situation between Iran and Israel and Iran and its proxies as well. So it's really, really important this week to try to make some progress on these ceasefire deals. Now we're hearing that Antony Blinken, the U.S. Secretary of State, might be going to the region this week to try to push this deal through, but like everyone else, he's waiting to see what Iran does. So it's a very tenuous situation. Now in terms of what Israel is thinking, now we have heard from Arab mediators, the Qataris and the Egyptians, that Hamas actually wants a deal. That's why they're kind of going back and forth. First, they said they didn't want to, because the deal has been changed since President Biden laid it out back in May 31st. But now they're saying they might. It looks like they want to deal. The Israeli negotiators are saying the opposite about Netanyahu, that he's stalling, that he's backtracking, and he's under too much pressure from his coalition partners in Israel.",
