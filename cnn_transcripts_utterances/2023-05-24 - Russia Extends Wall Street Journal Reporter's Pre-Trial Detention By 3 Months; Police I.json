According to Guyana's police, a female student is suspected of starting the deadly dormitory fire that killed 19 people. Police indicate that it could have been because the student's cell phone was taken away by dormitory supervisors. There were riots in Cardiff, Wales after two teenage boys died in a road accident. Police in South Wales have now obtained surveillance footage that shows a police vehicle following a bike ahead of the deadly crash. What exactly happened is still under investigation. France's ban on short domestic flights was signed into law on Tuesday. The environmental measure bars journeys possibly if less than 2 1/2 hours by train. All right. Coming up, a new court decision on a jailed Wall Street Journal reporter. And the brand-new search for Madeleine McCann underway today. (COMMERCIAL)",

      "sentences": "Well, that's exactly the reason why the court did extend this detention. It was supposed to end around May 29, now extended to August 30 because the FSB -- the intelligence agency of Russia -- put this petition to the court providing no explanation, requesting that his detention be extended.Now, the United States, just last month, was accusing Russia of playing silly games, saying they were flouting the norms of access when it comes to officials reaching this journalist in prison, saying it was difficult even to get paperwork to him. You'll remember that just last month -- last month, rather, Gershkovich put in a request to change his pretrial detention terms to allow for house arrest. That was denied as well. And as fears and concerns increase around the first arrest of an American journalist since the Cold War, U.S. officials say they are looking at all options, even creative and challenging options. That raises the possibility, of course, of a prisoner swap but experts say that Russia may potentially want these proceedings -- the court proceedings to play out before they engage in any negotiations. And, of course, there is concerns that another prisoner swap -- where there has been a couple of these before -- that another prisoner swap could lead to potentially more arrests in the future -- incentivize this type of action. The United States continues to say that this is an unlawful detention and they're doing everything they can to get this Wall Street Journal journalist out.",

He said that he had gotten a tip from quote-unquote \"underworld sources\" that the body was stashed in the reservoir.That search, though, was far from exhaustive.

Even Kevin McCarthy, himself, has said that repeatedly. But then we have the gamesmanship in terms of what people are saying. And Republicans -- it's not that they demand a certain amount of cuts. It's not that they demand the bill that they passed a few weeks ago or last month go forward and be the bill that actually raises the debt ceiling. What they demand is that their speaker use leverage. And what progressives are demanding is that the White House is not getting rolled. The White House has shown any particular wins. It looks like the conservatives are getting some wins in these negotiation deals.
