Unclear where that operation will be, but of course we've been hearing those warnings about a ground operation in Rafah for some time now, although Israel continues to come under international pressure to protect civilian lives. We know, of course, that there are some 1.5 million civilians currently sheltering in the southern city. And what we've seen just in the last few hours is civilians returning now to Khan Younis. Many of them have been unable to return for months, and what they have been returning to is complete destruction, absolutely nothing left. Take a look.

That call coming at a pivotal moment, only days after World Central Kitchen employees were killed in an Israeli attack in Gaza.Now, according to sources, President Biden placed additional pressure on Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to change his policies in his war against Hamas. That included primarily getting more humanitarian aid into Gaza by opening a land crossing, a port and also ramping up supplies. Now, according to a source, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu agreed to that, saying that there would be more done. But the president went a step further, saying that it needed to be done soon. And indeed, hours after the call, the Israeli Security Cabinet approved of the measures. The White House has so far welcomed the moves and the changes that they've seen thus far, acknowledging that there has been frustration and that more needs to be done. But what is clear is that the U.S. is steadfastly supporting Israel and its right to defend itself. Difference now is that they are more willing to change their policy if Israel doesn't change what it's doing. Of course, what that would be still remains an open question, as well as what metrics the U.S. is using to determine if Israel is making the necessary changes. Priscilla Alvarez, CNN, Washington.

The good news is, though, it looks like the storms do blow up after the eclipse. We've got a couple of showers kind of right as the eclipse is starting, that partial eclipse, and then they blow up right after that peak, probably after 3 or 4 o'clock. So you might have a 1- to 2-hour window to seek shelter if you're in a place like Dallas outside to watch the eclipse. Though it will come with cloud cover, mostly cloudy skies in Dallas, temperatures in the 70s. 1:42 is your total solar eclipse time. Then it ends at 3:00, and those storms will fire up shortly after. It's all part of the system that kind of stalls right near that path of totality, bringing you some showers from middle Tennessee and then over towards the Carolinas. We do have some clouds that will come with it from Texas into Louisiana on the southern end of the path, some clearing across the Ohio Valley, and even some clearing in New England, too. Also looks like a pretty good spot to catch the total solar eclipse. If you're looking at some places like Little Rock, where we'll have some mostly cloudy skies, a little bit close to that system, your totality is at 1:51. Places like Rochester, also finding some mostly cloudy skies with your peak at 3:20. Now, what's so cool about this, too, is we will find temperatures taking a dip while you have the peak totality of that shadow because it's cutting off the energy from the sun, so those temperatures are going to briefly come down and will pop back up once the shadow moves away from the sun and we get those temperatures to rebound, so something that we'll have to watch out for closely. So not only will you experience the total darkness in totality, you'll experience that temperature drop, the relative humidity increases as the temperatures dip closer to that dew point. The winds could decrease, too, and so could your cloud cover. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Unfortunately, a lot of them are going to be disappointed, aren't they, if we look at that weather report. But will the weather affect any sort of scientific managements you take as well?GAMMON-ROSS: Weather is always a problem. Usually here in the U.K. we find it's a massive problem as well. In terms of the science that is done around eclipses, there's not loads that is sort of currently done. Eclipses have been studied for a very long time as they're such an easy thing for everyone to be able to spot. One thing that is a really useful thing that you can study during an eclipse, though, is the outer atmosphere of the Sun. So the outer atmosphere is much fainter compared to the Sun itself, which is incredibly bright. And so it's only when the main disk of the Sun itself is blocked out that we're able to see those fainter layers. Clouds, of course, will block that and get in the way a little bit, but it shouldn't be anything too much of a problem in terms of that side.",

What is the advice?GAMMON-ROSS Yes, definitely do not look at the eclipse directly. Don't look at the Sun directly at all, ever. Do not look at it through sunglasses, only through special solar eclipse glasses. If you don't have access to those, though, it is very easy to make your own pinhole camera. All you need is two sheets of paper, put a little hole in one of them, hold it up so the rays of the Sun can pass through that hole and project it onto your second sheet of paper, and you can see it very safely through that.",

I was a little too young to fully remember it at that time, though I do have memories of going into the garden with my mum when I was very young, and we made our own little pinhole camera then. But yes, it is a very exciting thing to happen. Lots of people, as you've mentioned, go all over the world trying to chase these because it's so exciting to be in that position, to see the dynamics of the solar system playing out over your head is just such a special thing that I hope to properly experience one day myself.",

The biggest being we've sent spacecraft out to take a look at the Earth from above and look down. But there's even things like if you look out over the sea and are watching ships go by, they can appear to sort of come up over the horizon because of the Earth's curvature and lots of things like that.

If you're just joining us here are some of our top stories today.Aid is not flowing through the Erez crossing into Gaza yet after Israel says there are additional logistical preparations needed. Once a date has been set, an Israeli spokesperson says they will announce the crossing's opening. Negotiators for Israel and Hamas are still working on a potential hostage and ceasefire deal. But Egyptian officials say there's been significant progress on many points and negotiations are expected to continue for the next 48 hours. And Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says Ukraine will lose the war with Russia if the U.S. Congress doesn't approve military aid. Zelenskyy's warning comes as House Speaker Mike Johnson faces mounting pressure to decide whether to move forward with an aid bill. Joining me now from Vienna is Franz-Stefan Gady, an Associate Fellow of the International Institute for Strategic Studies. I mean, it was very clear language, wasn't it, from President Zelenskyy? But it's the sort of argument that's been made in Washington for some time for all of those who feel that Ukraine needs that money from the U.S. FRANZ-STEFAN GADY, ASSOCIATE FELLOW, INTERNATIONAL INSTITUTE FOR STRATEGIC STUDIES: Well, I think it's fair to assume that we are currently in a transitional phase when it comes to the war in Ukraine. Russia is conducting probing attacks along the front line. It is trying to advance where it can. And it is preparing what seems to be a future offensive down the road. And this is, of course, very, very worrying because Ukraine currently is also already losing territory, men. And the biggest handicap that Ukraine currently has in its war against Russia is manpower. It is, of course, related to ammunition, but it's not exclusively the lack of Western support. I do want to emphasize this here.",
