And that also seems to be part of what the president talked about yesterday with Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Zelenskyy thanking the president for that next installment of the security assistance, $275 million this time. The sort of key items in that were additional ammunition for HIMARS, those very effective multiple rocket-launching systems, and then also about 80,000 additional rounds of 155-millimeter artillery shells. So that's also something just to keep Ukraine in that fight and help them continue to win back some of their territory. One of the other things that the Ukrainians also thanked the U.S. for was humanitarian assistance but also assistance to try and get their power grid back up and running after those massive Russian strikes that have been continuing for months now. Zelenskyy telling the U.S. president that so far, about 50 percent of Ukraine's energy infrastructure has been hit. Obviously, the Ukrainians are saying that needs to constantly be repaired.

And what they show is a lot of these divisions are exaggerated. They reflect what they call perception gaps, particularly along partisan lines when it comes to the teaching of American history. Let me show you just one example. For example, a statement \"All students should learn about the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution and how it advanced freedom and equality,\" 92 percent of Democrats agree with that statement. But only 45 percent of Republicans think Democrats support that view. On the flip side, by the way, take a look at this statement: \"It's important that every American student learn about slavery, Jim Crow and segregation.\" This is the heart of the issue of so-called CRT panic.",
