On the ground, search and rescue teams are combing through the rubble of the aftermath. Also ahead, the Secret Service has just announced its findings into the investigation of July assassination attempt on Donald Trump, we'll bring you the very latest. And we've heard for more alleged victims of the former owner of Harrods, Mohamed Al-Fayed. Some have called him a monster. I spoke to the legal team representing these women, that conversation is coming up on the show. Now, the U.N. special coordinator for Lebanon says the world is witnessing an extremely dangerous cycle of violence with devastating consequences. And we begin as you can see with breaking news from Beirut this hour. Israel says it killed the leader of an elite Hezbollah unit in an airstrike today, along with some ten other commanders. The IDF bombed a crowded residential area in Beirut's southern suburbs, destroying an entire building as you can see there. Lebanon's Health Ministry says at least 12 people were killed and 66 others wounded. The Lebanese Prime Minister says the attacks were quote, \"akin to genocide\", and Iran's embassy in Lebanon is condemning what it calls Israeli madness that crossed all lines. But Israel's Defense Minister vows that attacks in this, quote, \"new phase of the war will continue until Israeli residents can return to their homes along the Lebanese border.\" I want to go to our Ben Wedeman who is in Beirut, been following all the details. So, Ben, the IDF been claiming that it's killed Hezbollah's Ibrahim Aqil, we're still I'm guessing, waiting for confirmation from Hezbollah, but if true, Ben, how much of a blow would this be for Hezbollah?",

Well,we're following a very disturbing story out of the occupied West Bank. And I do want to warn you, the next video we're about to show you is disturbing. It's really hard to watch in fact. The Israeli military says it's investigating soldiers for throwing bodies off a roof top during an incursion near Jenin. Now, CNN can't confirm whether the men were already dead, but their bodies as you can see are motionless and appear lifeless. Israel calls it a serious incident that does not coincide with IDF values. It did not identify the bodies, but says it killed seven militants during clashes in the area. Palestinian politician Mustafa Barghouti calls it a barbaric act that shows a degradation and brutality of the Israeli army. Our Jeremy Diamond is following developments and joins us now from Tel Aviv. And Jeremy, that video, it is incredibly hard to watch, just give us -- tell us a bit more of what the IDF is saying.

Three Israeli soldiers standing on the rooftop of a building in the area of the city of Jenin in the occupied West Bank, which has been the site of multiple Israeli military operations over the course of the last several weeks. And you see these soldiers take one body after the next, and either push or kick them off of that roof, three bodies in total over the course of about a minute or two in this video, very disturbing footage that the Israeli military says is an incident that they are now investigating. They say that this is a quote, \"serious incident\" that they say does not coincide with IDF values and the expectations from IDF soldiers. It would be one thing though, if this was a one-off incident, but unfortunately, we have seen numerous incidences involving Israeli soldiers in both the West Bank and Gaza over the course of the last year in which they appear to be carrying out various acts that would violate international law. We have seen videos of Israeli soldiers in Gaza, for example, vandalizing properties, burning homes -- I have spoken -- myself with Israeli soldiers who had blown the whistle and said that soldiers were burning homes without any reason. We have seen more serious incidents, of course, as well, including the shooting of civilians who were waving white flags in Gaza. The Israeli military after many of these incidents, has called them grave, has said that they will investigate them. And yet, we have only seen some investigations actually carried out by the Israeli military, but very little actual accountability thus far. And that of course, raises questions about, as we have seen, numerous human rights advocates and lawyers today, raising questions about whether this is actually a situation of bad apples, of bad behavior among a few select soldiers or whether this is something far more grave, far more systematic in the Israeli military .",

Well, Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah isvowing to continue hostilities with Israel until the war in Gaza ends. And yet, there is no end in sight. Dozens of deaths are reported today after new Israeli airstrikes across Gaza. Witnesses and hospital officials tell CNN, women and children are among the dead. Rescuers are still on the scene of airstrikes that hit a refugee camp in central Gaza earlier this week. Civil defense officials yesterday said more than 50 people are reported missing or trapped underneath crushed buildings. CNN has asked the IDF for comment. I want to bring in Matthew Levitt on all these strands. He's a Senior Fellow at the Washington Institute for Middle East Policies, the author of \"Hezbollah: The Global Footprint of Lebanon's Party of God\", and he joins us from D.C. Matthew, great to have you on the show. So, it seems as you've been seeing the breaking news in the last hour or so, the IDF is claiming another top senior Hezbollah commander has been reportedly killed. That's on top of course, of Fuad Shukr that we saw several weeks ago. How significant is this? How much of a blow is this for Hezbollah? Blow and humiliation for Hezbollah here. MATTHEW LEVITT, AUTHOR &amp; SENIOR FELLOW, WASHINGTON INSTITUTE FOR MIDDLE EAST POLICIES:  Leave the humiliation aside, which is significant, but this is one body blow after another. Today, reportedly, Ibrahim Aqil has been killed. Ibrahim Aqil was the successor to Fuad Shukr. Fuad Shukr, Ibrahim Aqil and one remaining person, Ali Quraki(ph) were the three main people leading Hezbollah's Jihad Council, its highest military command. Two of those three are now dead, and in today's attack, reportedly, the Israelis also killed up to 20 commanders of Hezbollah's Radwan Special Forces. So, their communication systems are shut, trust in the system is shut and leadership in their gear, the Israelis have carried out preemptive strikes against their launchers in the past few weeks when they've been   plotting to launch rockets at Israel, they did a special forces raid about a week ago into Syria to target Iran's ability to provide missiles to Hezbollah. At every level here Hezbollah is reeling, and its ability to carry out coordinated and long-term fight in a real war is severely diminished today compared to what it was just a few days ago.",

And so, what the Israelis are doing is taking out Hezbollah's ability to continue fighting as they have, the Israelis want the now-almost one year, almost daily, Hezbollah rockets into northern Israel to end. The diplomatic effort to do that would have been preferable, but wasn't going anywhere. And so, now, with their war against Hamas, as they put it nearly over, they've been focusing on the northern front to enable their 60,000 or so plus displaced civilians to be able to go back to their homes.",

I think neither Prime Minister Netanyahu and Israel nor Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar really wanted to cross that last threshold with the latest problem being Sinwar demanding more senior and larger number of Hamas people being released in the first round, likely anticipating that there wouldn't be a second round. I feared that the diplomatic track on the south and the diplomatic track on the north are stalled. Hassan Nasrallah; the head of Hezbollah has said for a long time now, including just yesterday that he would continue firing in Israel until there is a ceasefire in the south. So, from Israel's perspective, it appears they've decided to do things to prevent Hezbollah from being able to continue to carry out these strikes, and to make it more difficult for it to escalate or do things even in the intermediate that might draw bigger Israeli response that Hezbollah wouldn't be prepared to deal with.

Speaking to also a lack of how the personnel for the Secret Service, the people who are providing protection, not just to Donald Trump, but to the sitting President of the United States as well as Vice President Kamala Harris, that they're stretched very thin right now, and that, you know, the lack of an incident in previous years and months has led to this complacency. So, I think that's a very notable top line, but in terms of specific breakdowns, he did go through several that were identified over the course of this investigation, both in the days leading up to the Butler rally on July 13th and on the day of -- and I think one of the notable ones has to do with the venue. He said that the Trump campaign did choose the venue, the Butler Farm venue, and the Secret Service raised concerns about it. They said they saw it as a challenge, and they also specifically on the day of the rally raised concerns about the rooftop where that shooter was ultimately perched when he fired eight rounds on Donald Trump. Acting Director Rowe said the Secret Service raised concerns about the line of sight, the fact that somebody could have a direct and clear line of sight at Donald Trump from that rooftop. But yet, that concern was never elevated to supervisors and ultimately never communicated as a concern more broadly to tell the local law enforcement that were on the scene that day. And also the communication breakdowns that occurred between local and Secret Service in those minutes leading up to the shots. That's a really important moment that happened. The warning about a person on the roof minutes before shots were fired was never communicated to Secret Service, and ultimately, Secret Service was on the phone trying to figure out what was going on when those shots rang out. So, really a troubling finding of this investigation.",

So, this is the state election board in Georgia. There are five members, three of the members who are a majority are Trump loyalists, Trump allies who pushed this through in a vote several hours ago. The other two members, one of them is an independent who was appointed by their Republican governor and a Democrat, they were unified in opposition, but of course 3 to 2, it passed. So, the proposal here was passed over the objections of the Republican Attorney General of Georgia, the Republican Secretary of State of Georgia and bipartisan and non-partisan election officials throughout the state that said it's going to really cause problems, it's going to create a massive burden for the local officials who have the task of counting the ballots. This new rule, if it's not blocked by a judge, and if it does go into effect for this election, would require every county in the state to do a hand count of the number of ballots that were cast on election day to make sure that, that number of paper ballots matches up the number of ballots that the machines tell them were cast in that polling place as well. So, they tried to reconcile the numbers. In theory, it's not a terrible idea, Isa, but the officials that warn against it said number one, it's just so close to the election, you really shouldn't be messing with the rules and procedures so close to the start of voting. And number two, it's going to slow things down. Some of these counties have hundreds of thousands of voters, imagine sitting in a room once the polls close in the evening and trying to tally up hundreds of thousands of votes, it does not set up a situation for success. And that was the warning from the chairman of that board, who is an independent. He voted against it and he was pleading with his colleagues to stand down. Listen to what he had to say.

And of course, it didn't help when one went to the police and they didn't do anything about it, and said there wasn't sufficient evidence or whatever excuse they gave. Women victims are often in fear that no one will believe them. That if they go to the police, that it won't be prosecuted. mated But let's talk about Harrods because Harrods got new owners, it was bought off the -- I think from 2010, right? That they bought Harrods from Mohamed Al-Fayed. Now, they have apologized. We've seen their statement, apologize for failing women. And I want to read part of what they said. You have seen this as well. \"We are utterly appalled by the allegations of abuse perpetrated by Mohamed Al-Fayed. We also acknowledge that during this time as a business we failed our employees who were his victims and for this we are sincerely apologize.\" They all go on to say, \"Since new information came to light in 2023 about historic allegations of sexual abuse by Al-Fayed, it has been our priority to settle claims in the quickest way possible, avoiding lengthy legal proceedings for the women involved.
