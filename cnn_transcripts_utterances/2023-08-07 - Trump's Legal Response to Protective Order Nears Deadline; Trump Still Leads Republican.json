Hear what one of his lawyers tells CNN about it.Meanwhile, a deadline for coup leaders in Niger comes and goes leaving questions about what the country's neighbors might do next. And a desperate situation in New York City. A steady stream of migrants amid record breaking temperatures leaves the city asking for help. Thanks for joining us. Well, the clock is ticking for Donald Trump's lawyers to respond to a legal filing in the case over his alleged efforts to overturn the 2020 U.S. presidential election. Special Counsel Jack Smith has requested limitations on evidence provided to Trump's team. Specifically, they are asking the former president not to receive his own copies of sensitive material fearing he could use it to threaten witnesses. And the deadline to respond is just hours away. Smith filed the request in response to Trump's posts on social media, including this one which says, quote, \"If you go after me, I'm coming after you.\" One of Trump's attorneys tells CNN he will fight the protective order. He also says the former president did not tell former Vice President Mike Pence to throw out key electoral votes. Trump simply asked. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And we have seen time after time, the vast majority of Republican elected officials, virtually all of them in the current case, refusing to draw any lines.And Trump has quite understandably taken from that the lesson that he has essentially broken the party to his will, and there is no point he can go to, at which a critical mass of Republicans will coalesce against him and try the admittedly difficult task of convincing their voters that this is unacceptable. But when you add all of this up, you see the challenge it creates for American democracy because we are now in a situation where the vast majority of Republican elected officials and voters are basically saying they do not believe his conduct after the 2020 election or on January 6th is disqualifying for him to be president again, and the legal system may have very different judgments about what he did in that period.",

This is all part of a broader effort by the White House to sell the president's accomplishments and take credit for those accomplishments, including the Inflation Reduction Act, which you'll remember included $370 billion meant to combat climate change.Now, the president will visit Arizona first, and sources tell us that he is considering designating a new national monument around the Grand Canyon. This is something that native tribes have been lobbying for for years, and it would prevent new drilling in the area. So, the president really trying to bolster his climate agenda ahead of the 2024 election. Of course, this is a critical issue for key members of the democratic coalition, progressives, young voters, people who haven't necessarily been satisfied with the president in this area so far when it comes to drilling for fossil fuels, when it comes to cutting carbon emissions, the president really hoping to show voters that he is serious about combating climate change. Now, this is all part of a bigger effort by the Biden administration to take more credit for their economic agenda in the month of August. And you'll see the president, the vice president, members of the cabinet all out talking about their economic record. And they do believe that they have a good story to tell. Inflation is easing, consumer sentiment is ticking up, and certainly hiring remains strong. But there does remain this disconnect with voters. In a poll last week by CNN, 75 percent said that they viewed economic conditions as poor and that is translating into political headwinds for President Biden when it comes to his approval rating. So certainly, the challenge for President Biden as he gears up for re-election is to close that gap and remind voters of all that he has accomplished when it comes to the economy.

Firstly, Nigeria's president, Bola Tinubu, is the head of -- the current head of ECOWAS, which is the regional bloc of heads of state, who decided to take military intervention against Niger.But President Tinubu is hampered legally. His Senate has not approved the decision to take military action in Niger and they've asked him to go back to the table for a more diplomatic option. And also, Nigeria is bordered several states in the north with Niger. Very close links historically, ethnically. Many people in the north, parts of northern Nigeria considered Nigerians to be brothers. So, there is a very strong element pushing from Niger, the governor's forum, which is very powerful, telling the president, they actually met last night, on Sunday night, telling the president, we cannot allow this war. We need to find a peaceful solution. So, President Tinubu is caught between a rock and a hard place.

The U.S. team are heading home after a dramatic loss to Sweden. And in the end, the difference here was about as thick as this piece of paper.These two sides have often met on the world stage. Sweden usually come out on top, but the USA gave it everything. They just peppered the Swedish goal with 11 shots on target, but they couldn't find a way past their goalie, Zecira Musovic, who saved every single one of those shots. She was brilliant and deservedly won the Player of the Match award. So, after 90 minutes and extra time, it was goalless. And that's when the drama really began. The first five penalties were all scored. Sweden's Nathalie Bjorn was the first to miss. The American legend, Megan Rapinoe had the chance to give her team a commanding lead, but she blazed her kick over the bar. Normally, so composed and reliable, she could only laugh at the agony. But now everyone's nerves were jangling. Rebecka Blomqvist stepped up, only to be denied by a brilliant save from the U.S. Goalie Alyssa Naeher. And that meant Sophia Smith had a chance to win it for the Americans, but she missed as well. The pressure was now almost intolerable. The U.S. team was hoping to win a third consecutive World Cup, but Kelly O'Hara's shot against the post was their third miss out of four kicks. And it was Lena Hurtig who won it for the Swedes in the end. But they had to wait to celebrate. It seemed as though, Naeher had saved her kick, but the goal line technology revealed that it had crossed the line, but only just. It really couldn't have been any closer, could it? Everybody held their breath until the ref got word, the kick was good, the ball was over, the game was over, and for everyone involved, the emotions were just overwhelming. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
