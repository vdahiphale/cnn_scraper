I have been told by senior officials in some of the non-Israeli or non-U.S. mediating teams, meaning the Arab governments that are involved in mediations, that they have conveyed to Hamas that politics are changing in the United States. And to the extent that they think they've gotten a softer ride, Hamas, with the Biden administration, they need to be prepared for the possibility that A, the administration is -- their attention is going to shift. They're going to be distracted because of the circus-like political cycle we're in right now, including the one over the last ten days or so. And the possibility that Donald Trump will succeed President Biden and Kamala Harris. And that if Trump succeeds Biden-Harris, Hamas is in a whole new world.
