      "sentences": "Welcome to our viewers in the United States and watching around the world. I'm Jake Tapper.The race for the White House takes a big step forward in just moments. Nikki Haley will formally kick off her presidential campaign in Charleston. The former South Carolina governor and former United Nations ambassador will become the first major Republican candidate to challenge Donald Trump for the 2024 Republican nomination. The announcement comes exactly three months after her former boss launched his own campaign. Haley did not mention Trump by name in her launch video yesterday. But she is calling for a, quote, \"new generation of leadership\" and she pointed out the Republicans have lost, lost in the popular vote in seven of the last eight presidential elections. That includes Donald Trump losing the popular vote twice. Today's announcement gives Haley a head start over what promises to be a crowded Republican field with big names such as Florida governor Ron DeSantis and former vice president Mike Pence, also expect to join the race. Let's begin our coverage now with Kylie Atwood. She's live in Charleston for us, where Haley will soon take the stage. Kylie, what are we expected to hear from Haley as a message of her campaign?",

      "sentences": "I think Nikki Haley views this as a speech to introduce herself to the American people for the first time as a presidential candidate.She's going to focus on her biography, the fact she grew up as an immigrant child. Her parents emigrated to the United States from India. She grew up in a situation where she did face challenges because she wasn't Black; she wasn't white, she was different, in her words, in a video put out yesterday. She'll also talk about her time leading this state of South Carolina as the first female governor, two-time governor in this state, what she did to bring people together after that awful shooting at Mother Emmanuel AME Church that happened in 2014 while she was governor. That's just blocks from here. Then she will also likely talk about her time as ambassador to the United Nations and I'm told that, in the context of having worked with Trump in the Trump administration, she will raise the former president. But what she's not expected to do is really take him on or criticize him in this speech. That is in line with what we've seen from her in recent comments, where she's talked about the need for a new generation of the Republican Party. Essentially saying it's time to move on from Trump without mentioning Trump by name and saying that she's the one who is best positioned to be that new leader but trying not to alienate, you know, Trump supporters here. We're seeing that from some other folks who are potentially hopping into this race as well. One thing I want to note, Jake, is I spoke with someone who will be on stage introducing Nikki Haley today, Cindy Warmbier. She's the mother of Otto Warmbier, who was an American detained in North Korea. He died just days after he was released. Cindy Warmbier has developed a close personal relationship with Nikki Haley. And she says that Nikki Haley is the one who gave her strength to stand up to the North Korean regime after that awful death of her son -- Jake.",

      "sentences": "So she opens really with either a decent favorable rating -- almost half of Republicans view her favorably. And the rest are more open minded. Only 11 percent unfavorable.So she has a blank slate almost, a good slate to fill in if she can get momentum in the campaign. Still the biggest challenge, Monmouth asked, what about Trump versus Ron DeSantis? That's the mindset of many Republicans right now, that this is a two- man race. Haley has to change that. Anyone else getting in has to change that. DeSantis actually beats Trump in this hypothetical one on one -- emphasis on hypothetical -- a long way until anybody votes. But again, here's an opening whether it's Haley or Mike Pompeo or somebody else to get into the race, half of Republicans, 49 percent, in this recent -- this is a \"Washington Post\"/ABC poll -- say they want somebody else. We don't want Donald Trump again. And that's today. Think of all the legal, other political issues around Donald Trump right now and even now, half of Republicans say let's look for somebody else. Let me flip that coin. This is Trump's advantage in a crowded field; 44 percent say nominate Trump. If Donald Trump can stay in the high 20s or low 30s or get close to that, there are six or eight other candidates, winner take all rules in the Republican primaries, that's the challenge. Trump is weakened but not weak. I want to show you this number. People say what do you care about what Democrats think of Joe Biden on this day? But nearly six in 10 Democrats want somebody other than Joe Biden right now. Why do I point that out? Democrats want someone other than Biden. A lot of Republicans want somebody other than Trump. If there's an opening for somebody like Haley, Jake, as she gets in from a low positive, it does seem across the American electorate, all voters are at least open to the idea of somebody new, somebody fresh. The question is, can she start today from a very low position and make that progress? That's the challenge.",

And look, I think Nikki Haley is aware that she is, as John put it, starting from the back of the pack in this marathon. And the idea here is to get some of this pure coverage that is just solely focused on her, her biography, her story, which they think is one of her biggest strong suits. And that may be enough to help her with the fundraising, which might be the next biggest hurdle that she has. She has to have money to run this thing.

This is where DeSantis has got an huge advantage, starting with COVID and up through these other issues he's been dealing with in Florida, whether it's Disney, the college board, you name it. He actually can say, I have been listening to people complaining but I'm the one doing something about it. Haley's video that she launched, which was a nice video, it's her sort of reciting what everyone is worried about. So I want to hear how she's going to try to make that connection with Republicans.

DAVID CHALIAN, CNN HOSTof looking at Nikki Haley on the stage tonight and what she represents, a woman, a woman of color, the daughter of immigrants, the whole story, the executive of the state, what she's going to try to portray is lean into all of that in an attempt to widen and broaden the Republican brand appeal nationally. I always look for something, Jake, on announcement day, which is, when you watch the speech, think, is this candidate going to give the same speech at the convention, on the eve of the general election? Because we have found that the most successful presidential candidates are ones that can run on a consistent message, from their first day all the way through the tape at the end of the election. So watch how she navigates the red meat part, where she has to throw some stuff out there for the base and keep them enthused and engaged, but also in really reaching out, thinking about the general election audience this far in advance, even though the primary comes first.

Here, one of Trump's attorneys -- we know three attorneys of his has that have gone before the grand jury -- Adam Corcoran, he went before the grand jury and he invoked executive privilege several times when he was asked about the events leading up to that search of Mar-a-Lago. Of course it is absolutely his right to insert (sic) that privilege into any potential testimony, as any good attorney would be expected to do. But now prosecutors are asking the court to invoke one of the few exceptions to attorney-client privilege by raising the idea that Corcoran was used -- or his advice was used -- in furtherance of a crime by the former president.
