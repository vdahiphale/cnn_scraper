But as anyone going through chemotherapy will know there are good days and there are bad days. On those bad days, you feel weak, tired and have to give into your body resting. But on the good days, when you feel stronger, you want to make the most of feeling well. And my treatment is ongoing. And will be going on for a few months as well. So, she's undergoing chemotherapy, her treatment continues. So, it's going on longer than many people expected. But at the same time, we just didn't know when she was going to appear. So, they're taking each day as it comes. If she's not well enough tomorrow, she won't appear. We shouldn't read too much into that, I'm told. She's just going on the advice of the doctors.

She'll come out of the palace, a huge amount of media already gathering for this event now. She will go up The Mall in front of all the crowds. And we are expecting a much bigger crowds now as a result, their first chance to see the princess in such a long time. And then she will watch the parade from a balcony with her family. She'll come back down The Mall. And then she'll go into the palace. And then she will appear with the wider family up there on the balcony, which is a scene that I know you know pretty well. Everyone will be pouring over how well she looks, hopefully. And the palace is really keen that we shouldn't speculate too much about how well she looks or exactly what type of cancer this is. She wants to keep that private, she feels she has a right to keep that private. And she said don't expect to see that much of her but she is going to try to come out over the summer.

We thought, oh, we'll toss it back down to the states. Well, this is now what you need to hash out.

So, I'm going to play two quick videos here. This is Zack Nelson of the Jerry Rig Everything YouTube channel. He's a self-described gun enthusiast who, you know, this is something he's done with his family for years, he's using an AR-15 that he says he purchased the day before this video was shot without a bump stock, here it is. And here is the part of the video where he is using the AR-15 with the bump stock and for the first time that he's ever used it. He was very surprised in the video by how many bullets he could shoot, how many rounds would go off there. It's an undeniable difference. I mean, what do you save that sentence from Justice Thomas?",

Same concept, but this time, 30,000 feet in the air, so you can imagine how frightening that would be. But it's essentially the tail of the plane is wobbling back and forth, the wings moving up and down as the front of the plane, the nose of the plane is making this little figure out -- a figure eight, I should say. And this was happening on this flight to Oakland from Phoenix last month. Fortunately, the pilots of the Southwest flight were able to get it under control, no injuries on board, and they were able to land safely in Oakland. But once they got there, they figured out that there was damage to a power system onboard, a power system that is used to control the rudder. We don't know, did the Dutch roll caused the power system issue? Did the power system issue caused the Dutch roll? That's something that's under investigation right now. But this is a 737 Max 8 we're talking about and it really thrust that Boeing plane right back into the spotlight because back in February, the FAA told all airlines they need to inspect the rudders of these aircraft, looking for missing nuts and bolts because they feared that that rudder assembly issue could make it harder for pilots to control the rudder with their pedals. We don't know if that's what happened here. The NTSB is now investigating. They say they've downloaded the flight data from that plane. So, hopefully, we'll know more in the coming weeks but lot of quality control issues for Boeing.",
