They say there is no threat to public safety.And importantly, they also say that there is no known nexus at this time to any foreign government or foreign entity. That is very notable. Let's see if we had the sound from Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas to our own Wolf Blitzer last night. OK, we don't have that sound, but Mayorkas said we have not seen anything unusual. We know of no threat or nefarious activity. He also says that the Department of Homeland Security has sent its own state of the art technology to New Jersey and the tri-State area that has not confirmed any drone sightings. But still so many questions about where these drones come from, who is responsible? And as one lawmaker said in the year 2024, with the technology we have, how is it possible that we don't the answers to those questions? We've also heard from lawmakers on both sides of the aisle that have raised a lot of concerns like that New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy letter to President Biden. He says in part that it is apparent more resources are needed to understand what is going on. And he expresses a lot of concern about in the vacuum of information and details, the conspiracy theories that are cropping up on social media. We've also heard now from President-Elect Donald Trump, who we should note has started receiving those national security briefings as of last month. And Trump said in a social media post overnight, can this really be happening without our government's knowledge? I don't think so. Let the public know and now otherwise shoot them down. Now, I should note that Mayorkas told CNN that the U.S. government has been asking the Congress to give them more authority to counter drone activity.

And we have had no new counter UAS related laws passed since 2018 and the DOJ and DHS's original authorities, which provided them legislative relief from a lot of different federal laws that would generally prohibit the use of some of these technologies.

He has promised to pardon January 6th rioters and told \"Time Magazine\" he would look at their cases individually.  BLACKWELLtheir approach to those pardons. CNN's Katelyn Polantz breaks down who could get a pass from the incoming President. KATELYN POLANTZ, CNN CRIME &amp; JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT:  Victor and Amara, Donald Trump keeps promising that he's going to be pardoning these January 6th rioters in the first few minutes that he takes office in January. But whenever you dig into this, our sources are telling us that the Trump transition, the people who are incoming into the Trump administration, they just haven't figured out how this will work. It is possible that Donald Trump issued some sort of blanket pardon for January 6th rioters, but there are lots of questions that people have about this, defense attorneys, the rioters themselves, even people around the transition, they don't know what the plan is yet. Will there be specific ways Capitol rioters are applying to Trump and his team to get one of these pardons or commutations? And the other question is, does this mean everybody is going to be pardoned? Or if Trump says he only wants to pardon non-violent offenders, which is one of the things he said in a recent interview with \"Time Magazine\". Does that mean non-violent offenders who are not charged with certain things and other things, or does that mean there is a group of rioters that is charged with serious crimes, even potentially seditious conspiracy, like the leaders of the Oath Keepers and the Proud Boys, who would be pardoned, while others who are convicted of, say, assaults on police, those people would not. So, a lot of questions to see how the January 6th pardon promise from Donald Trump plays out once he takes office here. There are still people that are anticipating this and relatively unhappy with it too. Judges on the D.C. district court, even a Reagan appointee, a Trump appointee himself who are speaking from the bench to Capitol riot defendants, reminding people how violent this Capitol riot was, that the people there were committing federal crimes have been convicted, hundreds of them. And one Judge, Carl Nichols says \"blanket pardons for all January 6th defendants or anything close would be beyond frustrating and disappointing. But that's not my call.\" That's what the judge said. Back to you.",

Now, the House will be in Republican hands, I suspect that they will listen to Donald Trump if he tells them to eliminate Daylight Saving. And so, I think this is one of the things that could actually happen. It does seem like there's will on the Senate side at least, and perhaps on the House to change this.

CNN's Brynn Gingras has more.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BRYNN GINGRAS, CNN CORRESPONDENT (on camera):  Yes, Amara and Victor, we are learning that it's possible the earliest we could see Mangione come back to New York is next week. And we're learning this from the Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg. He told the public that he is hearing it's possible he might consider waiving his extradition. Of course, that would speed up this entire process. Bragg saying that then the earliest -- his understanding is that Mangione could get in front of a Pennsylvania judge would be on Tuesday. So, we'll keep an eye out for that. In the meantime, Bragg says that he's continuing the process on his end, which, of course, is securing an indictment. And we have reported that he has started presenting evidence to a grand jury. In regards to this, San Francisco PD tip that was eventually sent to the NYPD, we have learned, according to the FBI, that, that did happen. They did receive a tip from the San Francisco Police Department about four days before Mangione was actually arrested. The \"San Francisco Chronicle\" reporting that it was actually a Special Victims unit police officer who was assigned to the missing person's case. If you remember, Mangione's mother filed a missing person's report on November 18th, that officer actually recognized that infamous photo of the suspect bringing his mask down and showing his entire face and said, hey, I actually know that person and sent that name along. And our understanding is the FBI here in New York forwarded that to the NYPD. Now, it's unclear where that landed on the NYPD's desk. We know that they were investigating hundreds of tips. I know from sources alone that there was a number of names that they were running down, trying to see if it was their main suspect. But it does appear that they did have that name in their possession, maybe four days prior to Mangione actually being arrested. Brynn Gingras, CNN, New York. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
