This was the first time that President Biden did so publicly. Let's watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN, U.S. PRESIDENT: The American principle that no one is above the law was reaffirmed. And it's reckless. It's dangerous. It's irresponsible for anyone to say this was rigged just because they don't like the verdict. Our justice system has endured for nearly 250 years. And it literally is the cornerstone of America. Our justice system. The justice system should be respected. And we should never allow anyone to tear it down. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Take a listen to what he said.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, (R) FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT, 2024 REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE: Now, I would have testified. I wanted to testify. The theory is you never testify because as soon as you test for anybody, if it were George Washington, don't testify because he'll get you on something that you said slightly wrong. And then they sue you for perjury. But I didn't care about that. I wanted to. But the judge allowed them to go into everything that I was ever involved in, not this case, everything that I was ever involved in, which is a first. In other words, you could go into every single thing that I ever did. Was he a bad boy here? Was he a bad boy there? And my lawyer said, what do you need to go through? And all you wanted to do is testify simply on this case because I would have loved to have testified to this day. I would have liked to have testified. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

He was talking at one point about Allen Weisselberg being in jail, talking about different cars and how why do you have to claim them on your tax reports? There was a lot of in and out in this speech. But one thing is clear. Donald Trump is going to capitalize off of this verdict as much as he possibly can. Will it help him in the end politically? That is something that only voters will be able to decide. But right now, his team believes. That he should continue to message this. They should continue to fundraise off of this and that that could help them get some Republican voters who feel like they were sitting on the fence before to support Donald Trump. I will note that Donald Trump's team says that they raised $34.8 million in small dollar donations since that verdict came out.

And so it took a shift as this case went to trial. And they did a good job meeting the technical legal requirements of the offense presented to the jury in a way, obviously, that they could understand. But at the beginning, as a prosecutor, this appeared to me as a campaign finance violation. It seemed to be a stretch.

So these are Google searches for Donald Trump. Look at this. At the time of conviction, up 3,233% versus the hour before the conviction took place yesterday. You do not need to be a mathematical wizard to know that this number is extremely high. And, you know, throughout this trial, we really have not seen the interest from the American public in this trial. It's been sort of low on the list of most important issues.

But those dollars are coming from people who obviously were Trump voters to begin with. I think Harry was right to be cautious about making any predictions about how this would go. I think it's very hard in advance to weigh what a verdict like this will actually do in in in the real world when it has happened. But there is one thing that I think is true. And we saw it play out this morning. I did a podcast earlier in this week, my Hacks on Tap podcast. And Chris Christie was on the podcast who knows Trump very well. And Christie said, we're focusing too much on how the verdict will be received by voters. And we should focus more on how the verdict will be received by Trump.Because he is likely to become a lot angrier, a lot more paranoid, a lot more apocalyptic as because the two things that he fears the most in life are bankruptcy and prison. And I think you saw an unhinged Donald Trump this morning who made the, you know, his remarks, he would have little interventions where he talked about the country, but mostly he talked about himself. This is an opportunity for Joe Biden. Trump becomes more and more consumed with his own grievances and his own situation. Biden has an opportunity to go out there and talk about the problems and concerns of people, what he's doing, what Trump would do, what the future would look like.

I mean, his point should be, well, he's consumed by himself and is fighting for himself. I'm fighting for you.[14:25:09] And let me tell you how- and let me tell you what your future, what the future will look like with Trump and with me when it comes to the cost of your health care, the cost of your pharmaceuticals, abortion rights. There are really distinct differences between these two guys. Biden needs to prosecute that case politically in order to leverage up in this race. And I think Trump's, you know, sort of unhinged focus on his own situation gives him that opportunity. The contrast would work for Biden. But what he has to not do is do what he's done too much of, I think, which is to look for credit for the things he's done. This is not an electorate that is in a in a credit giving mood. The country's in a sour mood and history will give Joe Biden credit for a lot of the things that he's done, he needs to set this into a comparative frame. You know, he's fought to make health care more accessible through the Affordable Care Act. Trump would destroy the Affordable Care Act. He's fought to bring down the cost of pharmaceuticals. Trump did nothing about that and would bow to the pharmaceutical company. You know, I think there are a series of contracts that go to the lives that people are leading and their own problems that in which Biden can engage. And of course, his superpower is his empathy.
