And we continue to follow major new developments involving former President Donald J. Trump. Trump now saying he expects to be arrested on Tuesday and is calling for protests. He made the announcement today in a social media post lashing out at the Manhattan District Attorney's office which has invited him to testify before a grand jury.The arrest would be part of their investigation into alleged hush money payments to Stormy Daniels during the 2016 election. And in the post, Trump called for protests over his pending arrest to \"take our nation back.\" This development comes as sources tell CNN that law enforcement agencies in New York are also now preparing for the possible indictment of Trump. CNN's Polo Sandoval is outside the Manhattan criminal courthouse for us. And CNN Senior Crime and Justice Reporter Katelyn Polantz is in Washington. Caitlin, to you first. What do we know about the possible arrest at the former president has been posting on social media about?",

But his team in a statement following that Truth Social post of his says that they have not been notified by the Manhattan District Attorney's Office, that there would be an indictment on the arrest of Donald Trump that he would need to be turning himself in.What we know right now about this grand jury investigation is that it continues, it has been ongoing for months. But Fredricka that it is nearing the end. The reason we know that is because Donald Trump as the target of this investigation was invited to testify in front of the grand jury sitting in Manhattan that has been looking at possible financial crimes, especially rated -- related to those hush money. That hush money payments that his lawyer made to Stormy Daniels during the 2016 campaign. Trump decided he wasn't going to testify to that grand jury. And we have learned this morning. There is another witness that is expected to testify on Monday. So, they're nearing the end. But the grand juries work is not done here. And the answer of when an indictment could come and what the charges exactly would be when the grand jury is asked to potentially approve the unprecedented indictment of the former president of the United States. We just don't have the answer to that right now. Fredricka?",
