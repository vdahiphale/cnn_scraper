Let's start with M.J. Lee in the convention hall. So, Vice President Harris's speech is behind her. What is next as this campaign moves forward? M.J. LEE, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Yes, Anderson, the past four days have been a jubilant celebration here in Chicago, culminating with the vice president officially accepting her party's nomination for the presidency. But Anderson, despite all of this around us -- the confetti, and the balloons, and all of the parties that are going to take place later tonight -- we do know, based on people who have spoken to the vice president in recent days, that she actually remains clear-eyed about what could come next. I'm told by one person who spoke with the vice president in recent days that they've actually not heard the vice president using the word \"honeymoon,\" but that that's really the idea: that the period between President Biden dropping out and tonight has resembled a honeymoon, and that there is recognition by the vice president herself and others on down in the campaign, that the level of enthusiasm and the excitement that we have seen, the momentum that we have seen, that all of those things could wane for reasons that are, or are not, under the vice president's control. But Anderson, for at least right now, at least for tonight, the partying and the celebration is going to continue. And that includes the vice president, who is currently headed to, we are told, the Queenie's Supper Club here inside the United Center, where she is going to be greeted by excited supporters. And also keep in mind that this is going to be a night of celebration, hopefully, for the vice president and second gentleman, Doug Emhoff. They are celebrating their 10th wedding anniversary tonight -- Anderson.",

And I think this is her great challenge, is how do you change when you're already in there?And one thing I did not hear in her speech tonight was really an ounce of humility about any of the failures of the current administration. I mean, the polling is pretty clear. They're down on a lot of the big issues that people really care about. I'm wondering what you think about that. In order to get away from Biden, would it be better to show a little humility and say, Hey, we tried some things. I cast some votes. I've learned from my mistakes? Or is it better to ignore it and hope people forget about it? What's your opinion?",

Does she deal with that now on this stage with this first big moment with the American people? She chose not to. She will have to deal with it when Donald Trump is standing next to her on the debate stage and Donald Trump is saying you're a part of Biden this. You're part of Biden that. You are part of Biden this. You're right. This is the president's job approval rating. If he were the incumbent, 56 disapproval is a horrible number to win reelection. He's not anymore, but she is his vice president. So, you're right that that will be an issue. The Republicans are going to try to give her, quote unquote, \"Biden baggage.\" And she's going to have to have answers for it if she wants to win the election. But her argument, clearly, they decided we're not going to deal with that tonight, but that will come up at the debate.",

I don't say this to be critical of Vice President Harris. The Democrats had a usually successful convention. But this is why inside her campaign they're saying ride this momentum but be careful about it. She will have momentum coming out of this. There's no doubt about that. How much, in these polarized times? We don't know. But this was my first campaign, 1988. Michael Dukakis only won 10 states. He left his convention 17 points up in the national polls. Seventeen points up, and then he lost 40 states. Seventy-five days is a lot of time.",

I mean, she exuded the confidence that the American people, and frankly, the world needed to see to know that, yes, she is woman, but yes, hear her roar. And roar she did. She made it clear that she also has a vision, a vision that is one where the middle class will absolutely be able to realize the American dream. And I thought that she also just wove in her story so well to basically say, I am the American dream standing in front of you.

She talked about not just America in isolation. But she talked about it in terms of how we can lead on the globe, how we know that there are conflicts going around all over the world. She didn't shy from them. She took them head on. The tough ones like Israel and Gaza that are tenuous in our coalition right now. And that's what leaders do. And then, she drew the contrast, and she was like, this is who Donald Trump is, and this is who I am. And she did it through her story of self, which we learn as organizers.

And I think that this is part of the biography piece that fits in with the policy piece that works for Democrats in this election. She also, I noted, in the speech tonight, she was very clear. She -- she called Trump out for his -- you know, the case with E. Jean Carroll where he was found liable for rape. She was very forceful in the description of Trump's convictions and liability on those fronts. So, I think all of those things are very much connected, where what she's trying to say is that, you know, Trump himself has both -- you know, the Project 2025 stuff, what she was saying there, I think, was very linked to Project 2025. So, you can say about that what you will.

But also ruled there is no immunity for unofficial acts.
