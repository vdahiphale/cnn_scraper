This is \"CNN Newsroom.\"Two days before New Hampshire's primary, Donald Trump and Nikki Haley are duking it out, while Ron DeSantis shifts focus to the next state in the race for the White House. Plus, Iran vows revenge after a deadly strike in Syria's capital, Damascus. We'll have a live report from the region. And, parts of the U.S. face dangerously low temperatures in the hours ahead. We'll look at where an Arctic chill is settling in for the remainder of the weekend. We begin here in the U.S. as the presidential race becomes increasingly bitter with just two days to go before the New Hampshire Republican primary. Former President Donald Trump and ex-South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley are ramping up attacks against each other. On Saturday, Haley questioned Trump's mental fitness after he appeared to confuse her with Former U.S. House Speaker and Democrat Nancy Pelosi. Listen to this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) NIKKI HALEY, U.S. REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  When you're 80, that's what happens. You're just not as sharp as you used to be. There is a decline. And this is a situation where our country is very vulnerable right now. And we can't just have four years. We've got to have eight years of somebody that's on it all the time. I'm worried that we're not going to have somebody that's on it two years from now. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "Well, it's just three days to go until the New Hampshire primary. Donald Trump is escalating his attacks on his rival, Nikki Haley. And part of that strategy is by using leaders from South Carolina and trying to paint her as not being very well liked by people in her own backyard.On Saturday, Trump called up a series of South Carolina lawmakers to the stage, including South Carolina Governor Henry McMaster, fierce Trump ally who endorsed him back in 2022. And of course, that comes after Friday night where Donald Trump also picked up a massive endorsement from South Carolina Senator Tim Scott. I'm told from my conversations with Trump's campaign that they'd really been courting his endorsement ever since he dropped out of the presidential race last year. But they had really accelerated that timeline because they wanted to try and have it come right before New Hampshire. Again, New Hampshire is a state where they are worried about Nikki Haley's rise in the polls, especially her popularity with moderates and independents. And so, you're seeing the campaign and Donald Trump himself try to implement every tactic they can to undercut her in these final days. Now, another thing I like to point your attention to was Donald Trump also defended his cognitive abilities while on stage, that comes after a gaffe that Trump had on Friday where he seemed to confuse Nikki Haley with Nancy Pelosi when talking about security at the Capitol on January 6, 2021. We should point out that Nikki Haley was not in office then and had nothing to do with security at the Capitol during that time. But Donald Trump continuously brought up her name on Friday. And that your response from Nikki Haley, she had said that perhaps it shows Trump is not mentally fit for office. Take a listen to how Trump responded. DONALD TRUMP, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT AND U.S. REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  If I'm sarcastic or like I -- a lot of times I'll say, and President Obama is doing a lousy job, meaning that Obama is running the show. They'll say, Donald Trump doesn't know who our president is. No, no. A few months ago, I took a cognitive test, my doctor gave me. I said, give me a cognitive test just so we can, you know, because you know what the standards were. And I aced it. I'll let you know when I go bad. I really think I'll be able to tell you. TREENE:  Now I can tell you that this is an argument that actually bothers Donald Trump personally. We know that Donald Trump often likes to use these attacks on Joe Biden and doesn't really like the fire being trained on himself. And I think that's why you saw him try to bring this up tonight and address it head on. Alayna Treene, CNN, Manchester, New Hampshire. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Volodymyr Zelenskyy told Britain's Channel 4 News, the idea that Trump could unilaterally make decisions that don't work for Ukraine or its people makes him quite stressed. But Trump seems to feel he knows how to handle such crises, telling \"Fox News\" that if he were president, \"Putin would have never attacked Ukraine.\"All right. Joining me now to talk about Donald Trump's impact on geopolitics is Ian Bremmer, president of the Eurasia Group and GZERO Media. Thanks so much for being here with us. So, at the World Economic Forum this week, I imagine Trump was one of the topics of conversation. Is there a concern among some European leaders that Trump could in fact win?",

I would say that the general sense is that Trump not only can win but most of the delegates thought he was reasonably likely to win which was, I think, a little surprising. And beyond that, this sense of panic, particularly among the European delegates, like right underneath the ice, you had this sense of, my God, you know, we've had very strong coordinated policy on NATO. The transatlantic relationship is very strong in the midst of a war on Ukraine. And if Trump comes president, I mean, not only is he, sort of, indifferent to very negative on the European Union, but he says he's going to end the war on Ukraine, particularly because he considers Volodymyr Zelenskyy a personal enemy. And that for not opening the investigations against Biden and Hunter -- Biden and his son. So, all that means, that if you are a European, you think that a Trump presidency is a disaster for you.",

He's probably the single leader that's most excited about the idea of Trump coming in. But you're right, Viktor Orban and also a number of the European movements, not in power yet, but gaining political strength across Europe, who are anti-European Union themselves.So, of course, I'm talking about Marine Le Pen and her party, that right now is outperforming Macron's own in France. I'm thinking of the alternatives for Deutschland in Germany, routinely polling at 20, 25 percent across Germany, particularly strong in East Germany. There are movements like that in the Nordics and the Netherlands. In other words -- I mean, if Trump decides that he's going to end support for Ukraine, it's not just Orban that's going to support him, but large percentages of populations across Europe will put real political pressure on their leaders saying, hey, let's cut a deal with Russia. Let's stop the fighting. It's not going anywhere. Cut Ukraine off. That's probably the single biggest geopolitical impact that Trump would have immediately upon becoming president. BRUNHUBER:  I mean, the other factor here is, you know, it's the crazy seesawing from one extreme to the other that seems to have allies worried. I mean, it seems as though it's a nonstop cycle of Democratic presidents entering into agreements like the, you know, climate, environment, so on. And then the Republican president rips it all up. It becomes hard for allies to rely on the U.S. with this constant policy whiplash.",

I mean, the U.K., of course, given that they are out of the E.U., Brexit, though, assuming a labor prime minister comes in, much less aligned ideologically with Trump than the present conservative party.These issues are also true across Asia with American top ally's vis-a- vis China. Trump would be seen to be a pretty hawkish proponent of policies against China, but would he be willing to stand up for continued strong military support for the Japanese, for the South Koreans? I mean, ultimately, these things are not really based on rule of law as much as they are believed that the American president and the American power will stand up for them if there's a fight.

We have seen countless near daily attacks against U.S. Troops by Iranian proxies in these two countries, more than 140, in fact, since October 7th. But what we understand is that this is a more significant missile, obviously, ballistic missile, far more powerful.

And if an election were held tomorrow, poll after poll shows that he would be out of the job.So, he's hoping to shore up his domestic constituency with these comments. But I think what it's also going to do internationally is broaden, widen the rift, or more of a Gulf now between Israel and the United States in terms of what's going to happen the day after. Netanyahu effectively saying that from the river to the sea, Israel needs to have security control. This is diametrically opposed to what the U.S. is saying. We've also heard from the E.U.'s. top foreign policy chief saying that perhaps a two-state solution might need to be imposed on the parties because they can't agree to one themselves -- with themselves. And of course, we heard from the U.N. Secretary General posting on X in the early hours of this morning, certainly in Israel, but I guess the Saturday evening in the U.S., saying the refusal to accept the two-state solution for Israelis and Palestinians and the demand of the right to statehood for the Palestinian people are unacceptable. But one thing is worth noting, Kim, is this isn't really any different from Netanyahu's long held position. You may recall back in 2009, he gave a famous speech at Bar-Ilan University in Israel in which he said that he was open to a two-state solution and that that was a possibility. Martin Indyk, a former Ambassador to Israel from the United States, telling \"The New Yorker\" in an article that came out last week that after that a couple of days later, they spoke. Netanyahu said to him, all right, I said it. Now, can we get on with dealing with Iran? Kim. BRUNHUBER:  Interesting. All right.

They said they killed a number of Hamas terrorists.And one piece of evidence they found there to show that hostages were being held, and let's not forget there are still more than 100 Israelis being held in the Gaza Strip by Hamas and others was a drawing by a former five-year -- a former hostage, a five-year-old girl called Emilia Aloni. In terms of the broader war theater, the death toll now, according to the Hamas-run health ministry, is just shy of 25,000. Now, those figures don't distinguish between combatants and civilians.

North Korea's state media says, Putin will soon travel east. The two leaders, increasingly isolated on the world stage met in Russia last September. The U.S. has raised concerns the two nations could be working on advancing arms negotiations as Russia seeks weapons for its war in Ukraine. The Kremlin says dates for Putin's visit are still being worked out.And there are concerns tensions between North and South Korea could result in a wider conflict. One observer says, the rhetoric coming out of North Korea is reminiscent of the Korean War 70 years ago. Earlier this month, Kim Jong Un labeled the South as North Korea's principal enemy. Will Ripley has the story. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) WILL RIPLEY, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Tonight, the Korean Peninsula staring down the barrel of a catastrophic conflict. That warning from one of America's leading nuclear scientists, one of two long time North Korea observers who say Kim Jong Un is sending signals in state media. He may be prepared to take advantage of global chaos to exploit what he sees as weakness and vulnerability between the U.S. and close allies South Korea and Japan. SIEGFRIED S. HECKER, PROFESSOR, MIDDLEBURY INSTITUTE OF INTERNATIONAL STUDIES:  They're talking about war. They're talking about war preparations for their country. And so, we're quite concerned. RIPLEY (voice-over):  For years, Former Los Alamos Director Siegfried Hecker had unparalleled access to North Korea's highly secretive nuclear program. Seeing more than almost any American. What he's seeing now, he says, reminiscent of the lead up to the catastrophic Korean War more than 70 years ago. A chilling shift in leader Kim Jong Un's strategy, far more than the usual saber rattling.",

With temperatures still way below average for this time of year and even hitting dangerous levels again for parts of the upper Midwest. I mean, we're looking at overnight low temperatures Sunday morning of minus five degrees in Chicago, minus four in Omaha, that's not including the wind chill.You've got temperatures in the single digits down to Nashville, even in the teens as far south as Atlanta. Daytime highs won't break freezing for many cities like Chicago and Cleveland and St. Louis. Temperatures in the 40s in Atlanta is still a good 10 degrees below average. But look at what happens when you look at the four-day forecast. You start to find the other side of the hill with temperatures starting to warm up. We start out the work week with temperatures a little bit closer to average. And then look at these numbers in the 60s by Wednesday in Atlanta, some 40s up from D.C. to New York. We'll keep things again on the chilly side on Sunday. You can see these temperatures still about 10 degrees below average. We're closer to average by Monday and Tuesday, and then all the oranges start to spread. And you're looking at temperatures 10 to 20 degrees above average by Wednesday and Thursday, nearing 70 degrees from Atlanta and Charlotte. Temperatures, again, very warm and thawing out for this time of year. I mean, look at Atlanta's seven-day forecast, overnight lows below freezing in the 20s over the weekend, and then we'll warm up with daytime highs up around 70 degrees with some showers and storms. That's what's going to pull in some of that warmer air. And even for a place like Cincinnati that won't hit 70, you're still looking at a huge warm up where your overnight lows are in the teens, and then they warm up to the middle 40s, which is warmer than your average daytime high which is around 39 degrees for this time of year. Your daytime highs will get near 60. So, a big thaw, a big warmup for a lot of the U.S. is coming. (END VIDEO CLIP)",
