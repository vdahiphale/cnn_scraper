After 14 years of the most brutal and ugly civil war, these people want the world to know that Syria is free and is beginning a new chapter. Kate?",

Talk about what you've seen in the days you've been there.

While people in Syria were starving, were being bombed, were being killed, were being tortured, he was living in lavish opulence with huge garages full of luxury cars. I'm just pointing over here, and I don't know if we can get it at all. It's probably a bit tough without a tripod, but cameraman Scott McWhinnie, if you can see were in Umayyad, central Damascus, Umayyad Square. On the top of that monument, you can see one individual who has been waving a flag.And I think you can also see, what's interesting Kate, is the mixture of people we're seeing here. We are definitely seeing some rebel fighters who are clearly Islamist. We are also seeing young women who are not wearing headscarves. And the question will be how long can this moment last? How long can this honeymoon period last? There are so many challenges ahead. So many concerns about things that could go wrong. But for this one -- the Syrian people we are talking to are saying just let us have this moment, just let us enjoy this moment, because we have never been able to come out and celebrate and speak our minds on the streets without fear of being shot or imprisoned or tortured. And there is something kind of magical about that, despite all the anxiety about what will come next.",

      "sentences": "Yes, Kate, I mean even friends and family members at this point are wondering what happened here. I mean, this is a person, Luigi Mangione, who grew up extremely privileged, went to some of the best schools in this country, comes from a very prominent Maryland family.And if you look at his social media footprint, we really found someone who loved to travel, loved to hang out with friends, was most recently living in Hawaii in a co-living space and was head of the book club there, loved to hike. But then about this summer, it starts to sort of go away. We see messages where Mangione is tagged, where people are worried about him, wondering sort of where he went, that his family was worried. Someone actually commented, are you going to honor your rsvp to my wedding? So it does seem that he sort of trailed off. The big question is, what happened? Right. That is what investigators are trying to answer at this point as far as a motive is concerned. We do glean a little bit more from his social media. There is a picture on his X account of a spinal x-ray essentially with some hardware in it, and we learned from someone who was with him in that co-living space in Hawaii that he did undergo some chronic back pain and possibly surgery after surfing lessons. This person said that he was bedridden for about a week. And we wonder possibly, was there some sort of vendetta against the health care industry, though there is nothing there that sort of points exactly to Thompson, the victim in this case, or UnitedHealthcare in general. I do want you to hear from this person that we talked to with the co- living space to give more about the conversations they once had. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) R.J. MARTIN, SUSPECT'S FORMER ROOMMATE:  I know we talked about social issues and we talked about how to improve the world, and we talked about, you know, issues that are, you know, say, with capitalism or with the health care system or with housing or the food systems. It wasn't anything specific. It wasn't like he had an ax to grind or he was even upset or angry about a particular issue. They were just natural, intellectual conversations that you have when you're inquisitive. (END VIDEO CLIP) GINGRAS:  Yes, and a Reddit account that appears to be Mangione's does talk about also Lyme disease, dealing with brain fog, saying that the health care industry really didn't understand brain fog. So again, these are all sort of things that investigators certainly have scrubbed at this point and are looking into themselves for their own investigation. I do want to share a statement that was released from the Mangione family. It says \"Our family is shocked and devastated by Luigi's arrest. We offer prayers to the family of Brian Thompson and we ask people to pray for all involved.\" Certainly, we will find out more about Mangione and, of course, all the charges we know that he now faces and when he will return to New York.
