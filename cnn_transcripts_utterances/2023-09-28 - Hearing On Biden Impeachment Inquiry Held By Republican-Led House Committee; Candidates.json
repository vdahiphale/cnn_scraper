RON DESANTIS (R-FL), U.S. REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  And you know who else is missing in action? Donald Trump is missing in action. He should be on this stage tonight. He owes it to you to defend his record. CHRIS CHRISTIE, U.S. REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  Donald, I know you are watching. You can't help yourself. You're ducking these things. And let me tell you what's going to happen, you keep doing that, no one up here's going to call you Donald Trump anymore. We're going to call you Donald Duck. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Friends, I want to put up on the screen just so people can see. The CNN Poll of Polls, what we did is I took Donald Trump's current number on the Poll of Polls and added up everyone else on that stage. All seven candidates added up are at 37 percent. Trump is beating the field collectively by 21 points.So, Congressman, to you -- we'll get to who had the best moment in a bit. But did anything that happened change the fundamental structure of this race to make it more likely than any of them could beat Donald Trump? FMR. REP. ADAM KINZINGER (R-IL), CNN SENIOR POLITICAL COMMENTATOR AND HONORARY CHAIRMAN, COUNTY FIRST PAC:  I wish I could tell you, yes. I wish. No, it's not going to change anything. Really the key is that opposition force, should we call it, the people running against Donald Trump, that has to thin out so then you see one person, kind of, growing in numbers, and then the discussion becomes it's really a two- person race. That's not going to happen any time soon. So, I don't think anything last night changed the fundamental of whatever it was, 58, 37.

You saw it with respect to the record of the Trump administration on spending, which a lot of people know they added a ton of debt, a ton of deficits.And so, you saw an effort by folks like Nikki Haley, like Tim Scott to draw some of that contrast. Now, at the end of the day, the congressman is right. What they're really fighting for is to be the last person standing against Donald Trump.

And Chris Christie was pretty strong.So, I would say, probably, of all the group, I'm going to say Christie, Haley, kind of Scott, DeSantis, all of them. I don't know. So, it's just -- again, we're shuffling deck chairs. But Vivek, I think, came out pretty poorly last night, and I'm not saying this just to some Washington D.C. insider. Nikki Haley, what you saw on that clip, she was genuinely -- like, you saw a genuine disgust by the charlatan nature of what Vivek has become. You know, calling out his China links, calling out his complete disregard for Ukraine and the fight for freedom there. I think that was actually really effective because, again, Vivek is trying to play off this Donald Trump thing of genuineness, which Trump is not genuine, but he does a good job of pretending. I don't think Vivek can pull that off. I mean, she did a good job. BERMAN:  Voters have shown, for generations that what --they like is someone who's true to themself. One way or another, for better or for worse. Lanhee, is there any reason Donald Trump should show up to next debate if he's trying to win, not because it's the right thing to do.

I do think that his campaign team has it right in the sense that it puts him on a plane with people who, frankly, from a polling perspective now are not on his plane.But at some point, you would hope he does show up because, first of all, it would be more entertaining for everybody. But second of all, it would allow the candidates to show, are they willing to go after him directly when he is on the stage, or are they going to cower from that potential responsibility? So, I do hope he shows up. I'm not holding my breath unless, in fact, his ego sort of says, look, I cannot continue to standby and let people attack me without letting this thing go unresponded to.

Many military families are unable to feel that second income that most middle-class and working-class people need because they move so often over and over again. They get that broken time. So, families are on the edge. I got a text yesterday from a young enlisted spouse that I know, her husband is an E-force junior soldier. Missing one paycheck for us means we cannot buy groceries.

We urged Congress to pass that. When the troops are not paid, they look for emergency aid. We have to ask our neighbors and our employers to understand the situation we're in and to try to help us out. But the long-term effects of this is that we are hearing, and in that pulse poll you mentioned, 54 percent said they'd be greatly affected, but 85 percent said that they would be somewhat greatly affected. Those folks are also telling us that they're considering leaving military service.

This was his attempt to get this judge, Tanya Chutkan, and the federal court in Washington D.C. off of his case that is set to go to trial next year. But this is an opinion worth noting because it is one where this judge is being asked to address, essentially, political attacks that Donald Trump has brought into the courtroom. Something a tactic he has tried in a number of his cases, and it continues on, the judges and prosecutors are having to grapple with.In this particular case, he was trying to say that Judge Chutkan should not be on this case because she could not be fair to him because of sentences she had already imposed, sentencing two Capitol riot defendants to jail time. In those cases, both of those people, those two Capitol rioters had tried to argue with their sentences that they should shift the blame to Trump. That they should not be held as fully responsible because, for some reason, they were at the Capitol because of Donald Trump. Judge Chutkan had rejected that, essentially, during those sentencings. And now, is also rejecting Donald Trump's request here. One of the things she writes in this opinion that came out last night, her statements at those sentencing, they arose not as the defense speculates from watching the news, but from the sentencing proceedings. And the statements directly reflected facts proffered and arguments made by those defendants, the January 6th rioters. And so, she's not really engaging with the political bluster of Donald Trump here. This is a pretty straightforward opinion from Judge Chutkan, and one that sets us closer to trial, getting rid of this request he made by denying it. And so now, we have this opinion from Judge Chutkan. She can write in a way that cuts like a knife, but in this opinion, it is pretty straightforward. Kate.",
