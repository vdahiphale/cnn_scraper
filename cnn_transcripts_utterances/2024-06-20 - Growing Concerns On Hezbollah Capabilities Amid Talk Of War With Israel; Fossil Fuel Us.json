Tonight, concerns coming from the United Statesthat Israel's iron dome air defense system could be overwhelmed if war breaks out with Hezbollah, we'll bring you the very latest on that. Then, from New Mexico to New Delhi, the effects of the climate crisis are being felt across the globe. But a new climate report shows emissions are only getting worse. Plus, legendary actor Donald Sutherland dies at the age of 88. His agency says he passed away after a long illness. We'll have more on his life as well as his legacy. But we begin this hour with new information about the capabilities of Hezbollah as concerns grow that full-scale war between Israel and Lebanon could be on the horizon. Now, U.S. officials have told CNN that the Biden administration has serious concerns that Hezbollah could overwhelm Israel's air defenses including the iron dome. And that thread is set to be more likely if Hezbollah conducted a large- scale attack with precision-guided ammunitions. Now, Israel warned all-out war could be nearing after Hezbollah, if you remember, released a drone video and some nine-minute drone video this week that captured Israeli civilian as well as military or locations around Haifa. Israel vows it would destroy Hezbollah, saying it has infinitely more powerful capabilities. Israel reportedly told the U.S. it plans to shift resources from southern Gaza to northern Israel in case of war with Lebanon. And this, of course, all comes as new video emerges showing some of the destruction that you're seeing right there in Rafah, where the IDF says it's operating against Hamas. This is what's left, have a look at it, of Gaza's border crossing with Egypt. The passenger terminal burned and severely damaged. An official in Rafah says the city is disaster struck with homes, civilian infrastructure and entire squares destroyed. Let's get more from Alex Marquardt, who is in Washington and Paula Hancocks is in Jerusalem. And Alex, first to you, just talk us through this warning and these concerns coming from the United States and the vulnerabilities here of the iron dome system.",

Alex was just mentioning there, and now we're getting this warning from the United States. What has been the response from the IDF?

      "sentences": "Well, Isa, we're hearing nothing on the records. They don't want to be publicly discussing theseconcerns. Certainly, the rhetoric we are hearing is one of strength from Israel, as you might expect in this kind of situation. You've got the foreign minister warning Hezbollah of all-out war, saying Hezbollah will be destroyed. But of course, when you speak behind the scenes, they are concerned about the Hezbollah of today compared to the Hezbollah of 2006, for example, which is the last time that they had a significant war against Hezbollah. The precision-guided ammunitions and missiles that they have been stockpiling now for years provided by Iran will concern Israeli officials. And really, the attacks and the missile strikes that we have seen from Hezbollah into northern Israel over recent months have been far more strategic than we have seen in the past. They are trying, it appears, to take out the missile defense systems that Israel has in place. Of course, that iron dome system, which is such a key part of the missile defense system here in Israel. And as Alex mentioned, there was a claim from Hezbollah that they had taken out one of these iron dome systems. The IDF said there was no damage, but certainly Israeli media as well was reporting on that. So, it is more of a sense of vulnerability that you see in the Israeli sense, when you see that Hezbollah is able to target those systems and they have quite systematically been trying to take out the ability of Israel to defend itself.

You can't really overstate how important that is to try and get humanitarian aid into Gaza,and also to try and get some of the more critical cases out of Gaza. The W.H.O. told us just last week, they believe about 10,000 critically-injured patients are waiting to be able to have treatment outside of Gaza and other countries that are waiting to receive them. But nothing has come through that crossing since May 7th when the Israeli military took control of it. Now, we have seen through footage, through satellite imagery that at the end of last month, there was severe burning and fires within that crossing itself. It's not clear what started that. And then, June 9th or 10th, according to the satellite imagery, when the bulldozing was taking place by the Israeli military to try and clear that area. There was severe damage done to that passenger crossing as well. Now, it's obviously been criticized by the Palestinian authorities on the ground. It's been criticized by Hamas, the IDF says that it would be able to -- it wouldn't affect being able to bring aid in because nothing is coming in through that crossing at the moment. But the fact is, humanitarian aid groups are calling for it to be reopened if of course it is not functioning, then that is a very severe blow when some of the other land crossings are not allowing in as much as could be.

As a matter of fact, already there's some sort of low-grade war going on, on the south of Lebanon. So many villages by the way have already been destroyed. I think most of the images are coming from Gaza, but in reality, I saw some images of the villages in south Lebanon, they're terribly destroyed in the same manner as in Gaza. So, the situation is very dire, and I think there are two possibilities here. One is that Netanyahu continues the war in Gaza regardless of the U.N. Security Council resolution, regardless of the proposal by President Biden, in which case the escalation on the northern front will happen. And that is very dangerous for both -- for everybody, including Israelis. The other path is that Israel will listen to all the decisions and the resolutions and stop the war on Gaza, in which case the Lebanese front- wheel immediately go into peace.

I worry that what's happening here is that the court is taking Donald Trump's side, that they're slow rolling this until possibly after the election.

Because frankly, let's just get to the root problem here, it's about whether or not a former president is immune from prosecution after being president for criminal acts. And that's what's at stake here. Not just a criminal act, but a criminal act that threatens democracy in an attempted self-coup. There should be an attempt to prosecute him. And if he wants to defend himself, he can present the law on the facts. But what an immunity argument does is give him a get out of jail free card.

And while I certainly agree with President Biden that this court is acting in a way that's very dangerous when it comes to democracy, the one even more worrying thing is that we've been here before. We've seen courts act in not just a partisan way, but in a way that threatens democracy. During the Civil War, for instance, the Dred Scott case denied all rights, essentially, to black people. So, there's a long history of the court being complicit in threats to democracy, and I worry that's what's going on here, too.

Aides have prepared binders with policy areas that could come up in this debate. And President Biden is well known for offering extensive feedbacks to advisers in his debate preparations. He is hoping to remind voters what those four years were like when Trump was in office, but also warned of what a second term could look like. A lot of what his focus will be on is trying to map out the different scenarios for this debate, including the way Trump could behave, the types of messages Trump could relay, and also possible personal attacks for his family.

And then, of course, internationally, there is no question that there really is a stark choice here facing the voters in the U.S. about America's direction in the world. Donald Trump very much is not, you know, the same - - does not hold the same policy views that many Republicans Ronald Reagan, George W. Bush, et cetera, have on Ukraine, for example, the Middle East. He's been not quite as specific in the Middle East.
