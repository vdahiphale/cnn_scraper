We just heard a little while ago from the Secretary of State, Tony Blinken, in a blistering and important speech. And in Ukraine, President Zelenskyy is also speaking this morning and promising victory for his country in 2023. He's also once again pushing for more support from the West in order to pull it off.For Russia's part, they show no signs of letting up, of course, the -- with ongoing shelling in Ukraine's east and south, killing at least three civilians and injuring several others in just the last 24 hours. And make no mistake. The war is reaching a critical juncture as Ukraine is preparing for an unexpected Russian spring offensive. And in a new interview with CNN, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin discussed the role that China could play in the next year of this war if China begins providing lethal support to Russia as is feared. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) LLOYD AUSTIN, U.S. DEFENSE SECRETARY: We've not seen any -- China provides any material assistance to Ukraine -- to Russia at this point. China hasn't taken that -- taken that off the table for sure. I engaged my counterpart early on and told him that this would be a very bad mistake if China were to do this. It would further complicate things.",

But we've also heard him, particularly when he met with President Biden just a few days ago saying that there are still things that Ukraine is pushing for in terms of weapons, that they feel that they need to push the Russians out of this country, including longer-range missiles, and perhaps for the longer-term fighter jets.The fight is obviously extremely active. It is despite the fact that the front line is relatively stagnant. There is a huge demand from the Ukrainian side for weapons not just in terms of increased sophistication, but in increased speed. Because there is an expectation that Russia will carry out a new offensive that we're already seeing the early stages of. But that Ukraine itself wants to go on a new counter-offensive against the Russians. Kate. BOLDUAN: Alex, thank you very much. Let's talk more about China and the new and increased focus on China's role -- potential role in Ukraine. China's calling for a ceasefire in Ukraine and for peace talks to begin as soon as possible. Those proposals are part of a new 12-Point Plan that China put out today as Beijing faces mounting questions over its growing relationship with Russia and also facing new accusations from the secretary of state that it's trying to have it both ways when it comes to Ukraine. Kylie Atwood is live at the United Nations where the Secretary of State just spoke. Kylie, what's -- what was Blinken's message to the UN Security Council just now?",

Listen to his reflections. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ANTONY BLINKEN, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE: When President Putin couldn't break the Ukrainian military, he intensified efforts to break Ukrainian spirits. Over the last year, Russia has killed tens of thousands of Ukrainian men, women, and children, uprooted more than 13 million people from their homes, destroyed more than half of the country's energy grid, bombed more than 700 hospitals, 2600 schools and abducted at least 6000 Ukrainian children, some as young as four months old, and relocated them to Russia.
