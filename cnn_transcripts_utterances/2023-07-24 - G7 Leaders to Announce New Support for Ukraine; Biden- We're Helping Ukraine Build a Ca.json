And the announcement of those long term security guarantees Max, is that essentially, they're going to be looking not just at military capabilities that they can continue to add, but perhaps more importantly the political economic investments that they can make in the country to try and ensure not just its independent future, but the fact it should be more closely integrated with the West that should provide some long of those long term guarantees that President Zelenskyy has been looking for. As well as so many of those short term military deliverables that we've been hearing about. And yet we just show you just showed Max, a moment from that press conference. And Jens Stoltenberg, explaining very clearly there that they were now equals, if not yet allies. And really what you heard from President Zelenskyy very clearly was that was all well and good. But being on the road to membership, getting pledges of aid from NATO was not the same as being a member again, repeating that sense of frustration. It's something we've been hearing about here on the sidelines of this meeting with the UK Defense Minister speaking at a briefing here at the main NATO event. Saying, look, he's told the Ukrainians, you need to be showing a little more gratitude for what's been done already. We're not Amazon. We cannot be given shopping lists. And then these kinds of demands speaking to the tone, that so many have found surprising, and there was expressed again today, but a lot of focus clearly on what's to come next. First of all, the bilateral between Joe Biden and President Zelenskyy, we've been hearing from Jake Sullivan Max, who said that the American President intends to be plain speaking with his Ukrainian counterpart, even though he will be there to listen to what President Zelenskyy has to say as well. We will, of course, also be looking towards that package of measures much broader than simply military aid to be announced by the G7 with an eye on the political future, the economic future of Ukraine. And again its integration within the west with an eye on what Jens Stoltenberg explained earlier, which is that the point is to prevent this kind of conflict from ever happening again, to make it absolutely clear to Moscow where the future of Ukraine lies, Max.",

The seven most powerful economies in the world are gathering together there and representatives from the EU as well. What we just heard from President Biden was that the g7 have agreed to provide security to Ukraine against any aggression that may occur, clear support lasting long into the future. And President Zelenskyy coming in after saying that was a meaningful success for Ukraine. The security guarantees are for NATO, as it makes a part as for Ukraine, as it makes a path towards NATO. He didn't get what he ideally wanted, which was an invitation, a formal invitation to NATO, but he is receiving formal guarantees of security as we approach that time, which will come one day President Biden said. We'll continue to bring you live updates from the second and final day of NATO Summit in Lithuania here on CNN. But first and important and encouraging you read on the path of U.S. prices. New data shows U.S. consumer inflation rising at a 3 percent rate year-over-year in June. This is the first time in more than two years; their headline inflation has come in below 4 percent. It also is the 12th straight month of easing inflation, the all-important core rates that factors out volatile food and energy prices is easing too, to under 5 percent on a yearly basis, both the headline and core numbers came in lower than expected. The market reaction of course is positive. All the major U.S. averages are rallying in early trading with tech stocks in the lead, U.S. bond yields are pulling back after the report too. For more on today's inflation number, I'm joined by Michael Gapen, Head of U.S. Economics of Bank of America Securities. Thank you so much for joining us. And we've seen the reaction from the markets; I guess it's this core figure that's really impressed them. MICHAEL GAPEN, HEAD OF U.S. ECONOMICS, BANK OF AMERICA SECURITIES: That's right. So there was evidence another month of evidence that inflation is gradually dissipating in the U.S. economy. And we saw a further moderation in services inflation, which is kind of a key consideration for the Federal Reserve because in some ways reflects the strength of the domestic economy. We do expect weakness in some goods prices. But there was a broad base softness in the report. And I think it's a very good report for the economy and the outlook for disinflation, and the stabilization and inflation going forward.",

They were up about 50 percent during the pandemic. And we have expected them to come back down as new auto supply has come on board that was happening and then it stopped. Now it appears to be happening again, I think that would be considered good news. Airline prices came down dramatically on the month. But a key consideration for the Federal Reserve has been what we call shelter inflation or rents, rental inflation, housing inflation that actually moderated further, it's still rising, but it rose 0.4 on the month versus 0.5 or 0.6. So again, it's showing signs of slowing. So I would point to those three categories housing inflation, airlines as well as used cars.",

And I think what the data in totality supports not just the inflation data, but the labor market andother activity data suggests the Fed will raise its policy rate, another 25 basis points or a quarter of a percent at its July meeting later this month. But I think after that things are still very open ended. We think that they will do one more 25 basis point increase after that. But if inflation continues to surprise to the downside, maybe they don't. So I think the outlook is very data dependent. And certainly think more action in June is forthcoming.

So the headline rate of inflation has come down as energy prices have stabilized. But this month, food prices were up a 10th or two, energy rebounded about a half a percent, gasoline prices were up 1 percent. So I think most of the improvement there is in the rearview mirror.

And they in turn, alerted Microsoft. And that set off this sort of goose chase for the hackers and to try to evict them from networks. It's a much targeted attack, meaning these alleged Chinese hackers are after very specific information from high level officials. And it's like you said it's only a handful of federal agencies, and they're trying to pick out information from the unclassified email system. So the Biden Administration is pointing out that they were first to detect this and not Microsoft. So there's some finger pointing going on. But this is more of the same in terms of the long running, very challenging Chinese espionage threat facing U.S. government agencies and corporations, according to outside experts, not just government sources, but outside experts and well documented activity from the Chinese. Now that the Chinese typically deny this and point out that the U.S. government in turn conducts its own hacking, but the scale and sophistication that we're seeing sometimes from the Chinese is something that really keeps U.S. officials up at night Max.",
