But Ukrainian officials say it will not break their spirit. Also, an exclusive investigation into the death of an activist in Iran, as nationwide protests against the regime continue. And Brazilians head to the polls Sunday for what has been described as one of the most consequential elections in the country's democratic history. We'll debrief why. Russia's latest attacks on Ukraine's power facility is plunging more people into darkness and cold, as winter approaches. Russia fired drones and missiles overnight at power plants in Kyiv, causing massive fires, requiring the deployment of dozens of emergency workers. Ukrainian officials say they had to implement severe and unprecedented power cuts in the region to avoid a complete back out. One energy CEO says hundreds of thousands of homes are now without power. UN and Red Cross officials say it will only cause deep suffering for the Ukraine people, depriving them of hate, ordering electricity. It won't be easy for Ukraine to carry out repairs on the heavily damaged power plants. Our Nic Robertson with an exclusive look at one facility, which was targeted twice by Russia.

Everyone here knows what to do. We agreed not to show faces or name the power plant for security regions. We've been given these safety jackets to wear. Officials here telling us it's normal to end up in a bunker several times a day. The coal-fired power plant hit twice since Putin began targeting electrical facilities days ago. Cards, dominoes, messaging loved ones passes the time. This 29-year veteran of the Soviet-era plant tells me every minute in the bunker is time wasted. We need to be on top repairing the bomb damage. An hour and a half later, all clear, everyone back to work. One of the first things you notice here is just how quiet it is. No generator stumping away. Around the corner, engineers are already around the bunker making repairs. Those cables are the easy bit. Russia's cruise missiles and drones ripped through the hardest part of the plant to repair. They say got tangled up in the high bolted cables appear. It ripped equipment apart all on the ground. It's all around burnt out cables. And over here, burnt out equipment. And the problem official says that this part of the site was the most sensitive part. It has been off line since. Officials here convince Putin's power engineers, are advising his military had a crash Ukraine's grid.",

They say Russian troops are digging in, reinforcing their positions to try and hold on to their city. The Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelenskyy says, of course, those Russian forces will be defeated. CNN's Frederik Pleitgen visited the frontline and filed this report for us. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  Across these fields are the Russians. That means we need to get into the trenches that snake their way through this battle space in southern Ukraine. So, this is the actual front line between the Russians and the Ukrainians. They say that the Russians are only a couple of kilometers in that direction. And obviously, there's a lot of shelling that goes on here almost all the time. A destroyed tank turret right outside Ukrainian position shows just how fierce the fighting is here, spent cartridges from cluster bombs and Russian flak vests also still lying around. While some thought the Ukrainians might quickly oust the Russians and take back the key city of Kherson, in the trench, a feeling of stalemate. ALEXANDER, 59TH BRIGADE, UKRAINIAN ARMY (through translator):  There is shelling every day. In some places less. In some, more. We would shoot back, but we have nothing to shoot with here.",

I want to start with what we are hearing on the front lines. We have been reporting that Russia was sending prisoners to the frontline. We have been learning that some are diseased prisoners. We've also seeing new video emerged showing Russians complaining that they don't have basic tools to survive. CNN can't independently verify that video but it's consistent with what we've been reporting the past. What else are you seeing and hearing in the frontlines, Fred?",

It was the West that have been gearing up for this for a long time. It was interesting to hear him say that the West was playing a dirty game that essentially, over the last year, the West has cornered Russian and that now Russia had no choice but to do this. One of the interesting things that I picked up from Vladimir Putin speech was where he said that he believes that Russia only wants to exist, that he doesn't want to confront the West, that Russia only wants to exist. But at the same time, you see here in Ukraine, there's Russian offensives going on. There's obviously a lot of people being killed. It certainly seems like Vladimir Putin is trying to justify that at home and obviously trying to justify that abroad as well. But, first and foremost, he's obviously trying to keep the Russian population in line and behind the war effort that's currently going on, Lynda.",

Good have you with us.Well, Brazil is just days away from choosing its next president, and voters have a choice between two names on Sunday's ballot. Former two term leftist president, Luiz Ignacio Lula da Silva, popularly known as Lula, and his far-right opponent, who currently has the job, Jair Bolsonaro. Well, socially and economically, Brazil is suffering. Recent polls say that the poor and women may cast the deciding votes on Sunday. CNN's Paula Newton is following the political battle for us and join us in the capital. Good to have you with us. So, Brazil, of course, was hit really hard by the COVID pandemic. Bolsonaro frequently dismissed the threat. At one point, calling it the little flu. And Brazil has certainly shackled to emerge from the economic turmoil.

What that means is that a whole new generation struggling with hunger has not had to do that in the last few years. A lot at stake here, as I said and people try not to be too cynical about which candidate might bring them some relief from what has been, again, just absolutely crippling economic demise here.",
