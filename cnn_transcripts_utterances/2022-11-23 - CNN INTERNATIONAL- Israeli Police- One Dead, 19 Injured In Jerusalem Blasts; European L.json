The first blast taking place just after 07And you can see some of the damage behind me. You can see, you know, there's people now coming to look at the site, but there appears to be a hole in the fence and a lot of debris, rocks debris. And just around us, we can see the marks of the shrapnel, likely the screws and the nails that police believe were placed inside of the bombs that when it exploded, it caused maximum damage. One person was killed at this site, a 16-year-old Canadian-Israeli religious school student, and more than 15 others were injured. 30 minutes after the bomb at this site down the hill from us, there was another bombing at another bus station. Police now believe this was a coordinated attack, that in both instances, some sort of bag with the bomb inside was placed at both bus stops. And it does appear as though they believe that these were detonated remotely in some fashion. Now, while this has been a deadly and violent year in this region for both Israelis and Palestinians, there hasn't been an attack like this, a bombing like this in Jerusalem or in Israel proper for years. And it's bringing back for many people the memories of the Second Intifida when suicide bombings, bombings at bus stations, at restaurants, became a regular occurrence. This is something unusual also because of the level of sophistication and organization that such an attack requires. Now, the Prime Minister of Israel, Yair Lapid, has put out a statement saying that they are on the hunt because they still do not know who placed these bombs and who carried out this attack. No militant group has taken responsibility for this attack, although the Hamas militant group has praised it. The U.S. Embassy and the American White House has condemned the attack, saying that terrorism does not reach any end. And now there is a fear that this is just the beginning, because the kindling has been dry on the ground for some time, that an attack like this -- that attack like this could somehow set off even more attacks. There's a lot of fears that we could be on the cusp here of a Third Intifida just because these types of attacks have become so rare in recent years and so frightening for so many people here. Max?",

They still don't know who the killer is or how many people they're looking for. CNN's Natasha Chen spoke with a representative about what police know so far. NATASHA CHEN, CNN U.S. NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: I asked the police spokesman here whether they're any closer to finding a suspect. And what I was told is they're definitely making progress. What that means is they've interviewed more than 90 people, they've chased more than 700 leads, and they've set up a portal online for people in the community who might have relevant surveillance footage to be able to upload those videos to police. And they say they've actually received quite a number of submissions. And so right now, their investigators are combing through those very large video files to see what may be relevant to hand over to the detectives on this case. Now, I did ask about the general threat level to the community. After all, a suspect has not been caught. And so the spokesperson tells me that people do need to be vigilant. Here's what he said.

That's after many students gave their input about how they would like to see the university proceed for the remaining two weeks of the school year after the Thanksgiving holiday break.

But is this the end of the road for independence, or will this just translate into more support for Scottish separation?This is what the Scottish First Minister has to say about it. She's very much leading the independence charge. \"While disappointed by it, I respect the ruling of the U.K. Supreme Court. It doesn't make law, only interprets it. A law that doesn't allow Scotland to choose our own future without Westminster consent exposes as myth any notion of the U.K. as a voluntary partnership and makes the case for independence.\" She goes on to say, \"Scottish democracy will not be denied. Today's ruling blocks one roots to Scotland's voice being heard on independence. But in a democracy, our voice cannot and will not be silenced. I'll make a full statement later this morning.\" Which she did, and she repeated many of those points. Let's bring in CNN's Nada Bashir. I want to bring up actually first the latest result, Nada, that we have for a referendum. It was back in 2014, 55 percent against 45 percent. So most people in Scotland voted to remain within the United Kingdom. But actually, if we look at the polls now, Nada, they're much tighter than that, which is what's driving Nicola Sturgeon towards another referendum. And this is a setback, however, she spins it.",

We've seen Brexit, of course, where the majority of authorities in Scotland voted to remain in the European Union.And, of course, we've seen the country now plummeting economically, financially, Nicola Sturgeon herself criticizing the Westminster government and the Conservative Party. Of course, we've seen three prime ministers now in just a matter of weeks. She has accused the Conservative Party of presiding over a government of chaos and pushing the country into financial crisis. And, of course, she believes that Rishi Sunak and the Conservative Party no longer hold a mandate, that this is the right thing to do, to respect democracy and to respect the will of the Scottish people. But the Westminster government and Rishi Sunak, of course, remain firm that this is not the right course of action. Rishi Sunak himself saying today in Parliament that he believes the Scottish people want the government to focus on the matters most important to them, including the cost of living crisis. But the picture has changed significantly since 2014 and the Scottish National Party now saying it will campaign to defend, in its words, democracy in Scotland, making this a primary priority for them in a campaign ahead of the general election.",

And ahead of that general election, they will be focusing on calls for another independence referendum. She did say that this was just one avenue to secure independence of Scotland. So they will be looking at other ways to do that. And in particular, of course, the results of that general election, which will be seen by Nicola Sturgeon, by the Scottish Nationalist Party, as a de facto referendum on the potential for an independent referendum. That will be a key focus ahead of the general election. But, of course, Nicola Sturgeon herself believes that the government in Westminster does not have a mandate, particularly in Scotland anymore. She has previously called for an early general election. There have been called for that even within Westminster. And we had a pretty fiery response from the Scottish representative in Westminster.

Morocco held Croatia to a draw earlier. Croatia, you may recall, with a 2018 runners up.For the rest of the day, Spain takes on Costa Rica. And after a 36- year absence, Canada is back in the World Cup, taking on Belgium in a few hours time. CNN's Amanda Davies following all of this from Doha. Germany versus Japan now well underway, and the Germans appear to show a protest ahead of the national anthems, or was it during the anthems? AMANDA DAVIES, CNN WORLD SPORT: It wasn't actually during the anthems. We will come to that because, you know, Germany have been one of the most vocal supporters of wearing that \"OneLove\" armband, which, until a couple of months ago, nobody's ever heard of. But now, we all know was a pretty common phrase, an armband that a number of the UEFA European top teams decided they wanted to wear here in Qatar, where it's illegal to be gay, as a show of solidarity, a fight, a message for inclusion in society. Of course, FIFA have stood by their rules, their regulations, and said that any team or player exhibiting a symbol of political protest or message would be punished on the field of play by being shown a yellow card. So there's been a lot of anger amongst these European teams and bodies from around the world, the likes of Amnesty International, the likes of the Football Supporters Association, against that decision by FIFA. And UEFA's Human Rights Working Group, reacting to the news, said that there might still be action that they were going to take. So there was a lot of speculation ahead of Germany taking to the field a little bit earlier on. That Manuel Neuer might still wear that \"OneLove\" armbands and be prepared to take the sanction. But instead of that, a very, very powerful message from the entire team after the anthem, as they lined up for the traditional team photo, the entire Germany team covered their mouths. It, of course, appeared to be a protest very quickly afterwards that a message was posted via the German Football Association social media, which said this. \"We wanted to use our captain's armband to take a stand for values that we hold in the Germany national team, diversity and mutual respect. Together with other nations, we wanted our voice to be heard. It wasn't about making a political statement, human rights are nonnegotiable that should be taken for granted, but it still isn't the case. That's why this message is so important to us. Denying us the armband is the same as denying us a voice. We stand by our position.\" So that is the stance that Germany have taken. We wait to see. This is not a story that's going to be going anywhere over the next four weeks or so, Max. We are yet to hear from FIFA or Qatar's organizers as to whether or not any action will be taken against Germany. I can tell you it is now halftime in their opening match of this tournament against Germany. They are one up, Ilkay Gundogan, with the goal from the penalty spot.",
