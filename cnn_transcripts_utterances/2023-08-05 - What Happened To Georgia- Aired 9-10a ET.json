      "sentences": "Welcome to The Whole Story. I'm Anderson Cooper.Former President Donald Trump has now been criminally indicted three times with the most recent federal indictment last week from Special Counsel Jack Smith. A part of his wide ranging investigation looked into the efforts by the former president and his allies to subvert election results in seven states after President Biden won in 2020. One of those states is Georgia, which President Biden flipped blue for a win in 2020. President Trump refused to accept the result and he and his allies engaged in a number of plots to overturn Biden's win. Some of these actions were so aggressive, they drew the attention of the Fulton County District Attorney who launched her own criminal probe in 2021. Now, a grand jury has been convened, and the former president could face even more indictments in the weeks to come. So, what exactly did Trump and his allies do in Georgia and what charges might they face? Over the next hour, CNN's Sara Murray will lay out the entire investigation and piece together what we know about the pressure campaigns, Trump's private calls to election officials, a major data breach and the plots and subvert the Electoral College process.",
