      "sentences": "Well, Jim, Bezelel Smotrich, who is both Israel's finance minister, as well as a minister inside the Ministry of Defense, he is now ordering two key departments within the Defense Ministry that he oversees to make preparations for to establish full Israeli sovereignty over Israeli settlements inside of the West Bank. And what that basically means is that he is laying the groundwork now for Israel to annex large parts of the West Bank areas that could potentially be the basis for a future Palestinian state.And he is tying his decision to carry out these next steps directly to the election of President Donald Trump. He is making very clear in his statement here that he believes that the time is now in the wake of Donald Trump's election victory to pursue annexing these large parts of the West Bank where Israel currently has numerous settlements there. He is also saying that he wants to lead a group to work with the incoming Trump administration to establish U.S. recognition of these settlements and of the Israeli sovereignty that he plans to extend to these settlements. Now, we've reached out to the Israeli prime minister's office for comments. We've also reached out to the Palestinian authority for comments, and we have yet to actually hear back so far. But we should know that Donald Trump, when he was last president, his peace plan that he proposed did indeed call for recognizing the sovereignty of settlements in the West Bank. And so it's very clear that Smotrich, as well as other right wingers in Netanyahu's government, are taking note of that fact and are now seeing the incoming Donald Trump presidency as an opportunity to fulfill many of their long held goals and beliefs regarding Israel's right to have settlements in the West Bank. We should note that these settlements are considered illegal under international law as a result, and Israel has had these settlements following its conquest of that area in the 1967 war. Jim?",

I don't get the sense that there's any appetite, at least at the moment, in the incoming Trump administration to pursue any such move like Israeli annexation of the West Bank.The reason that Benjamin Netanyahu, on January 28, 2020, had to walk back his statement about annexing the West Bank was because Donald Trump told them, don't do it. And in the Trump peace plan, the Israeli-Palestinian peace plan, when you read it the word, annexation, is not there and the word implementation of Israeli law in the West Bank is also not there. So, I think, you know, what people say now, I think, you know, some people are, you know, maybe might be excited, but the results of the U.S. election, it still doesn't mean that they're going to get what they want.",

      "sentences": "Yes. Homan is an interesting background as someone who was actually a Border Patrol agent himself and rose through the agency, ultimately becoming the executive associate director at the ICE headquarters under President Barack Obama. In fact, President Obama gave him the presidential rank award, which is the highest honor that someone who works in senior executive level of the bureaucracy can receive. And he stayed on through Trump's first term ultimately becoming associate or the acting ICE director, as you said, and he was the enforcer of Trump's immigration policies and ultimately was the architect of his family separation policies as well.And he has been influential in Trump's orbit, especially on immigration. Throughout his campaign, he was a contributor to Project 2025, that controversial plan for Trump's administration. And he has been one of the people who has been influencing Trump's policies that he has been rolling out not only as a campaign candidate but also in his early days of his administration. And now he will be a border czar, as you said. Now, that role obviously does not have a cabinet title to it. In fact, it wouldn't need any sort of Senate confirmation. And it's not exactly clear what that would entail. However, Trump on the campaign trail talked a lot about mobilizing all branches of government, and as well as the military and state and local law enforcement in order to carry out his mass deportation plan. So, you can certainly see where someone like Homan would be in charge of overseeing all the various stakeholders under that plan.",

Obviously, she ultimately was not chosen, but has been in the mix and discussed for a potential role in his administration. And now she will find herself as the nominee for U.N. ambassador, an interesting twist in that role, given that one of the previous U.N. ambassadors for Donald Trump was Nikki Haley, who obviously became one of his rivals in the Republican primary.

      "sentences": "Well, it'll be interesting to see what the American people really think they're getting with Donald Trump, right? I mean, look, I listen to people in focus groups all the time. Immigration was an enormous vulnerability for Democrats. Americans do want a secure border. I do think there's a question on top of that about whether or not Americans can stomach the idea of American military going and rounding people up and deporting them en masse.I think the images of them sort of deporting children, many of whom are American citizens, that can get dicey really fast and can create the kind of sort of chaos and buyer's remorse that Donald Trump experienced in his first term when people actually saw him implement many of his policies. And so -- but, look, the American people voted for it, and they were -- they're going to see whether or not they like it when they get it. I will say on the, Elise Stefanik is an interesting choice especially considering how Donald Trump has sort of gone after Liz Cheney and others who he says are sort of neocons or war hawks. You know, Elise Stefanik is somebody who has been quite hawkish in her career because she used to be a completely different person than the one she is now as a MAGA loyalist. And so she used to be somebody who would support Ukraine, support democratic allies abroad. So, it will be interesting to see which version of her of Elise Stefanik shows up because she's been such a shapeshifter. But, you know, Donald Trump has shown real contempt for people who do want to stand with democratic allies, and it'll be interesting to see how she does that job.",

Is it fealty to the executive, which is a co-equal branch of government, or is it guilty to their role for advice and consent as United States senators?But I do want to say on Elise Stefanik, she os a former colleague and a friend. I think she's an exceptional choice for this role. She would be credible and competent in any number of positions of the administration, but I think she's particularly well-suited for U.N. Ambassador. Recall her fight against anti-Semitism on college campuses. That went viral. I think she is going to be a forceful voice for America's interests there in New York with both allies and adversaries. ACOSTA:  But, Sarah, on the recess appointment issue, I mean, this is a way for Donald Trump -- we saw this in the first Trump administration, to sort of skirt Senate confirmation to get the kind of people he wants in the administration to be in those very important positions.",

And it comes as Ukraine faces uncertainty over future support from President-elect Donald Trump.Joining me now is former NATO Supreme Allied Commander General Wesley Clark. General, what do you make of this, I mean, pretty big surge and these drone strikes going back and forth? And what do you expect moving forward now that Trump has won? GEN. WESLEY CLARK (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST:  Well, I think that you're going to see an intensification of the combat by both parties simply because if you're going into negotiations, you want the most favorable battlefield situation, and that includes the drone strikes. So, I think it's going to intensify certainly in the near term. President Trump is going to have to work with Mr. Putin. And the thing is that it's one thing to get elected and say what you have to say to get elected, but how President Trump decides on the Ukraine policy will have a lot to do with how he's perceived by people all over the world, his contemporaries and so forth, like Xi Jinping and President Erdogan and President Sisi and MBS and Saudi Arabia. They're looking to see strength. If he comes in and concedes everything that Russia wants, he's going to look weak in front of everybody in the world. And in addition to that, of course, if he gives up on Europe, he loses the key bargaining chip in terms of managing China. China wants Europe. They want their technology. They want their investment. Russia wants Europe. And so unlike the 19th century, when people were scrambling for colonies in Africa, today, it's really about who has the influence with Europe, who has their investment, who has their technologies. And so I think with President Trump, we might see a different outcome than what people are anticipating.",
