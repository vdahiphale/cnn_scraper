It could be the legislature, in the case of an elected member of Congress. Each house has the ability to judge the qualifications of their members, or if it's outside the situation of Congress, it would be whatever Congress enacts.So, when it was the writs of quo warranto, each federal prosecutor had the authority to bring a quo warranto writ against an incumbent official and seek his ouster from office under Section 3, but it was still subject to that amnesty provision in Section 3 of the 14th Amendment. So, we do acknowledge the tension, but we don't think that's an insurmountable obstacle -- SAMUEL ALITO, U.S. ASSOCIATE SUPREME COURT JUSTICE:  I don't think you can see why there's a tension. If you analogize the lifting by Congress of the disqualification by a two-thirds vote to a pardon, then surely one would not argue that the fact that the president or a governor can pardon someone from a criminal conviction or a criminal offense means that the person couldn't be prosecuted in the first place for the criminal offense.",

But the Commission's Clause, I think, is the strongest because it says the president shall, you know, commission all the officers of the United States. Shall is mandatory. All is all encompassing. And the president doesn't commission himself and he can't commission himself. So, that's one of the first problems.I think the Anderson litigants are trying to say, you know, there's somehow an implied exception there because the President, obviously, can't commission himself, so we should construe that to mean all officers of the United States besides the President. But you also have members of Congress who are not commissioned by the President, and that's because they're not officers of the United States. So, the only sensible distinction that we can see, given the language of the Commission's Clause, is that officers of the United States are appointed officials, and elected officials, such as members of Congress, and the president, and the vice president are not. And the Impeachment Clause reinforces that the president, the vice president, and all civil officers of the United States shall be removed from office upon impeachment for and conviction of hall high crimes and misdemeanors. The president and the vice president are listed separately from officers of the United States. And then of course, the Appointments Clause, we know the president is not appointed pursuant to Article II, neither is the vice president, neither are members of Congress. So, they can't be officers either.",

That could be evidence, as you say, of the original public meeting, at least some evidence. It's a precedent, although not binding. But your point then is it's reinforced because Congress itself relies on that precedent in the Enforcement Act of 1870 and forms the backdrop against which Congress does legislate.And then as Justice Alito says, the historical practice for 155 years has been that that's the way it's gone. There hasn't -- there haven't been state attempts to enforce disqualification under Section 3 against federal officers in the years since. So, whether that's a Federalist 37 liquidation argument, it all reinforces what happened back in 1868, 1869, and 1870.",
