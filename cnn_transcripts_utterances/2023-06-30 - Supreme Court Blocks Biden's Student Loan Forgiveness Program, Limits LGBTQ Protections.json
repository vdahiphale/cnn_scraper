And Christina, just looking at some of the statements coming in from top Republicans on this, John Thune putting out a statement, and I'm seeing the way he's talking about it is very similar to the other Republican reaction coming from Capitol Hill is talking about the plan that Biden had put forward, was an unserious scheme to force 87 percent of Americans who do not have student loan debt to bear the costs of the 13 percent of Americans who do so.He says anyone frustrated by today's decision should direct their complaints to the White House, where they knew this executive order would likely be struck down by the courts, but they did nothing whatsoever to meaningfully address exorbitant costs in higher education, and the exorbitant costs in higher education is something that we've talked about so many times whenever this has come up, because this is the way that I often described as is any of these efforts is really just a band aid over a gaping wound, which is the cost of higher education is too high.",

There's really nowhere in the economy where you've seen inflation for something that is so necessary for so many people to enter the middle class that inflation is almost it just runaway inflation in terms of the cost of college.So that is definitely an underlying problem. But I think it's interesting, some of the other responses from Republicans, and there are Democrats, too, who agree, they just kind of don't understand the fairness of, you know, I sent my kid to a state school because that's what we could afford. So why as a taxpayer, am I, you know, am I subsidizing someone else who maybe got a major that was very expensive, and an industry that doesn't, you know, have a lot of jobs? Like, what how should taxpayers subsidize the choices people are making? It's also the only thing you guys and I've covered this for years, it's the only debt that we allow people to take on without judging whether they have the ability to pay it back, right, you can just get as much of this debt as you want. And so we need to do a better job on the front end of not only the cost of college, but understanding how much it's going to cost to pay for it.",

Let's just remind people where we are this morning and everything that's just happened in the last hour, the Supreme Court has issued two major decisions. The first one from Colorado has to do with a wedding website designer, the court ruled she does not have to design websites for same sex marriages.They rule that her first amendment rights would be violated by forcing her to do so you cannot be forced, the court says, to engage in expressive activity, if you do not believe in it. And then the other ruling, which we were just talking about, the Supreme Court, just flat out overthrew President Biden's student loan forgiveness program.

What these days, this week also shows and the tension has an impact inside of that courtroom, maybe create some discomfort there. What the court rules has an impact around the entire country. And what we have now seen by six-three margins, is the judicial ideology of this court firmly stated. One law professor told me last night, we are now in a YOLO Supreme Court and you only live once Supreme Court moment, which for conservatives, they are rejoicing.And obviously, for liberals, they are not. But this is a moment where conservatives are getting what they want on major, major issues, starting from Dobbs to affirmative action and now to today.",

      "sentences": "I think it's an important moment to stop and sort of reflect on where we are with the Supreme Court. This is the end of the term by the way. This will be the last of the full decisions, there may be emergency decisions. This term gave us a couple of really surprising cross ideological opinions, particularly in the area of voting rights, where we had in one case, Justice -- Chief Justice Roberts, along with Justices Kavanaugh and Barrett and another case, those two minus Barrett coming over joining with the liberals, first to uphold a key provision of the Voting Rights Act.And then just earlier this week to reject this sort of really radical what we call independent state legislature theory. However, we had a healthy portion of sort of predictable ideology line six to three decisions. We had the affirmative action decision yesterday. We have the two today. We also had a series of cases involving religious freedom and first amendment rights, sometimes pitted against anti- discrimination laws that almost uniformly went in favor of First Amendment and religious rights. The other thing that I think is worth reflecting on is just how much power we give Supreme Court justices. These justices outlast presidency, after presidency. Justice Clarence Thomas, longest serving member of the court. He was confirmed in 1991. He has now served during six different presidencies, right, Bush, Clinton, Bush, Obama, Trump, Biden. And so it's worth remembering this when these vacancies come up, in some respects, they have -- these Supreme Court justices possess more power than any other person in our government. And we're reminded of that now.",

And it's the amount of power that the court is claiming to insert itself into basically every kind of decision in American life. I mean, let's just take the two cases from today. You know, the decision in the Colorado website case now means that any business owner anywhere in the country can at least try to defend exclusionary behavior on the ground that what they do is expressive, that's going to open the floodgates to first potentially misbehavior by businesses and second, a ton of litigation.But also don't sleep on the student loan case, like whatever folks think of the student loan program, as such, by allowing Missouri to challenge it, and by applying this major questions doctrine does strike it down. What the Supreme Court is really doing is it's transferring power from the political branches to the courts, because now any federal district judge anywhere in the country can look at any federal policy, and say, I believe this is a program of quote, vast political or economic significance. What isn't? And I don't think Congress has acted specifically enough to authorize it. Guys, it's open seats it. Now when it comes to federal programs, not just new and controversial ones, like the student loan program, but long standing ones like Medicare. And I think that's a really remarkable moment for this court at this juncture to be in, to be taking all of this power, guys, not just for itself, but for the federal judiciary writ large.",

      "sentences": "Well, taken collectively, this notion that precedent is a long standing tradition by which we can order all of our lives really is now gone. The idea that you expect to have when a Supreme Court rules on a case that it will have a foundational and transformational impact, that's long lasting really is no more. As Steve alluded to, the Open Season aspect on certain areas of the law in questions, it really means that many things perhaps we all took for granted as sacrosanct, as things that would be able to order our lives around might no longer be the case.And that's very, very concerning for so many people have come to rely on the way we legislate as a result of Supreme Court authority and opinions, how people conduct admissions operations, how people also are able to at the state level enact and implement laws that they believe to be in line with prior Supreme Court precedent. All of these things are really being transformed. And we find ourselves after many years are talking about the wild, wild west, or things of a novel moment, or uncharted territory. Never did many people think that would be with the Supreme Court. And yet, here we are. And I'll say when you think about all of this, collectively, how often we've heard this term are from the Supreme Court to suggest or is there some line that's included in a written opinion that says, by the way, nothing we've said here should be construed to mean the opposite of what we're saying here or involve and invoke other aspects of our society in life. That caveat that is always there is a blaring reminder, essentially saying, look, everything we are saying we are aware, will be construed, may be construed, might be construed in the long run, to try to subvert some other principle. And so here we are, in a kind of novel territory, wondering what precedent will really mean, and what's the next to potentially be on the chopping block. Now, the Supreme Court, of course, has done itself no favors in the grand scheme of things of trying to ensure they are viewed as completely apolitical. And yet we have a vested interest societally to have the Supreme Court of United States, you know, enrobed, as they are to be above politics, and oftentimes above the type of reproach or accountability that leaving the lower courts of the same branch and Article Three courts experience. And so we have a bit of a reckoning on the way in terms of how the political body views the court, how litigants view the court, how the society will view the court and how lower courts will now structure their opinions in line with this.",

When they weigh in on something, it changes things for a long time, and they are big things, by definition. And Steve Vladeck, because you watched this so closely, I'm not throwing you a curveball, but based on all the big items that the court has ruled on, in the last, you know, 14 months at this point, if you are a conservative, you're in the federal society, you know, what's left on your wish list here because you're getting a lot of what you want so far.",
