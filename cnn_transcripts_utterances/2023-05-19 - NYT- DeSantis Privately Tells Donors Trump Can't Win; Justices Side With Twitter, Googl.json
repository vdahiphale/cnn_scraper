Ron DeSantis -- how he sees the 2024 race playing out as he is expected to enter it himself in just a few days from now, making it official.According to The New York Times, Gov. DeSantis told donors on a call yesterday that he believes there are only three credible candidates, adding -- and I'm quoting the Florida governor now -- \"I think of those two -- those three. Two have a chance to get elected president -- Biden and me -- based on all the data in the swing states, which is not great for the former president and probably insurmountable because people aren't going to change their view of him.\" Sources tell CNN that DeSantis is expected to file his presidential campaign paperwork next week. His plans to defeat Donald Trump run to the right of him when it comes to abortion, guns, transgender rights. This week, he responded to the former president's criticism that Florida's new abortion restrictions were too tough. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV. RON DESANTIS, (R) FLORIDA:  I signed the bill. I was proud to do it. He won't answer whether he would sign it or not. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Disney scrapped its plans to build a billion- dollar office complex in central Florida, citing challenging business conditions. They didn't name DeSantis directly but this will cost the state of Florida 2,000 white-collar jobs. A spokesperson for DeSantis said it was unsurprising that Disney would cancel the project saying, quote, \"?iven the company's financial straits, failing market cap, and declining stock price.\" Now, President -- former President Trump's campaign put out a statement arguing that DeSantis, quote, \"Single-handedly lost Florida more than 2,000 jobs.\" Former Vice President Mike Pence, who is also eyeing a 2024 run, weighed in.
