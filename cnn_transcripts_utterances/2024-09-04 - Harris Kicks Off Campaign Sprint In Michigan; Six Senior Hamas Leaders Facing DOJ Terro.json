It shows Harris leading Trump 48 percent to 43 percent. A reminder, of course, Donald Trump won Michigan in 2016 narrowly, but President Biden flipped it back in 2020.And joining me now are two Michigan experts. Jonathan Oosting, the deputy editor for Bridge Michigan, and Zoe Clark, the political director and co-host of \"It's Just Politics\" on Michigan Public Radio. Welcome to both of you. I'm so grateful to have you this morning. Of course, one of the people that we talk to a lot on this show and I'm sure you all are very familiar with as well is Debbie Dingell, the congresswoman who, of course, tried to warn the Hillary Clinton campaign in 2016 that Michigan could potentially go for Donald Trump. She will say no one listened. Of course, Trump won that time. I kind of want to get the perspective from both of you. Jonathan, let me start with you in terms of what you are seeing on the ground in Michigan. We obviously have this new poll that shows Harris with a lead here. There obviously have been things that have changed since Biden was defenestrated from the top of the ticket. Does this polling line up with what you know, Jonathan, in reporting and what you're seeing on the ground, or what else would you have us know? JONATHAN OOSTING, DEPUTY EDITOR, BRIDGE MICHIGAN (via Webex by Cisco): Well, you know, I think there's some other polling that suggests it's a closer race. But either way, I think pretty much everybody agrees this race is very close in Michigan right now. I think we've -- it's been a remarkable campaign, right? There's been an assassination attempt, a criminal conviction. But for a lot of voters we've been talking to the economy is still a very, very big issue. We -- we're out in mid-Michigan this week talking to voters there and a lot of folks talked about yeah, inflation has technically gone down but the cost of everyday goods is still very high. And they are sort of on the fence. I mean, I think this election could come down to, again, what we've thought all along. The economy versus Kamala Harris saying she'll offer a more stable hand. A lot of voters talk about the importance of democracy to them, and that's one thing that Kamala Harris certainly has in her favor. But the economic anxiety is still very real here in Michigan.",

      "sentences": "Yeah.Zoe, to pick up on that -- I mean, one of the other things that we are seeing in our poll is that enthusiasm is up among Democrats in particular, in Michigan, and that may help explain why Harris seems to be doing better here. That the base, basically, is coming home. They weren't sure about Joe Biden. She will need as much of that as possible to stand up to what Jonathan was just explaining. In your reporting and kind of understanding, and your conversations with Michiganders across the state, how are you understanding these dynamics, and where do you think the race stands right now? ZOE CLARK, POLITICAL DIRECTOR AND CO-HOST, IT'S JUST POLITICS, MICHIGAN PUBLIC RADIO (via Webex by Cisco):  Yeah. Well, I'll start with the latter first, which as Jonathan said, it is close, right? I mean, the one thing we can say is it is a lot closer than it was when Biden was at the top of the ticket, right? That Kamala Harris, to your point, has really enthused voters whereas Donald Trump time and time again in the polls earlier in this race was above. It is all going to be about turnout for Democrats here in Michigan. When Democrats turn out -- when more voters turn out in Michigan Democrats win. And so this enthusiasm is really important. You know, Donald Trump has a low ceiling, meaning his base is his base and they're going to turn out. But there's not a lot of room for growth. What we're seeing with Kamala Harris here in Michigan, particularly in a city like Detroit, is enthusiasm. If they can get that to be turnout it's really what could make the race here in Michigan.",

      "sentences": "Well, obviously, Republicans are trying to poke the nest there and rile up folks who might be unclear where Kamala Harris exactly stands compared to Joe Biden. But look, it's a real issue for Kamala Harris. She wouldn't have met with Arab American leaders last time she visited Michigan -- or two times ago, sorry -- if she didn't think it was serious.I mean -- you know, in the -- in the grand scheme of things it was about 100,000 votes in the primary that went uncommitted. That's not a huge number. But Michigan has been decided by closer margins. Less than 11,000 votes decided the race in 2016 when Donald Trump won Michigan. So it is an issue. Harris, of course, is more nuanced than that ad would let you believe but she hasn't done what the uncommitted leaders, at least, have publicly stated they want, which is to call for an arms embargo on Israel. She hasn't done that. And so it's going to remain an issue for her unless things change materially in that conflict or his position. HUNT:  Interesting. Zoe, can I ask you when you look at the map -- when you think about -- you were talking about some of the different groups in Michigan. Is there either a location -- you know, a Grand Rapids or a Detroit suburbs, or an Ann Arbor that you're looking at in terms of helping to decide this, or a group of voters? Is it going to be those UAW halls again outside Detroit? Is it going to be young, Black men who maybe are voting for Donald Trump in larger numbers? Where are you looking that we in the national media may not be seeing because we're not as close to this as you are?",

You know, one of the things that she's very focused on is labor because these were folks who in '16 helped Donald Trump win in Michigan. I often like to say it wasn't so much that Donald Trump won Michigan in '16, but Hillary Clinton lost, right? And so in '16, some of these labor workers who tended to go back to Bill Clinton went to Trump. Then in 2020, they went back to Biden. Harris has some work to do, which I think is exactly why saw her meeting with labor on Monday doing what many former presidents have done. Barack Obama was here in Detroit on Labor Day really firing up this base. You know, labor leaders tend to go Democratic but labor workers -- that is something she's going to need to watch.",

DAVID SANGER, CNN POLITICAL AND NATIONAL SECURITY ANALYST, AUTHOR, \"NEW COLD WARS\" (via Webex by Cisco):  Well, Kasie, good morning, and thanks for having me on. Yeah, the tragedy that started over the weekend with the execution of these six hostages now is having its predictable political effects. I mean, even before that moment the families of the more than 100 Israelis who have been hostage -- and there are a small group of Americans among that -- among that number all were saying, or many were saying that they believe that of the many priorities that Prime Minister Netanyahu laid out, releasing the hostages wasn't the top of close to the top. That, in fact, he was trying to extend the war and use the line that he had to completely defeat Hamas -- not entirely clear what that means -- in order to make that the chief priority. And, of course, they believe that is because he's trying to extend his time in office and avoid prosecution on completely unrelated charges. A trial that's been in a ban since he's been prime minister. And so that's the dynamic underway. What's really hurting him is that his own defense minister has charged that he is putting the hostage -- that Netanyahu is putting the hostage agreement on the back burner for no apparent reason other than this commitment to total victory.",

Making sure that no one in the New York State government talked in a positive way, or at least from the senior members, about Chinese dissidents or dissident groups. So basically, what they were -- if you believe the indictment, what they were seeking to do was try to extend the repression that -- of free speech that is taking place across Xi Jinping' China into New York State.
