More than 30 other people were injured, and video shows the extensive damage left behind. State media reports that investigators have been questioning everyone who was inside the cafe at the time.

The secretary called for his immediate release. Secretary Blinken further urged the Kremlin to immediately release wrongfully detained U.S. citizen Paul Whelan.\" Paul Whelan has -- is in the process of serving a 16-year sentence after facing espionage charges in Russia. Gershkovich is also facing espionage charges, something that the White House and his employer, \"The Wall Street Journal,\" say simply just is not accurate.

Once again, President Tsai praised the Guatemalan government for its support to her country, saying that Taiwan will continue to cooperate and provide assistance to its democratic partners around the world. President Giammattei reiterated his country's support for Taiwan. \"I reaffirm before you the unconditional commitment that Guatemala, as an essential part of its foreign policy, will continue to support the recognition of Taiwan's sovereignty,\" he said. President Giammattei went even further at a public event Saturday when he reiterated that Taiwan is, in his words, \"an independent nation and the only true China,\" with which Guatemala shares democratic values, mutual respect and fraternal ties. Tsai's visit to Central America happened only a week after Honduras, another Central American country, broke diplomatic relations with Taiwan after 80 years just before forging a new alliance with China. Now Taiwan has only 13 diplomatic partners, mainly small countries in Latin America and the Caribbean. On Friday, a Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman said that the one- China policy should be accepted worldwide, adding that she hopes Guatemala makes the right decision to stop supporting Taiwan in the near future.

Mr. Netanyahu's cabinet did not say who would run the new force. That will be determined by a committee in the next 90 days. The guard would be charged with dealing with, quote, \"emergency situations,\" but the guard proposal has already set off protests in several cities. Critics fear it would target Israeli Arabs and, Ben-Gvir controls it, it could become an extremist private militia. Former prime minister, Ehud Barak, calls it a, quote, \"lunatic step,\" given Ben Gvir's history of inciting racism and supporting terrorism. Israel's judicial reform was put on hold amid raging protests by critics who fear it would undermine the country's democracy. Among them, Israeli veterans, a revered group in Israeli society. CNN's Hadas Gold spoke with one of their leaders about why he and his fellow former soldiers have taken to the streets. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) HADAS GOLD, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Yiftach Golov (ph) may look like one of the hundreds of thousands of Israeli protesters, but a special forces veteran from the Second Intifada, injured on the front lines, he now helps lead a group of Israeli veterans, Brothers and Sisters in Arms, who've become a backbone of the protest movement against the Israeli government's planned judicial overhaul.",
