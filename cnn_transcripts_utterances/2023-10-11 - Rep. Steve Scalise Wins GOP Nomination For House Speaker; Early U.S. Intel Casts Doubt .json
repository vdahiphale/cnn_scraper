I think anytime that you could use something quickly on the Hill, it avoids the lack of uncertainty and the unknown.I do think one thing that also has happened really in the last few moments is Jim Jordan, who's the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, who will go on to keep doing his job in the impeachment inquiry under things, he says that he will support Steve Scalise. That's a very important development. The question is, will all of the 99 people who voted for him will? My guess is most of them will. This is probably a moment where cooler heads will prevail. Except they have seen that one or two members can spoil things. So what is happening now is looking for specific deals. Looking for specific extractions potentially from Steve Scalise. But I think we should just take back -- step back for a moment. Former President Donald Trump, he endorsed Jim Jordan. He did not win. So what is the former president going to do with this? My guess is he has an OK relationship with Steve Scalise. Steve Scalise certainly is plenty Trumpy enough if you want to use that expression. So my guess is this moves forward. It will just take a day. But uncertainty on Capitol Hill, the measure of time usually is not helpful for things.",

Did Iran know something in advance and when did they know it?That's a question high-level officials in the U.S. and Israel, and elsewhere, have been scrambling to try to answer. Whether or not Iran played a role in planning or approving the sophisticated terror attacks that took place here, starting Saturday morning, launched by Hamas against Israel. We are now hearing some conflicting assessments at this stage. And it is pretty early in this whole process. I want to bring in CNN's Alex Marquardt and Matthew Chance to try to walk us through what we have learned and what they are hearing from various sources. Alex Marquardt, let's start off with you. What are you hearing from sources about the U.S. intelligence community's assessment?",

It has provided long-standing support, weapons, political backing to the Hamas militant group in Gaza. But it's a question of how much direct influence they had, how much direct commitment they had to this appalling operation that killed so many Israelis. And what this Israeli official that I spoke to told me -- and he's somebody who's familiar with the latest Israeli intelligence -- is that he felt, he said, that Israeli intelligence had thought that Iran essentially greenlighted this operation. They didn't know about the timing, they didn't know it was going to cause perhaps such tragic consequences with so many Israelis killed, but they were aware that the operation was in the planning stage and they greenlighted it in that sense. They green lighted the concept of it. And that's slightly different to having no direct involvement at all, but not as much as saying look, Iran orchestrated this as the puppet master for Hamas. They were involved. Perhaps they didn't know the appalling consequences of this operation and the geopolitical impact it was going to have, but they knew it was in the planning stage.",

We are told by intelligence officials there was a certain level of surprise among senior Iranian officials about this attack.But to Matthew's point, that could be surprise about the timing. That could be surprise about the barbarity. When you talk to former officials, Iran's M.O. when it comes to Hamas and Hezbollah in the north, is essentially to create these proxies. To give them the funding, the resources they need, the power they need, the equipment they need to operate in the geography and a shared understanding of what they're supposed to do, and in both those cases, Hamas and Hezbollah's, to attack Israel. So there isn't necessarily a need for Iran to be aware of everything and on top of everything because it's understood that Iran is giving Hamas that support so they can go after Israel -- Anderson?",

Obviously, more than 200 million -- excuse me, more than two million people live in Gaza. Egypt, the border on the south, has always been very resistant to allowing Gazans to leave and go into Egypt. Is that the only option? And do you think they can come to some sort of agreement to allow, you know, whether it's small numbers of Gazan citizens every day to leave along with American citizens in Gaza?

There are bad options and there are worse options.And the reality that Israel and its supporters, led by us, are looking at is the fact that if they launch a major operation into Gaza, what about the hostages? Hamas has already said they'd start killing them and may have already done so in a most horrific way. So we've got to try to factor that in. What can be done to ensure that the hostages, Americans among them, are not summarily executed? The Egypt option for the broader population I think is the only option that is possible. It is just politically unthinkable, frankly, right now to imagine that Israel could take Gazan civilians in on their territory. So I hope very much -- I'm sure we're working overtime on this. We will get the Egyptians to agree to that. We're going to need to get the United Nations involved in setting up very swiftly some large camp areas. But I think that is very, very important. And I think that also is the -- really the only way forward to deal as well with the hostage situation, to find a way to signal to Hamas that if they start killing hostages, Israeli or American, that it is ready to go for them from bad to worse. As you mentioned earlier, I think we've now got our top diplomat on his way to Israel. We also have a carrier strike group heading to the eastern Med. And back in the day, I would refer to an aircraft carrier as 100,000 tons of diplomacy. That is the muscle that goes along with the politics on this for anyone who might be thinking of escalating this, particularly I would say Iran. But it really is the problem from hell, how Israel cannot cede the moral high ground that Hamas has really given them by inflicting what the world would see as huge suffering on the Gaza population.
