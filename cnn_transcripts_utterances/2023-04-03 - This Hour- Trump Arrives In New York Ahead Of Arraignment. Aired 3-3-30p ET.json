That is where he is going to deliver a speech from Mar-A-Lago, we are told, tomorrow night. Here with me in Manhattan as we await Trump's arrival is CNN's Chief National Affairs Correspondent, Jeff Zeleny, and CNN Political Director, David Chalian, both joining me here live. Thank you both for being here. One thing that I have been thinking about as Trump is on his way here, he's already launched these attacks. He's been going after the District Attorney Alvin Bragg here, there's no surprise there. They are also going after the judge, though. And Cy Vance, who was the former Manhattan district attorney was saying yesterday that Trump needed to be careful essentially of potentially committing another criminal offense by going after and lashing out at these officials, including the judge he is going to be arraigned before tomorrow.",

So I would be very surprised if there are any outbursts in the courtroom or anything here in New York. He's saving it, of course, when he gives his speech when he returns to Mar-A-Lago on Tuesday. But this is a very different moment for Donald Trump, so much history in Trump Tower behind us here where he announced his presidential campaign in the summer of 2015. Of course, he's now a Florida resident, but tomorrow he is a - someone who's in a legal proceeding. So that is sort of different than the Donald Trump we've seen.",

Now, something we were talking about a little bit earlier in the program was this idea of delay and the former president being able to use delay to his advantage and has in the past. Now, maybe that's the case, but right now, as a litigant, he has the right to challenge aspects of the case.So number one, he may - they may file a motion to change the venue of the trial saying, this defendant at this time cannot get a fair trial from this bias prosecutor in New York City, from this jury pool that's tainted, we have to move it somewhere else, that's going to get dismissed, right? It's just - he's not going to win that and it's just highly unlikely. They may challenge aspects of the indictment. So for instance this - if it involves federal campaign finance charges, saying, well, look, this is a state prosecution. This ought not be here or any other matters. The publicity or the politicization of challenging the prosecutor himself. So any of these things are motions that he can file, he's probably not going to win most of them, because the law presumes that jurors and courts and prosecutors will behave in a fair manner, but he has that right. Now, in terms of - to your question, Phil, about timing, New York is pretty notorious for taking a long time to go from indictment to trial, and it can take up to a year to get something in court. And I would anticipate that you're going to see that amount of time both because of the fact it's a normal trial, but also you can expect this defendant to file a lot of motions to slow things down.",

And I do think that it's very easy to - because so many scandals sort of get brushed away in hurricane Trump land, it's hard for us to look at any one particular one and see the kind of greater concern there. But for people at home, this is something to think about. There is a reason why there are campaign finance laws, there are reason why there's campaign fraud laws. And it's because we want you to have the best truthful information you can get going into the ballot. And if you have manipulation of that process, then that's something that the law does take seriously. Now, with that being said, the bar is really high, right, for this prosecutor to make his case.

I don't know if there was some kind of a fight here or something, but it just - I think the point that I want to make here is just to show you how on edge some of the folks here are and keeping an eye on everything.You can see more police officers here moving in. This has sort of been a gathering spot here. They've just - it looks like they've just arrested someone here, Kaitlan. We don't really know why. But this is sort of in the area where many of the protesters and supporters of Trump have been gathering, but this is the first time that we've seen anyone actually being arrested. We don't know why. But it was really interesting to watch because something was going on and then all of a sudden, the court officers offices here jumped over these barricades and ran over here and just took that that man into custody. But I think the reason why I'm showing you this just to show you kind of some of the security measures that are in place here, the sensitivity and certainly just how on alert the officers are here. As I said there are NYPD officers here and all of these court officers and clearly they saw something Kaitlan and they jumped over this way.",

I just want to note for viewers we are seeing for President Trump's plane land here at LaGuardia Airport in New York. That is his flight that he was taking before he is going to make his way over here to Trump Tower, Phil and Dana, before he is going to be arraigned tomorrow.That, of course, is a flight that they had been planning. The logistics of this had been certainly a big aspect. And we know we had heard that initially when that indictment came down last Thursday, they wanted Trump to appear in a courthouse in a courtroom the following Friday, but they said they needed more time to work on the logistics of what exactly this was going to look like. So while there are still a lot of unknowns, there has been a lot of planning behind the scenes when it comes to Trump's legal team and secret service in the New York Police Department into this visit and coordinating this. And so Trump is going to get off that plane as the ex-president, but also as the first former or sitting president to ever have criminal charges facing him. And so - he's not expected to speak while he's here in New York. They've said, of course, those are famous last words, Dana and Fish, we do know he will be speaking tomorrow night.",

So it would not be a surprising thing that he is watching his - himself taxing in New York on TV adds to the sort of surreal notion of this moment.But Donald Trump born and raised in New York, of New York now a resident of the State of Florida back in New York to do something that he spent his - pretty much his entire adult life fighting, which is the legal system as a private citizen, and then as a politician and as president in the way that a president does, but now back being a private citizen, for the first time, getting to the point where he is a man who has been indicted, and he will see what the charges specifically are when he goes to the courtroom and he is booked tomorrow morning - or tomorrow at some point.",
