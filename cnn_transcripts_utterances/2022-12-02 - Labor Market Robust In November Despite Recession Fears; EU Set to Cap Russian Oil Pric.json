And where a better place for us to be tonight than at the National Gallery in Trafalgar Square in London, a perfect place for us to start to get into what is going to be a great evening on QUEST MEANS BUSINESS. The markets, let me show you how now trading at the moment. They are doing virtually nothing, bits and bobs and bits in between is how the Dow is. Little changes, up seven points. It had been very sharply lower as you can see, but it has now rallied back up again. The markets and the main events of the day: US strong wage growth. It is giving a worrying sign for inflation. If wages are going up, can inflation be far behind? Europe is agreeing Russian oil price caps at some $60.00 a barrel. And the World Cup Group Stage is coming to an end. Now, is it going to be Serbia or Switzerland that will proceed? Live from London's National Gallery in Trafalgar Square on Friday. It's December the 2nd. I'm Richard Quest. And in London, I definitely mean business. Good evening. As I say, we are tonight in Trafalgar Square. I suppose you could say QUEST MEANS BUSINESS, Quest means the start of the Holiday season. We are here, and to give you an idea, of course you'll be very familiar with this. There you have the Christmas market, Big Ben off in the distance. There is Nelson on top of his column in the middle and the Christmas tree, which in London always looks a little skinny. But that is the National Christmas Tree in a sense, and that is what we're going to be talking about, not Christmas trees as such, but we're going to be talking about the economy. And we're also here, of course, at one of the world's great art galleries and museums, London's National Gallery, whom we're very grateful for having let us interlope onto their balcony overlooking. We begin tonight, though, with very interesting economic numbers from the United States. The US added some 263K, more than a quarter of a million jobs last month, more than expected even though the unemployment rate stayed steady at 3.7 percent. There were high-profile layoffs in a variety of industries across the board, if you will. You can think of those layoffs rather like this splendid artwork, which is on display here at the National Gallery, The Great Ruston Railway, it is. And so the labor market is very similar. It is chugging along in its own slow way, but reminiscent of many times moving forward, despite hazards on the way. Uncertainty is all around, but it's getting there nonetheless. Matt Egan is with me. Matt, this number is interesting, because what does it suggest when it comes to the next interest rate rise in December, later this month?",

Imean, keep in mind, that would be the fifth straight time of going with 75 basis points, pretty unthinkable. But markets are still leaning towards 50 basis points right now, because Fed officials have signaled that they do want to slow the pace of these hikes because they are moving very quickly right now. But the question is, you know, what is this due to the risk of a recession? Because there is nothing about today's numbers that speaks to an imminent recession, right? We saw across the border demand for hiring. These are really strong numbers. But it does mean that the Fed may have to keep raising interest rates and may have to go higher, and may have to keep them at a high level for longer. And all of that raises the risk of a recession. Not right now, maybe not even in the first half of next year, but perhaps in the second half of 2023 or 2024.",

They've done that with their for three-quarter point hikes. The next stage is the Battle of 2023, get rates to a level you're sure is tight, and then hold them there.

That's what's the term structure is telling us. So part of it is about financial conditions. They've got to be tighter. Part of it is that there is a lot of retained saving from all of that government largess 2020-2021, and even into 2022.

Now, it's all to be adopted on Monday if things go according to plan. That's when new import ban takes effect. It's only going to affect Russians seaborne oil.

Now, as you mentioned, there has been a lot of debate among member nations as to how much was enough. You mentioned Poland, I believe. We heard from Estonia's Foreign Minister today, who said that the intent was right, but the delivery may not have been on target. Earlier, when this discussion began, we heard from Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy who said $30.00 a barrel. So, it is this type of balancing act, but it is one that at the end, they feel that the $60.00 price cap, if you will, it is one that everyone can agree with. It is also getting the approval of the United States.

Ukraine says it's tightening security at all of its embassies and consulates to deal with a wave of suspicious mail (INAUDIBLE) embassies in Europe receive blood-soaked deliveries this week, some contained animal eyes. Ukraine's foreign minister says the packages are meant to intimidate his country. Infowars host Alex Jones has filed for personal bankruptcy in the U.S. The right-wing conspiracy theorist was found liable for claiming the Sandy Hook School shooting was fake. He owes the victim's families more than $1.4 billion. A lawyer for the families has called the bankruptcy filing a cowardly move. Excuse me. Indonesia may outlaw extramarital sex as part of a sweeping Criminal Code reform. The new code would also have been insulting the president or expressing views counter to state ideology or form is expected to pass parliament and would apply to citizens and foreigners alike. And Sir Elton John's very last U.K. performance is going to take place at the famed Glastonbury Festival. The legendary musician will headline the festivals final night.

So, get your abacus out because we need to work out to the final lot going through. We know South Korea's through after they beat Rinaldo's Portugal two-one. There are two games at the moment. Serbia versus Switzerland, Brazil versus Cameroon who are fighting for the last spot. Don Riddell is toasting in Doha. I won't hold that against you, Don, compared to rainy London.

But I have to say, it's highly entertaining. And this is being debated right now, Richard, the next World Cup in four years' time has more teams in it. And the plan is to have groups of three, which means you're not going to have all this drama in the last game. And there's an awful lot of talk now, especially over the last couple of nights, which have been so entertaining that it's going to be a crime if we don't have this kind of setup in the next World Cup in North America and Mexico. So, I think it's a great system. The drama is what we all love, and that's why we enjoy live sport. But it can be a little bit confusing at times. There's no doubt about that.",

They have the Earthshot Prize award ceremony tonight. That is an initiative founded by William to tackle environmental challenges and it is one that will be headlined by singers like Billy Eilish and Ellie Goulding. Now, of course, President Biden's visit coincided with the royals here.
