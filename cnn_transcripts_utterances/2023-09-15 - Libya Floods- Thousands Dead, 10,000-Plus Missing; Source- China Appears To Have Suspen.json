You can see here search-and-rescue teams wading through waist-deep floodwaters, looking for bodies. Because 10,000 people are still unaccounted for. Officials don't expect to find any more survivors at this point. CNN is the only U.S. network on the ground there. We have CNN's Jomana Karadsheh witnessing the devastation firsthand.

      "sentences": "We've all covered wars, natural disasters before, but none of us have seen anything like this.I mean, we drove into Derna late last night. Even during nighttime, in the dark, you could still see the destruction. Now, during the day, this is just utter, utter destruction. And it really feels like you are walking through a war zone. Like massive bombs had gone off here. This is what people here would tell you. You know, you've got several cities along the Libyan coast that were impacted by Storm Daniel, by the flooding over the weekend. But nothing like this, what people are describing here as this catastrophe. What happened in Derna, of course, as you know, are the two dams that burst. You have the floodwaters that swept through the heart of the city, washing out entire buildings, neighborhoods, homes, infrastructure, families, and brought it all down here to the sea, to the Mediterranean. I mean, this is just -- it is very difficult for us to really move the camera around because of the communication issues, the communications that were disrupted in the city. Our connection is not very stable. But looking into the sea, what we see here is people's lives in there. You see homes. You see door frames, windows, furniture, clothes, cars, everything. They are still right now searching for dead bodies, bodies that are still washing up on the shore six days after this tragedy happened. Right now, Libyan officials are saying about 5,000 people have been killed. There are still 10,000 people unaccounted for. Officials we have speaking to say they don't expect to find any more survivors right now. What you've got here, where we are, is all these volunteers from different parts of the country who are working, who are trying to assist in this recovery effort. It is such a tough task. They're telling us they're not equipped to deal with something like this. They don't have the means and capabilities to do this. One young man I was speaking to just a short time ago just describing how people were just tying ropes to themselves and holding each other as they would dive into the sea and start pulling out body after body. This one young man telling me, in one day, he pulled 40 bodies just by himself. Right now, the volunteers here are saying, look, they need heavy equipment. You've got cars that are stuck in there. They don't know how many people are still in there. They are worried there are people still, dead bodies in these cars. And they want support, they want help. They want heavy -- they want divers, they want diving equipment to try and get -- recover as many bodies as they can. They've had some international support. We've seen some teams here on the ground. The Turks were already out on a rubber boat a short time ago. You have helicopters in the air. But it is nowhere near enough. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

      "sentences": "Yes, Jim, our reporting suggests that there are several reasons for this. The first is that, obviously, the U.S. and China have been trying to cool/ease tensions over the last couple months.You saw Joe Biden say last week that he does not want to try to contain China, that he wants to get the relationship back on track. The Chinese have also been showing a willingness to communicate more with the American side. That's part of it, according to the officials we spoke to. But the more specific aspect of this is that Chinese leaders were actually pretty angry about this spy balloon incident. Chinese President Xi Jinping was apparently caught off guard by the fact this balloon actually transited over the continental U.S. And, of course, the diplomatic uproar that ensued. If you'll remember, Secretary of State Antony Blinken was set to visit Beijing around that same time. (CROSSTALK)",

It's just the juice wasn't really worth the squeeze here in terms of getting the surveillance balloon up, having it float over the U.S., causing this uproar. And potentially jeopardizing that relationship over something that potentially wasn't even providing them with very good intelligence.

And so while this may be on hold at this point, and U.S. officials, we should note, have not seen any new launches of these balloons since February, it could always restart.

The alliance that represents the studios and streaming services says it has reached out to the Writers Guild and the two sides both agreed to resume negotiations.

They settled along the southern east coast, preserving their traditions, living in relatively isolated areas. And over the generations, the Gullah/Geechee communities dwindled. One in particular, known as Hogg Hammock, with a population of just dozens, has held onto its culture and has battled over taxes, development and county law. But this week, the enclave on Georgia's Sapelo Island suffered what Geechee descendants say could erase their culture. The McIntosh County Board approved in a three to two vote to increase the maximum size of homes from 1,400 to 3,000 square feet. The decision, the Gullah/Geechee say, will usher in vacation homes and force out many on fixed incomes in the Hogg Hammock community. Joining us now is Maurice Bailey. He is a local historian. He's also a ninth-generation resident of Hogg Hammock. Maurice, thank you so much for being with us. This is kind of complicated for people not familiar with it. I hope I did it justice explaining it. Tell us your reaction to the zoning change. MAURICE BAILEY, GULLAH/GEECHEE COMMUNITY OF DESCENDANTS OF FREED SLAVES:  Well, I'm not happy with it. It's very discouraging. Not too surprised. The new council is trying to eradicate the population on this island in various ways. It's just another way of them removing us from this community and calling it their own. It's going to be a tough battle, but we're going to continue to fight for this last community. People like my mother and other people have witnessed the loss of other communities throughout the years. This is the last one we have left. But people are tired of fighting.",
