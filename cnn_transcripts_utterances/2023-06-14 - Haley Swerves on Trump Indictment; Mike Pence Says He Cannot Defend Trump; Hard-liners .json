And what they really want is more power, they specifically want more say in the upcoming appropriations process. They want less spending. They want to use those spending bills to go after agencies like the DOJ and FBI.So, that is potentially setting up a huge clash with the Democratic- controlled Senate raising possibility of a government shut down in the fall. And if they don't like what they see, those conservatives, if McCarthy is forced to cut another deal that involves Democrats, they're threatening to use their hardball tactics to not only hold up the floor again, potentially even remove Kevin McCarthy as Speaker. And meanwhile, there is a lot of sour feelings inside the House Republican conference over the House Freedom Caucus and their antics. In fact, there was a heated conference meeting yesterday, where I'm told multiple lawmakers stood up and complained about their Freedom Caucus colleagues and said how unfair it was for them to hold everything hostage. They didn't vote for a week, remember, because of this blockade on the floor. Don Bacon, a Congressman, said it was a bit of a slugging in the room. I'm told there were multiple f-bombs dropped in some of the speeches and then following that meeting, there was another meeting involving the various factions within the party, a group known as the five families, which is a movie reference to \"The Godfather.\" And I want to read you what Congressman Ken Buck told my colleague Annie Grayer about that meeting. He said, it was five families, but I think someone pointed out that four of the families died at the end of the movie. So, I wasn't happy being there. I wasn't sure which family I was in.

Right now, the moderates that won the majority for Kevin McCarthy aren't too happy right now.And I think the other -- so that's a tension that we're going to be watching in the coming weeks and months.

And what we know is that as soon as news of this indictment dropped, the White House already had a very carefully formulated strategy for how they would approach this. And that would be to simply not comment on this.It's important to note that this White House views this as a responsibility of the president, who as the Head of the Executive Branch has oversight over the Justice Department and, therefore, doesn't want to be seen as interfering with its independence. Restoring that independent was, in fact, a key goal for the president when he came into office. But it's also very much a strategy as well, where this White House doesn't want to feed Republican attacks that this is some kind of a politicized prosecution, trying to maintain as much distance as possible. And that has even extended to the Democratic National Committee and the presidential re-election campaign, both of which have been entirely silent on this subject and decided, as you noted, not to fund raise off of this, and that is a deliberate decision.
