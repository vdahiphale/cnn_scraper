I'm Fredricka Whitfield, and we begin with this breaking news.A short time ago in Russia, the last polls closed following a three- day presidential election with no genuine opposition candidates appearing on the ballot, the outcome was never in doubt. Vladimir Putin is expected to win the vote that will keep his grip on power through 2030. He is already Russia's longest-serving ruler since Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin. We've got full coverage for you. CNN's Matthew Chance is in Moscow. Fred Pleitgen is in Berlin, and also with us, CNN contributor and former Moscow bureau chief, Jill Dougherty. Matthew, let's begin with you. Despite the lack of opposition, there were acts of defiance weren't there today?",

      "sentences": "Yes, there have been quite a few actually, but look, I mean, the preliminary results are just coming in and that they're very high, which is expected. We are looking at something in the region of 88 percent votes for Vladimir Putin. That's with about 25 percent of the votes counted and a turnout of well over 70 percent. So these are extraordinary high results, even by the standards of an election of Vladimir Putin.But you're right, it has not been a totally unified and stable election period. There has been a lot of defiance, acts of defiance at polling stations. For instance, across the country with petrol bombs being thrown and paint and ink, and antiseptic dye being put in to voting boxes. That's extraordinary, of course, in a country where public displays of dissent can attract very serious consequences. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) CHANCE (voice over): Another flash of defiance in Russia's presidential vote. The opposition called this Midday Against Putin, supporters gathering at polling stations across the country in a show of solidarity. (ALEXEI NAVALNY speaking in foreign language.) CHANCE (voice over): It is what Alexei Navalny, Russia's late opposition leader had urged before he suddenly died. CHANCE (on camera): Well, the Russian authorities say that anyone who attends an unauthorized protests will be dealt with severely, but you can see its just after 12:00 here in Moscow and a lot of people have turned out at this one polling station to cast their ballots. It is not a protest, but it is an indication of just how many people here are heeding Alexei Navalny's call. Why do you come now to cast your vote?",

In several polling stations, dye was poured into ballot boxes to ruin paper votes already cast. Across Russia, a number of voting centers were hit with arson attacks. Officials insist these deeply flawed presidential elections in which the opposition wasn't even allowed to stand were free and fair. (UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE speaking in foreign language.)

But the defiance of some Russians has also been exceptional, a simmering discontent in the Kremlin's tightly controlled Russia briefly boiling up to the surface. (END VIDEOTAPE) CHANCE (on camera): Well, Fred, the Kremlin have confirmed tonight that we are likely to hear from Vladimir Putin within the next few hours and with the results like the ones that were seeing now coming in, with 88 percent all or thereabouts of the vote, it is likely Vladimir Putin will take this opportunity to claim a mandate for more of his policies.

But Berlin certainly seemed to have one of the largest showings and certainly also some of the most prominent opposition activists are here as well, the most prominent by far, of course, Yulia Navalnaya, the widow of Alexei Navalny. She actually came out and she said she had to stand in line for six hours to be able to vote because there were so many people who are showing up and we were there for large parts of that time, and we certainly did see a lot of people with anti-Putin signs, some of them with pro-Ukrainian gear as well. There were, however, also a lot of pro-Putin voters, one has to say in the crowd that was waiting to also get in. Now, Yulia Navalnaya, after standing in line for a very long time did manage to get in and cast her ballot. And she said that she wrote the surname Navalny on that ballot. And here is why.

He said, I came because I wanted to see other people and I think this is one thing that the opposition wants people to know, that they are not alone, that there are other people in the country who feel the same way they do.And that is very difficult in Russia sometimes because essentially you can't go onto the streets anymore. You cannot protest. You can't like things on social media. You can be arrested very easily for any sign of opposition. And so knowing that there are other people who do not support Putin, actually is significant. It is very hard to measure, obviously, but I think, cumulatively it is an important thing.",

I mean, correct me if I'm wrong on that, but a lot of experts have said, you know, it doesn't seem to influence Putin very much.But Russia's economy remains rather small compared to some of the larger nations.

Long term, they actually are, but they haven't done what they wanted to do or the West wanted to do in the beginning, which was to stop Vladimir Putin from invading another country.But what's happening right now is Putin has put his economy on a war footing. So there are a lot of indications, you know, the economy seems to be doing quite well, or booming. Some of that is actually coming because it is a wartime economy, because people are back in factories making equipment and weapons et cetera, and that increases the economy. But what does it mean in the long run? Some of it -- you obviously have a lot of people who have left the country, educated people, people who are in IT et cetera. You also have a lack of some of the most sophisticated technological supplies that you can imagine that Russia really needs, the high-tech supplies that they could get from the West, which they can't anymore.
