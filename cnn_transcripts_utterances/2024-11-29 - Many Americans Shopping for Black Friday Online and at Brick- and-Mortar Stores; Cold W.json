Yes, because this is really going to impact quite a significant portion of the population. So in terms of travel, the sky is not necessarily going to be as big of an issue this weekend as road travel, especially across portions of the Midwest and the northeast, where lake effect snow is really expected to tick up today and through the weekend. You can already see some of those bands beginning to form right now as the wind really pushes that cold air over across those very warm Great Lakes, at least warm in comparison to the air temperature.But you can start to see the snow bands beginning. They're going to continue to increase, and as we go through the weekend, you can see a lot of these alerts already set in place, the winter storm warnings, winter weather advisories, and even some lake effect snow warnings as well. Some of these locations are expected to pick up significant amounts. The National Weather Service office in Buffalo reporting that some of these areas could see paralyzing amounts of snow. We are talking three to five feet of snow expected to fall over the next several days for areas around Watertown and areas south of Buffalo as we head through the weekend. And that cold air has already come out in portions of the northern tier of the country. Take a look at this. When you take that temperature of zero degrees in Fargo, mix in the wind, that feels like temperature is minus 15 right now, it feels like minus three in Minneapolis, and minus eight in Sioux Falls. That cold air is going to continue to spread south and east over the next several days, really reaching a pretty significant area. In fact, almost 70 percent of the U.S. population is going to see temperatures at or below freezing in the next several days. That reaches even all the way as far south as the gulf coast. Some of these counties here, even in Florida, looking at those freeze alerts in effect. Here's the other thing, too. It's going to be multiple days. This isn't just a one and done for these cold temperatures. So you see Chicago, the normal high right around 29 to 30 degrees. The temperatures are going to be half that through the weekend. But even on Monday as they, quote, warm up, they're only going to get to 18. Atlanta, St. Louis, Washington, D.C., all looking at those incredibly cold temperatures. And for Chicago, look at this.

Good to see you.I just want to pick up with that latest headline there on these Connecticut Congressmembers facing bomb threats. It came -- it comes just a day after some of president-elect's cabinet members, or cabinet appointees were targeted in a similar way. Still more investigating to do all around, but I wonder how you assess sort of this dynamic? JACKIE KUCINICH, WASHINGTON BUREAU CHIEF, \"THE DAILY BEAST\":  Well, you're right. We don't know yet why these threats were made, who made them. However, this is an unfortunate reminder of even though that the presidential campaign and the election is over, the toxic environment that really defined it still remains. And we know that threats over the last couple of years have ticked up against members of Congress, the United States Capitol police released a report in January of this year detailing how many threats that they had to investigate over the course of the last couple years, and it really, it's a reminder that -- and they attributed that to political rhetoric and the heated political rhetoric that has come to define our politics over the past decade or so.",

Now, it really seems like, be it Jeff Bezos or Mark Zuckerberg, they're really trying to make nice with President-elect Trump. They've really extended out a hand. And that's why you see these meetings continue. We'll see if -- you'll never know if these relationships are going to hold with the president-elect.

He and the Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum, just had a phone conversation where he posted that she agreed to stop migration into the United States and close our southern border. She then denied that happened in her own statement about the conversation, saying her country's position is not to close borders.

Well, Australia is now the first country in the world to pass a law prohibiting anyone under the age of 16 from creating a social media account.This follows months of debate and a process that saw the bill introduced, debated and passed in just a single week. There's no date right now for when the ban would take effect. Joining me to discuss is Jonathan Haidt. He's a social psychologist and the author of the book \"The Anxious Generation.\" In the book, he shows how social media has impacted a generation of kids who had access to those accounts at younger and younger ages. Jonathan, it's great to have you with us. So, according to this new law, the onus is on the tech companies here. They have to take, in the words of the law, reasonable steps to prevent underage users from creating these accounts, from accessing social media. The headline is great, Australia says it wants to be a model for the rest of the world. Practically speaking, though, do you see this being enforced?",

In the real world, if the law said -- hey, the drinking age is 18, but, you know, it's up to you parents to keep your kids out of bars. The companies that are making money off your kids, they have no responsibility to enforce the age limit. That's what we have on the internet.And as a result, eight, nine, ten year old children are all over the internet. They're seeing porn. They're seeing horrible things. So yes, it has to be done and it can be done. Scott Galloway here at NYU, he says that the industry could easily do it, but they really don't want to. He says when you pay an industry not to understand something, it will never figure it out. And there are already more than a dozen methods of age verification. So the technology is there.
