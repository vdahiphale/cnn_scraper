I'm Rosemary Church.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is promising his country will go after Hamas like never before following the militant group's unprecedented attack over the weekend. Israeli airstrikes have been pounding Gaza and overnight the military says more than 200 targets were hit. The Israeli Defense Minister has ordered the complete siege of Gaza and will halt the supply of food, fuel and electricity. Rockets are also being launched from Gaza as Hamas warns it would begin killing civilian hostages and broadcasting it if Israel targets people in Gaza without warning. The death toll on both sides continues to climb, including at least 900 people killed in Israel following the assault by Hamas, and nearly 700 killed in Gaza after Israeli airstrikes there. The U.N. Relief and Works Agency says emergency shelters in Gaza are at 90 percent capacity, with more than 137,000 people taking cover. All this, as Israel says, it's adding tens of thousands of additional troops along the border with Lebanon, where an IDF spokesperson describes the situation as volatile. Journalist Elliot Gotkine is following developments for us from London. He joins us now. So Elliot, what is the latest information that you have on this ongoing war?",

And that's what Prime Minister Netanyahu said last night, that Israel will be unleashing on the militants of Hamas inside the Gaza Strip, taking to the airwaves last night to try to rally international support, comparing Hamas to Islamic State.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

No food, no fuel, no water, no electricity going from Israel into the Gaza Strip. And I suppose the idea there is to get the civilian population there to put pressure onto the militants of Hamas to try to release the hostages. Now a couple of things on that note, of course, if Hamas is able to get weaponry, smuggle weapons, bulldozers and all sorts of other equipment into the Gaza Strip, one can only assume that they'll be able to get, you know, fuel and other supplies in there, though clearly not to offset the kind of supplies that they usually get. And it also seems unlikely, certainly at this stage, that there is going to be anything that is going to sway Hamas from its current position, and of course holding on to those hostages, at least dozens of them, according to the Israeli defense forces, and of course using those hostages as leverage to extract concessions, release of Palestinian prisoners. We don't actually have a list of any demands just yet, but clearly they will be making the most of what they will see as incredibly valuable assets. Rosemary?",

The Israeli ambassador to the U.N. estimates up to 150 hostages have been captured by Hamas fighters. Some of them were captured at a music festival over the weekend, others are soldiers, and some are children. A Hamas spokesperson announced on Monday in a video message, they will not negotiate hostage release while under Israeli fire. And I spoke just a few minutes ago Major Libby Weiss, spokesperson for the Israel Defense Forces. And I began by asking her, what are the latest updates now, three days after the Hamas incursion into Israel. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MAJ. LIBBY WEISS, ISRAEL DEFENSE FORCES SPOKESPERSON: We are now in the third day of this national tragedy following the Hamas massacre on Saturday morning. The situation is a very dynamic one that is changing constantly. We right now are at more than 900 Israeli casualties from the attack on Saturday. Thousands of injured and of course the dozens of hostages who were kidnapped into the Gaza Strip. The situation along the border with Gaza in those civilian communities appears to be more controlled than in previous days. But of course, the IDF is working constantly to make sure that there are no Hamas terrorists still operating within Israeli territory.",

How can you reconcile that? WEISSnon-military, we are all devastated by this hostage situation. Our thoughts are with the families and with the innocent civilians who are kidnapped and who knows what is happening to them right now in Gaza. And we are thinking about them constantly. The situation is a very, very complex one. But the IDF strikes are on Hamas military targets. That is the purpose of those strikes. The situation is a complex one much because of what Hamas has done in the Gaza Strip over the last decade and what they continue to do but the situation is a is certainly a very challenging one and our Focus and thoughts are always with those hostages with those civilians' children, women, the elderly, people who have nothing to do with this kind of conflict and our thoughts are with them constantly.",

I would not be able to imagine that anywhere in the world would be able to live with this kind of reality. Hamas is a terror organization that committed a massacre of historic proportions against Israeli civilians.

And we heard yesterday initially from a European Commission official saying that funds aid towards -- going towards Palestinians would be suspended in response to the Saturday's attack by Hamas on Israel. But as you said mentioned there, this has since been walked back by the European Union. We've heard from European Union officials in a statement saying that humanitarian funds for Palestinians will not be suspended. Now there is a review ongoing into the overall program of E.U. support and E.U. funding for Palestinians but crucial aid that Palestinians, many of them across the board, particularly those in Gaza are so dependent on will continue according to the European Union as long as it is needed.And this will come as a relief of course for many given the fact that we heard yesterday from the Israeli defense minister who announced a complete siege on Gaza meaning no food, no fuel and no electricity going into Gaza and that of course has been condemned by the United Nations.

Now CNN is learning from senior defense officials that the Biden administration will surge support with a particular focus on air defenses and ammunition.Now as we understand it from U.S. officials there are still discussions ongoing around the particular needs of Israel when it comes to air defenses. Unclear where those talks stand at this current stage but it was previously understood that Israel had requested interceptors for its Iron Dome air defense system. Now of course that Iron Dome air defense system has proven crucial in defending Israel against rockets fired by Hamas from Gaza for many years now. But it's not just on the military front that the U.S. has pledged support. We've also heard from defense officials who have said that the U.S. will be providing crucial support with ongoing efforts by Israel to locate and rescue Israeli citizens held hostage and captive by Hamas inside Gaza. Now according to officials, that support will not come in the form of U.S. boots on the ground, but rather will be in the form of surveillance, reconnaissance and intelligence support by U.S. agencies and of course while it is unclear at this stage according to the IDF just how many Israeli citizens have been taken hostage. We have heard from the Israeli ambassador to the United Nations who said it is believed that between 100 and 150 Israeli citizens are currently being held hostage in Gaza and there is real concern for their safety. Not only their safety in terms of being caught up in the crossfire of Israeli airstrikes on Gaza but of course their fate at the hands of their Hamas captors. We've heard those warnings yesterday from Hamas saying that if Israel continues to strike civilian areas in Gaza without warning, Hamas will begin executing Israeli citizens held hostage and that they will not engage in any negotiations or talks around the hostage situation while Gaza is still under fire.",

It has not reversed Monday's gains, though, so I think you can say that there's still a bit of a premium on the price because of this risk. We're also watching natural gas because Chevron said on Monday that the Israeli authorities had asked it to shut down one of its gas fields in the eastern Mediterranean, supplying some 70 percent of the gas that Israel uses for power generation. That sent European gas prices up some 12 percent on Monday. They're up again this morning some 5 percent. So we're keeping an eye on that. Chevron says it is still able to supply its Israeli customers through another gas field. And finally, Rosemary, the Israeli currency, the Shekel, also not reversing its losses. It's down slightly this morning. against the dollar. That comes despite unprecedented action by the central bank coming in with a 45 billion dollar program to try to stabilize the currency.
