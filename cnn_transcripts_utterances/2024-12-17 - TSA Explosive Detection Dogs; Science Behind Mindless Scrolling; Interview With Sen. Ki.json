I think he's got a very open mind, or I wouldn't have put him there. He's going to be very much less radical. But there are problems. I mean, we don't do as well as a lot of other nations, and those nations use nothing. And we're going to find out what those problems are. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

We want to make sure parents have the right to know that when kids go to school, they are going to be safe and have access to vaccines and access to health care. So that's very important to me. But RFK Jr. has also spoke about food safety issues, which I care a lot about. I sit on the Agriculture Committee, testing food, particularly food that goes into our school systems. We do very little food testing. A very small percentage of food that comes into this country is tested. And so I appreciate some of his views there. I also appreciate some of his views on clean air and clean water. He used to run an organization in New York called River Keeper, a preeminent environmental organization trying to clean up the Hudson River and trying to protect people who live along the Hudson, and from toxins in the environment. So I think there's a great deal of issues where we may find common ground on with Mr. Kennedy. And I look forward to exploring those before I decide how I'm going to vote.",

As you point out, there are policies and things he's advocated like on food, on clean air, and water that people like yourself find appealing.What would he need to say to you to get you totally on board? GILLIBRAND:  Well, I just want to make sure there's going to be no reduction in access to vaccines for school-aged children. We know that vaccines work. We know that it keeps our children safe and it has eradicated massive disease that decimated our country hundreds of years ago. So, the science has continued to progress and continued to protect our young children. And I want to make sure those protections are still in place.

You were on with my colleague Jake Tapper yesterday. And I was going back to that interview. You said -- quote -- \"I don't think we do know who they are or even what technology they're using.\" So, when the Biden administration says that these are commercial drones, hobbyist drones or law enforcement drones operating legally, do you buy it?",

We have had them over military bases. We have had them over arsenals. We have had them in New York. They were over Stewart Air Force Base. They were over an arsenal in New Jersey. They were over Wright-Patterson Base. They were over Langley in Virginia. These are highly sensitive military sites. They have also been seen off the coast where nuclear capabilities are located. We have seen them across the United States in sensitive areas. And in those sightings by military personnel, we have them documented, but we do not know what technology they are. They are not something that in many of these instances we saw coming via radar. So they use detection that radar doesn't pick up. They use technology that radar doesn't pick up. And so these are serious questions about national security that should not be dismissed. And I don't know that New York and New Jersey should feel satisfied that all of the sightings are known.",

We don't know whether they're adversarial or run by a foreign entity. We don't know what their purpose is. We don't know if they're spying.When they are located for two straight weeks over Langley, that is definitely not enthusiasts. That is definitely not without risk or without a national security concern, because any drone can carry any type of technology. It can carry detection devices. It can carry weapons. It can carry jamming devices. It can harm our interests in multiple ways. And so these drones should be reviewed more quickly. We should have FAA work with the FBI and Homeland Security to bring these drones down, where they can safely identify who they are. And then they can assess if we're safe or not safe.",

And there isn't a huge difference, but this is U.S. teens. That's the data you're seeing for teens, 95 percent access to a smartphone, 46 percent using it almost constantly. But if you look at adults, you have sort of seen similar statistics. So it's -- a lot of it has to do with access and the way these platforms are designed to keep you scrolling. You're more likely to keep scrolling if you have watched five things of the same sort of nature versus if you have just watched one.

So both those things need to be true. But I think there's a first sort of step here, which somebody who -- Catherine Price, who's wonderful, you should read her book -- talks about, every time you pick up the phone, to sort of ask yourself, what for? Why did I just pick this up? Why am I doing it now? And what else could I be doing instead? That makes a huge difference just to create that sort of pause in your thinking.
