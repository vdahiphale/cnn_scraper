According to newly-released documents from the sheriff's office, the shooter's ex-wife and son went to the police in May to report their concerns about his paranoia. Police visited the gunman's residence twice in September after his Army unit reported that Card was, quote, \"having psychotic episodes where he is hearing voices that are insulting him, calling him a pedophile. Card is also making threats to shoot up the Seco National Guard facility.\"Our Shimon Prokupecz has been doing all of this reporting on the ground in Maine and joins us live this morning.

And instead of someone saying, hold up, wait a second, we have to do something about this, we have to get this man help, we have to get his guns away from him, we have to potentially take him off the street, everyone just sort of acted like social workers here. Certainly the law enforcement officials, the military, all saying they were going to try and get him help. They were using the family to try and get him help. But clearly, based on these documents, none of that was working. And here we are today with 18 people dead and something that certainly people across this country, from law enforcement officials, people in this state to the families believed this could have been prevented had someone just taken the action.When we look through these documents, you see that back in July when the shooter was in training in New York, he had an episode. There was a mental breakdown. A fellow soldier complained that he was sort of talking about potentially doing some kind of a mass shooting. Talking about violence. Talking about hurting people. And they were concerned. And they went to military officials. So much so that we found out yesterday that the Army, in a statement, said that they basically instituted a policy. They said that he can no longer handle weapons or ammunition. But yet somehow he continued to be able to possess his personal weapons. And then we see, as we know now in September, the family, the military, all went to the police saying that they needed to get him help. And while he just remained on the street.

Do you believe this proposal, which Senate Democrats say is dead on arrival, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell disagrees with, is the right course of action? REP. VICTORIA SPARTZ (R-IN): Well, thank you for having me. And I'm very disappointed to hear that, you know, that we're not wanting to deal with our fiscal issue. We do need urgently need to help Ukraine. We need - and we need urgency to help Israel. But I think it's important for us also to deal with our spending. And I think this package is very reasonable, what our new speaker is proposing. We need to understand that we already give $12 billion per year appropriations to IRS. $80 billion for additional appropriations. So, what it does is just give less increase to IRS, which is really, you know, not doing a good job anyway and harassing a lot of Americans. So, I think we need to move Israel aid quickly. This is very urgent. You know, people of Israel are fighting very serious battle that they need to win. And they need to stabilize in the whole region and can really get us involved in very, very significant crisis. So, I think that needs to move first quicker. And then we have to deal with Ukraine.",
