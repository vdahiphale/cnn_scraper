Just last week, you'll recall, Arizona State Supreme Court ruled in favor of upholding the 1864 law which prohibits abortions except to save the life of a woman. Abortion rights opponents gathered outside the state House today. A member of the Arizona chapter of Right to Life said, quote, this is not a political issue. It's a moral issue.Abortion rights advocates were also on hand. They've been gathering signatures for a ballot measure that would enshrine abortion access in the state's constitution up until fetal viability, which doctors estimate is around 22 to 24 weeks.

What prosecutors plan to ask the former president if he eventually decides to testify?European leaders pleading with Israel to exercise restraint in its response to Iran's missile and drone attack. And the impeachment trial of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas shut down in the Senate before a single argument could be heard. It is 5:00 a.m. here in Washington, 4:00 a.m. in Tennessee. There's a live look at Nashville. Good morning, everyone. I'm Jim Acosta in for Kasie Hunt. It's great to be with you. Jury selection in New York's Donald Trump hush money trial resumes in just a few hours. Seven jurors have been seated so far. Five more need to be selected to fill out the 12 person panel, plus six alternates. In a filing yesterday, prosecutors for the Manhattan D.A.'s office indicated they plan to question Trump about his past run-ins with the law to discredit him if he chooses to testify. Prosecutors intend to ask the former president about the recent civil fraud trial that landed him a fine of more than $350 million, as well as the E. Jean Carroll defamation and civil sexual abuse civil cases. Trump owes her nearly $90 million. Last week, Trump said he intended to testify in the criminal hush money trial. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And there is much to be gained in many cases by a defendant taking the stand. But there are some risks and doors that can be opened that wouldn't otherwise be open to the prosecution in that case.And again, with Trump, these topics are pretty well known. Of course, some of these jurors have indicated they don't have as much knowledge about his past as others. But you're going to be hard pressed to find people that don't have some general knowledge about these issues anyway. So it probably isn't too big of a risk here.",

But I ultimately do believe in the jury system. I believe that there are people even in Manhattan that could be fair, neutral, impartial and judge the case based only on the evidence that's presented in court and what the judge instructs them on.So I don't think it's impossible. Again, many people have said he only needs one juror, and that's not a nullification argument necessarily. It's just that you just need one person to believe that there's reasonable doubt in a criminal case, and many other jurors might agree with them at that point as well. So I certainly don't think that's off the table here. I do believe in the system.",

It's a very unique situation, especially for these jurors to be in, knowing that they are going to be casting a judgment on former president here if they're selected. So I think the judge is being careful to ensure that there are no issues whatsoever, that there's no indications that somebody's being intimidated in some way, especially if they do end up sitting on that jury.",

The Biden administration has called for restraint while expressing solidarity with the Israeli government.That was certainly the message as well from both the United Kingdom and Germany, whose foreign ministers were meeting with officials in Israel yesterday, again calling for restraint, but also focusing on potentially expanding sanctions on Iran. But there has also been warnings from the European Union as a whole. We heard today, this morning from the E.U.'s Foreign Policy Chief Josep Borrell. He spoke ahead of the G7 foreign minister's meeting in Italy, again calling for a straight warning that the Middle East in his eyes is on the brink of a regional war and that the European leaders should stand together in calling for Israel's response to be one of restraint. But we have heard from the Prime Minister of Israel, Benjamin Netanyahu. He spoke yesterday around a cabinet meeting saying that while he thanks allies for their continued support and solidarity, the decision on how to respond will be Israel's alone. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER (through translator): I thank our friends for their support for the defense of Israel. And I say this, both support in words and support in actions. They also have all kinds of suggestions and advice. I appreciate it.

And that's something that not all the leaders or not all the foreign ministers, let's say, agree on all of this, you know, talking about the priority, that was the priority before the attacks last weekend, which is a humanitarian crisis in Gaza.
