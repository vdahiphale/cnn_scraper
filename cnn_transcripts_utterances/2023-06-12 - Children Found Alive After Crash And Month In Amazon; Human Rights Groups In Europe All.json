A preschool teacher ad was targeted to 93 percent women. But an ad for a pilot was targeted to just 25 percent women. And a mechanic job was just six percent women.

JAKABThe Wall Street Journal surveys a number of economists, and has for many years, of various things. And one of the things they ask is how likely do you think a recession is -- a U.S. recession in the next 12 months. Now, last October, it was the highest ever. Sixty-three percent said that they saw a recession in the next 12 months. But if you go back to the month that the recession would begin -- the worst-ever post-war recession back in December 2007 -- it was just 23 percent, which is above average. But they sort of missed that one. And then, of course, the stock market tends to have actually a better record of predicting recessions than economists, but it's by no means perfect either. As a matter of fact, Paul Samuelson, who won the Nobel Price for economics many years ago, made this joke that the stock market has predicted nine of the last five recessions.",
