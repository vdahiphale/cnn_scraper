He also happens to be under indictment now. You have DeSantis trying to test himself. He hasn't announced yet. Do you have a couple of other declared candidates and a few others dancing around that they just think, let everybody focus on that right now that benefits us?",

For this White House, there is that part of the strategy. And you see that in previous White Houses, too.They don't necessarily feel the need to immediately announce because Republicans are out there tearing each other apart or Democrats are out there tearing each other apart. But I do think that the White House is able and the President at times is able to use the fights that are going on within the Republican Party to try to advance some of his arguments. You know, when you think about the economy, he repeatedly will point to extreme MAGA Republicans who can't come to an agreement when it comes to their own budget. So I think that they're very eager to allow those Republican infighting to play out and kind of sit back and just watch it.",

Is the apparatus in place to start launching the candidacy? It's largely going to be run out of the White House. Let's be honest about this. The headquarters likely to be in Wilmington, possibly Philadelphia, but are they focused on -- it's a tough job running the country and running a reelection campaign. In many respects, it's a different job. So can the same people do all of that job? That's why it may matter. This year is important to define your opponents.",

CNN's Isaac Dovere reports Democrats are hoping to make abortion a key issue and a turnout driver in 2024 by using an old Republican playbook. The goal is to put abortion rights questions on the ballot in key states. That is a copycat strategy of sorts to what Republican Karl Rove did back in 2004 with ballot initiative designed to block same sex marriage.Isaac joins us now with his latest reporting. I remember that campaign, George W. Bush running for reelection. It was a close campaign with John Kerry 51 to 49 in Ohio and a lot of Republicans think George W. Bush carried Ohio because of that same sex marriage ballot initiative. Why do Democrats think abortion will help them in 2024?",

But already you see efforts underway in a state like Arizona, which obviously is very close in 2020, expected will be a battleground in 2024 in a state like Montana, where there, again, it's probably not going to be a competitive presidential election, but there is a key Senate race there. There's efforts there to get it going. Other states looking at it, Colorado, Florida, there's some effort in Missouri, doesn't seem like it's going that far, so far. But this is something that is going to start being talked about in more and more states, it looks like, as we get geared up for this year and next.",

And to Isaac's point, we'll see how it plays out, we'll see how many state ballots they qualify for. But just look at these results in Milwaukee, 2020 exit polls versus 2023 with the Supreme Court election on the ballot. These are three suburban counties. Republicans winning all three of them again. But look how the margins changed, right, between 2020. And that's the difference in a battleground state. You move from plus 21 to plus 16, from plus 12 to plus four, from plus 38 to plus 32. In key suburban counties, you can flip a battleground state your way. LAURA BARRON-LOPEZ, CNN POLITICAL ANALYST: Yes, it's all at those margins there in those battleground states. Another thing, though, is even in states where Democrats may not be able to get a ballot initiative up, there are Republican legislators that are also making this an issue. You know, even in Florida, where they've introduced the six-week abortion ban, there's a number of other states that are doing similar types of abortion ban, similar types of trying to or going beyond what happened with the fall of Roe by trying to say we're not going to allow, you know, interstate travel or a minor can't travel out of state. I think that was Idaho just recently, as this week, without some parental consent. All of those things are going to make abortion a big issue in 2024, even if Democrats don't get the initiative. KING: And is there any evidence before us that Republicans see that? You talk to Republican strategists, they see it especially in a battleground state like Wisconsin, which followed the big losses in Michigan to, again, Midwestern states Republicans had hoped were going their way. The vote in Kansas last year. Are there Republicans saying, whoa, whoa, we need to be careful here?",

What we saw at this internal meeting at the State Department first was Secretary Blinken and Ambassador John Bass, who led the evacuation on the ground, the non-combatant evacuation in Kabul. First, they made some acknowledgments that were much less defensive. It was much more candid and raw in their self-assessment of what went wrong.You know, Secretary Blinken for the first time said more urgent planning and preparation was needed to prepare for potential worst case scenarios. And Secretary, pardon me, Ambassador Bass said the department did not have the right mix of structure, resources, and mindset in place to meet the challenge of that scale and complexity. And so, you know, then the Secretary talked about a lack of clear authority, competing and conflicting guidance from Washington and from my reporting on the ground, talking to people on the ground, that was a huge problem in Kabul in August of 2021 and a lack of clear tracking of Americans. So this non-public event, first of all, gave us a much more candid view of the problems in the State Department. And then even then, there was a great deal of pushback in this supposedly friendly audience. So there was a counselor official who was on the ground in Kabul, and she spoke up, and it was quite emotional where she talked about the sense of disillusionment on the part of state diplomats who were on the ground during the chaos. And she challenged the Secretary about the refusal to release the After Action Report. This full sort of, you know, if you, you know, if you don't learn from history, you're doomed to repeat it. Well, that's what an After Action Report does, and they're not releasing it. And so she said, it feels like there's more concern about blowback than interest in being transparent. And so, this was really an extraordinary event yesterday, but again, it was internal at the State Department, not for public consumption. The question is whether all of that's going to be made public.",

And you talk about one particular day in the whole Abbey Gate episode. He says, \"The next morning, Sunday, August 22, Sam's supervisor told him he'd be returning to Abbey Gate. Before he left the JOC, the Joint Operations Center, Sam learned at a briefing that his job had grown even harder. The window for freedom for Afghans had narrowed. At risk Afghans, even those in fare of their lives from the Taliban, no longer qualified automatically for evacuation.\" You have that reporting spelled out in the book in even more detail, and again, I urge people to read it.
