He is described as a certified firearms instructor and a member of the U.S. Army Reserves.

Think about those venues, I mean, places of entertainment, places of joy that were struck by gunfire.Now what we're learning about this shooter is that he according to law enforcement sources, telling CNN is a military reservist in the U.S. Army. He was a firearms instructor. And so this is someone who would presumably have great proficiency in the use of a firearm. We show that photo that we had, this is what police have put out. This is an image of the suspect at one of those locations, holding that high powered assault style rifle. The reason why we're showing this is because authorities want this image to get out there with people see this person and know who this is or know anything about him his whereabouts. Certainly, they want to hear from you. And certainly for members of the community as this manhunt continues. If you see an individual matching this description, authorities are saying you should be considered armed and extremely dangerous do not approach him. And you know, in addition to those victims that we talked about, Laura, you now have numerous members of this area of this community that are sheltering in place certain areas in a state of lockdown again, just to ensure their own safety as this manhunt continues. Finally, this far, we've learned no new leads about where precisely authorities are looking. We know that federal state, local law enforcement have flooded into that area to try to assist with this manhunt.

You can see if you put it back up for a second, the hair length is longer than the picture on the screen, perhaps the build could be different, the facial hair seems to be distinct as well and different.So just looking at the style, and what the person looks like in the moment can be really the difference for people to look and say, do I know the person in the photograph to the bottom left of my screen? Or have I seen the person that is in the center of this image highlighted right now, this is why it's important to have it in real time. You've also mentioned, Josh, it is the middle of the night.

This is the somewhat similar to the Boston Marathon bombings in which you have a community that goes on lockdown.Law enforcement are then -- are also vulnerable because you have a person or suspects that are going to kill rather than and willing to kill law enforcement as well. The challenge now for the community that is under stress and dealing with this tragedy, and now under lockdown, we see the pictures of Bates College and other areas that are under lockdown is when do you lift it if you don't find him, and this is a challenge we had here in Massachusetts, as well. If he's not found by tomorrow morning, say eight or nine or 10, you can't keep communities locked down for this long. It's just not -- it's just not sustainable. And then you're going to have to open up also knowing that this very violent person is still amongst them. This is going to be the challenge for the community, for the state, for the governor. What we do know now though, at least in the last couple of minutes is the suspect has ties to other states, including Maine and Massachusetts. And so you have even other states to point as we are here in Massachusetts. State Police at the borders to sort of, you know, make sure that he's not making his way elsewhere in the United States. You also have that, you know, sort of fortification in Canada as well. But this issue of lockdowns, it's not just in the United States. European cities have done lockdowns after major terror attacks. And even when they don't find the terrorist, they do have to open. We're going to have to manage that because it will still be a risk, of course for the community.

But speaking about the manhunt in Pennsylvania about a month ago, similar guidance was pushed out to the communities affected after that prison escape, it wasn't an all -- it kind of turns from an all-out locked down to just a cautionary guidance to the community to say like, you should stay in your residence with the doors locked as long as you can, and you should report any kind of sightings to law enforcement.The other side of that coin is it does, as you said, Laura, forces that person who is on the run to also seek cover at least during daylight hours, either in heavily wooded areas, or potentially by invading a home where a family might be present. And we know that's exactly what happened in Pennsylvania, right. The individual in that case broke into numerous houses, one of them there was a family sleep at the time. They knew he was down in their kitchen. So, you could potentially force a very volatile situation like that. I think one of your one of your earlier guests tonight said we should be prepared for a longer term man hunt, that may take several days or even longer to find this individual. And I think that's probably a good way to think about it. That's not what anybody wants. But we may be in that situation already. We know he's been able to move away from Lewiston. We know he's dropped, dumped his car, he may have been able to pick up or steal another form of transportation. But he is definitely on the run from what he knows will be a very serious and dangerous interaction with law enforcement in which he is in the best case scenario, looking at spending the rest of his life in jail.

Central Maine Medical Center confirmed that this is a mass casualty shooting event and they are working with other area hospitals to try to take in patients.I want to bring in Dr. Anthony Cardillo who is an EMS director at Glendale Venice Medical Center. Doctor, thank you for being up with us this evening. I mean, the scope of what is at stake tonight, what has to happen in these facilities to assess and identify, what level of care to provide, how to prioritize it, it is overwhelming to think about, let alone to actually execute in this way. When you see the kind of weapon that was used in this shooting, what kind of wounds would you expect the patients to have? DR. ANTHONY CARDILLO, EMS DIRECTOR, GLENDALE VENICE MEDICAL CENTER: Yes, a great question. Certainly, even when we have one victim of a shooting with this caliber weapon it exhausts all of our resources. We saw -- we only have central Maine Medical Center, level three trauma center, the closest level one trauma center is Maine Medical Center Portland, 45 minutes away. This all starts with EMS arriving at the scene having mass casualties and, unfortunately, having an unsecured scene. You have a scene where a suspect is still at large, meaning that there are patients languishing, dying, waiting for EMS to get to them, to save them and rescue them and just start treating them. And you can't do that because the scene is not secure. So, it starts with EMS trying to secure that scene and get access to those patients. Once they get access to those patients, the trauma teams are activated in all the local hospitals and then the EMS professionals start doing triage. They determine, unfortunately, who cannot be saved versus who has a chance of survival. That triage process begins and they must have come across dozens of patients if this amount of people have been killed and have been wounded. That is a tragedy for any EMS personnel to encounter. It's very challenging to start that process of triaging. Then it's a question of which medical centers do you bring these patients to. We do activate the medical centers to be from the field, so they are getting all of the doctors, all of the nursing staff, geared up, ready, and able to receive these patients at the centers. Also trying to triage where do patients go? Do they hop on an airlift and go to Maine Medical Center in Portland, or can they be brought safely to Central Maine where maybe the injuries aren't as severe? We also activate these trauma teams. 24-hour trauma teams come in. These are a combination of surgeons, anesthesiologists, radiologists, emergency physicians that are there to deal with the sheer number of patients. As you mentioned, with this kind of weapon, what we see are very, very high velocity, high caliber injuries that usually traverse the entire body, take out a lot of tissue along the way, extensive organ damage. These are patients that are going to be tied up in the operating room for hours and hours, even if it's only one patient is going to exhaust the system. When you have this many patients coming in, it's all hands on deck. Every physician is being called to come in and help try to manage these patients. And they're also going to be long-term consequences the next couple of days for these hospitals just trying to recover from the amount of just work they had to do in these coming hours.",

And a lot of these decisions are done in a matter of minutes and maybe seconds at times to assess those different levels of treatment that can be provided. So, if you're talking about the treatment, especially with the number you're talking about, there's not even, for lack of a better word, the luxury to spend the amount of time that you would normally do on a surgery to try to correct.Are these -- would these be done in parts then where you're stabilizing initially and then going on to other patients and then returning to figure out what comes next?",

That gun itself not inherently illegal. But there is that question about if he had these mental episodes and he went under some type of mental health assessment, as our reporting, you know, was that ever reported to state officials and what would the ramifications have been?Now, it will be interesting to watch moving forward because we hear a lot after these mass shootings, particularly on the right, saying, well, no, this isn't a gun issue, it's a mental health issue. But that really raises the question, well, what's being done to make more strict the mental health aspects of some of these laws? So, a lot of questions, and, obviously, you know, are focused on the victims here and this incident, certainly this manhunt and, you know, law enforcement getting this person off the street. But each of these incidents is something that law enforcement studies because they want to learn in the end how to prevent the next one.",

So, we came home, and she wanted to lock up right away. We locked up, locked up the windows, everything. I do have a firearm, so it made her feel better to know that I was carrying it around and had it all ready to go. She was scared somebody was going to come into our home.
