That is the big picture of these speeches. The slightly smaller picture, but nonetheless more equally important, is Zelenskyy has to go to Washington, has to keep persuading Capitol Hill to keep up this support. But it's really, really important and the way he put it was incredibly, I think, powerful and accessible. People can understand what he's saying.

And again, of course, using many of the same tactics you witnessed in the 1990s in Yugoslavia, targeting civilians deliberately.Kurt Volker, you understand this very well, given your service through the years. Has the U.N. gotten any better at handling this? Because part of Biden's message, right, was to make the case for international organizations such as the U.N. that they still have a place today, and not just to end the war there, but for climate change and other challenges, food security for the global south. He was making an impassioned plea there, but in large part because those organizations and agreements are under threat. KURT VOLKER, FORMER U.S. AMBASSADOR TO NATO: Well, that's exactly right. And I think President Biden is absolutely right that these multinational institutions are important on a range of very functional and technical issues. But when it comes to international peace and security, we have a fundamentally broken structure. We have a Russia and a China that sit on the U.N. Security Council, who are themselves the sources of aggression in the world today. So - and as long as that remains the case, we're not going to have a functional U.N. Security Council. I think in this case, we're going to have to see change in Russia. We've seen Russia launch a war of aggression. We've seen them commit what appears to be genocide. We've seen them certainly commit war crimes in their actions in Ukraine. And this is not the actions of a country that belongs in the U.N. Security Council. And as President Zelenskyy said in his comments yesterday to the media, this is a problem not just for Ukraine. This is a problem for the world.

That is to change and obliterate Ukraine's identity. That's a genocidal thought and it's a genocidal goal and it's something that the Ukrainians take very seriously. They absolutely want their children back. They want accountability to the idea of there being any space for negotiation. No leader in the world will tell you now that there's any real space because Putin hasn't shown the slightest bit of willing to sit down and obviously Ukraine has their red lines. I talked to the Secretary General of NATO, who's obviously in charge of keeping this alliance together, and to the idea of Putin waiting it out. Well, he says Putin thought he could wait out the West, thought he could chip away at NATO's resolve, at the EU resolve, at the General G7 resolve, and he hasn't managed to do that.",
