He wants cashed $50,000 worth of Walmart gift cards in a single day. He even earned a guest appearance on a Seinfeld episode, all on United's dime.

And much hubbub has been made over the reporting from \"The New York Times\" piece -- quote -- \"A second former IRS official, who has not been identified, told House Republicans that same story. That episode was confirmed independently to The New York Times by a person with knowledge of the situation.\" On Friday, Hunter Biden's lawyer, Abbe Lowell, pushed back in a letter to Jason Smith, the GOP chair of the House Ways and Means Committee, who released the whistleblower transcripts. Lowell called them -- quote -- \"disgruntled agents\" with \"a bias and an axe to grind.\" And accusing Republican lawmakers of releasing the transcripts as -- quote -- \"An obvious ploy to feed the misinformation campaign to harm our client, Hunter Biden, as a vehicle to attack his father.\" So, what actually happened here?

GLENN THRUSH, WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT, THE NEW YORK TIMES/COVERS DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE: Who knows? But I think one of the things that is becoming increasingly clear is Merrick Garland did not do a very good job of explaining the process to us when he addressed us on Friday. This is a much more nuanced process than Weiss having completely unlimited authority to move unilaterally. The process would entail, say he goes to D.C. and California and says to them, let's partner on prosecutions involving violations of the tax code. And what we're really talking about here, according to the material that's out there, is the 2014 and 2015 tax years seems to be ones they were targeting, right? They then saying, nah, we don't like it, or for whatever reasons that they choose to decline to partner he can then go appeal, essentially, to Merrick Garland and say, I want to invoke a section of the law called the special -- not special counsel, special attorney, whereby you overrule these guys and give full authority.
