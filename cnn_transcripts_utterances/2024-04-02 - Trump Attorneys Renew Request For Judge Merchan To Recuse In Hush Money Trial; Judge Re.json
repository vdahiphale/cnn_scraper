And all we're learning about Israel's strike on a food convoy that killed seven workers from World Central Kitchen. Good evening thanks for joining us when most criminal trials are just days away most criminal defendants and their legal teams are busy enough just prepping their cases. Donald Trump of course is not most defendants so today with his New York criminal trial just 13 days away his legal team tried again to get the trial judge to recuse himself. And in short order Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg responded. So we begin with that as well as some court filings which we're expecting tonight in the classified documents case. CNN's Kara Scannell is following all of it. So what is the Trump team's argument for recusal this time? Because the judge just gave a ruling on this less than 24 hours ago.",

I don't know Judge Cannon. I don't know what her thinking is. But I do think that what you would normally do, as Carrie just said, is you would decide the legal issues first. What is the law that applies to the case? Are we under the Presidential Records Act? Are we under the Espionage Act? What are - what's the governing law?And then you would make all of your case management decisions, including what's in the jury instructions, based on those determinations. And so the way she's doing it is exactly the reverse of how it would normally be done. And I think it could potentially put the government in a very tough position. I mean, let's say that she decides that the instructions that former President Trump is asking for are the right ones. You know, that actually this is all about the Presidential Records Act and he could have declassified anything he wanted to without following any formalities. If she makes that decision and then the case goes to trial and then he's acquitted, as he certainly would be with that instruction, the government has no recourse. There's double jeopardy. So they have to find a way to get this legal issue decided first. And the way a judge would normally do it is you would decide, okay, here's the law. These are the instructions I'm going to give.

That's a tremendously low bar compared to some other battleground states. Now, there's no question that Kennedy's supporters can be found across the political spectrum. But Anderson, Democrats are paying particular attention to him, trying to define him. They have teams of lawyers and others going through all of this paperwork here.

I mean, this is a state that, you know, Donald Trump won by 20,000 votes in 2016 with a third party candidate on the ballot defeated Hillary Clinton. Biden then, as we heard, won the state in 2020 by 20,000 votes.So the narrowest of margins, which means that any third party candidate has the potential to be a spoiler. So I think the Biden campaign and Democrats need to take this seriously. I think that they are. I think there's a little bit of a challenge for them in - they don't want to further elevate him. I mean, really, his currency, Kennedy's currency right now is really attention, right? And so they don't want to give him more attention, but they also don't want to let him go unanswered. So I think one of the things the Biden operation has to do is to really help educate people on the notion that a vote for Robert F. Kennedy is not a vote to put Robert F. Kennedy in the White House. There is really not a universe where he is going to get enough electoral votes to be president of the United States. A vote for Robert F. Kennedy is effectively going to be a vote for Donald Trump. And so I think they need to be very clear in terms of voter education on that. And then they also need their allies as they're doing, I think. They need their allies out pushing back on some of the most egregious things he said. Last night he was talking about Joe Biden is a worse threat to democracy than Donald Trump. That's a ludicrous statement. And they need to make very clear that that's the kind of person he is. That's what he stands for. And they need to make sure the stakes are understood.",

Kennedy Jr., it's Republicans. They're going to spend all of that Super PAC money not going after Donald Trump. They're going to be attacking Joe Biden with it. So from Donald Trump's perspective, that's a good thing. That's why you have Republicans running his Super PAC because they will be consistently trying to knock down Joe Biden. And then you think about just the fact that Donald Trump supporters, I think, are much less likely to say, goodness, there's this guy running for president who isn't Donald Trump, even though I like Donald Trump, I'm going to vote for him. We all know the base of Trump support is pretty rabid. But Joe Biden has this moment where there are some Democrats that either aren't happy with them, whether it's Gaza or anything else.
