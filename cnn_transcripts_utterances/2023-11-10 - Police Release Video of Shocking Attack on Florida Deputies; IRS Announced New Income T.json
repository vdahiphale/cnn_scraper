He snapped a shot inside of the hospital with one of these injured deputies, Deputy Manuel Santos right there. That's his wife on the right. Now, before we heard that his other deputy, Corporal Carlos Brito, he was the one that was worse hurt from this incident. And the Sheriff, Chad Chronister, had said that it was possible that he might lose his leg. HSO was not able to give me a condition as to how that deputy is doing and the condition of his life. So let me walk you back to yesterday morning. What happened here? This all started with a 911 call. A mother saying that she was in fear for her life. Her son was behaving erratically and violently. So deputies arrived to the Brandon home and tried speaking with Ralph Bouzy, who was in his car. But he refused to speak to the deputies. Backed off out of the driveway and left. But then he came back. I want to show you now the surveillance footage. It is very graphic. You can see a deputy right there jumping out of the way. Then he speeds up right into those two deputies. Horrible situation. Horrible to look at right there. Just a violent collision. Here's what the deputy. Excuse me, the sheriff, Chad Chronister, had to say about the situation. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Put it simply, it just means that they're going to have more money staying in your pocket, less money going to the IRS.Now, normally, this is pretty boring these changes. The adjustments are usually pretty small, but because inflation is so high right now, the IRS has been forced to make bigger changes. So let me just give you one example. In 2023, income above $95,000 was taxed at 24 percent in 2024, it would have to be above $100,500 before you get to that 24 percent limit. So that is a significant change here. The IRS is not trying to lower anyone's tax burden per say, but they are trying to adjust for inflation. And we're also seeing some changes to its deductions. So let's look at the standard deduction. That's the most common one that people take. That's going up by 5 percent. So if you are a single taxpayer that is going up by $750 for 2024. For married couples it's also going higher -- the standard deduction is going up by $1,500. So these are changes, again, that the IRS is making for tax year 2224.",

You know, before the pandemic, the national vaccination rates for a lot of these vaccines was 95 percent. And that's the goal, really, to reach sort of herd immunity where you can protect the folks who aren't vaccinated or don't get enough benefit, by having everybody else be protected. So during the pandemic we saw that slowly inched down to 94 percent and then over the past two years it's held at 93 percent. What we have also seen now in this new CDC data is that exemptions togetting these vaccines has risen to the highest level ever recorded three percent. That's up from 2.6 percent in the prior year. And so that's folks who are not intending to catch up. And so that is really alarming to public health officials and people who work in this space. They say that specifically for measles, for example, where the national vaccination rate is about 93 percent that puts about 250,000 kindergarteners at risk of a measles infection. And so they're really encouraging schools and providers to try to focus on getting kids caught up here.",

But really to try to work with folks where if they're in a lag trying to get them caught up, provide school-based clinics and really do everything to make sure kids aren't falling through the cracks to try to get those levels back up to 95 percent or higher.",

This Sunday, on CNN's \"THE WHOLE STORY\" with Anderson Cooper, our Dana Bash takes an in-depth look at this disturbing trend. Here's part of her report where she spoke with the special envoy to monitor and combat anti- Semitism.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) AMB. DEBORAH LIPSTADT, U.S. SPECIAL ENVOY TO MONITOR AND COMBAT ANTISEMITISM: Jew hatred, anti-Semitism is deeply baked into not just Western society, but much of the world. It's very hard to eradicate. The anti-Semitism has been called the longest or the oldest hatred, with good reason. So this sort of let the lid off for many antisemites for quite a few decades. It hasn't been taken seriously. People have said, well, it's not as serious as racism. It's not as serious as homophobia. It's not as serious as misogyny, et cetera. Or what you'll often find is amongst the university administrators, oh, these Jewish kids, they come from well healed families. It's almost falling into the anti-Semitic trope. Jews are powerful, so why are they complaining? Jews are successful, so why are they complaining? So it's using the anti-Semitism against them. When you encounter an act of prejudice, call it out for what it is. When George Floyd was murdered, it would have been so inappropriate to say we condemn the racism that was behind this and the homophobia and the anti-Semitism. But somehow when it comes to anti-Semitism, it couldn't be called out on its own. It couldn't stand on its own.",
