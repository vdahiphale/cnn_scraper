      "sentences": "Get back. In the meantime in the next hour U.S. economic is set to release some of Former President Donald Trump's federal tax returns. He refuse to take them public because the candidate and then as President. Trump is already calling this move and outrageous abuse of power.The release comes days before Republicans who want a slim majority in November's midterm elections take control of the House. Trump was the first Presidential candidate in decades who didn't release his tax returns. As Kristen Holmes reports, the Former President has a lot of stake here. KRISTEN HOLMES, CNN U.S. NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: After years long legal battle, the House Ways and Means Committee led by Democrats will release Trump's taxes on Friday morning. So here's what we are expecting to see these are going to be returned for six years from 2015 to 2020. These are going to be his personal federal tax returns as well as the returns of some of his businesses. They will also include IRS audit materials. Now this is a big deal for a number of reasons. Trump himself has built an entire brand on being a wealthy and therefore successful businessman. And in that process, he has done everything in his power to protect that image and that meant shielding his finances for decades. That includes his net worth who he did business with how exactly he made his money? And the big question now is what this pulling back of the curtain is going to reveal? Will it have a political impact? One thing to remind you of here is that when Trump ran for office, and when he was President, he became the first President in modern history, not to release his tax returns. Now, we do have some information. There was an analysis done on these taxes from the Joint Committee on Taxation. They talked about his income tax, or they talk 2017 he paid only $750. In 2018 and 19, he paid 1.1 million, and in 2020, he paid $0 in income tax. Now this same group also raised questions about his charitable deductions, particularly gears, where he made deductions that were over a million dollars, most of them in cash. So we'll see what comes out of these documents but again, a big deal. We're already hearing from Republicans saying that this is setting a bad precedent. The Former President himself has said that when Republicans take control of Congress, they should immediately start investigating Biden and his family and get them to turn over their tax returns.

Two more countries plan to place restrictions on travelers from China. South Korea says it will stop issuing short term visas from its consulates in China for the time being.Those that do get visas will need a negative COVID test and Spain is also now requiring a negative test or proof of full vaccination. The measures come as China sees a surge in COVID cases as eases, its strict zero COVID policies. European Center for Disease Control has a different take that it calls the restrictions on travelers from China unjustified. It cites higher immunity among the U.S. population and said that COVID variants circulating in China are already in the EU. Still, member States like Italy have put restrictions in place on their own, including requiring a COVID test for visitors from China, or covering the story on two continents. Barbie Nadeau is at the airport in Rome, and Paula Hancocks joins us from Seoul. Barbie, let's start with you because Italy has imposed restrictions tell us more about them and also which other European country is following suit.",

      "sentences": "Well, certainly they're not being welcomed Bianca, we've had a couple of comments today from Beijing one saying that they wanted to say that they were truthful, open and transparent in the way that they are reporting data.Also one top epidemiologist saying that there is no secrecy in China that they have nine variants of Omicron in the country at this point and all the information that they have is being shared with the World Health Organization that the WHO. And of course, we're hearing from other countries that there is not enough data being shared. That there's not enough genome sequencing the United States, for example, quoting that as the reason it decided to put more restrictions in place for travelers from China. But this is being rejected by Beijing. We've heard through state run media, which often says what the leaders maybe don't want to say Global Times, for example, which is state run, said that they believe that what is happening is unfounded and discriminatory also leaders blaming the Western media for distorting the facts. So there's definite pushback from Beijing at this point. But when you look at the numbers being reported, Beijing has admitted that no longer will they give a daily number of COVID cases. They have significantly refined the definition of a COVID death. It has to be someone who's died from a respiratory illness directly related to COVID 19. And the numbers are miniscule when you consider what we have seen all our teams on the ground have seen and what we're hearing anecdotally in China itself. So this transparency that Beijing says it has and the lack of transparency that many other countries believe it has is indirect competition at this point. So Beijing is pushing back but countries around the world including South Korea, just this Friday are putting extra checks and balances in place. Of course, here in South Korea, the government wants to put those checks in place, as it was February 2020. Very soon after this outbreak happened, that South Korea was hit hard. Obviously very close geographically to China, many Chinese tourists and students come here to South Korea. And not only have they put the checks and balances in place that other countries have checking that you don't have COVID before you come in even having a test afterwards. They're also effectively trying to stem the number of travelers from China by stopping short term visas being issued at their consulates in China, Bianca.",

A court in Myanmar has sentenced oppose Former Leader Aung San Suu Kyi to another seven years in prison.A source says that the court found her guilty of corruption charges. It's the last in a string of trials against a 77 year old Nobel Peace Prize winner who now faces a total of 33 years in prison. Suu Kyi denies all charges rights groups call the convictions Schanz and part of the ruling military junta is drive to crush democracy. And the death toll from a huge fire that gutted a casino in Cambodia has grown to 25 people. At least 100 people were injured in the blaze that tore through the building near the Thai border, which also includes a hotel. Officials say that some of the victims were trapped in their rooms as the flames raged. Others jumped to their deaths in a frantic attempt to escape. Cambodian rescue teams are using heavy machinery to dig through the rubble as they search for dozens of people who are still unaccounted for. They expect to wrap up their efforts by Friday evening and the Cambodian government has also said it will investigate the cause of the fire. Let's return now to our top story. Vladimir Putin says that he's expecting China's President to make a state visit to Russia in a few months' time. And he's vowing to strengthen military cooperation between Moscow and Beijing. Meantime President Zelenskyy's office says three Ukrainians were killed in cross border shelling in the Northern regions. So to discuss all this CNN's Ben Wedeman joins us now live from Kyiv. Ben, tell us your analysis of what we've learned so far about this video call between President Putin and President Xi, especially the elements that of course pertain to Russia's invasion of Ukraine.",

Because what we've seen is that the Chinese are certainly benefiting from dismal oil from Russia. But in terms of military supplies, from China to Russia, it doesn't seem that China at the moment is a significant source of weaponry or ammunition.And certainly there as far as cooperation going in the other direction, it's questionable after the fairly dismal performance of Russian equipment and the Russian Military in Ukraine.

Now overnight, yes, there were 16 drones launched in the direction of Ukraine.As far as Kyiv goes, two of them were shot down before they reach the city, 5 were shot down over the city. So it does appear that the air defenses are working relatively well. But it just takes a few to get through and cause a serious disruption for instance, yesterday in Kharkiv for missiles did reach their targets in that city where that caused severe disruption of the supply of electricity. So it doesn't take much too just get a few through and cause trouble for Ukraine despite clearly a fairly good air defense system, Bianca.",

He was absolutely up there and you just have to see the videos that have been put together particularly over the last few weeks seeing the skills that some of the greatest footballers of the modern day, the last 50 years have produced.Pele did most of it before they did it. He was very much leading the way but and it's the goals that he scored the records that he broke the age that he did it he was making waves at the age of 15. It was widely talked about the fact that he played barefoot practiced with a sock stuffed with rags and his tale really of coming from that. Yes, his father was a footballer but coming from that at the age of 15, helping Santos to a title in his first season. This you remember is the era before the internet before social media. So whilst he was making waves and breaking records in Brazil, it was really at the World Cup where he was catapulted onto the world stage, the youngest player to ever represent Brazil, at a World Cup. He helped Brazil to their first world title they hadn't won the World Cup before Pele. He helped them to 1958, Age 17. He then helped them repeat that feat four years later, there are still only two countries that have ever successfully defended their crown. We talked about France not being able to do it this year and then they missed out in 1966 when he was injured. But he came back four years later, and helped them to a Third World Cup. He's still the only player to have won three world titles. And really there was there's an image from 1970 him shaking hands swapping shirts with the England captain, the late legendary Bobby Moore. And that was really for me, and for a lot of people of my generation that encapsulated that he was so much more than just a football. That was really seen as an image that broke down racial barriers and catapulted him to that next level embracing not only sport, but far beyond that as well.",

Well, there's been so many tributes paid over the last 24 hours, but he would say, I would say before Pele, football was just a sport. Pele changed everything.
