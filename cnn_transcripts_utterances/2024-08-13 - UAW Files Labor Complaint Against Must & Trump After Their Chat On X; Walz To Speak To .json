We're following these major developing stories and many more all coming in right here to CNN NEWS CENTRAL.This hour, Vice President Kamala Harris' running mate makes his first solo campaign stop. Moments from now, Minnesota governor, Tim Walz, will speak to one of the nation's largest unions of public employees. It comes as the United Auto Workers union just filed labor charges against former President Donald Trump and Tesla CEO Elon Musk. The UAW claims the two men threatened to intimidate workers who go on strike during a rambling conversation last night on X. We're going to have much more on those charges in a moment, but let's start with CNN's Natasha Chen, who's live in Los Angeles at that Walz event. Natasha, break down this campaign stop for us, what should we expect to hear?",

This room is full of AFSCME members. This is a union of state, county, municipal, government workers, but also cultural workers, people who are unionized at museums, at zoos, all around the country. It's a total of 1.4 million members around the U.S., 4,000 of them here in this room right now.   And you can see they are separated by state. There are actuallydelegates from Maryland right behind us. And I spoke to a lady at this table right next to us who is a vocational rehabilitation specialist with the Maryland Department of Education. And we talked about Musk's conversation with Trump yesterday. She said she was not surprised to hear that UAW is filing charges. She said they should. She also mentioned this idea that Trump has been going out there saying he would cut federal jobs. He would, you know, trim government employee, spending on government employees. And she said, thinking about her own position, she helps young people on Social Security, on SSI benefits, to get off of these benefits. Some of them have autism, some of them other situation, circumstances that make it difficult for them to work, to help them gain skills and get a job, sometimes part-time, but it helps them feel productive, she said. And so if her job were to be cut, she said, you could eliminate spending on her salary, but you would then be spending a lot more still offering these federal benefits to the young people that she helps. So that's how she looks at the situation. A very energized room here, again, from a union that has officially endorsed Harris-Walz for the presidential and vice presidential ticket here. So they are all waiting to hear from Walz. He did speak to UAW last week, in which he said something about how the audience is a friendly audience, as it is today. He said, it may be preaching to the choir, but we need this choir to sing. And I anticipate that he might echo those sentiments today, because while this is in California, we do have a lot of members here in the room from battleground states, including Pennsylvania, Arizona, Wisconsin. And so he's going to need those people to go out and spread the message of why people should vote for Harris-Walz. Boris?",

      "sentences": "Okay. So first, let's just talk a little bit of context here, because you have the United Auto Workers. One, they have endorsed Kamala Harris. They had endorsed President Joe Biden. And on top of that, he has - he being Donald Trump - has a pretty toxic relationship with the head of the UAW, Shawn Fain. They have publicly criticized each other over and over again.I think Trump is pretty fixated on Fain, if you want my opinion on that, because he continues to bring him up on a regular basis. So now you have, following these remarks, UAW filing these federal labor charges against both Trump and Musk, saying that they were threatening workers who threatened to strike by saying they would get fired, which is illegal. It is illegal to threaten anyone who is threatening to strike or to fire anyone who is threatening to strike. So now you're hearing the Trump campaign hitting back. And they released this statement saying, \"This frivolous lawsuit is a shameless political stunt intended to erode President Trump's overwhelming support among American workers.\" They go on to say, \"Democrat special interest bosses may lie and stoke fear to try and stop President Trump from creating the broadest coalition of any candidate in history, but rank-and-file workers and their families know the truth.\" Now, the reason why this is interesting is because there is a dynamic between the leaders of these various unions and the rank-and-file members. When Donald Trump goes to Michigan, they don't have an expectation that the leadership of any of these unions are going to show up. However, what you have seen is this chipping away of these rank-and-file members, and even if you talk to some of the leadership at these unions, they will acknowledge that. So that is where he's really trying to dig in. Obviously, insulting unions and saying things like you should fire people who are threatening to strike. It's not a great tone, but he believes that the messaging is not about unions, it's about the economy and focusing on inflation, essentially targeting rank-and-file voters by saying we are for the working class. Again, Donald Trump doesn't really have the record to back that up in terms of unions and being pro-worker, but that's part of the reason he also brought on JD Vance, who is somebody who they believe speaks to workers and supporting workers.",

So he's not exactly the best person to be going after, particularly in Michigan, where I just think the UAW has a very special presence there, both proportionally in terms of the number of members they have, but also culturally.And I think it speaks to a weakness that Donald Trump has had since Joe Biden got in this race, which is he really needs to make this a change election where he's going to make the economy better for people. And all he seems to be doing is swirling controversy around himself. The talking points here are actually pretty simple, and he just can't get over himself to get them out.

Russia successfully hacked the personal email of the Clinton campaign chair, John Podesta.You lived through all of that. You know what that's like. What do you think the lessons are we should take from that instance in 2016, when Russia was trying to meddle?

And we also learned in retrospect that China was very active in 2012, trying to break into the Romney and Obama campaign.So this is clearly a problem. It's a pervasive problem and what we're seeing is it's dictatorships that do this. And what they're trying to do is get us to fight with each other even more to divide our country so that they - these dictatorships can be more competitive against us on the world stage. So first and foremost, I'd say this is wrong. We need to condemn it when it happens. I condemn it happening to the Trump campaign, to the Harris campaign. I condemn it happening in the past and any campaign out there, let's keep in mind in 2016, you know, this was happening at the congressional level too. So every campaign needs to act to protect themselves against this happening. And I think this is here to stay. This is just a fact of our politics now. I appreciate that the media this time has been putting this information in its proper context. It sounds like a lot of outlets refused to take the materials and are reporting that this is in fact the foreign government.

We're a week into something which Ukraine didn't even accept it was doing for 48 hours, hinting at it only in the middle of last week, around about the time, too, in which Vladimir Putin heard from his top brass that they'd essentially halted the advance.And now today it continues with the number of settlements under their control, leaping from local Russian officials saying 28 yesterday to now Volodymyr Zelenskyy saying 74. Now, bear in mind, this is a large swathe of - some relatively sparsely populated border area that presumably Russia thought Ukraine would never try and take, yet they seem to have marched in relatively unimpeded. Yes, there's video of Ukrainian soldiers lost in the fighting here and Russians taken prisoner, too. But ultimately, we have 121,000 from yesterday Russians being evacuated. The numbers are frankly staggering, as is the speed in which Ukraine has moved and the efficiency, too. And there have been a number of videos we've seen that suggest Western-supplied armor has indeed been used as part of this. Now, I couldn't quite hear everything President Biden was saying, but it was clear he's being kept abreast of the situation, and rightly so. This is an utterly staggering moment in the war. And, Jessica, we have to try and work out really what is Ukraine's endgame here. They've already achieved probably their first goal, which is to embarrass Moscow, to make it clear that they're potentially good at those slow, grinding fights over one small town in the winter, losing thousands of men over tiny amounts of territory. But when it comes to responding to large, sweeping mobilizations of Ukrainian troops across large areas of undefended territory, they've proven useless. They've not sent strong enough forces and the ultimate question, I think, about this is, does Ukraine sustain this long enough to force Vladimir Putin to stem the embarrassment by sending his better troops from parts of the front line where they're fighting in occupied Ukraine or is he willing to just allow this remarkable Ukrainian run across farmlands, border areas that he keeps being told is about to be stopped for that to continue for yet more days. It's a - not a turning point in the war, I would say, but certainly a moment where Ukraine's strength, mobility and Western supplies are now seeing full use. And one that may give Ukraine a upper hand if indeed we end up seeing something approaching talks in the months ahead. Bizarrely, during this Ukrainian lightning dash across Russian territory, both sides keep referring to peace talks, distant as they seem now. But I think that's what's potentially in the distance here - maybe guiding Ukraine's moves, along with the possibility that they're just very eager to get some positive military headlines after a bad year of losing ground.",

Well, one of the key things here, in fact, let's go to the big map first just to give everybody a bit of an idea. This area right here is what we're talking about. This is where the Ukrainians have made their big incursion, and when you go up here, this is a detailed look at this same area. The town of Sudzha is the first area that the Ukrainians captured, and they're moving basically in this general direction toward things like the capital of the Kursk Oblast, toward this region right here, as well as a nuclear power plant, which just happens to be right there as well.

It's right up here where the symbol is. And then we have this pipeline.This pipeline is the gas pipeline, about 50 percent of Russia's gas exports go through this pipeline to Europe, specifically to countries like Hungary and Slovakia. And that's why that is one of the reasons that the Ukrainians have captured things like this gas meter plant right here. This is actually part of the pipeline. This is what it looked like back in July of '22. This is what it looks like now. Clearly, we have a bit of damage associated with this, and that is perhaps one of the targets. They can cut off supplies. If they cut this off right here, right now Ukraine gets money from this gas pipeline, but they could also tell the Russians, okay, enough is enough, and we can cut this.",

So let's focus on the Donbas region, because the Donbas region - remember the town of Bakhmut, which was fought over for a really long time, and all the towns that you see listed right here. But one of the problems that the Ukrainians have is basically this line of defense right here is the one that the Russians are contesting right now.
