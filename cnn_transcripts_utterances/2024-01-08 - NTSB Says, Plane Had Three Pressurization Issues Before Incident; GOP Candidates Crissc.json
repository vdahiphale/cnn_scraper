I thought this man would come in and upend the politics of our country and the bureaucracy, and he sure did those things, but not in the way that I had envisioned.And I think it's important for people who were like me or who are like me now, who really believe in him to understand how another Trump presidency will be. So, what is democracy? That's the people having the freedom to act and speak freely. I think under Trump, you're not going to be able to do that or you are going to be able to do that as long as you're talking just about him in positive ways. I think free press will be really something that's going to go by the wayside. I remember when I was press secretary, he wanted me to kick everybody off the White House grounds constantly. I think that's something that's going to happen. I think that we're going to be aligned with countries like China and Russia rather than our NATO allies. So, I think it's important that people are understanding really how he's going to operate.",

The high court will review this unprecedented decision by the state of Colorado, their Supreme Court, that removes Trump from the state's ballot, citing the 14th Amendment's insurrection clause.The court argued that Trump's actions on January 6 and in the days that followed, quote, constituted overt, voluntary and direct participation in an insurrection. Let's turn to our Senior Legal Analyst Elie Honig with much more on this. So, Supreme Court has to address this.",
