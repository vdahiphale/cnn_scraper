      "sentences": "This is CNN. I am Richard Quest in New York. And a warm welcome to all of you watching us wherever you are in the world.The headlines, Hamas militants are claiming to have launched a major missile attack on Ashkelon in Southern Israel overnight. Hundreds of missiles, blanketed the night sky. Israeli police say they're responding to a direct hit on an apartment building there. And the number of people dead in Israel, has now reached 700, and will likely rise. The Israeli ambassador to the United States has told CNN, Hamas fired more than 4,000 rockets since the attack started. And, Israel's response, pounding Gaza with airstrikes. The Palestinian ministry of health now says, at least 413 Palestinians have been killed, and that includes 78 children. There is a particularly horrifying discovery, 260 bodies have been found dead at a music festival site near the Gaza border. They were killed by the Palestinian militant group that invaded Israel. Hadas Gold is in Jerusalem. I almost don't know which atrocity is greater to begin with. But I think that probably we just need to update on the overnight of events. I say, it's 3:00 in the morning, have things quieted down or they're still going full throttle? HADAS GOLD, CNN JERUSALEM CORRESPONDENT:  I mean, in terms of just the intensity of the rockets being launched, those have calmed down a bit, especially compared to last night, and even in the last few hours. A few hours ago, there was a barrage of rockets, as you noted, towards Ashkelon, as well as towards the Tel Aviv area, and towards the airport. The Hamas militant groups saying that they were specifically targeting the airport. But as far as we understand, airport operations were not affected. We were also still hearing reports that they were active engagements with militants still at this hour. So, we are almost 48 hours into this with militants in certain communities in Southern Israel. So, it's kind of starting to believe that there are still militants on the streets and that the Israeli military has not yet been able to completely secure all of the Israeli communities in Southern Israel. I -- here in Jerusalem, it has been quiet, but I have to say I continue to hear almost on a regular pace what must be fighter jets above us, flying from bases, maybe towards the Gaza Strip or back, even all the way out here in Jerusalem. It is a very eerie. It's -- you can feel that, really, the Israeli society is in shock. We also have now just heard from Hamas claiming that they have more than 100 hostages. This is in addition to Islamic jihad, which is another militant group in the Gaza Strip saying that they have 30 hostages, not clear how those numbers potentially overlapped or not. The Israeli authorities have not yet given us a specific number of hostages, but we have been told by them that these numbers are in the dozens. And Richard, these include women, these include children as young as toddlers. These include elderly, including elderly in wheelchairs. In some cases, Richard, they were taken literally from their homes. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOLD (voiceover):  Palestinian militants kidnapped a group of distraught women and children. In video posted on social media, it's terrifying to watch, even more so if the people who are being abducted are your family. Yoni Asher is safe in his home in Israel, but he says he is terrified for his wife and two young daughters. Abducted by Hamas militants from his mother-in-law's home near the Gaza border. He says, the last days have been difficult. He hasn't slept, and desperately wants to send this message to their captors.",

The pain shared now by many Israeli families, not knowing if a loved one is dead or alive, or ever coming home. (END VIDEO CLIP) GOLD (on camera):  And Richard, we do understand that it might not just be Israeli citizens who are among those captured and being held by Gaza. We also understand there might be Mexican, German, American nationals among them.

There's a lot of questions, of course, not only over the security failures of just not anticipating something like this, not seeing the preparations for it. And then of course, not having the ability to respond so quickly to so many infiltrations. That will be the big question. This is something that I really don't think anybody expected or could have ever imagined had -- would happen because in the past, there had been, you know, certain people who had tried to infiltrate the fence, like here and there. We would hear reports about somebody trying to cross the fence, and it would be very quickly shut down and that person would be very quickly apprehended. So, this is a failure on a scale that I think it is very hard for people to imagine. And I won't be -- I mean, we're already hearing the comparisons to the Yom Kippur War of 1973, almost 50 years ago to the day, to when this started. The failures and the intelligence on that situation. But you know, we're 50 years later where Israel has very sophisticated surveillance now on all of its borders.

I will say one thing, the number of people who were involved with this, without there being a single asset, a single disclosure, a single whisper that either U.S. intelligence or Israeli intelligence picked up, does suggest a -- an effort that was not done by technology.

And so, that is the difference, sort of, in the days after both the attacks that everyone including Pakistan, except for Afghanistan, who we eventually went to war with, isolated themselves from al Qaeda and the movement and you're just not seeing that with Hamas right now. And I think that is the scary difference for Israel right now.I think the other 9/11 analogy is, of course, Israel has experienced this as 9/11 is that -- or the question that Israel will have to ask itself, not now but soon is, for a nation that always knew that it was surrounded by this kind of threat. That they just simply were not unable to pick it up or response to it fast enough is an intelligence failure similar to 9/11, but maybe even worse to the extent that they could imagine this. Remember in 9/11, it was the failure of imagination. Israel obviously could imagine this because they've been imagining it for their entire existence, and I think that's the reporters are saying before.

No action was taken following the meeting, according to several security council members. In remarks to the media, the deputy U.S. ambassador to the U.N. said, a good number of countries condemned the Hamas militants attack against Israel. Richard Roth is our Senior U.N. Correspondent. He joins me now. I was much taken in your -- when we spoke an hour or two ago, when you said, the time isn't right. I mean, they got together, but there's always a time in a moment for diplomacy, and this is not it. RICHARD ROTH, CNN SENIOR U.N. CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, all of these crises have their own timing or momentum. The Middle East flare-ups have occurred, and sometimes, it seems the council waits until it settled like Egypt and other countries, and then they hold their meeting. They have an -- they have a monthly meeting about the Palestinian situation, no matter what's going on there. So, we've kind of heard it all. There hasn't been a dramatic change until the last two days. The shooting, the hostages, that doesn't happen here at the U.N. It's the house of talk and sometimes there is a benefit. Too early to say though. They -- I don't think any -- you would've gotten all 15, I think, to agree on a statement today that all. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ROBERT WOOD, DEPUTY U.S. AMBASSADOR TO THE U.N.:  When you say protecting civilians, we are very much concerned about the impact of this invasion by Hamas. Not just on civilians, right in that immediate area, but in the region. This conflict could grow, and we don't want to see that happen. And obviously, our thoughts are with all civilians that are hurt. But what we need to focus on is this ongoing terrorist violence being committed by Hamas. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

There is the organization known as UNRWA, which handles Palestinian schools, education, sometimes a rocket or two has been found in one of those schools. I believe, overnight, they were saying there are hundreds of people in Hamas taking shelter in those U.N. schools.They have a U.N. special envoy. If the -- if enough people trusted him, I guess Israel and the Palestinian could talk. But this is Hamas, they're not a member state of the U.N. So, it's -- the communication is very tough. We know that Antony Blinken, the secretary of state, has been making calls to everyone. The -- you would agree, this is going to take time. I mean, the amount of deaths, the shocking nature of bodies, and the kidnappings. This is different than the other ones. You've got member countries of the U.N. who have lost citizens.",

      "sentences": "Well, Richard, what I can tell you is that at least as of tonight, U.S. officials are still saying that they haven't found a smoking gun directly connecting Iran and this attack that we saw over the weekend. But look, it is exactly as you put it, U.S. officials say, of course, that there is a history of Iran supporting and funding Hamas, and that that is not news.One U.S. official I spoke with earlier tonight saying, of course Iran is in the picture. That they have known for years that Iran has been involved in aiding Hamas. I think what is interesting is that U.S. officials increasingly, over the last 48 hours, have been openly pointing to the likelihood that it will soon be shown that Iran was involved in helping to execute and plan for this attack. But again, at this moment in time, U.S. officials are still being careful and saying they have not found anything to corroborate the fact that there was a direct linkage, but the history there is pretty plain and obvious.",

      "sentences": "Look, I think a huge question, of course, and you reference that phone call between President Biden and Prime Minister Netanyahu, this was the second time that they have spoken since the attacks began. The big question is going to be continued assistance to Israel. We, of course know that the U.S. has now in the process of very quickly moving extra military assets into the region. And the administration has been very clear that they intend in the coming hours, in the coming days to discuss what additional assistance they can offer Israel as it fights off these attacks.But the important context here in the U.S. is what's going on the other side of Pennsylvania Avenue on Capitol Hill. There has been some political drama, as you know. We are in a situation right now, really unprecedented where there is not a permanent speaker of the house. And what that means is that Capitol Hill's ability, Congress's ability to legislate is really up in the air. So, just as an example, if the U.S. were to try to move forward with an assistance package for Israel, actually, administration officials aren't even sure how that would play out in the absence of a permanent house speaker. So, that is going to be one huge question confronting administration officials and lawmakers as well as that, sort of, hangs out there as a very, very big question mark.",
