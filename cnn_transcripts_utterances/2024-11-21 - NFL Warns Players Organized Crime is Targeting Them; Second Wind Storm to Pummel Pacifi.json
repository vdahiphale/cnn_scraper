      "sentences": "I don't think you're going to be able to tell when one storm ends and the other storm starts, because the rain will not stop, and the snow is still piling up here. This is the atmospheric river. It goes almost all the way back to Hawaii.So this is going to take days to finally clear California, especially northern California, from North Bay northward. And then maybe a little bit of a sneak down toward central and southern California. They'll take the rain, if you can spread it out. But today, it's not spread out. There is a high risk of flooding. Only 4 percent of all of these events here are high risk. But yet, 80 percent of all flood-related damage is occurring in those just 4 percent of days. Look at the rainfall. Over a foot of rain in parts of California already, and the snow is piling up. This isn't an impressive number, 20 inches here. Impressive for some. But not impressive when it comes to how much moisture is in the snow. This is heavy, wet snow. And if you're from Chicago, like I am, Buffalo, New York, and you forget what it's like to shovel snow, don't forget, because it's on its way as well. Some lake effect coming in, coming after, likely, Thanksgiving. But the colder air is coming to the east coast. Here's the rainfall across parts of northern California. You can see it from Santa Clara, Santa Rosa, all the way up even toward Medford. Some of the heaviest rain will be right here in this flood watch. This is where the rain will pile up. And also, now with that new second system coming through, we'll make more wind again. Well, now the problem is the ground is all saturated. And so if you put wind on top of saturated ground, you're going to have more trees falling. And I think that's the big event for the next event when the winds pick up again to 50 or 60. Trees are going to be coming down again -- Brianna.",

I mean, they want the fans able to gamble on every single pitch. And they take it out of the umpires' hands. So they'll have electronic strike zone. And that way, you know, fans can sit in their seats if they want to or certainly watch TV and gamble with the next pitch to be a ball, strike, what part of the strike zone.

And, you know, same with the hitters, with the managers, that sort of thing. A little bit like we've seen in instant replay.

They should be called strikes.But I think, you know, by doing this, remember Theo Epstein, when he worked in the commissioner's office, said the beauty of this is you can change that strike zone year after year. If you want to go, you know, higher and lower. If you want to go, you know, more horizontal. And change, you know, change the game a little bit to provide more offense.
