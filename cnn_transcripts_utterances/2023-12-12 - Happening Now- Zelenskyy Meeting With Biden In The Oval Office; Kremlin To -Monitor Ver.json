It shows bon ami or at least goodwill. People think things are getting better. There is a Fed meeting, of course, around the corner for tomorrow, but those are the markets. And the main events that I must bring to your immediate attention. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is at the White House after trying -- and some say failing -- to convince US Republicans to pass more funding for the Ukrainian war effort. President Biden tells Democratic donors Israel is beginning to lose support around the world. And the COP climate tour is supposed to be finished, but there's still no agreement on a final deal, and so it continues. We are in New York. It is Tuesday, December the 12th. We're live here. You better believe it. I'm Richard Quest, and yes, I mean business. Good evening. Ukraine's president is in Washington today, making a direct plea for continued US support. Volodymyr Zelenskyy is at the White House. He's just been meeting President Biden here a moment ago. Biden speaking alongside the Ukrainian leader. He said withholding aid to Ukraine would be a Christmas gift for Russian President Vladimir Putin. Zelenskyy met earlier with members of the US Senate. Congress has not yet authorized the $61 billion for Kyiv that Mr. Biden has requested. Senate Republicans blocked the security bill from advancing last week. They say they won't vote for it without more money to secure the southern US border. Lawmakers are struggling to compromise, and Ukraine is basically caught in the middle. The real danger is that Congress goes off for Christmas without a deal, and leaders on both sides are speaking out. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

But at the end of the day, what is going to unlock this new aid for Ukraine is some agreement on tightening the rules on the southern border. And that is not something that President Zelenskyy has any control over. And right now, Republicans and Democrats are at an impasse. Certainly, President Biden in that Oval Office meeting that just happened a few moments ago tried to reassure Zelenskyy. He told him that he didn't want him giving up hope on American aid coming through. But it's not at all clear what the backing of those assurances is. And when you heard from Republicans today on Capitol Hill, they made clear that there would be no aid -- forthcoming aid for Ukraine unless they can come to some agreement on the southern border. And so I think over the next three days, they will certainly continue these talks. And it's possible that President Biden is more forthcoming about what he would concede to when it comes to the southern border.

It is being held up, as Kevin was saying, on this issue of the southern border, which it could be a compromise. Who knows? But look, yes, I mean, the Russian media, for instance, loved to paint Volodymyr Zelenskyy, the Ukrainian president, as a ridiculous figure going against Washington, beating a path to Washington, capping hand, begging for money. That's the only way they say he is able to survive. The Kremlin, as you mentioned, has said, look, you know, we're monitoring it carefully, which they wouldn't be if they weren't concerned about it, by the way. But they're saying it's not going to have an outcome on -- in terms of how this conflict plays out. It's not going to have an outcome on the battlefield. But I think, you know, behind that bravado, Russians know and Russian officials particularly know that the tens of billions of dollars that's being sort of bargained for, at the moment, will have a big difference -- will make a big difference. The billions of dollars of aid that have already been given to Ukraine have resulted in absolutely devastating losses for the Russians on the battlefield -- tens of thousands, perhaps hundreds of thousands of men have taken out of action, killed, or injured. And yes, Russia can sustain those casualties perhaps. They've got a big population more so than Ukraine can, but there are still losses.

Israel has been very strict about inspecting all of the aid that goes into the Gaza Strip. Until now, there has been only one inspection point. This is now the second one. Once these trucks are done being inspected, they will then go back out to Egypt and go up to the Rafah Crossing, which is where all of the aid has been crossing into Gaza since this war began. But there is no guarantee that all the trucks can actually get in because of the bottleneck at the Rafah Crossing. That crossing is not built for a huge number of trucks. And then we've seen a real catastrophe on the humanitarian level in the southern part of Gaza, with hundreds of thousands of people who have been displaced desperate for aid with no shelter, no food, and the heavy fighting that has made aid distribution so difficult. A major question now is, when will Israel allow aid to flow directly from Israel through this crossing into Gaza? For now, I'm told that is not on the table, that it's a decision that the Israeli government has to make. And for now, they have not approved that.

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (voice-over): So giant sequoias have a complicated relationship with fire. Without fire, you don't get seedlings like this. But it has to be the right kind of fire, which, in this system, is frequent mixed severity fire. So fire that comes through every 7-30 years and burns out mainly on the ground and burns up the needles and the small branches and then creates little openings like this that have a lot of sun. (MUSIC PLAYING) WEIR (voice-over): But the coalition says, prescribed burning might not be enough. So they are also creating a genetic bank of giant sequoia cones. LINNEA HARDLUND, FOREST ECOLOGIST (voice-over): In the past, there's never really been a need to replant because we haven't had these large, continuous patches of high severity wildfire within these groves. And when you have really large, high severity patches like that, there are very few remaining mature trees to disperse seed. WEIR (voice-over): More than just a majestic sight to see, sequoias play a critical role in the forest ecosystem. And with a little help from us, they might just stand a fighting chance.

So we are critical because we make sure that Africa is connected to the world and the world connects to Africa in a seamless fashion. We also encourage to grow the cargo, because cargo is important for trade. Now you mentioned the famous starting point, Richard, the blanket. I cannot see it, unfortunately.
