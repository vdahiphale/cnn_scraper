And welcome to INSIDE POLITICS SUNDAY, I'm Manu Raju.A raft of new polling out this morning gives us a snapshot of where the race for the White House stands eight months before Election Day. It's clear the momentum is with Donald Trump and Joe Biden has his work cut out for him. Now, we're going to dig into those numbers in just a moment. But Trump has his own issues. And one of them is named Nikki Haley, who is still in the GOP primary. And assuming Trump is the GOP nominee, a major question now looms. How many of Haley's supporters will actually come back to Trump in November? Will they sit out or will they vote for Biden? And with Super Tuesday just two days away, we'll get a clear sense of Trump's strength within the GOP and his weaknesses as a general election candidate. And for now, Trump is moving closer to clinching the nomination. Just yesterday, he swept three GOP contests held in Missouri, Idaho, and Michigan. He now has 247 delegates to Nikki Haley's 24. 854 more delegates are up for grab Tuesday in 15 states. And Trump needs 1,215 delegates to clinch the nomination altogether. So yesterday, as he tried to rally the base and focused on Biden and North Carolina, Trump made some baseless accusations against the president. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Good morning to all of you guys. This is the -- lots to digest. And there's a lot of polls out this morning, which we'll get into here in a second.

There are 15 states that are voting, you know. But Haley only continues to get a sizable amount of votes, 28 percent, 26 percent she got in Michigan, 39 percent she got in South Carolina.

Or, you know, 5,000 votes, 10,000 votes here or there that will determine the election, that's everything. RAJUJust this weekend's poll from the \"New York Times,\" Siena Poll, 48 percent of Trump voters are enthusiastic of his as the nominee. Just 23 percent of Biden voters. Such a significant gap. And then just how people view the Trump presidency versus the Biden president. There's been several polls that have been similar to this. There's one out this morning from CBS News/YouGov saying, how would you rate their presidency? Forty-six percent say excellent and good for Trump. Fifty-three percent say fair or poor. Just 33 percent for Joe Biden. You know, that -- those -- if you're in the Biden campaign headquarters right now, what are you thinking about those? And what are you going to do differently? LAURA BARRON-LOPEZ, CNN POLITICAL ANALYST: Well, I mean, those numbers clearly aren't good for President Biden. But what the campaign will tell us, over and over again, and what they're saying despite those numbers, is that they really are clinging to this theory of the case. That essentially, once voters realize that it is definitely a rematch, there's no more Nikki Haley. And it is Donald Trump versus Joe Biden. They believe that they can swing voters towards Joe Biden because of that contrast. They're going to draw a contrast on immigration, on democracy, on abortion, on reproductive rights, all of that. And that voters just aren't tuned in yet. And then once they're -- once they're able to do that, you know, that they can bring people home. I mean, that being said, a lot of the Democrats that I talked to, I was talking to Adam Schiff this week, as I was in California for the Senate primary. And he said one of his biggest concerns is young voters. So in addition to black and brown voters, which are showing low enthusiasm for President Biden, a lot of Democrats are really concerned about young voters not getting home --",

Forty- seven percent now. And Trump has a 15 point percent increase since then. And then women voters, 57 percent of women voters, back in 2020, backed Biden. That is down 11 points.

I think that, you know, they're all trying to maintain this relationship with Trump because Trump still controls the party. And if we've learned anything over the last year or so, especially as the House Republican majority has tried to navigate their majority, is that they all follow whatever Trump says and it ends up making them twist in the wind.

And that is his biggest concern going into the general election.But I think where Donald Trump has really moved the bar on terms of expectations of presidents is that what I hear from younger voters a lot is he should be doing more. At least Donald Trump, I don't agree with what he did, but he delivered stuff for his people. He told people how it was, or he would take on these ex-and-so people. And that I think what the frustration is exactly that, that even though we know that whatever Biden says in the State of the Union address or whatever he says to Netanyahu isn't going to change the course of this war, it is going to send a signal that he takes this seriously. So there's a difference between actually being able to move policy and being able to tell voters across the board where your sort of focus is and what your interest is, even if it doesn't turn into something.",

I mean, one of the areas that senators were working on for a long time was trying to put some guardrails around how Israel could use funding that the U.S. was going to send to them. The administration ended up doing some things around the fringes, but I think they did it because there was pressure coming from the Hill and they would rather do it themselves than have Congress actually implement a new law forcing their hand.

He labeled it a, quote, \"death wish\" for the Republican Party. Now, he ended up stalling in the Senate after Republicans said it would be dead on arrival in the House. So it's been a rough few weeks, to say the least, for the Republican senator who spent nearly five months negotiating that deal with Democrats. Senator James Lankford -- Lankford of Oklahoma. At the time, Trump said the bill would be, quote, \"very bad for Lankford's career.\" Now, I caught up with the senator a few days ago to talk about the fallout. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
