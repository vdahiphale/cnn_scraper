After a rebel offensive swiftly ousted President Bashar al-Assad over the weekend, the brutal dictator and his family fled to Russia, where they have been granted asylum. The Assad dynasty, propped up by Iran and Russia, help power in Syria for more than 50 years.Here to share their expert insights, CNN Global Affairs Analyst Kimberly Dozier, Retired Brigadier General Mark Kimmitt and Joby Warrick, author of \"Red Line: The Unraveling of Syria and America's Race to Destroy the Most Dangerous Arsenal in the World\". Well, that's prescient Joby. I mean, you know, I certainly hope people who are interested in that pick up your book and see the way that you looked into your crystal ball. Given where we are now and your knowledge of Syria and the Assad regime and what's to come, what should we be thinking about?",

We've got a really strong balancing act going on between the Western nations and Iran with Prime Minister Sudani. I would not like to see them double down in Iraq because that's one of those areas that we have been making some progress over the last couple of years.

It has given Israel the opportunity with U.S. backing to take out the lion's share of the Hezbollah operatives in Lebanon, in Syria.The same with the Quds Force guards that were helping organize those proxy groups. So Iran finds itself temporarily pretty defanged. But one thing I do want to add, though, Saudi Arabia and Iran are not on the outs as they once were.

He arrives without a suit and tie from Tajikistan. He comes to a -- for a terrorism case, and the judge really lays into him for no other reason, really, other than that he thinks he's a spy, quote unquote, \"spy\", from Washington.

And when he comes to the Justice Department sort of that kind of thing, I think, keeps driving some of his interactions. There is this view of him as kind of unremarkable. But later on, people are looking back and they see, like the 2016 episode where the judge ends up entering a order of ineptitude against everybody involved in the case, the Justice Department people involved in the case.
