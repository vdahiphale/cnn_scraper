What Matt Gaetz says matters because it could have influence on other people of his ilk, there aren't a lot of people who are like Matt Gaetz. But if there are enough, it will make a difference. I think the focus that Kevin McCarthy has right now is clearly on, as we just heard Manu report, just at the very least trying to convince some of the skeptics to give him a chance that he won't be like speakers in the past who, from the perspective of those who are on the more extreme or not in a senior position aren't listened to, it's much easier to rule that way. If you're a house speaker, to be more, to be more to roll with a heavier fist, but it's not going to get all the votes.",

But could they say, you know, we're going to make sure it has to go to more than one ballot, even if Kevin McCarthy ends up becoming speaker, they can drag it out. if it doesn't take more than maybe a half dozen people to stay committed to causing chaos, that's the question.",

Do you just do a short term spending bill? Do you do a big omnibus fraud of next year? Do you raise the debt limit now or does that have to go to until the Republicans are kept? Where is Kevin McCarthy's leash in these negotiations? Where does he have to, you know, do things maybe he might not have done six months ago, now that he cannot afford to lose more than three or four votes for speaker.",

Because we know that his first priority, I would assume is to become Speaker of the House, his priority is not necessarily to help Speaker Pelosi on her way out or to necessarily keep the government funded. So it is just a thorny path that he has. But the reason Matt Gaetz about what you're saying earlier is important because of his single vote, it doesn't matter if he brings anyone else over, he literally needs every single person. At the end of the day, you have to assume that he's likely to become speaker, but largely because there's no center of gravity around any one other person, but as we've seen in years past, and we've said this before in here, at this point, Dennis Hastert would have never assumed that he was going to be the speaker of the House.It happened very quickly. I believe, on a Saturday afternoon, Bob Livingston was going to be the speaker. This is ancient history, obviously. But things can happen very, very quickly.",

You heard there, listen to him, he would be the chairman of the House Oversight Committee. And he says when Republicans take charge, his committee is going to be busy.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. JAMES COMER (R-KY): We're going to investigate between 40 and 50 different things, we want to try to determine what happened with the fraudulent unemployment insurance funds, a fraudulent PPP loan funds, some of this money that's being spent for state and local governments in the COVID stimulus monies.

Remarkably diplomatic tone for a guy who's not afraid of doing political combat when he sees it as it is interest, very diplomatic, largely in response to this. I just showed the headline of this Washington Post story. January 6th panel staffers angry at Cheney for focusing so much of report on Trump goes on to say that there are some staff members who are disillusioned they think Liz Cheney's trying to use this for her political future. Schiff trying to dial it back, big time. Is it that this, you know, is a big project, there are Democrats and Republicans involved? There are ambitious lawyers and ambitious staff members, is this normal? We're going to get sharp elbows and the end, we'll be friends again, or is it a problem?",

I mean, the fact that they're having this debate, but I think because the Committee itself is not normal in that what you usually see are actual different sides based on where they stand ideologically, in this case, Kevin McCarthy chose not to put up his own members, you do have two Republicans, Adam Kinzinger and Liz Cheney, but they were appointed by the Democratic Speaker.And the fact that you have Democrats, largely Democrats, wanting to make the point to \"The Washington Post,\" that there is too much of a focus on Donald Trump is like, where are we in the world? But it is because there clearly is a larger goal among a lot of these lawyers who were hired to make sure that a lot of the boxes are checked. And one of the questions that really wasn't explored at all in the public hearings, is why there were intelligence failures, why would they were law enforcement failures, why they didn't have the national guard there. Those are really important unanswered questions. And that's why a lot of staff members clearly want to get that into the report. Adam Schiff said he wants to get them on the report",

So they believe that, you know, a focus on the former president only will not be, you know, a historical reckoning or recounting of this, but it is fascinating, like just the inner conversation. But, you know, on any report like this, there's always a back and forth, there's always. But usually it's just with Republicans and Democrats. So it's just kind of an unusual alignment there.But the question here is members, obviously that story in \"The Washington Post,\" excellent reporting, what do members say about this, and the individual members are going to have the final say? And is Liz Cheney going to get any pushback, she has been remarkably in control of this Committee, but she's the vice chair.

And then who decided to go on further to the Capitol? And then who made the fateful step beyond that to go in? Do you include anything on the prosecutions and the investigations, the money that, you know, the Trump allies, the outer circle, so there's a lot to do. Our team really breaks it down? Well, the green team, for example, was asked for tracking money. Some of the other teams such as the red, blue and gold teams examined everything from the motivation of participants, whether there was coordination between groups, and whether Trump uses executive authority to pressure lawmakers, former Vice President Mike Pence and the Justice Department, according to sources familiar with the Committee's work.So it is a lot of comparisons have been made tonight on the 9/11 Commission report. It is an incredibly complicated event. It was not one day. And I guess this competition is, you know, you want to be a chapter not an appendix, I guess, in the final report if you did so much work.",

What Tim Cheney will say is, none of this would even be a conversation. We wouldn't even be here if not for Donald Trump. January 6th wouldn't have happened.

New numbers show Black Friday sales also breaking records. Now there is a downside to all of this spending for many of you. And that's how Americans are paying for all this.

I mean, it would be easy to bet against consumers right now, confidence is low, inflation is high. And people are worried about a potential recession. But history shows it's never a good idea to bet against the willingness of Americans to spend money, especially around the holidays. And so Adobe analytics is projecting that today alone on Cyber Monday, Americans are going to spend another $11.6 billion online, that would be up by a healthy 8 percent from last year.And this would be on top of Black Friday, when online sales topped $9.1 billion. That was up 2 percent from a year ago. Now it's worth noting that these figures are not adjusted for inflation. But Adobe says online prices have actually been coming down. In other words, even if you adjust for inflation, this does appear to be real growth. And this is good news because consumer spending is the main driver of this economy once people stop spending, that's when all bets are off. I think the bad news though, is how people are spending. Because industry experts they expect people to rely more on dipping into savings and credit cards. That is obviously a concern. I mean, it's never a good time to carry a credit card balance. But right now is arguably the worst time. Credit card rates are at record highs as the Fed scrambles to fight inflation by rapidly raising interest rates. And at the same time we have some store branded credit cards topping 30 percent APR. So John, it is good news that people are continuing to spend and they feel confident enough but we do have to watch for signs that they maybe are stretching themselves a bit too thin.",
