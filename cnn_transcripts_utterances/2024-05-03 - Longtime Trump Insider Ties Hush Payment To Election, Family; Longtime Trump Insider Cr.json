I'm Abby Phillip in New York alongside Laura Coates.And tonight, reunited from a distance and under subpoena, the former president of the United States and the aide who was by his side as he ascended the political ladder, they sat mere feet apart today. There was no mistaking it. Hope Hicks was inside a Manhattan courtroom against her will. The woman who spent years answering questions for Trump was now answering questions from the prosecution. Government lawyers see Hicks as the code breaker, the person who knows him about as well as anyone. And most critically, she can speak to his deep involvement in managing everything about his orbit. But did what Hope Hicks say while she was under oath actually do damage to the prosecution's case in some ways?",

The prosecution, they scored its most important moment when they elicited this from Hope Hicks about the days after The Wall Street Journal broke the story of Trump's alleged tryst with the adult film actress and director, saying, quote, I believe I heard Mr. Trump speaking to Mr. Cohen shortly after the story was published.",

So anytime she said that she couldn't remember or didn't recall, I know it's a legal tactic, but it was a little surprising for me in that respect.But there were some things that were very similar to my time working with her from the campaign into the White House. She is a messenger for Trump. And I think that she kind of went into a default for that when she took some unnecessary jabs at Cohen. She said that he broke things and/or he would create these situations where he broke them and he would have to fix them. And I thought that was really odd, particularly since he had to fix things for her. I don't know if you guys recall her alleged relationship with Corey Lewandowski, Cohen had to kill stories about that relationship on her behalf, and he did. So, I thought some of those things were her kind of falling into the default of continuing to be a messenger for Donald Trump, but there were other moments that I thought were very poignant.",

Was she considered a partisan within the organization? Or was she considered somebody, you're already shaking your head, no, somebody who was just a communications person? [22:05:00] OLIVIA NUZZI, WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT, NEW YORK MAGAZINE:  She was a communications person. She became very close to the family beginning in 2012 when she started working for Ivanka Trump, and then she went into the Trump Organization. She really liked Trump, and she became very defensive of him. If there was ever a bunker mentality, as they took a lot of incoming, all of it justified, I think, from the press over all of those years, she really felt like, oh, well, why don't people see the Trump that I see? And I think it took her a very long time. There was a lot of self- deception at play for everyone who stayed, and I think it took her a very, very long time to start to realize that the Trump that she saw on a daily basis or how he treated her was not representative and, in fact, maybe just didn't matter at all relative to how he treated the country and the world.",

These little points are not coincidental. They're intentional. The D.A.'s office put her on there as their witness. This is not Donald Trump's witness, even though they had a great relationship and supposedly they haven't been speaking since 2022. But, clearly, her emotions were -- there was a favorable energy between the two of them, according to everybody who was in court today. But this was a strategic decision to show through Hope Hicks that while she was working on this campaign, she was getting calls from Michael Cohen about managing the campaign, even though everyone is saying Michael Cohen was just the fixer, he had nothing to do with the campaign, he's a horrible person, he's difficult to work with, these are all -- Hope Hicks was the witness to tie Trump back into the alleged scheme because Trump's lawyers are going to pull him out and say, Michael Cohen did this without permission from Donald Trump.",

But my impression of the testimony and what they listed from her and from accounts is that she was good at what she was doing, but she said he was the best at actually managing his own brand.And so when they brought her in to that point about Michael Cohen, she considered him and went along with the testimony to affirm this. She said, look, Michael Cohen was sometimes frustrated into the campaign. He sometimes was doing things that were not what they wanted them to do, that he was a rogue person at times, which is probably an understatement in some respects of it.

Anytime someone says that to me, it's laughable. And also, he actually helped to organize some of the people who are in the key positions of the campaign strategically where they are.So, when people dismiss him as just someone on the outside, it's just not the case. He traveled with us when we had to formulate this diversity coalition for Donald Trump. You'll see tons of pictures with him. Look at the pictures from Cleveland. Look at the pictures from Detroit. Michael Cohen is right there involved in the campaign. That's number one. Number two, Michael Cohen could not do anything in that organization without Donald Trump knowing, without Donald Trump directing. Donald Trump knew how many people were in his lobby buying ice creams from the ice cream shop, how many people were coming into the parking garage and which parking attendant was working these. That's how involved he was in the organization. To say that Michael Cohen went rogue is laughable. It's somebody who doesn't know Trump world and doesn't know how Donald Trump operates.",

The moment came after prosecutors had wrapped their questioning, which revealed that Trump communicated directly to her about the hush money payment and that he was relieved that the story did not come out before the election.Now she testified, quote, \"it was Mr. Trump's opinion is that it was better to be dealing with it now and that it would have been bad to have that story come out before the election\". And moments later, as the defense was beginning their own questioning, she became overwhelmed with emotion and turned her face and began to cry, prompting the defense counsel to ask if she needed a break. And she said that she did. They dismissed the jury. She got off the stand to go gather herself. And of course, the prosecution then followed her out. Remember, this is their witness. They had actually called for subpoena. So the question is, how will the jury who witnessed her crying on the stand, how will they see all of this? Joining us now is jury consultant Richard Gabriel, who's also the president of Decision Analysis, and the author of \"Acquittal: an insider reveals the stories and strategies behind today's most infamous verdict\". So Richard, I'm so glad you're here to unpack this, because you know what it takes to put together a jury to try to get your clients the very best chance.

Jurors can appreciate that. And then it's up to them to sort of sort out, okay, first of all, it increases her credibility as a witness.

It's almost a relief, I think, for the jury to be able to kind of go, OK, here's somebody who is being authentic, who's telling us she's nervous and is clearly conflicted. But what I also think is really interesting about this testimony, both sides are laying in the themes and the framework for ultimately what I think they're going to be arguing to the jury in closing argument here.

And to a certain extent, I think the defense is trying to humanize him to say, OK, there are people that really do care about him, that do care about his message, and aren't just sort of on some of his abuse that he can be known to dish out.
