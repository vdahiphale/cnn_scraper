When asked if he was getting paid, he declined to answer.You know, is notable that even though Giuliani's lawyers were in court a week ago saying that he could not afford to pay his legal bills, he flew into Georgia on a private jet even though he is just miles from the biggest airport in the world. It is unclear how he was able to afford that specific mode of transportation, but it did allow him to knock out the bond negotiations and his surrender all in one day, which I'm told was his goal. That he wanted to get back to New York before former President Trump arrived in Atlanta Thursday. Paula Reid, CNN, Fulton County, Georgia. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

He was the most popular American politician. And I remember being struck by his charisma and his very eloquent -- but I don't know. That was face-to-face. I don't get the impression that he has that confidence anymore. Who knows?We're following developments -- a developing story out of Russia where the head of the Wagner Mercenary Group has apparently been killed in a plane crash. Russian authorities say that Yevgeny Prigozhin was on board a private jet that went down Wednesday evening. State media report all seven passengers and three crew members were killed. The flight was heading from Moscow to St. Petersburg. It stopped transmitting flight data shortly after 6:00 p.m. local time. Malcolm Davis is a senior analyst of defense strategy and capability for the Australian Strategic Policy Institute and he's in Canberra for us. Thanks for joining us. I mean, we've been so careful about -- it's really a hard story to cover. Because we just don't know so many of the facts. But obviously, everyone is seeing a similar narrative here and we heard President Biden intimating it as well, that Putin was somehow involved in this downing.",

And so therefore, you know, if that is the case, then, you know, his life is over, he is dead. And the question is, you know, was the plane crash deliberate, an act of state by the Russian government, or was it an accident?

And so it's really a case of how Wagner can survive as an organization, as a private military contractor organization, having lost most of its leadership including its key leader Prigozhin.Can it quickly reconstitute that leadership with new people or is it going to be left essentially rudderless? And obviously the other key question that I think everyone is focusing on is how does Wagner respond if indeed this was a state sanctioned assassination of Prigozhin by the Russian government. And I think the jury is still out on that, but there is a range of different scenarios that could emerge in the coming days and weeks which we could all see.",

If they were to try a revenge against the Putin government, similar to what they did 60 days ago with the march for justice, then it's highly likely that Putin would essentially direct the Russian military to attack them. And the question then is to what extent do the rank and file of the Russian military, as opposed to the top military leadership follow Putin's orders or do some defect over to Wagner.That uncertainty and the uncertainty as to who the Wagner can trust in Moscow, means that they may not do that sort of rebellion type offensive that they did some months ago. Instead what they may do is an internal insurgency or resistance or some sort of terrorist operation designed to strike back against the Russian government.",

There is some suggestion that some sort of explosion. We don't know whether it was an internal explosion or some sort of external explosion. The latter would indicate some sort of missile. But if it loses a wing, it's not flying. It's going to come crashing out of the sky and it's not going to glide in. It's going to essentially drop like a stone.

And anything coming out of the Kremlin I think we have to take with a degree of caution in terms of its accuracy and its intent. If we actually do get confirmation that Prigozhin is dead through some sort of DNA evidence or identification of a body, something along the lines of that, then I think that is pretty certain.But a statement out of the Kremlin suggesting that Prigozhin is dead, I'm not sure that we can totally trust that. And given the way the previous march for justice rebellion occurred and then suddenly ended without warning and Prigozhin was allowed to move about relatively freely, this is an issue that is ripe for uncertainty and ripe for Kremlin trickery -- maskirovka. So I do think that we need to be cautious in terms of assuming events coming in the next few days and weeks.",

And then as I said, the key issue is how does Wagner respond to that. To what extent can they reconstitute a new leadership and what are their options in terms of carrying out any sort of revenge? If they can't respond, if they can't reconstitute, then I think Wagner as a fighting force is finished and you might see them essentially dissolve as an element of power in the Russian state.

It was nightmarish. The winds started picking up at about 3:00 a.m. This is actually where the fire began on Tuesday afternoon. And as you can see in the distance there -- and we've been stopped by police, we can't go further than this spot -- fire has reignited further into Parnitha Mountain. Now this is known as lungs of Athens. Firefighters as well as air supports battling to contain these fires that are now igniting deeper within the forest. One firefighter told me that Parmitha, as we know it, is not going to ever be the same again. They are trying as much as possible with the resources that they have, Max, to get things under control. One of those helicopters contains 11 tons of water. They are flying past every few minutes, which gives you a sense of the scale.
