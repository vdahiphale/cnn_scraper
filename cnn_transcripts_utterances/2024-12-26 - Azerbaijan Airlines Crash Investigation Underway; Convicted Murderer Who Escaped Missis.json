It is Thursday, December the 26th, 9 a.m. here in London, 2 p.m. in western Kazakhstan, where investigators are looking for clues into what could have caused the crash of an Azerbaijan Airlines flight killing at least 38 people.Russia's aviation watchdog reports the pilot tried to make an emergency landing after a bird strike. Azerbaijan state news says the plane's black box has been recovered. The flight was headed from Baku to the Russian city of Grozny in Chechnya. Twenty nine people survived the crash. All were taken to hospital. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) FARID HUSEYNOV, HEAD OF PRESS SERVICE, AZERBAIJAN AIRLINES (through translator): A medical team and necessary medical equipment have been sent to Kazakhstan by air. A hotline has been established for the family members of the passengers on board and the public has been informed about it.

It is remarkable that there were survivors.We've seen that dramatic footage of rescue workers immediately at the scene and eyewitnesses as injured passengers were essentially being pulled out of the wreckage of the sort of back half of the plane, the tail end of the plane. And now, according to officials, at least we know that 29 people survived, including two children. They've all been taken to hospital, of course, for immediate medical attention. At least 11 people are said to be in a critical condition. So we will be waiting for updates from officials on their status. But, of course, dozens were killed, at least 38 confirmed dead by officials. And there have been questions around the sort of what led to this crash. We've seen that video of the plane essentially circling the airfield ahead of what appears to have been an attempt to make that emergency landing just about two miles from the Kazakh city of Aktau. And, of course, we have also heard from the Russian aviation authorities saying they believe preliminary information suggests this was caused by a bird strike.

That's according to the country's new interior ministry. It happened hours after the current military said its forces had killed a number of former Assad fighters in the same area. The new government has set a deadline for former regime forces and gangs to disarm less than three weeks after rebels advanced on Damascus and forced Assad to flee the country. Hospital officials in Gaza say five journalists were killed in an Israeli military operation overnight. The journalists were sleeping in a vehicle parked outside the Al-Ada Hospital in northern Gaza when the vehicle was hit by an Israeli strike. The vehicle belonged to a Gaza- based television channel affiliated with the Palestine Islamic Jihad militant group. Footage shows the vehicle in flames, with the words TV and press visible on the back doors. The Israeli military confirmed it carried out a strike on what it called an Islamic Jihad terror cell in the area, but didn't provide any proof for their allegation. On Wednesday, Hamas and Israel traded blame for the failure to reach a ceasefire on hostage release deal. Israel's defense minister insists there will be no deal without a secure Gaza. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ISRAEL KATZ, ISRAELI DEFENSE MINISTER (through translator): We will ensure here in Gaza, as with Lebanon, as with Syria and in the east, that no more threats will be created against Israeli communities, citizens of the state of Israel and IDF soldiers. In Gaza, too, we will ensure that there are security spaces, buffer zones and command posts that will ensure the security of the communities. And with all this, we will act to achieve the two goals of the war, to release all the kidnapped people home and to defeat Hamas. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Thousands of people attended a protest on the holiday's first night, demanding the Israeli government strike a deal to release the remaining 100 captives. The mother of hostage, Liri Albag, lit the first Hanukkah candle and led prayers for the hostages' immediate return.Afghanistan's Taliban government is threatening retaliation after a wave of Pakistani airstrikes in that country. The Taliban says at least 46 people were killed and six others injured when Pakistani warplanes hit four locations near the border on Tuesday. Pakistan isn't commenting on the strikes, but one official says the target was the Pakistani Taliban, which aims to impose Islamic law in Pakistan. It says the militant group has been staging cross-border attacks from Afghanistan, which the Afghan Taliban denies. Authorities in Hawaii investigating after a body was found in the wheel well of a United Airlines plane. It had flown from Chicago to Maui on Christmas Eve, and the body was discovered after the plane landed. The airline says the wheel well is only accessible from outside the plane, and it's not clear how or when the person got in there. It's also unclear how they ultimately died, though both temperatures and oxygen levels plummet during the flight. While unusual, this is still a common method for stowaways trying to reach a destination. U.S. aviation authorities say more than three quarters of people who've tried to hitch an illegal ride on an airplane have died. Now, in the U.S. state of Mississippi, the manhunt is over for a convicted murderer who broke out of prison on Christmas Eve. The 33- year-old convict has a lengthy history of violence both in and outside of jail. CNN's Nick Valencia has the details. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

Ukraine's president is welcoming in the Hanukkah holiday with a renewed call for peace. Volodymyr Zelenskyy took part in a candle lighting ceremony with leaders of Ukraine's Jewish community. The chief rabbi of the Dnipro region gave a blessing and said the Hanukkah candles remind Ukraine that light will prevail over darkness and evil will soon be defeated. Music filled St. Peter's Square before Pope Francis delivered his annual Christmas Day message.
