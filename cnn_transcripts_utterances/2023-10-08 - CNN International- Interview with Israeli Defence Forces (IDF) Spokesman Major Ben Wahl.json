In the past few hours, Hamas militants claimed they've launched a major missile attack on Ashkelon in Southern Israel. Israeli police say they're responding to a direct hit on an apartment building there.It comes as Israel's reeling from a horrific discovery, at least 260 bodies have been found at a music festival site near the Gaza border. The numbers have been given to us from the Israeli Rescue Service, Zaka. The victims were killed, of course, after the Palestinian militant group launched surprise attack. Fighting is fierce in Israel. There are more than 700 people dead, and that's the latest numbers just given to us a few moments ago. Thousands of people are wounded. And we are confirming that this is Hamas propaganda video, it shows paragliders and a barrage of rockets launched from a field in Gaza. Now, this was in the early moments of the attack. Tonight, and over into the night, Israel's responding, they're pounding Gaza with airstrikes. Salma Abdelaziz joins me now from London. Mighty vengeance is how the Israeli president described when called and he said the country was at war, it's very early days still, but what's happening tonight?",

So, we may hear something soon.But as we were driving into the city a couple of hours ago, you could see the night sky was really lit up by that Iron Dome as it attempted to intercept a pretty relentless barrage of rockets that was coming in. As far as we know, at least two of them did make a direct impact. One actually not far from here, and that was a particularly loud bloom. But the Iron Dome has been extremely effective in neutralizing the vast majority of them. What I will say is very striking, here in Ashkelon, is that you really do not see anyone, unsurprisingly, out on the streets, partly because it's the middle of the night, but partly because the city has come under pretty sustained attack, and many people are choosing to stay in their shelters, go down to wherever they can, where it feels a bit safer and more secure, and wait for this nightmare to end with the very real knowledge that that end may not be coming anytime soon, Richard.",

Certainly, I think everyone has been taken by surprise by the ferocity of these barrages of rockets and particularly, by these long-range missiles, which, of course, are much harder to source and much harder to hide, by the way.The question that's being posed again and again is, how did this all happen? Presumably, taking place, the planning at least, over the course of many months in an area right up along of the border where the Israelis can literally see-through state-of-the-art technology, cameras, sensors, what every blade of grass is doing. How on earth did this happen without the foresight or knowledge of Israeli intelligence? But I will say, despite those very real questions being asked, the more pressing concern that we find when we talk to people on the ground here, Richard is, firstly, let's deal with getting these Hamas militants, who have still been able to continue infiltrate across that border out of Southern Israel once and for all. We were driving along today near the border, saw -- had to turn our car around because a firefight was ongoing between Israeli forces and presumed Hamas militants. So, that is the priority. And then, of course, the other priority is to find these hostages. It's not yet known exactly how many there are. The term that is being bandied about a lot is dozens, but we don't know where they are. We don't know who is alive. We don't know where they are being held, or what the terms of their release might entail. And so, that obviously then complicates, Richard, efforts for some kind of larger assault or ground offensive potentially into Gaza to try to really dismantle Hamas' leadership. I will say though, that we saw a huge amount of heavy military hardware, moving into those areas along the border. Definitely an increased military presence there, Richard.",

Dozens of people are believed to have been captured by Hamas fighters over the weekend.The locations are across Gaza, tunnels, basements. It's rabbit warren, if you will. A lot will complicate the response of Israel to the attack. We know, so far, and we'll get an update shortly, that more than 700 people on the Israeli side have been killed.

A couple of hours ago, explosions were heard across Central Israel and the suburbs of Tel Aviv, as Hamas claimed to target Ben Gurion Airport, according to CNN teams on the ground. CNN's Sam Kiley is reporting on the events of the weekend. The images you are about to see, many of them are disturbing. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SAM KILEY, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voiceover):  It's official, Israel has declared war, and this is what it looks like. Israeli troops in combat against Hamas infiltrators near the port city of Ashdod. Scenes like this, civilians murdered by Hamas, and militants dead from an Israeli roadside today were inconceivable until yesterday, when Gaza militants swarmed out of the enclave. Israel's death toll has climbed past 600. And the Israeli Defense Forces say hundreds of Palestinian fighters have been killed. But they fight on, so Israel has evacuated 22 towns in kibbutzim from around Gaza. Hamas claimed to have been launched a second wave of infiltrations, the IDF intercepted a seaborne assault at Zakim.

Complicating what Israel has promised will be a devastating response to the Hamas attacks. The Palestinian Ministry of Health says that the debt death toll there is at least 370. And as Israel has massed forces and continued airstrikes ahead of a likely ground assault, Hamas has called for regional conflagration.
