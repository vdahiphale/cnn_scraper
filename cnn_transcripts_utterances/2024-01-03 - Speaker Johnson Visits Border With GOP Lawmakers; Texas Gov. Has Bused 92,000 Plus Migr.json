So will this visit and those talks in Washington result in Congress' first meaningful action on immigration in decades? Let's check in with all of our reporters from Washington to the border to see where those - where everything stands.First to you, Ed Lavandera, who is in Eagle Pass, Texas. Ed, so what are this large group of Republicans led by Speaker Johnson, what are they going to see today?",

But they've been here getting a briefing from the State Department of Public Safety, the state officers that have really been enforcing what Gov. Greg Abbott, the Republican governor of Texas, has been pushing here in their fight with the Biden administration over the last few years.And you see a lot here, the razor wire that runs several miles up and down the Rio Grande here, several miles of these steel containers that are used to block the edge of the Rio Grande. All of this is in place by state authorities and they're getting an up-close look at all of that. Of course, Eagle Pass has been one of the major focal points of the migration crisis on the southern border where thousands of people have crossed. But incidentally, as these lawmakers are visiting Eagle Pass today, there, in recent days, has been a dramatic drop in the number of people crossing illegally here in Eagle Pass. Just before the Christmas holiday, there were several thousand crossing per day just here in this location. But now we're seeing far fewer numbers and there are a number of reasons. So there's an obvious natural ebb and flow of migration that happens. But we're also told anecdotally from officials on the Mexican side of the border that at various checkpoints in the interior part of Mexico, just several miles that way, more robust checkpoints where Mexican immigration officials are cracking down on the movement of migrants making their way north as well. That could be the product and the result of negotiations and talks that the Biden administration, high-level members of the administration, had with the Mexican president just after Christmas. But we're expecting to hear a lot more here from Republican lawmakers who are clearly making this visit to the border here as negotiations continue in Washington. And I think clearly the effort here is to ratchet up pressure on the Biden administration to get more of what they want in these negotiations as they press ahead on the Senate side.",

This is essentially the Biden administration asking the Supreme Court now to allow for Border Patrol agents to be able to cut razor wire that's seen across the U.S. southern border, some of the kind that we saw just a few minutes ago in Ed's live shot.What the administration is saying is that this razor wire that was put in place by the state of Texas needs to be removed in some cases, for example, because these patrol agents may need to provide medical assistance to some of the migrants that are coming across or, in some cases, apprehend some of the people that are crossing over the southern border. And this is, of course, just one of many issues, one of many examples we have seen where the issue has become contentious between the federal government and the state of Texas and essentially pitting, in a lot of cases, President Biden with Texas governor, Greg Abbott. And we are seeing, of course, here in Washington, D.C., as Lauren just laid out, how this border issue has become so politically contentious on Capitol Hill with this issue getting caught up in the issue of funding for Israel and Ukraine. I was just coming out of the first White House press briefing of the year. And again, they were talking about the urgency behind this issue. But there's really not a lot of signs right now, as Lauren was saying, of how this actually gets resolved. And as she was saying, lawmakers left town before the holidays, before a deal was struck. And now we are in the new year, but it also means that we are now squarely in the middle of an election year. And that means that on both sides of the aisle, this is going to be an increasingly politically sensitive issue, both for Democrats and Republicans to navigate, guys?",

But we are facing real pressure right now with over 168,000 arrivals over the past year and a half with very little financial assistance from the federal government, no national plan to settle refugees based on where there is local capacity. There should be a survey of every town and county and state around the country to look at capacity. And finally, we need more work permits for the migrants.I talked to so many of them and the first question I'm asked invariably is how can I work. These families want to work, they want to pay taxes, they want to pay their own way, but they need to be given those work permits.

So the first families who were affected by that 60 day limit were supposed to be evicted just last week, right after Christmas, but they did receive an extension through this month, we understand.

We're just faced with tougher and tougher choices as the number of people arriving continues to increase, and we have no financial support and other support from the federal government.

Last night, there were families with young kids who arrived at the main entry point in Midtown Manhattan at 3 AM. It was very, very cold out.If Gov. Abbott cared at all about the humanity of these migrants, he would at least coordinate with New York. They don't. It makes it much harder. If we had cooperation nationally, I think we could manage this so no one wound up in the street so that everyone had humane treatment, but we're going to need help to pull that off.",

And there's been some reporting since then that, in fact, Hamas leaders no longer feel safe there and have been leaving there expressly for that reason. So I think that's a piece of it.Also, all the parties here, there was deep concern about expanding this war. And it's not clear that any of these parties necessarily want that today. Does Israel want it at some point? Perhaps. There are certainly members of the government that talk about going into southern Lebanon at some point that does not appear to be the position of the war cabinet, the unity government at this point. Are there members of Hezbollah who would like to go to war with Israel? Possibly. Are there members of the Iranian government? But at this point, based on the level of military action, for instance, at that border between Israel and Lebanon, it seems that both sides are trying to keep it below a threshold of a broader conflict. Now, the trouble is, those thresholds are movable. And my perception of the threshold might be different from yours and my perception of what is breaking that threshold might be different from yours.
