I'm Dana Bash in Washington, where the state of our union is sickened and heartbroken.Americans are grieving today and they are demanding change, with protesters taking to the streets and cities across the U.S., spurred by the sight of five police officers mercilessly beating Tyre Nichols while he calls for his mother and begs to go home. On Saturday, the Memphis Police Department disbanded the so-called Scorpion unit, whose officers, ironically, had focused on areas of rising violent crime. Of course, five members of that unit are now the ones charged with second-degree murder in Tyre's death. There are still a lot of outstanding questions about the reason he was pulled over and whether anyone else will be charged in his death and also why an initial police statement downplayed the horror that we have all now seen on tape, officers intensely, aggressively going in hot from the moment they pulled Tyre Nichols over. I want to warn you, the footage you're about to see is extremely disturbing and include some graphic language. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

We want to make sure, for example, all our law enforcement officers are seeing that video, understanding what happened, what -- where those failures really were.

In New Hampshire, we have one centralized training facility for local and state enforcement. So it allows us -- when we change one of our processes, it makes sure that it goes to the whole system. Not every state does it that way.
