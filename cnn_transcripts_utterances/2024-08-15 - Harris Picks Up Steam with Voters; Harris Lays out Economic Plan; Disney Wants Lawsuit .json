And I want you to look at their voting patterns, who they want for president.Now, let's go back to June. What we saw was 28 percent of those folks were going for Joe Biden compared to 19 percent who said they were going for Donald Trump. Now that Kamala Harris is the Democratic nominee, look at her support among them. Look at this, 53 percent say Kamala Harris. Look at that jump. That's a jump of 25 points. Donald Trump has gone in the other direction, down to 11 points. And now we're looking at, what is that, John, that is a 42-point advantage among the folks who dislike Joe Biden and Donald Trump for Kamala Harris compared to just that nine point advantage that Joe Biden had back in June. This, of course, is of substantial portion of the electorate. Before Kamala Harris got in, this was going to be the group that was going to determine one way or another. And it may still be. And if it is, Kamala Harris has this massive advantage over this very key bloc in the election.",

These are people who somewhat disapproved of Joe Biden's job as president. Somewhat disapprove. And this is in the key battleground states of Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. Look at the advantage that Kamala Harris has with this group. Look at this. She's at 55 percent. Donald Trump is just at 36 percent.And this was a key bloc of voters back in the 2022 midterms. Normally when you see a president with a disapproval rating well north of 50 percent, you would think his party was in major trouble. But Democrats actually won that bloc by four points in a close race for the House, Democrats did. Look at Kamala Harris' advantage now though. It's 19 points. Well more than that four points that the House Democrats had back in 2022. And so, again, you're wondering, how is it that Kamala Harris is doing so well despite the fact that Joe Biden is so unpopular. It's because those people who are lukewarm on him, they don't like him, but they don't hate him, they are going in heavy numbers for Kamala Harris in those key battleground states of Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin.",

So, these are people who supported RFK Junior in July and now back - look at this, 39 percent of those who backed RFK Junior in July are now backing Kamala Harris. Way more than the 20 percent who are backing Donald Trump. Now, he's still getting 39 percent of them. But if you're only holding on to two-fifths of your support from July, you're falling through the floor, which RFK Junior is doing. But the key nugget here is Kamala Harris is picking up a slew of those voters who were disaffected, who said they were going to vote for a third party. They're no longer voting for a third party. By a two-to-one margin, they're voting for - say they're going to vote for Kamala Harris over Donald Trump.

I mean I think, if they want to run on the last four years and the economy being great as - as something that's going to convince voters to support them, all for it. Because the reality is, is that costs, while have been coming down - while they have been coming down the last few months, they're still way higher than they were four years ago. I mean were still having this housing crisis where people are paying thousands of dollars more per month in rent because they can't afford a house because that - the mortgage rates are too high. And groceries. I mean I know that - that Kamala is going to be talking about price gouging, et cetera, but they're not looking at the bigger picture in terms of, you know, the supply chain and how everything that the government does influences the prices of each step of the way in the process. And so, yes, you can go after corporations for price gouging, but how are you going to stop, you know, the - the increasing costs or the elevated costs for actually delivering the food to the shelves in the grocery stores? I mean that's a big chunk of price there as well. And so I think what they have to do, what Kamala has to do, is she does have to go into detail. And for once we'd like to see some more recognition that, hey, you are feeling the crunch at the - at the grocery store, at the gas pump, in your homes and everyday life, not sitting there telling us how the economy is great because we all - we all live it.

They're contractual agreements between the companies and the consumer.That being said, there is a degree of, you read the contract and whether or not it's reasonable, that it's going to extend to other rights outside of those user agreements, or what would be what's called conscionable, meaning, it's not that you can necessarily sign your life away because you want to watch television through an app. There's going to be limits to how far these companies can extend those obligations.
