Well, this is the scene in France where President EmmanuelMacron is holding a tribute to French, resistance fighters on the eve of the 80th anniversary of D-Day. It's 3 pm in Normandy in France, its 5 pm here in Abu Dhabi in the UAE. I'm Becky Anderson. You're watching \"Connect the World\". Also happening this hour, police are investigating a shooting outside the U.S. Embassy in Lebanon as tensions between Israel and Lebanon hit their highest in months. Nearly 10 years after being acquitted of the murder of her roommate in Italy Amanda Knox was back in an Italian court earlier. We're live in Rome to find out why. And the Hunter Biden trial is restarting as we speak the son of the U.S. President facing felony gun charges. And the markets in New York will open in about 30 minutes from now, looking at the arrows on the futures markets at least. Well it is a positive look all pointing higher which is a change of course after yesterday's sea of red. We will check back in at 9:30 Eastern time. We begin with news developing in Lebanon that is indicative of a region on edge. A man has been arrested after shots were fired outside the U.S. Embassy in Lebanon. That is according to officials there who say the suspect was taken to hospital. We're hearing the suspect's brother has been detained or coincidentally this happened as the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu made a visit near the Lebanese border on the southern side. Of course, more than his country is prepared for intense action there. Let's get more details of that shooting. CNN's Ben Wedeman has reported extensively from Lebanon over the years. He joins me tonight out of Rome. What do we know about this search shooting at this point? What are the details?",

It's in it hilltop near the town of Awkar, which is north east of the Lebanese capital. We understand that small arms were fired in this incident that didn't involve one gunman. We've seen video he does seem to be wearing body armor. Now according to the Lebanese army, he has been injured and has undergone surgery. We don't know anything about the identity of the gunman himself. But we understand according to the Lebanese official, national news agency that his brother has been detained as well as another individual simply identified as MJ. The brother and this so called MJ are described as Syrian nationals. Now Najib Mikati, the caretaker Lebanese Prime Minister has said an intensive investigation is underway into this incident. The U.S. Embassy put out a statement saying that all staff was well that the Lebanese security forces and embassy security reacted rapidly to this incident. There was no damage to the facility itself. Now, it's important to keep in mind that tensions have been running very high in Lebanon since the seventh of October. In the initial weeks of the war in Gaza, we saw some very chaotic demonstrations at the hill -- at the bottom of the hill, leading up to the U.S. Embassy where there were some intense clashes between demonstrators and Lebanese security forces. And of course, the border between Israel and Lebanon has seen almost daily exchanges of fire between Hezbollah, other Lebanese factions and Israeli forces on the other side of the border, Becky.",

Now, you mentioned the Israelis who have been displaced and almost similar number of -- 94,000 Lebanese civilians have been displaced from the southern area of Lebanon. More than 400 people have been killed. That includes fighters as well as Lebanese civilians as since these hostilities began. Now the United States, France, Egypt, Qatar, are trying to work out some sort of arrangement on the border to end these hostilities. But we've heard warnings that the Israelis are running out of patience if these hostilities continue. The pressure is mounting on the government of Benjamin Netanyahu to do something decisive which many people in Lebanon are reading is an attack, a large military offensive, Becky.",

The Al-Aqsa Martyrs hospital saying 65 people were killed in Deir El-Balah. Women and children are said to be among the victims. The strike said to have come overnight as people slept. Israel says it targeted Hamas military facilities. This is the U.S. CIA Chief and Middle East Envoy head to the region to give a new push to these ceasefire efforts. Mediated Qatar says it's waiting for Hamas to respond to that proposal outlined by President Joe Biden, last week. CNN's Nada Bashir joins me now with more. And look, we've got two faces on the screen. So we've got Brett McGurk and Bill Burns, these are two storage diplomats. These are people who, you know, from the U.S. administration probably know this region of the world better than anybody. Biden is got his big guns out around the region, once again, trying to affect, trying to use the U.S. heft to affect a ceasefire deal, at present. But I have to say all of us who are talking to our sources around the region, are well aware that from the Hamas side, they see no guarantees that this proposal provides a permanent ceasefire. And that is what they want and from the Israeli side, despite this being sold as an Israeli proposal. Ultimately, we don't have word from the Israeli side that they are also in any way signed up to this. Aware to things, how much closer if at all, are we to a deal at this point?",

For now though, when we expect President McConnell here shortly to begin his speech. He began the day earlier in Brittany, Becky, paying homage to the resistors, all sorts of parachutes', who played such an important role in the success of Operation Overlord, not just coming behind enemy lines, as the Allied Forces made their way on the beaches, but also getting the way of things like German communication centers and German supply lines up to the coast once D-Day had actually happened. Of course, also the civilian toll that was borne by France 50 to 70,000 civilians who were killed as a result of the allied bombings that allowed D-Day to be the success that it was. So of course, these commemorations mean an awful lot to this part of the world. The town that I'm standing in signed over McConnell due to speak so huge casualties on the night. Of the 5th to 6th of July, the local population had been worn through leaflets that were dropped by the air but it failed to arrive. Some 2000 civilians were killed in a town that became known as the town of ruins and stayed that way for some four years.

What it does, though, was very disappointing for her because she was hoping to clear her name of all charges related to the murder of Meredith Kercher. She went all the way up to the European Court of Human Rights, who ruled that Italy violated her rights, which is why this case was opened up again, which is why we had the hearing that ended today. And she gave really, you know, heartfelt testimony in Italian. You know, she hasn't been in Italy now, since 2012. But in Italian, she spoke to those judges today in her testimony, saying that she was just a young woman with an existential crisis, going through incredible stress. She was you know, her home she had become homeless because of the crime scene was in her home. She had all of these things going on. And so that is why she falsely accused her boss of the murder. She was under the stress. She had written a hand written sort of memorial or a diary entry in which this particular jury and to judge panel considered to see whether or not she really didn't mean to accuse him of the murder. You have to remember Patrick, remember the man she accused spent two weeks in prison. Innocent man was released them because there was absolutely no evidence against a really good day. A man from the Ivory Coast ended up being convicted of the crime serving 13 years. He's out of prison already. And yet the case of Amanda Knox still goes on.

NASA will try for a third time to launch Boeing's Starliner space craft with a crew onboard. Now these two astronauts are headed for the International Space Station where the conditions 90 percent favorable were told for this morning's launch. This has been 10 years in the making as Boeing developed a spaceship to compete with Space X. Well CNN's Space and Defense Correspondent Kristin Fisher joins me from Florida. Kristin, let's just start with how this is looking. Are we on time for a launch at this point? KRISTIN FISHER, CNN SPACE &amp; DEFENSE CORRESPONDENT: So far Becky, all systems are going for launch. You can see the countdown clock just behind me where exactly 1 hour and 15 minutes away. The weather looks good. 90 percent favorable, none of those high winds that we saw during that second scrub attempt on Saturday. And then in terms of the rocket itself, I think it's important for everybody to remember that even though this is a Boeing Starliner spacecraft. I've got a little model here though, model here that will help explain things. It's a slightly outdated, Becky, so bear with me, but this is the only part that's made entirely by Boeing. This is the Boeing Starliner spacecraft. This is where the two NASA astronauts Suni Williams and Butch Wilmore are right now the hatches just closed. There were no problems with the Boeing Starliner spacecraft on Saturday during that second scrub ordering the first scrub back in early May. This is the United Launch Alliance's Atlas V rocket, different company. This is what propels the Boeing Starliner spacecraft in this space. There was an issue with this part of it called the Cygnus. And there was an issue with this part back in May during the first scrub but what happened on Saturday, Becky, had nothing to do with any of this. The hardware was perfectly fine. The issue was with a troublesome ground computer. They have since fixed it and they say they are going for launch. So Becky, as of now all systems go.",

He was taking medication that helps him get through the match. But he walks off court and said he was very much going to need to assess the situation. Scans showed that it was far more serious than he initially thought. And so what it means is there are now serious question marks about what happens next. Will he be fit for Wimbledon? Will he be fit for the Olympics, which we know is an event that means so much to him? He's very boldly said he wants to get that gold medal around his neck.
