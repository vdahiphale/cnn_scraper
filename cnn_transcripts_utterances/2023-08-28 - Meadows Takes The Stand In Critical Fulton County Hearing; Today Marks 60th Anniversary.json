After four years of packing the courts with Federalist Society bloggers, someone like Mark Meadows is going to feel a lot more comfortable in federal court.

He's very much in the mold of Donald Trump in that way, and he's absolutely not backing down at all. In fact, yesterday after he was on with me, he tweeted out a repeat of his original comments. He said -- you see, he was referring to our interview, \"The remedy to past discrimination is present discrimination\". That was a reference to Ibram Kendi, somebody who Ramaswamy referenced on the campaign trail. And then again, \"We don't want any more brown faces that don't want to be a brown voice\". Again, a reference to Ayanna Pressley, he's quoting her. \"It's racist. It make the grand wizard of the KKK proud. It's driving reactionary attacks. It needs to end\".",

When you showed images of the 60th anniversary of the march on Washington, you see Biden is inviting the members of the family to the Oval Office, which is actually historically significant because JFK did the same thing today, 60 years ago.And then you also hear those comments. It's just it's hard to wrap your head around it, specifically because I remember talking to voters last week in Milwaukee, Republican voters, and I remember one man telling me he was very interested in Mr. Ramaswamy, and he said he was youthful and he kind of represents a Trumpian spirit. So it also tells you that even if Trump is wrapped up in court cases, he is the frontrunner. But if he's wrapped up in court dates and isn't the nominee, there is still an appetite for folks in the Republican Party who don't back down and say things and don't try to, you know, amend their statements.

His name is Ed Sisco (ph). He managed a lot of the legal process relating to -- responding to the investigations into Benghazi as well as the solar energy company, Solyndra. So he's very familiar with this. I think more broadly, what's important to note is this is a White House that has long believed that House Republicans are going to overplay their hand.

That's when, for Kevin McCarthy, this inherent tension becomes much more difficult because it's one thing for Kevin McCarthy to constantly placate the right wing of his party until you get to election season.
