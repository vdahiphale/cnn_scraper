Nikki Haley continued her language and you contrast that with Tim Scott, the senator from South Carolina who actually I think doubled down on a -- on a more significant position on abortion.That will be interesting to some Republican voters, but probably not entirely helpful as he looks toward the general election.

So that may not be the strongest argument. And I'm not even sure that was a strong argument to start with. I think a lot of Republican primary voters sort of shrugged their shoulders and said, well, look, we have a guy who actually did win the presidency of Donald Trump versus somebody who is trying to win the presidency for the first time and Ron DeSantis or Nikki Haley.So, the argument about electability, I'm not really sure that that is one that a lot of Republican primary voters put a lot of stock in. The reality is this. The reason why Donald Trump is running so well against Joe Biden right now is because a lot of voters are focused on the President's economic record, they're dissatisfied with their personal economic condition here in the United States. And so, Biden's numbers as a result have really suffered. That may change as the campaign defines itself a little bit more as it comes down to Trump versus Biden. Things may become a little bit more clear. But for now, at least, the President is suffering under the weight of what are some very difficult polling numbers, in part because of people's considerations about the economy.",

Obviously the most convenient, and the most logical administration that would follow and this is what the Secretary of State was articulating is that the Palestinian Authority would come back and retake control of the Gaza Strip, which it had between 2005 until 2007 when Hamas violently removed it from power there.But there are a few problems with that supposition. It's not going to be easy, because first of all, the Palestinian Authority is weak. It's unpopular. It is widely viewed as corrupt. It lacks legitimacy. President Mahmoud Abbas of the Palestinian Authority, which administers parts of the West Bank, the Israeli-occupied West Bank, he is in the 19th year of a four-year term. And he's hardly going to want to add to that laundry list by being seemed to be some kind of puppet of the Israelis or the U.S. by going into the Gaza Strip and taking control there as well. Although he did say that he would consider doing so when he met with Secretary of State Antony Blinken but only as part of a broader political agreement that would lead towards an independent Palestinian state on land occupied by Israel in 1967 and with East Jerusalem as its capital. But that of course, right now seems pretty fanciful. And we can speculate about the other options, perhaps some kind of international peacekeeping force, perhaps led by Arab allies of the United States and Israel. But right now, Israel is very much focused on this war, on destroying Hamas militarily so that it can never again perpetrate a massacre of the saw that he did on October the 7th or threaten Israeli civilians with rockets. And also, politically as well. Israel says it's making progress on that objective. It says overnight that it was -- that there was a 10-hour firefight, in which it took over what it describes as a military stronghold In Jabalia and that it recovered weapons and destroy tunnel shafts and kill come Hamas militants and the like. It says it's making progress. But it's clear that, you know, this war has still got a lot of time to run. And although it's very useful and probably advisable to start thinking about what comes next, I think that it's still quite a long way to go.

There have been over 40 such attacks in recent weeks since October 17 by Iran-backed proxy groups on U.S. and coalition bases in Iraq and Syria.And the US says they conducted this strike which is the second in just over two weeks on these kinds of weapons storage facilities in Syria, in order to degrade Iran and its proxies' ability to carry out these attacks in the future. They said that there's targeting this infrastructure in order to send a message to the Iranians that these attacks will not be tolerated and also to destroy their weapons stockpile. Now, Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin did release a statement about this and said that this strike was carried out in self-defense, it is a precision strike. And he emphasized that the U.S. does not want to see this war expand any further but that the U.S. is committed to defending its troops and that it will do so in every possible scenario. And so, Secretary Austin, other defense officials really emphasizing that they are carrying out these strikes in limited self- defense in order to destroy Iranian weapons supplies. But that this does not indicate a broader desire by the U.S. to escalate the conflict any further. However, all of this comes on the same day that Houthis in Yemen, who are backed by Iran. They shot down an M.Q.-9 Reaper drone that was carrying out surveillance activities over at the Red Sea. And so, this conflict obviously -- the U.S. is very concerned that it could spiral, that it could expand but right now we're doing everything possible to take limited steps to try to defend U.S. troops as well as degrade this Iranian proxy group's ability to attack us forces in the future.

There's a debate within the Republican Party about how to deal with it. There's also a debate about the top of the ticket. One of Donald Trump's closest allies on Capitol Hill, Marjorie Taylor Greene, made clear to me that she believes that Republicans are losing in part because they are not embracing Donald Trump. REP. MARJORIE TAYLOR GREENE (R-GA): There is multiple problems. One of them is being that I think Republicans are weak. They never come through on the promises that they give to their voters. Stop backing away from President Trump. He's winning the primary by massive numbers. He is winning the polling for the general election. Clearly, people like President Trump and his policies. So I think there should be changes.",

Five Republican presidential candidates appeared in Miami on Wednesday night for the third televised debate, just two months ahead of the Iowa caucuses. Frontrunner Donald Trump didn't attend. Now, on foreign policy, the candidates were mostly in alignment with support for Israel in the country's war with Hamas, but there were stark differences about giving more support with Ukraine.And at times, the debate got personal. Listen to Nikki Haley as she responded to Vivek Ramaswamy in one particularly heated exchange about the controversial app, TikTok. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) VIVEK RAMASWAMY, (R) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I want to laugh at why Nikki Haley didn't answer your question, which was about looking at families in the eye. In the last debate, she made fun of me for actually joining TikTok, while her own daughter was actually using the app for a long time. So, you might want to take care of your family first before preaching to anybody else.

So, he walks a very fine line.

The New York Attorney General says Ivanka was cordial and very courteous in court, unlike her brothers and father. But she says, Ivanka's testimony raises questions about her credibility. Kara Scannell has the latest.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) KARA SCANNELL, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (on camera): The New York Attorney General's Office rested their case today after calling their final witness, Ivanka Trump. She was on the stand all day long and the focus of her questioning had to do with her involvement in two loans that she shepherded at the Trump Organization for the golf course in Florida as well as the old Post Office Building in Washington, D.C. So Ivanka Trump testified that she was involved in the loans at a high- level, but she said with the nitty-gritty details, she didn't recall much of that information. And these loans are the center to the case because the attorney general's office has alleged that the banks received false financial information on their statements, and that they provided better interest rates to enrich the Trumps. So that is part of the questioning today that they really focused her in on. They also asked her about an apartment that she owns in Manhattan. She had a option to buy that apartment for about $8.5 million one year. On Trump's personal financial statements, that apartment was reflected with a value more than twice as much, north of $20 million. She was asked about that and she said she was not privy to her father's financial statements, did not know what went into them. Distancing herself from them, just as her brothers Don Jr. and Eric Trump did when they testified last week. So after she completed her testimony, the AG's Office rested their case. Here's what the New York Attorney General Letitia James said outside of court. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
