So, I do think that the president like has a point and he's noticing the same thing, some viewers are seeing. But just because it's happening at some publications, maybe Time Magazine is another example. You know, Time was flattering Trump yesterday. He returned the flattery toward Time. We're seeing that at some places. We're not seeing that at all. And most importantly, it's got to be driven by the reporting and by the facts.

What they have to gain, you know, Meta, there's a ban on TikTok that Congress has passed. Trump may have some say over whether that takes effect or not. Excuse me. Meta stands to benefit greatly if TikTok is banned, they also, you know, during his first administration, Trump repeatedly threatened social media companies with revoking Section 230. This is the liability shield for content that they distribute online. Whether they, whether he will go after that again may depend in part on whether he stands to benefit.

In New York State in 2022, so this is a very fragile vaccine ecosystem and these illnesses can come roaring back, and it's all based on nonsense. We've been at this for 25 years, and RFK Jr. is one of the lead anti- vaccine activists pushing this discredited theory. And he keeps moving the goalposts on what he says is the reason for autism. At first, in the late 1990s, early 2000s, they said it was the measles, mumps, rubella vaccine. That was disproven through large epidemiological studies. And then Robert F. Kennedy Jr., in 2005, wrote an article in Rolling Stone Magazine and Salon claiming it was thimerosal preservative. That was debunked again, through large epidemiologic studies and even non-human primate studies. Then they switched it up and said it was spacing vaccines too close together. So it became this kind of whack a mole game. Then another one would pop up that it was aluminum  vaccines. Then they switched for a while to HPV vaccine for cervical cancer and other cancers. They said it was causing infertility and autoimmunity. So, they keep on moving the goal posts, and each time the scientific community puts enormous resources into debunking the claims.",

We have over a hundred autism genes now. We have the gene, for instance, for my daughter, Rachel's autism and intellectual disabilities. So, autism is a series of neurodevelopmental processes that begin before the baby's born, before a baby ever sees the vaccines, and then they continue to accelerate. Interestingly, I did mention to him because he did have a history as being an environmental attorney. By the way, there are medications. If you take them early in pregnancy, they could affect the autism genes and cause conditions that resemble autism after birth. For instance, valproic acid, an anti-seizure medication, does that if you give it early in pregnancy. And he had no interest in that, and he still kept on pushing the fake vaccine narrative.
