      "sentences": "All right. Donald Trump is headed to the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania today, what might be the most important state in the race to 270 electoral votes. Why? This is the map that would look like if Kamala Harris won all the states that Joe Biden did last time -- 303 electoral votes.This time, 2024, the Harris campaign -- pretty much everyone thinks her clearest and easiest path to victory would be the so-called blue wall states in the north -- Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin. Why? Part of it is a simple math thing. If she wins these three states but still loses the other swing states right now -- Georgia, Arizona, Nevada -- she still wins. She's still at 270 electoral votes. Let's take them one-by-one here, OK? Let's just look Wisconsin to start out -- Wisconsin to start. Why is it circling like that? Wisconsin to start off here. OK, if she were to lose Wisconsin what would need to happen? Loses Wisconsin -- all she would need to do, and I'm not saying it's easy, is win Arizona and she's back to 270 electoral votes. She wins. Let's talk about Michigan. What would happen if, for instance, she lost in Michigan and flipped Wisconsin back to blue? Flip Wisconsin back to blue. You flip Michigan to red. What would she need to do in theory? North Carolina -- no Democrat has won since Barack Obama. But if she did, she would get to 270 electoral votes. Let's flip this back and talk about Pennsylvania. This is where the rubber meets the road. If Harris were to lose Pennsylvania, she would need to win a combination of two of the remaining swing states, and not just any two. Because she could win Nevada and Arizona and still lose the election if she loses Pennsylvania. She would need to win a combination of probably something like Georgia -- Georgia here and Nevada. That would get her to 273 electoral votes. But it's a hard path. You can see why Pennsylvania is so hard, and so challenging, and so important for the Harris campaign -- Kate. KATE BOLDUAN, CNN ANCHOR:  And when it comes to that race to 270, we have just one week to go before the votes start being counted. And the candidates, as part of this, are focusing on their closing arguments right now. Vice President Kamala Harris giving a primetime speech at the Ellipse this evening. Donald Trump is headed to Allentown, Pennsylvania. John is talking about Pennsylvania. And just as his campaign is struggling to contain the anger sparked by the racist jokes told by one of the warm-up acts at his rally on Sunday. Let's talk about all of this right now. Joining us right now, Democratic strategist Julie Roginsky, and Republican strategist Matt Gorman all together in the studio. This is very nice. OK, so the backlash, Matt, it's -- it is growing -- the fallout from the remarks coming from that warm-up act from the Madison Square Garden rally. Part of it -- I was just seeing from Politico reporting this morning about a letter that they have seen exclusively shared by the president of the Pennsylvania chapter of the National Puerto Rican Agenda. It's a nonpartisan group. And this president saying this. They're urging Pennsylvania Puerto Ricans now not to vote for Donald Trump, saying \"I'm not a Republican, I'm not a Democrat, I'm an Independent. But at this point, it's not about political, partisan issues. It is about the respect and honor our Puerto Rican and Latinos deserved as citizens and legal residents of this country. That's the issue.\" And some estimates are there are 300,000 Puerto Ricans that live in Pennsylvania. Is this a real problem? MATT GORMAN, FORMER SENIOR ADVISER, TIM SCOTT'S PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN, REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST:  I think a couple of things. I think what you're seeing today with the press conference, it is a classic Trump P.R. move to reset the headlines out of this, and we've seen this numerous times over the years. So I think is what you're seeing, number one, here. I think a couple of things. I would be very surprised, just candidly, after a decade of all of that he's done and said and four years of the presidency that finally this -- like, from a comedian who no one has heard of, except for the Tom Brady Netflix roast, is going to change votes. And honestly, on a more factual level -- I'm not trying to be flip -- but the guy was shot in the head and the polls really didn't move. I would be surprised if this was the thing that actually tipped it one way or the other.",

And it's also huge with the holiday travel rush on the horizon. Hard to believe that we are 30 days until Thanksgiving.Change is music to the ears of consumer advocates and also Transportation Sec. Pete Buttigieg who originally announced this back in April. Known officially as the Automatic Refund Provision, the Department of Transportation says this is now fully in effect as of just yesterday. Here's what it means. If your flight gets canceled or significantly delayed -- more on that in a second -- the airline must give you money back automatically. This is big because airlines have long offered vouchers or credits for you to use on a later flight. So this is, in essence, a cash refund. A little bit of fine print here though. If the airline rebooks you on a different flight, you must not accept that rebooking or any other compensation the airline offers you. Bottom line, choose not to fly, you get your money back. The big change here is that this also defined what is a significant delay. If you're on a domestic flight that's going to be three hours late, an international flight, more than six hours late, you now qualify for a full refund. The big question that you asked at the top -- how fast are you getting your money back? It really depends on how you pay. The requirement says the airline must refund you within seven business days if you paid with a credit card; 20 calendar days if you used another form of payment. And the pushback on this initially came from the airlines who said this would be overly complicated for them to implement. But Transportation Sec. Pete Buttigieg, in announcing this is a post on X, said passengers deserve to get their money back when an airline owns them without headaches or haggling. He really put airlines on notice back in July telling them to make it super clear to passengers when they are entitled to a refund. This is really blowing up on social media and on TikTok. So many people are happy to hear this who have been caught up in the cancellations and delays that were really big in 2021 and 2022. But the good news here is that airlines are doing much better. The cancellation rate was about one percent of all flights.",

The Uncommitted movement has made clear from the beginning that Trump is not right for our communities and not right for the anti -- for anti -- for the anti-war movement in this country. He wants Netanyahu \"finish the job.\" It's clear to us that he's a purveyor of hate and white supremacy who is actively preying on the pain of Arab and Muslim American voters right now. And it's resonating not because he's particularly convincing but because he's filling a void that's being left by Harris' actions on this issue -- the absence of support for families like my own who have family in Lebanon right now or we have family in Gaza or the West Bank right now who are on the receiving end of U.S. weapons that are being used illegally to harm and kill civilians. So while I agree with the senator, as a Democratic strategist and as someone who is in a swing state who is voting for Harris against Trump, I'm still terrified by the vacuum that she's leaving.

Thirty-seven cents cheaper from this time last year.And GasBuddy's Patrick De Haan -- he tells me that in the next seven to 12 days the national average is very likely to break below $3.00 a gallon for the first time in 3 1/2 years. Now, this is a big deal because a lot of people view gas prices as sort of a real time barometer into the cost of living. And remember, it was just two years ago when the most visible part of the inflation crisis was gasoline prices spiking above $5.00 a gallon for the first time ever. I mean, this was a nightmare for consumers. And it was a disaster politically for the Biden-Harris administration even though a lot of it was caused by Russia's invasion of Ukraine. But U.S. officials had to scramble to release emergency oil to try to put out the fire. Thankfully, we are a long way from that right now. Gas prices are much lower than they were at that point. And look, battleground voters -- right now they are experiencing much cheaper gas than they were 12 months ago, including in Nevada, 79 cents cheaper. Arizona, 78 cents -- Pennsylvania, Wisconsin.

He served four months behind bars for contempt of Congress charges. Bannon had refused to comply with a subpoena from the House committee that investigated the January 6 attack on the Capitol.He's expected to hold a new conference today and he plans to resume his political podcast. Michigan quarter Jack Tuttle says he's quitting football because of concussions and other health issues. The 25-year-old says he recently had his fifth concussion and needs to prioritize his health. He now hopes to go into coaching. Last week, North Carolina State's quarterback also retired from football over concussions. As you know, repeated concussions can cause traumatic brain injury. All right, thinking of Thanksgiving already a month out? Target is -- it just announced its Thanksgiving meal will be five bucks cheaper for a grand total of 20 bucks -- $20.00. The spread is for four people and includes a frozen turkey and some sides, like potatoes and stuffing mix. Aldi and Walmart are also cutting the cost of their Thanksgiving meal bundles kicking off the holiday price war -- John.",

Othel Moore Jr. died nearly a year ago while in the Jefferson City Correctional facility. He was serving a 30-year sentence on a range of charges.Now, the video appears to begin after he had been pepper-sprayed during a sweep for contraband. Now, four officers are charged in his death. CNN's Omar Jimenez has been doing amazing reporting on this. And Omar, you can explain what we're seeing here and why.",

So what you're seeing on your screen there -- this is at the Jefferson City Correctional Center. Right at that moment -- this is after the county prosecutor told us Othel Moore Jr. was pepper-sprayed during a sweep for contraband and these officers essentially were adding restraints to him. So we are now seeing him wheeled out. His legs are restrained. He's got things over his face as well to -- what some have said were masks that an inmate -- a former inmate who spoke to us who said he witnessed it said that it restricted his breathing, and he was yelling \"I can't breathe.\" This video does not have any audio. And in this second part of the video he's wheeled into essentially what's known as a dry cell, and he's really just left there after this. And he is still -- as you watch this video, he is still heavily restrained from his feet down. He has head gear over his face. He has a mask over his face as well. And then the door closes and essentially -- we're not going to play the whole thing, but while he is in there you see at points he's moving back and forth and then nothing. And then that is the lasting image that you see. And a guard -- an employee does eventually come and check right there and goes and signals for other help, but it was over 30 minutes past from when he was first wheeled in there to when help finally arrives. They checked for vitals but essentially did not -- did not seem like they were able to do so successfully. He was declared dead that day. And as I mentioned, four now-former corrections officers charged with murder as a result. They pleaded not guilty.",
