It is a sobering reality check for President Biden, tough performance grades and a big wow on the question of deserving four more years plus, a simply blockbuster, bombshell report.Get this, Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas did not disclose luxury trips around the world worth hundreds of 1000s of dollars paid for by a billionaire conservative activist. And protest and controversy right now in Tennessee. Three Democrats in the legislature could soon be expelled for staging a gun reform protests on the floor of the statehouse and today, they are still making their case for change. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) STATE REP. JUSTIN JONES (D-TN): We are making this political statement today but trying to act like we're doing something that is not going to do anything to prevent what occurred. More police officers in schools. Yesterday passed the bill to arm teachers, this is not going to make our students safe. And I think that we owe it to these young people, the 1000s here, who we who we tried to speak for when we were silence, the 1000s who are gathered outside demanding that we take real action to address the crisis of easy access to military grade weapons in this state. And so with that, I must say that I cannot support this bill, because this bill is a band aid. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

The numbers are beyond sobering for President Biden.They tell us many or in some cases, most of you have deep doubts about his performance and about the direction of the country right now. It is April 2023. So a very long way to November 2024. So consider these numbers, just an early campaign baseline. But it's an important but they are still quite telling about your mood. And the challenges facing the 80-year old incumbent. Our CNN political director, David Chalian here with us to unveil the numbers. David, what do they tell us?",

But we asked the American people if he deserves reelection, if he deserves a second term. 32 percent just a third of Americans in this poll, John, say yes, Joe Biden deserves to be reelected.When we asked that back in December, it was up at 37 percent. So he's lost a little bit of ground here. And we've noticed what's driving that is young voters, liberals, some people that should be naturally in a D versus R world, in Joe Biden's camp. So he'll have some work to do on his own side of the fence before he can actually convince the broad middle of the country. Take a look at his overall approval rating in this poll. 42 percent approve, 57 percent disapprove, how does that stack up in his recent trend? Well, he really doesn't move all that much as you can see here, it sort of operates within a narrow band. But you see here, John, this is November. This is right after that midterm election where Democrats performed a little better than anticipated, he got a bit of a bump from that that uptick is no more, that has stalled out where we have his approval today. And then we looked at his overall approval on some of the major issues of the day. And I think what's interesting here is the economy, 37 percent approval, immigration 35 percent. He's underperforming his overall job approval on a slew of issues only on the environment at 46 percent approval does he actually overperformed that overall 42 percent John -- job approval, John.",

If you -- if the Democrats would say well wait, if he's running against Trump, or if he's running against DeSantis, but as a candidate, your first deal with your issues, how much of this is him?

They aren't familiar with the infrastructure plan. And yes, he gets a lot of local news coverage. He went to Minnesota this week. So there are going to be some projects happening by the time that the election comes around. But there is no sense that he has been able to sort of grab people and show that he has the confidence for the job. This is different than any reelection, we've covered, obviously. Joe Biden's biggest challenge, in many respects, at least now is Joe Biden, trying to articulate that message and his advisors, some Democrats have been smiling this week at all the Donald Trump stuff. But the wiser ones, I think, or not necessarily because the excitement, and the attention is on Joe Biden. And we don't know how a 2020 campaign will be if it becomes them. It's way too early to assume that. But we should not necessarily assume that it would have the same outcome. The excitement factor is just not there for Joe Biden, maybe he can change that.

This was all conducted in the month of March. So this is before except for one day of the sample. This is before the American people knew Donald Trump was indicted, they knew he was charged.But even before that, we've seen a rally around the president among Republicans, even before that. Donald Trump's standing, should he be the nominee, it was 38 percent in December of 22. It is now up to 52 percent. So Donald Trump's trajectory in the Republican primary is on the rise. It was even before the charges. So Biden's got things to deal with. At the moment if you're Trump, despite all these legal problems. I know it sounds backwards.

And people have been here all day letting their voices be heard.And you can see the crowds behind me but you could also see the crowds in the video, they wanted to go in the statehouse to make sure that the lawmakers heard their voice throughout this.

But the conversation should be about the victims who were involved in this, those victims who were just killed less than two weeks ago. So the idea here that we talked to so many parents, so many teachers who want their voices heard. They want some common sense gun laws put into place. But when you talk about what happened on the floor here, those three lawmakers spoke out of turn, they went on to the floor, they used a bullhorn, and the Republicans have now moved forward with this idea of all three of them could be expelled. Now, groups have been fighting hard to maybe stop this and say, look, you're not talking about gun violence. And that's something they would like to speak about today.

He would also likely be asked about threats he faced from Trump supporters on Capitol Hill that day. Now there is one area where he will not have to answer questions.
