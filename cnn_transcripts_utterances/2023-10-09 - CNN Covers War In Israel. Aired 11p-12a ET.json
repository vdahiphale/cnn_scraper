The Israeli military is going on offense against Hamas with the force Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vows will be like -- quote -- \"like never before\" after a devastating surprise attack that has left at least 900 people dead in Israel. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, PRIME MINISTER OF ISRAEL (through translator): We have begun, and I emphasize we have only begun to strike at Hamas.

And the Israeli prime minister in an address late Monday night making clear that he wants to eliminate Hamas, making clear that this military campaign that his government is now waging will be unprecedented in scale. And what really shows us that it is perhaps going to be unprecedented to the fullest extent is what has yet to come and what we are seeing building on the ground. More than 300,000 Israeli military reservists have been called up. We have seen tanks, artillery formations building up around the Gaza Strip, and all of this a potential sign, a potential sign that Israel could be preparing for some kind of ground invasion of Gaza, an invasion perhaps the biggest in scale since Israel withdrew from the Gaza Strip back in 2005. But what is clear amid all of this, we have watched the Israeli death toll has risen to over 900, according to Israeli defense forces. And in Gaza, we have watched as that Palestinian death toll has risen to over 680 individuals. And what we certainly know, every time there is a conflict between Israel and Gaza, innocent Palestinian civilians are so often caught in the middle with nowhere to really go, a few bomb shelters to speak of, and certainly we know that civilian casualties typically take their toll in these conflicts. [23:05:05] COATES: Jeremy Diamond, thank you so much. We'll keep with this. Please keep us informed. It has been one of the most shocking attacks in the first few days of this war. One was the assault of an all-night music festival in a rural area near the Gaza-Israel border. One minute, people -- they're dancing, they're celebrating the holiday of Sukkot. Then suddenly, you've got the sound of rockets, the sound of sirens followed by gunfire. At least 260 people were killed. Now, some survivors reportedly were taken hostage as well. Joining me now, Noa Frimer, who her friends -- they had been missing since the attack. Noah, thank you for joining us this evening. We're all watching what has happened.

And they went and they made the friends of them that -- they were at the party already. They told me they made a food for them and they waited for them. And last time, one friend was talking to Shiraz (ph) and she told him, we are at this place. They were in a place very close to the party and she said, we are hearing a bombing, we are hearing a shooting, people shooting at us. And the other girl, Celine (ph), she was texting with her husband, and she's writing to him like, yeah, they're shooting at us, they're shooting at us, we hear bombing. My friend said, I hear the powder, you know, the burning powder. They can smell everything. They feel everything. And Celine (ph) was telling her husband like, oh, I see soldiers, I see soldiers, I do like this. And since then, we never heard of them. We don't know either they kidnapped, either they not with us anymore. We don't know nothing. You know, we keep the faith, but we don't know. And it's like we don't sleep really since then.

A hostage rescue operation, there are a lot of things that can go wrong. I've looked at quite a number of those hostage operations by jihadist groups.

According to the Israeli Defense Forces, this was a command and control node for Hamas.Now, getting to who else is playing in this field, you have, of course, the area right here, this is Gaza. You have the Golan Heights, which is Israeli-occupied territory of Syria. And there's a large presence of pro-Iranian elements in Syria. The government itself is pro-Iranian. Hezbollah is here in Lebanon. And then you have Iran itself right over here. And all of these players are really part of a much bigger picture. They support Hamas. They support what Hamas is doing against Israel right now. And the risk is that it makes for a bigger conflagration, possibly in the future, with all of these forces coming to bear.

But the recent iteration, the war -- all the wars since 1973 have pitted Israel against militias, non-state actors, Hezbollah, Hamas, the PLO, and that is a much harder challenge than fighting another state as it did against Egypt and Syria in 1973 when there was an address to go to a government to deal with a peace process that could be negotiated with international partners.Israel has found that the absolutist ideologies of particularly Hezbollah and Hamas are much harder to deal with, that you can win temporarily, short-term, you can beat them back, destroy their arsenals, but they come back because they're based on fury and passion and religious ideology. And so, while Israel is bound to make significant military progress eventually, the question is, can it really win in conventional terms? And it's not even clear what winning would mean for Israel and even for a certain degree to what for Hamas. This is -- you know, this is going to be much more difficult, I think, than anything Israel has faced, at least since the war, its longest war with Hezbollah.

Peter, when you look at this stepping back, there's the immediate, almost knee-jerk reaction to say, it's unprecedented and it went undetected. How could they have not anticipated it? Is it that simple?",

About over a year later, much against the Bush administration's attempts to make sure it didn't happen, it became clear the CIA was constantly warning the Bush administration in the summer of 2001 about a possible attack, not clear where it was going to be, but the Bush administration really did nothing during that time period.Now, the Netanyahu government is going to come under considerable pressure from Israelis about how did this happen. My guess is that because this usually happens, you will see there's usually a lot of noise, but when you look back, there are a lot of signals that you missed. And something this big, surely there were signals that were missed and surely there will be pressure from the Israeli public to find out what happened and how this -- because it couldn't have come just without any kind of warning at all.",

Then there is the policy decision-makers who will act on the intelligence, who may or may not believe that it, in fact, is imminent.

Meanwhile, they were planning this attack. But Hamas has, prior to that, always signaled that they were going to carry something like this out.There has been criticism inside Israel that the Netanyahu government, which includes members of the West Bank settler movement, was too focused on the West Bank, militants in the West Bank, and that it was a concentration of resources on the wrong part of the country and a failure of imagination that a certain arrogance that they just didn't think Hamas would be able to do something like this.",
