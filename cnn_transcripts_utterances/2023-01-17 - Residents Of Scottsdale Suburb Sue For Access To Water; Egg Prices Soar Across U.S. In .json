There's simply not enough to go around. The mayor issuing a statement saying, quote, there is no Santa Claus. Water is not a compassion game. Now my team and I spend time in the Rio Verde Foothills as this water cut off deadline was looming.

So it's not within city limits. You have to drive up this dusty road to get there. It's unincorporated which basically means folks don't pay city taxes or get city services like water which people used to really see as a plus, you know, not a lot of government interference. Many would get their water from wells but those wells have been drying up in this mega drought. And so several hundred homes have been relying on hauled water. You saw the water delivery guy there in my interview, which up until January 1st, was purchased from nearby Scottsdale. But when drought conditions forced the federal government to declare a shortage in the Colorado River, reducing how much water Arizona could use, Scottsdale had to cut off the water deliveries to outside communities like Rio Verde to conserve water to meet its own resident's needs. So this wasn't a sudden surprise, Rio Verde had more than a year to come up with solutions, but neighbors and politicians couldn't agree on one. Developers, meanwhile, guys, kept building Maricopa County where Rio Verde is a part of, is one of the fastest growing counties in the nation. And right now in Rio Verde, people are not flushing the toilet or using rainwater to do that. They're not taking showers. And I have to say, this is an example of how climate change is changing life as we know it and what is potentially in store for the rest of us in the southwest, given that our rivers and reservoirs are continuing to shrink.
