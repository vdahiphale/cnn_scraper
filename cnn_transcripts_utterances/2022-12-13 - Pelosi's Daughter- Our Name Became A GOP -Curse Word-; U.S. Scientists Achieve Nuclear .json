But those of us were at the Capitol on January 6th, I think many of us had a moment of reconsideration of the way our politics has evolved, what it means now to be especially for the members of Congress, who obviously were the targets of the attacks on that day, that violence in our political culture has become more and more normalized with time and that there is a different meaning to being a public figure in public life than there really used to be. And then that's a real challenge to have to grapple with. And obviously, the Pelosi's felted in this very this personal way.",

So there's a little bit of sort of off message this between mother and daughter there about the ramifications of that tragedy. I saw the film last night there was a showing in Washington, look, it's not dispassionate. It's a daughter's tribute to her mother, obviously.But what it also is, John, is a great gift to future historians purely because of the footage, not just from the last year, we're talking 20 years of private clips of a towering historical figure, and somebody who, thankfully, we now have on tape at incredibly crucial moments over the past couple of decades, her raw, unfiltered comments. And I think it's going to be wonderful for the future.

I think it's so -- to Jonathan's point, it's so fascinating and to be able to have these behind the scenes, you know, looks at her because she is like, her instinct.

It was certainly how people described it to us from the outside of someone who has just incredibly sharp political instincts, in addition to frankly, and this is one of the rare things about her is that she also combines incredible legislative skills because building a legislative coalition and working the politics of getting a bill like the, you know, Affordable Care Act through the house to different set of skills than raw political ones.But what you saw there was her sort of campaign knows I'm in her describing how she thinks about it.

The end result technology that replicates the way the sun generates energy. It could, it could one day power our homes and our cars in a way that's free of greenhouse gas emissions and radioactive waste.Let's get some perspective now from the Astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson. He's the author of \"Starry Messenger: Cosmic Perspectives on Civilisation.\" Neil, grateful for your time today trying to understand the context here, what does this compare to, Neil Armstrong stepped on the moon, he said, you know, small step for men, giant step for mankind.

So we don't want this to be just a fast science experiment that doesn't then have ramifications on our civilization, and especially on our economy, and our environment.So the big step that remains to be taken is once this bit of physics has been demonstrated, which of course was announced today by the U.S. energy secretary and her team, that this would one day become something real, that is something portable, something that is the foundation of power plants, or ideally, and maybe it's not entirely science fiction, we remember from the film \"Back to the Future\" at the very end, Doc Brown returns with his modern flying car, and it's powered by nuclear fusion, home fusion the device on his hood of his car, and he pours in beer and some banana peels and things.

And I very much look forward to watching that unfold and watching the engineer. By the way, to get the physics done required its own feats of engineering. So that's a whole other I mean, you know, what a civilization without engineers in this world so I just look forward to that. There's so, there are a lot of advances where there was some people who liked it and wanted it and they did it anyway and fine. Like you said, it's -- their toys that have been invented by the genius of physicists and engineers.

And then once all of that is done and approved, it could start moving very quickly. We're told the announcement could come by the end of the week. Why is this so important? Well, the patriot is really the premier long range high altitude air defense system that the Ukrainians have wanted for months. And the U.S. has, shall we say been resisting sending.Now in the face of all the destruction we're seeing in Ukraine with the Russian missile attacks, it looks like the White House is changing its mind and moving ahead. So why is this system so important? You see the picture of the launchers there. What the patriot does is its radar locks on to an incoming Russian missile, launches its own missile to shoot down the Russian attack and it can do it at high altitude and long range. And that means if this all works, the Ukrainian forces can bring down those Russian missiles before they get close to population centers, to power plants to water generation plants, to bridges, to infrastructure, all the things that are causing such devastation across Ukraine. This is what the Ukrainian forces have been asking for. What will have to happen once this is all finalized is Ukraine forces will have to be trained. They are likely to grow to the facility, the U.S. Army runs in Griffin weird Germany, get the training, move back into Ukraine and set all this up. The big question of course, what will Vladimir Putin have to say about all of this, John?",
