This hour a pivotal moment for the world's second biggest Catholic countrywe're going to take a deep dive into what Mexico's ruling to decriminalize abortion means for the political and cultural trajectory of the country. First up, though, you're on the headlines this hour U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken announces a new billion dollar aid package for Ukraine during his visit to Kyiv. This is a Ukrainian drone strike. It's dangerously close to Russia's southern military headquarters. Rescuers are racing to save an ill American trapped in Turkey's third deepest cave. The man is stuck 1100 meters below ground. A new CNN polling spells trouble for U.S. President Joe Biden's reelection bid. His overall approval rating has dropped to 39 percent. Mexico's Supreme Court declaring that access to abortion is a human right, and any effort to stop it is unconstitutional. Now this push for reproductive health rights has been a long time in the making by feminists across the country as recently as 2017. Women there could face up to three years in prison for ending their pregnancy. Now it's worth remembering that Mexico is home to some 100 million Catholics the second largest Catholic population in the world just behind Brazil. So the significance for the court to rule that the abortion ban violates the human rights of women and people with the capacity to just state cannot be understated. Meantime, Mexico's ruling party and the leading opposition party have both named female candidates for the presidential election next year making it very likely that Mexico will have its first female leader come 2024. So tonight we ask are we seeing a new era of liberalization in Mexico. Well, CNN's Rafael Romo has been covering Latin America for us for many years, and he has his finger on the zeitgeist in Mexico. So let's start with what is a very simple question, Rafael. Is this a new era for Mexico?",

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ROMO (voice-over): The effort to decriminalize abortion in Mexico has been going on for years, especially in Mexico City where abortion rights groups have taken to the streets to say my body my decision. In fact, by the time the Mexican Supreme Court issued a ruling Wednesday decriminalizing abortion at the federal level 12 out of 32 states had already invalidated laws banning abortion. MARIA ANTONIETA ALCAIDE, IPAS/MEXICO AND CENTRAL AMERICA: Our reaction was of pure joy and celebration but also has been very proud of being part of this green wave this movement that has been working to advance the abortion agenda. ROMO (voice-over): In a statement the court said that banning an abortion is unconstitutional because it violates the human rights of women and people with the capacity to gestate. Anti-abortion groups in Mexico blasted the ruling. ALICIA GALVAN, PRESIDENT &amp; FOUNDER, PATRIA UNIDA FOUNDATION: There are millions more Mexicans who are in favor of life from the moment of conception until natural death. ROMO (voice-over): The Supreme Court first ruled that it was unconstitutional to criminalize abortion in 2021. Same day the ground shook in Mexico.

ROMO (on camera): Well, at this point, Becky, I would say that it is pretty much a given and we have seen how women have rose in the political ranks in the country. The main political coalition that in the coalition of President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has announced already that Claudia Sheinbaum, Former Mayor of Mexico City is running for president, they have already chosen her. And then the other woman you see on screen there. Xochitl Galvez she's a Senator from the PIN another political party and she is running for a coalition of the three main opposition parties. So the question for Mexicans next year when they go to the polls, it's not going to be whether it should be a woman, but it's going to be which one of the two who are running should be the next Mexican President.",

That is some 753 million people. Well this hour, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken is wrapping up his trip to Ukraine. He spent the past two days stressing that his country's unwavering commitment to helping Ukraine sustain and improve its democracy while defending itself against Russia. Blinken's visit comes as U.S. President Joe Biden prepares to head to India to the G20 Summit.

We asked an open ended question, what's your biggest concern about his candidacy? 49 percent of his fellow partisan said his age 7 percent mental sharpness, 7 percent health 7 percent ability to do the job, that's all of a piece there, obviously.

And so, whether it'd be in the dub, where we've got 260,000 refugees, who have fled from Somalia, but we've also seen the situation where we've just had 100,000 refugees fleeing from Sudan to Chad. And so they're moving from a situation which is where they've been able to manage -- the flee of the conflict, find safety. But then they're moving into an environment which is extremely hostile, where they don't have shelter, where they don't have water, where they don't have food. And this situation is just going to become even more hostile, more tragic, more perilous. And so, what we do require is not only humanitarian support, we need agencies like not only like UNHCR to be supported, but we need agencies like the World Food Program to be supported, so food can go there. We also need development actors to come in. Because it's not only a situation of providing food and tents to people, that's not going to be sufficient to protect them from what's the extreme weather conditions that are coming more frequent and becoming more extreme. We need better shelter, we don't have shelter, we need more sustainable water systems, energy.

And a new X ray satellite, so-calledCRISM satellite could offer scientists extraordinary new insights about exploding stars black holes and galaxies powered by them. Meanwhile, the lander will use its own propulsion system to head towards the moon. It is expected to arrive in the moon's orbit in a few months and attempt a soft landing. Well, there's an awful lot going on in space at this point. For more, let's bring in CNN's Kristin Fisher, who is in Washington. What do you make of the images that we have been looking at today? KRISTIN FISHER, CNN SPACE &amp; DEFENSE CORRESPONDENT: Well, first of all, it was a successful launch by Japan's Space Agency, JAXA, in partnership with NASA and the European Space Agency. Two things Becky, really stand out from that launch, one, the successful launch of this brand new X-ray telescope, which is going to help astronomers study some of the hottest, most energetic places in the universe. Things like the matter around black holes, or all the stuff that comes out of a giant exploding star. There are other X-ray telescopes, but this one is expected to produce especially sharp and crisp X-ray images. And then the other thing that was onboard this rocket, Becky is a lunar lander that's called the moon sniper. And what it's supposed to do is demonstrate this new kind of technology that allows landers to land on a very narrow target about the size of a football field. Current targets for lunar landers are several miles wide. So this is a technology to demonstrate a pinpoint landing on the moon, which is why it's called the moon sniper. It's a great name.",
