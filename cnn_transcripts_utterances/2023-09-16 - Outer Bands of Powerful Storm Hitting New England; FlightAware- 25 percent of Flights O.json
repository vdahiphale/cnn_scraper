New England starting now to feel the impact of the massive storm. Boston Logan International Airport is experiencing a spike in flight cancellations.So far, 25 percent of flights leaving Boston have been canceled, that's according to FlightAware. Lee is not expected to make landfall in the U.S. But coastal cities can still expect powerful 50 to 60- mile-per-hour winds from outer bands of the massive storm.

      "sentences": "Yes. So yes, we are. That's, you know, where you are located you're seeing the impacts but it's not the only location behind me this is a live look at Bar Harbor, Maine. And you can see the water droplets sticking to the camera from time to time and those rain bands are pushing in. Also the trees in the distance, you can see them whipping as those wind gusts continue to get up around that 50 to 60 mile per hour range. That's going to continue through the day today. Again, you can see some of the heavier bands beginning to make their way into Northern Maine but also portions of Nova Scotia and New Brunswick. You still do have some rain bands for places like Boston and Providence. Those will be off and on throughout much of the day today.The storm itself has not changed. We got a brand new update at the top of the 8:00 o'clock hour. Sustained winds still 80 miles per hour. So even though the name has changed, it is now post Tropical Cyclone Lee instead of Hurricane Lee. The main point of the storm has not changed. The impacts have not changed. Sustained winds of 80 gusting up to 100 miles per hour. It has picked up speed moving to the north at about 25 miles per hour. All that really means is those impacts that are going to arrive a little bit earlier than anticipated but they'll also move out a little bit earlier than anticipated. We do expect that this will make landfall likely over southern Nova Scotia at some point this afternoon. Those wind gusts are going to continue not just in Canada but also along the East Coast. So from Massachusetts, up to Maine, still looking at those wind gusts possibly at 50 to 60 mile per hour range. At that range, power outages are still possible. You're going to have some of those trees come down because the thing to note is a lot of this area has been saturated. They had very wet summer. Now you add two, three, even four inches of rain on top of that and you saturate the ground. it may only take a 30 or even 40-mile-per-hour wind to bring some trees down. So power outages are still going to be a problem not just in Maine but for other states like New Hampshire, portions of Massachusetts as well. The bulk of the rain is going to push out by late this afternoon and early this evening. But this is 1:00, 2:00 o'clock. And you can see still some of those light rain bands impacting areas of Rhode Island, Massachusetts. Most of the rain exits Maine once we get to late this evening. And then by tomorrow morning, most of the rain is really just focused over portions of Canada. In the short term however, because of the amount of rain that's expected on top of the already saturated ground, from Caribou down through Bar Harbor and just East of Portland, we do -- we do have the potential for some flooding. So you've got a slight risk there as we go through the overnight hours tonight and even into the early morning hours tomorrow so do keep that in mind. I guess the main takeaways here, Victor and Amara, is that we are still going to be looking at gusty winds and the potential for very heavy rainfall even though the center of the storm itself is likely going to make landfall over Canada.",

So we as we look at the at the impact -- impact absolutely could be widespread, depending on the duration. We're already starting to hear some other plants that would likely go down in the coming days and just because of the three plants that have been on strike already. And as that moves into the next wave or the next stage, which we would expect, if there isn't a settlement over the weekend, here.

What we haven't seen is a massive change from the union side in terms of finding that -- that middle ground. So I think that's likely the next stage that we'll see as we see these additional offers come in. But it also gives them a lot of opportunity, too, to navigate and adjust along the way and flexibility there.They have a significant strike fund, over $800 million around 825.

But on the flip side, we also know as President Biden noted that the auto industry has raked in record profits in 2022.But you also hear the argument from the automakers, look, hey, despite these high profits, you know, we can't afford to meet these union -- the union's demands, because it's going to cost us a lot of money to make this transition to electric vehicles.

I think, as you look forward, part of this is looking forward and looking at the investment required for electrification. And those, by the way, are coming from the -- the regulatory bodies that are saying the automakers have to be electrified by a period in time and we're looking out to 2030 and beyond.The numbers go up exponentially and -- and there is a massive shift taking place in the industry from a cost standpoint of retrofitting or -- or changing factories over to electrification, vehicle development, and electrification. There's a lot at stake here. And certainly, on the union side, there are less you -- there are likely less workers required for electrification because the -- there are less parts involved and less moving parts. So there's certainly movement on both sides. Likely, if we look at it, we're likely to see something we would expect in the -- the mid-20 percent range, maybe a little bit more than that. And we're starting to see those -- those offers, get up in -- in close to that range.

Prosecutors with Special Counsel David Weiss's office have said they may bring tax charges in Washington D.C. or California, meaning charges could be announced within the next four weeks.The potential charges come on the heels of the federal indictment announced Thursday charging Hunter Biden with lying on an ATF form when he said he wasn't using or addicted to illegal drugs and for possessing the firearm while using or being addicted to a controlled substance. It's a dramatic reversal when only several weeks ago Hunter Biden had a deal to avoid prosecution on the gun charges if he abided by certain conditions for two years. He had also agreed to plead guilty to two tax misdemeanor charges. But that deal fell apart under a Federal judge's scrutiny. Hunter Biden's attorney Abbe Lowell says prosecutors cowl to political pressure from Republicans. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ABBE LOWELL, HUNTER BIDEN'S ATTORNEY: You have to ask what changed?

So they say there is that and of course, your small victories like the ones that the Ukrainians are talking about now.
