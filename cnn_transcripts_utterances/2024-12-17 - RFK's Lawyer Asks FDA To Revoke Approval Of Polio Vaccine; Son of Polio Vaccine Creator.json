I have friends, from many years ago, and they have obviously -- they -- they're still in not such good shape because of it. You know, that was -- and many people died.

He's a professor of infectious diseases and microbiology at the University of Pittsburgh School of Public Health. Doctor, thank you so much for taking the time to speak with us today. It's such a critical time. What are your thoughts as you're hearing what the president-elect and RFK Jr are saying about praising the polio vaccine, but also what they're saying about and have said about vaccines more broadly? DR. PETER L. SALK, PRESIDENT, JONAS SALK LEGACY FOUNDATION &amp; PROFESSOR OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES &amp; MICROBIOLOGY, UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH: Yes. I'm so relieved to hear that both the president and RFK Jr are being supportive of the polio vaccine. It has done such a wonderful job, along with the other vaccine that came along afterwards. in ridding the world almost completely from polio at this point. The injected vaccine that my father and his team at the University of Pittsburgh developed is extremely safe. Very rarely would someone have an allergic reaction to it. So this, I think, is absolutely the correct decision. What their concern was, was that more -- in more recent years, an enhanced potency version of that vaccine was made and that's just more effective. Their -- I think their concern was perhaps it was more dangerous, but there's been no evidence of that.",

Autism begins in the womb before a child is ever immunized against anything.It's -- so this is just -- what happens is that people receive vaccines during childhood and then, at some point, if a child is predestined to get autism, it will come at some point in relationship to anything that would happen before that, including a vaccine that might accidentally be close to it. There's not a cause-and-effect relationship. One can relax about that. But what I would say is this. In medications, including vaccines, can have side effects of one sort or another. What's important is to study them carefully and to be -- and to understand what the circumstances are. If there are concerns about one thing or another, we can take autism off of the list. But if there are concerns, then people should get together and address the issues as concisely as possible. Have studies done. Studies have been done that -- already. So if people are concerned, we have to respect that concern. But I can say as far as autism is concerned, that is just not something that one has to worry about with respect to vaccines.",

Obviously, this explosion, a very ambitious and well-planned targeted attack. I wonder what the strategy was behind Ukraine targeting this specific Russian official. LT. GEN. MARK HERTLING, CNN MILITARY ANALYST: Well, this isn't the first, Boris, as you know, and some of the reporting CNN has put out has showed that there have been multiple attempts at killing high- ranking Russian officials. On this particular one, it was a very good targeting approach because this individual is in charge of what's called the NBC capability of Russia nuclear, biological and chemical weapons. Russia has used chemical weapons inside of Ukraine. They've used a type of what's called C.S. gas or -- or chlorine-type of gas to -- to basically affect soldiers on the front line. And that's in violation of both the Geneva Convention and the Law of Land Warfare. So in-absentia, the courts in Ukraine has held this individual, Colonel, General Kirillov, a three-star general, as a war criminal. So this was a targeted attack on him to kill him. But it's also important that it's been done on the streets of Moscow. Some of -- some of the targets that have been conducted have been close to the city center. So you're seeing, you know, basically a psychological approach to tell Russian soldiers, Russian generals, there is no safe for you -- safe place for you, excuse me. If you're not on the front line, we're still going to come after you. And this is a valid target under the laws of land warfare.",

A variety of unmanned naval vehicles have struck the Black and the and the Baltic Sea fleets. So you're talking about that this -- Ukraine is sending the message that if you're going to strike our infrastructure inside of Ukraine, we're going to come after you, too. And again, I'll repeat it, there is no safe place for the Russians who are commanding this illegal invasion of Ukraine.",

I'm not sure how much more they could do. There we're a couple of days last week where there were between 200 and 300 kinetic projectiles launched inside of Ukraine against civilian targets. So once more, it's -- it's the illegality of what Russia is doing as war crimes against the country and the citizens of Ukraine, avoiding the military aspect of what's going on. So Ukraine is fighting back by saying, we're going to come into Russia and strike military targets and leave your infrastructure alone. But they're -- they're going after the same kind of things that Russia is doing in Ukraine, except making it more adamant and more psychological to hit a couple of hundred miles from the front line between Russia and Ukraine. So they're taking the fight deep into Russian territory to strike some of the key Russian targets.",
