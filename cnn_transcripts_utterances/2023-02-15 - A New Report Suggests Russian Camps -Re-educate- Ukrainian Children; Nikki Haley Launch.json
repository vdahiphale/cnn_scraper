Tonight, a disturbing new report into a Russianwar tactic, abducting Ukrainian children into camps that demand total loyalty to the Kremlin. We follow one mother's journey into Russian territory to bring back her daughter. Then, former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley launches a presidential bid, and already it's taking swipes at the incumbent. And yet, another twist in the balloon story. U.S. Intelligence officials are now assessing the possibility that the Chinese spy balloons path over the U.S. was accidental. Well, much more on those stories in just a moment. But first, NATO Secretary-General says Russian President Vladimir Putin must realize he cannot win this war in Ukraine. Jens Stoltenberg says NATO pledges of tanks and military training have given Ukraine, quote, \"a critical window of opportunity to tip the balance in its favor\". We'll have much more on the NATO meeting in Brussels just a moment. I'll be speaking with Poland's deputy defense minister about the military aid that's been agreed, including of course, the pledges of all important ammunition. But first, we are getting disturbing new insight into one of Russia's most insidious war tactics. According to a new report, Moscow is running an expansive system of camps in order to, quote, \"re-educate and Russify thousands of Ukrainian children\". David McKenzie is on the story, he joins me now live from Kyiv. So, David, just bring us up to date.   What are we learning about this disturbing study and then the Kremlin's thinking and purpose behind these camps here.",

And in the Russian federation itself, and what they say is happening is in fact very disturbing. That thousands of children have been taken to those camps. Now, they may not be the kind of camps you think of when you think of a camp for children during a time of war. But there is a very invidious propaganda attempt ongoing by the Russians, say this report, and also based on our own reporting. We joined a group of mothers who are desperately trying to get their children back. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MCKENZIE (voice-over):  Weeks ago, we first met Tetyana Vlaiko in Kyiv in a shelter for displaced   families. All of the mothers here separated from their children by the trauma of war. TETYANA VLAIKO, UKRAINIAN MOTHER (through translator):  Emotions overwhelmed me when Lilia(ph) left. When I realized what was happening, it terrified me. All I wanted were the best for my child at the time. Her 11- old daughter Lilia(ph) stuck in a Russian camp in occupied Crimea. All the lessons are in Russian. At first glance, their retreat seemed like any other Summer camp. But the loyalty expected from Ukrainian children is crystal clear. Part of what a new Yale University study calls systematic re-education efforts. But Tetyana and Lilia's(ph) story begins a year ago. Their hometown of Kherson fell quickly to advancing Russian troops. Within days, the occupiers began a campaign to Russify the population. Often coercing thousands of parents like Tetyana to send their kids to the camps. But when Ukrainian forces took back Kherson in November, Tetyana's daughter was on the wrong side of the frontline.",

And there were challenges that came with that, but her parents reminded her every day of just how blessed she was to have the opportunities to live in the United States. She was also critical of the Republican Party in the past, saying that they have lost a popular vote, seven out of the eight last presidential races. And she said the reason for that is because they haven't been able to attract the majority of voters. She is positioning herself as someone who is the candidate who can attract the majority of Republican voters. And she made her pitch very clearly. There was a lot in there for everyone. She said America should be strong and not woke and weak. She also talked about securing America's borders. The need for increased policing. The need for politicians to not be able -- unable to close schools. Of course, we saw Republican frustrations when that happened during COVID. So she really had something in there for everyone.

The reality now that we're hearing is that this is a very real possibility. CNN actually did model the weather patterns of kind of in the Pacific at the time the balloon took off.

So what law enforcement and security researchers are asking is for the public simply to be aware, to look for people who are becoming more and more detached from society. People who have maybe articulated want to harm themselves and those two attributes coupled with someone wanting to obtain firearms, that should be a red flag. That should be a warning sign. Interesting, researchers actually look at three different areas, where shooters have exhibited signs. It's in their family relationships. It's at work. It's at school. So people that are immediately around people who might be exhibiting these behaviors need to pick up the phone and call police. To give you an example as well, Isa, people say, why aren't the police picking up on these science? In the Secret Service study, only about 2 percent of the time that law enforcement even know about these suspects prior to the attack. Whereas there was about 90 percent incidents where people in the shooter's orbit knew something was wrong.

Those are diamond encrusted Tiffany glasses that he's been wearing throughout awards season. And Tiffany's is owned by LVMH, which also owns Louis Vuitton. So this is just staying in the family. Pharrell has been a fashion icon for years. I actually host the American Image Awards for the fashion industry. And part of that is the AAFA and the CFDA, the Council of Fashion Designers of America, that awarded Pharrell fashion icon back in 2015. Fashion is not a hobby for this man; it's a way of life. He is intertwined with different brands. He was the first male ambassador for Chanel. So it's only logical that someone who is as talented as he is in music has fashion right along with it.
