And the Trump coconspirator accused of trying to destroy evidence for the boss, sees the inside of a federal court.Plus, the polls. All of them. All for Donald Trump. Republican voters fall in line behind the frontrunner as Ron DeSantis' reasons for running appear to fall flat and the president corrects how he counts. Joe Biden acknowledges his seventh grandchild for the first time and now he hopes it returns to being a private matter. I'm Dana Bash. Let's go behind the headlines at Inside Politics. Up first, saving America or saving his skin. Today, we see on paper just how much money from donors Donald Trump spent on legal bills. Sources put that number north of $40 million for his own defense and the defense of those who are sticking with him. This morning, CNN cameras captured the glimpse of one of those individuals Carlos de Oliveira. The man federal prosecutors say schemed with Mr. Trump and Walt Nauta to shield evidence from federal investigators. The Mar-a-Lago property manager made his first appearance inside of federal court. And we're going to start there in South Florida, where CNN's Randi Kaye is posted. So, what did we see this morning, Randi?",

      "sentences": "Well, Dana. This was our first look at Carlos de Oliveira, as he entered into the courthouse here. Just behind me, he was wearing a navy-blue suit and a tie. He went inside with his lawyer John Irving, who was here from Washington, D.C.When he stood at the lectern to address the judge. He said, good morning. And then the judge proceeded to lay out the charges that he is facing. He said he understood the charges. He said he understood that he had a right to remain silent and speak to a lawyer. Then they went on to talk about a bond. The judge went on to set a $100,000 what they call a personal signature bond, so he doesn't have to pay it, but he doesn't have to stay behind bars right now. He was also asked, Dana, about a passport. He says that -- he said he does have a U.S. passport, but it's expired. Still, the judge told him that he had to turn that over within 48 hours. He was also told he can't leave South Florida without permission, the area of South Florida. And then he was also given a witness list of the list of government witnesses, and he was informed that he cannot speak to any of those witnesses that are on that, that have been identified as witnesses for the government. I can't tell you he did not enter a plea that will take place on August 10. There is going to be an actual arraignment on August 10 in Fort Pierce, Florida. He did not have a Florida barred attorney, which means he couldn't enter play. He needs somebody who can practice law in the state of Florida to do that. So that will happen on August 10. And of course, Dana, all lives are watching this because as we know his case is now pushed back. His arraignment is pushed back, which could impact Donald Trump's case when it comes to the Mar-a-Lago documents, and that we, of course, want to see whether or not he would go to trial before election day. That's certainly something a lot of people are watching, Dana?",

The Republican voters think that Trump would be great in a rematch against President Biden. Despite the fact that Ron DeSantis is really trying to and other Republicans that are running against the former president are trying to say that he can't possibly beat Biden with all of these legal issues and this legal peril looming over him.

Republican voters sided with the latter. They didn't want that at all, which shows why DeSantis' entire message up until this point has not been resonating or helping him.",
