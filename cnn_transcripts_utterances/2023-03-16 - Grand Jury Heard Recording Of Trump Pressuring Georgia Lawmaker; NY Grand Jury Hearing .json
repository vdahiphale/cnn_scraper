I know a lot of lawyers are debating whether to even bring this case because there are so many other cases, the Georgia case, we were just talking about, the classified documents case, how they wound up at Mar-a-Lago.And I think that what Donald Trump will do is, if he is indicted on this, he will play victim. And he will say just what his attorney was saying, that this is the was a this was a biased prosecutor, Democratic and out to get him. And you know, Brianna, he has played the victim card very, very successfully in the past. Even as the documents case opened up and they found those classified documents at Mar-a-Lago, he raised an awful lot of money after that, if you'll recall. So I think that is exactly what he would do again if this is the first case brought against him. But once the special counsel decides what to do, once the Georgia case, is there an indictment or isn't there an indictment, I think that will be a pile-on that will be very different because those cases are much more serious.",

This has been available for more than 20 years. And medication is the most common method of abortion in the U.S. If the judge rules in favor of the anti-abortion plaintiffs, it could have profound consequences nationwide. I want to bring in CNN justice correspondent, Jessica Schneider, on this. Any way that he indicated he may be leaning here, Jess?",

And he did seem open to really undoing the FBI's -- sorry, the FDA's approval of this abortion pill, which is exactly what these anti-abortion groups want him to do.But at the same time, he also expressed this be possibility that maybe he could take a more incremental step here and keep the approval in place but actually block some of the recent changes that the FDA has made making this pill easier to get by mail. Either way, though, there's a lot at stake in this case for millions of women. And it's all in the hands of this one federal judge in Amarillo, Texas. He has the power here because he's the only judge in this district that decides and hears these cases to determine whether, in fact, the FDA approval for this drug will be blocked. He got onto the bench in 2019. He was nominated by the former president, Donald Trump. And he does have this history of anti-abortion activism. He served as a lead lawyer advocating for the right and religious freedom groups. And he's been really outspoken, at least in the past, on issues like same-sex marriage. I talked to someone who was a good friend of his yesterday, Brianna. He says that Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk, he is all about intellect and not necessarily his beliefs. And he believes that he will really rule by law. And that's something, of course, that the judge had pledged to do at his confirmation hearing. A lot in question now, what could really be a very consequential ruling here that could come down to any minute. The judge said he'll be ruling as quickly as possible. So we wait and see - Brianna?",

[13As you mentioned, in 2021, that's the most recent year for which data were available, we saw more than 1,000 women die due to maternal causes. That was up from previous years. And we're seeing that black women are still at least three times, nearly three times as likely to die due to maternal causes than white women. And the maternal death rate among black women is well over the national average. Why are we seeing these rises in maternal deaths? Brianna, experts say it comes down to, as a nation, we could do better with providing postpartum care for women after childbirth. We he could do better listening to women when they say something feels wrong during pregnancy or childbirth. And in the past few years, we've had the covid pandemic and that has exacerbated the issue. So the nation has a lot of work to do to make sure women and their babies survive childbirth - Brianna?",

TikTok confirmed yesterday that the Biden administration wants TikTok to be spun off from its Chinese owners or else it could face a ban in the United States.Now, this represents a potential turning point in the long-running discussions that TikTok has been having with the United States government about whether or not it can continue operating in the United States. Despite security concerns about U.S. user data and whether or not it could be handed over to the Chinese government for intelligence purposes or military purposes. It also represents a hardening stance by the Biden administration after it's received criticism for not acting swiftly enough on the TikTok issue. In recent weeks and months, we've seen a number of states implement a ban on TikTok on government devices, a number of lawmakers have proposed bills that would ban TikTok nationwide. All of this is putting more pressure on the Biden administration to wrap up this two-year negotiation with TikTok and to reach some sort of conclusion. TikTok is saying that divestment is not the answer. It has put forward a number of voluntary measures intended to safeguard U.S. user data. It says it's put in place technical and bureaucratic measures designed to ensure that no one who is unauthorized can get access to that personal information. Of course, many of TikTok's critics say that's not nearly enough - Brianna?",
