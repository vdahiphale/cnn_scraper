The Palestinian Islamic Jihad is praising the Tel Aviv attack, saying it comes in response to what is happening in the Jenin refugee camp in the West Bank. Live pictures here of Jenin; Israeli forces say no non combatants have been killed during their ongoing raid, now in its second day. Palestinian officials say at least 10 people have lost their lives as Israel carries out what it calls counterterrorism activities. Let's go to Tel Aviv and CNN's Hadas Gold, who is live at the scene of the car ramming. Hadas, could you give us a sense of what is going on right now? Of course, we've heard that Hamas claimed responsibility for this attack.",

We saw the truck ourselves; it was very badly damaged. The windshield was smashed. Windshield was smashed, its entire front of the truck was ripped off. And as you can see behind me, this bus stop was also badly damaged as well. Israeli police are saying that the car mounted the pavement here, rammed into several pedestrians, who were standing here, and then the attacker got out of the car and began stabbing people. An armed civilian, who happened to be on the scene, heard the noise, turned around and shot and killed the attacker. We know that at least eight people have been injured as a result of this attack. One of them is critically injured. And the attacker has now been claimed as a member of Hamas, the military group saying that he is one of their fighters and saying it is in direct response to what we are seeing going on in Jenin. Of course, that is in its second day of operation. The Israeli military is undertaking its largest military operation there since 2002, since the days of the Second Intifada. And overnight, it has been a little quieter than it was a night before. The Israeli military saying it is reaching every corner of the refugee camps. Their goal, they say, is to essentially reform the refugee camp from being a hornets' nest, they say, for militants' activity. We know 10 people have been killed in the refugee camp. The Israeli military claiming that all of those killed, that no non- combatants have been killed or all of those killed were armed or were engaging with their soldiers in some way. But the Israeli military is acknowledging that, amongst the 100 people injured, at least some of them are civilians. They are also acknowledging problems with electricity and water in the refugee camp as a result of the extensive damage we are seeing in the camp. And overnight, thousands of people, thousands of Palestinians are leaving the refugee camp, evacuating out of fear of what is to come. Because as it has been described by one of the locals, there they are saying it looks like a natural disaster hit the refugee camp. That is why people are leaving, out of fear of what is to come next. The Israeli military saying they will continue this operation as long as it is necessary. It could take another few days, they say, before they believe they have reached all of their objectives. Eleni.",

More than 50 percent of India's imports in terms of weapons come from Russia. We know the West is highly dependent on India, because it sees it as a counterbalance to China. But for India, it doesn't want to be seen as taking sides. This entire group out here, the SCO, none of the member nations have come out and condemned Russia's invasion of Ukraine in the U.N. resolution. None of them have come out and actually voted against Russia. You have India that has said this should be resolved peacefully. Narendra Modi has said this is not the era for war. So India wants to be not aligned; they want to balance ties with the East and West.
