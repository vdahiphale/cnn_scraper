      "sentences": "Right. I mean, these financial statements are what the case is about. It's about they were prepared, the judge said they were fraudulent, and that they were then given to lenders and insurers and others who used them and relied on them. That is why they're so key.And through the questioning, even as Trump goes off on tangents, he is giving the attorney general's office something to work with. Unlike his sons, who feigned any knowledge of the financial statements, Trump is saying he was aware of them, until he became president. He said he was involved with them. He said he would look it over and he would discuss some values with them. And specifically, he was asked about some of these values, he's acknowledging that the Trump apartment at Trump Tower, that there was a mistake. It was overvalued, he said, and they fixed it. He also said he thought another property on the financial statement, the Seven Springs, the family compound in New York, he thought that was misvalued on the statement. So he is talking with some knowledge about this but then he goes off on a tangent, saying how things are worth more than they should be, how they're worth more in the future. And is not sticking to actually what the question was. That's what the judge is trying to rein in. But he is answering some of these questions very directly.",

Trump is trying to take that further and say it's telling you that you shouldn't rely on them at all. That is what he's testifying to, saying, as he put it, they weren't very important. You made it important, but it just wasn't important. So really trying to say these were statements that were, like, nice to have around, but that the banks wouldn't rely on them. He's also previewing a bit of what we may see if his lawyers do, in fact, put on a defense case. He's saying, we're going to hear from bankers who say they didn't rely on these statements, you're going to hear from some experts who disagree with how some of these things were valued. So sitting on a little bit of a preview. But saying that, in fact -- the judge is saying that that clause is worthless. And the judge even said to Trump, maybe you should read my ruling. I already said it was worthless.",

Because legally speaking, he is way behind the eight ball.A judge has already ordered and ruled he has lost what is called the motion for summary judgment. Meaning, based on what I've seen so far, you have committed fraud. The only remaining question is, how expensive is it going to get? Is it $250 million? Will you have your business certificates? Will it be a conservatorship for your own enterprise? Very important points here. Remember, there are 23 witnesses already, including his two adult sons. You've heard from the CFO. You've heard from Allen Weisselberg as well. All of whom have given various accounts and testimony. But it has not changed the equation to suggest that there were fraudulent documents, that you were aware that this had happened, that, as an officer of your company, you had a duty to actually ensure they were accurate before you handed them over to somebody else. Nothing, so far, antics-based, has changed that for this judge, I doubt.",

Because they're wondering if he'll open the door for their own cases.A statement he might make going a little bit off the rails, but not answering the question -- remember, the judge wants direct answers. His attorneys in the other matters want even more precise and limited responses. Because everything is tangentially related, and is in the helm of what might touch on everything else, could be used against him in any of the other courtrooms. They're aware of that. That means anything, from his finances for Alvin Bragg, for example, his conversations about who he is in control of, who he directs, and other contact as well, all very important.",

Any time -- his lawyer is saying here, any time someone goes in courtand makes a statement that contradicts another statement they make in another trial, that is a hit to the witness' credibility. So all of those other cases are looking at this testimony and are looking for tiny little places where there might be conflicts that goes to the credibility of future testimony he might give.

So that's sworn testimony. And that's also called receipts.You already had Don Jr asked a question about whether he was aware of misstatements, and then presented, after he gave his answer, with facts that he actually had. Eric Trump, who said, I'm more with the concrete and construction, here is evidence to suggest otherwise. Donald Trump, similarly, as you pointed out with Kara and Kaitlan, about statements he made about disclaimers that were given, to suggest, hey, use your own figures, mine, you can maybe or maybe not trust. All of that is a culmination at a trial, which is why you're very afraid, as a defense attorney, to have your witness take the stand. And as a prosecutor, you're a little thrilled. It's exhilarating to think about somebody who might be walking into a trap of their own making with little effort and bias on your own part.",

Jean Carroll, for example, where somebody is accusing him of sexual misconduct. He wasn't present at that. He wasn't required to be present. But he was not present at that. Here, he not only has been there on this day, but multiple days, going in front of a courthouse. Because his business empire -- and you've talked about this a lot as well, Dana -- is his political currency and vice-versa. Forget the quarter of a billion dollars at stake. There is a quarter of a presidential election year that, for him, is at stake as well. He wants four more years. And part of that requires the American electorate to buy into his business acumen. He's in control. He is somebody who, but for him, you would be attacking them. If that goes away, if Donald Trump has a conservatorship over his business empire, do you trust him to be the commander-in-chief? That's a question for the voters.",
