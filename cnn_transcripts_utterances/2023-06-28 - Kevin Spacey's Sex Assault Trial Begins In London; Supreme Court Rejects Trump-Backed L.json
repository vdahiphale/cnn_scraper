Important to note here that this is expected to take about four weeks, so don't expect any final results just yet.Kevin Spacey showed up -- and I know you have those pictures of him walking into court, stepping out of that black cab -- showed up nearly two hours early if you can believe it. He is keen, he says, to prove his innocence. He has time and time again denied these charges vehemently and says that they have cost him his award-winning career. And he has welcomed this opportunity, he and his lawyers say, to see their day in court. But make no doubt about it, these are some serious allegations. He is facing a dozen charges of sexual assault, including indecent assault and causing a person to engage in sexual activity without their consent. The incidents take place between 2001 and 2013. Four separate men -- four separate individuals coming forward with these charges. Why London? Why is this taking place here? Well, Kevin Spacey was the artistic director of the Old Vic Theatre for several years here in London between 2004 and 2015. So these charges dating back to that time. These victims say he took advantage of his position. Kevin Spacey insisting that he is innocent. Again, this will take weeks to clear up. But as you can imagine, all eyes now on the crown prosecution as they present their reason for these charges being put on Kevin Spacey.",

What we saw on the streets of that particular suburb in which thattook place early yesterday morning -- it was about 8:18 when the traffic stop happened, local time. What we saw overnight is a result of the news of this young man's death, but also that video, was some fairly severe rioting. Some 350 policemen were put on the streets to try and bring order -- riot police -- and what authorities say is that they're urging calm but expect to keep those numbers on the streets again tonight should that anger flare up once more. At the heart of that anger, Christine, this incident. Three young men, including the 17-year-old who was shot dead, in the car that gets stopped by -- at a police check and very quickly then drive off. What the police say is they refused to stop and refused to cooperate. What's actually emerged is now one of those police officers being taken into custody on suspicion of culpable homicide with Parisian authorities saying that yes, there is the presumption of innocence and this needs to be investigated. The problem is really, Christine, there has been incidents like these before and that's where that anger has come from. The idea that there have been far too many traffic or I.D. stops and checks by police that have ended in the killing of a young person, often in the less well- off suburbs of Paris. In addition to that video, which has stoked the controversy and the anger, some of France's best-known personalities have weighed in, including the French soccer star Kylian Mbappe, tweeting that he was hurting for his France. Also, we've been hearing from Omar Sy, a very well-known actor here, saying that justice needed to be brought for this particular child. The young involved, who died within an hour of that traffic stop despite attempts to save his life, was just 17 years old, Christine.",
