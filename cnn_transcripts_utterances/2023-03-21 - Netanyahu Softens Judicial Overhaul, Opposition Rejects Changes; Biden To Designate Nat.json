      "sentences": "Well, Christine, if you are optimistic you see it as the Israeli government with a coalition led by Benjamin Netanyahu as at least willing to budge a little bit, although none of this was done in consultation with the opposition. This was essentially the coalition -- the ruling government negotiating within themselves.And the change that they made was to how the judges would be selected for the high court. When you talk to people in the government they say that this is the number one issue really for them over this judicial overhaul that they want to do. And the change that they made is that on this committee that would select judges, instead of the government- appointed members having the vast majority -- instead, they would have just a one-seat majority but still a majority. And -- but this -- the opposition is rejecting this. They say that this does not go far enough. They say -- some of the protest leaders are even saying that it's not even a softening -- a declaration of war, they say. Another element is actually, they have to agree to pause the rest of the reforms because this is a package of several bills until after the Passover recess at the end of April and opening the door up to negotiations. But we're not hearing from the opposition leaders that this is enough for them at all. The protest leaders are still planning to go out into the street. Now there are some bigger questions coming out because another question is what will happen if the Israeli high court strikes down elements of these reforms that are trying to reform the high court. We are just hearing now reports in the Israeli media that the Ministry of Justice are saying they will not listen to the Supreme Court if they strike down these reforms. We are heading into a potentially judicial crisis even bigger than what Israel is already facing as we're seeing so much divisiveness and hundreds of thousands of Israelis taking to the streets on a weekly basis.",

Ole Miss' stunning upset of one-seed Stanford who had everybody's jaws on the floor. And then Indiana trying to avoid that same fate against nine- seed Miami. The Canes had the Big 10's regular season champs on the ropes all night. I.U. down three with 10 seconds to go. Yarden Garzon draining the step-back from deep to tie it up. The freshman from Israel sending Assembly Hall into a complete frenzy, but it wouldn't last. Destiny Harden, a senior from Chicago, hitting a really tough bucket to retake the lead. Hoosiers hustling up court couldn't even get off a shot though. Miami back in the Sweet Sixteen for the first time in 31 years, and it's the first time in 25 years that two one-seeds have lost before the Sweet Sixteen has even begun. The second-seeded Huskies took care of Baylor last night, extending their own record of 16 straight Sweet Sixteen appearances. Star sophomore Azzi Fudd was unstoppable, outscoring Baylor all by herself in the third quarter. She put up 16 of her 22 points out of the break. Things pick back up on Friday for the women in the Sweet Sixteen. In the NBA, Julius Randle scored 57 points for the Knicks last night and it still was not enough to get a win. Less than a minute to go in the game, Randle forcing the steal, gets it back, and drives for the tough bucket here and the foul to pull New York within three. Randle needed to make one more play though and he just couldn't do it. Good defense -- he just wasn't able to pull down the rebound, giving the Timberwolves another chance to ice it, and they do. Randle irate on the bench after this as you might imagine. He was slamming his hand on the scorer's table. Minnesota getting a crucial win. Some frustrations boiling over. They are one of nine teams separated by just four games in the Western Conference with less than a month until the playoffs begin.
