The new lines are coming thick and fast. Obviously, we're hearing that Meghan has described their engagement as an orchestrated reality show. We are learning more about their contentious relationship with the press. What's striking you at this time?",

They're describing their love story, how they got together, because they have said they want to tell people more about themselves as well as what happened with their departure from the Royal family.But the idea that there is a conspiracy between the palace and the media, and the palace is very concerned about upsetting the media, and there is a Royal Rota system, a pooling system, where certain outlets get favored access in order to tell the Royal story effectively, and they didn't benefit from that. So, Harry describing how male members of the family saying that their wives had gone through similar ordeals with the British media, but you just have to go through it. Harry saying but it's different this time, because we've got a race element. And they are not stepping in to recognize that or understand that. So, Harry and Meghan wanted more protection for the palace, more pushback against the media. And they felt they were not getting that. And they felt that was very unfair. And then Harry really describe where all that concern from his side came from, which was growing up with a wonderful mother who gave them great experiences, but much of his childhood punctuated by media intrusion. And how that really scarred him. And how he sees so many parallels between Meghan and his mother, not just in terms of character, but also in the way that they were both treated and how he was not going to let that happen again to his wife, the same thing that happened to his mother. Which is why they ultimately left the Royal roles that they had committed to.",

The presence of Princess Diana seems deeply felt in this docuseries. KATE WILLIAMS, CNN ROYAL HISTORIANdeeply. Harry talks about her particularly in episode two. He has talked about the pain and suffering of women marrying into the Royal family. We saw that on the trailers. And particularly in episode two, we talked about how she was followed. How his early memories about being followed by the paparazzi. And he talks about the panorama, into the BBC panorama into it. He said, I think we all know that she was deceived into it, but she spoke her truth, she spoke her actual truth of her experiences. And really, he's so concerned that she suffered so much, he doesn't want, as Max was saying, Meghan to go through the same. So, Princess Diana, want this documentary is saying, that we've learned nothing from the suffering of Princess Diana. We've learned nothing. Megan was pursued once more and pursued in a way that was also very different, because there is the racism as well.",

I think the Archibald Foundation that he's involved with that. And he said that the idea of a family anointed by God, by blood to rule over this country and other countries around the world is a difficult concepts for people to get their heads around. It's not so far explicit. But this docuseries doesn't really paint the monarchy as irrelevant or a particularly kind institution in the 21st century.",

Megan, the slide we've seen in the trailer, she said so many people have spoken for us, books have been written about us by people we don't even know, isn't it more sensible to hear our side the story? So, this is their side story. And certainly, I think, you know, obviously they are suing a lot of newspapers here in the United Kingdom. You, know the press coverage has been -- their criticism of the press coverage and the Royal Rota they were criticizing, the Royal correspondents in here. They were saying that they are an extended PR arm of the Royal family. So, there's a lot of criticism towards the media here.So, you know, Harry and Meghan do get a lot of criticism within the media. I don't think -- but I think there is a lot of -- you know, there's a lot of support for Meghan when she married into the Royal family. There's a lot of sympathy for her. And I think certainly, Meghan was the first woman of color to marry into the Royal family. And really, this is a multi-cultural Britain. The commonwealth is a majority of people of color. So, it really was, as one of historians in episode three said, it's the Royal family catching up with Britain. But now Meghan and Harry have left the Royal family. So, that means examining. And I think, you know, it was something that people in Britain are thinking very seriously about. And you were saying about the monarchy. And I do think obviously the Queen had all the sympathy. Charles, it's an early reign, Charles's reign has already been overshadowed by a racism row of what was said by a lady in waiting to a charity boss to the Queen consort reception. On top of that, there's this. So, I think Charles's reign was always going to be a bit shaky. But it seems I think overall are saying how relevant is the Monarchy and how relevant particular is it to the young and it's to people of color?",

      "sentences": "Not yet. There are references to the family. I mean, when they introduced -- when he introduce Meghan to the family, he said that the members of the family saw her as an American actress and it wouldn't last. So, some criticism there but quite a mild criticism and it's quite generic. We don't know specifically what they're talking about.And to Kate's point, I was just looking at some more detail about what they're saying about this kind of relationship with the media. That there is this conspiracy between Royal correspondents and the palace. But also, just how you react. So, whenever there's something difficult, the advice is not to react or feed into the story. So, don't react to every new story that you do not like. Clearly, Harry and Meghan did want more reaction. But there is a debate there, isn't it. What is the best way of dealing with constant daily barrage of media attacks. Do you respond to every attack or do you not? So, there are two very divergent sort of communication strategies. And I think that that's probably one huge part of the tension here. And, you know, everything that Meghan had been put through, this idea that other women in the family hadn't been put through it as well, so, just deal with it, just get on. Essentially questioning and criticizing the stiff upper lip of which is effectively what defined the monarchy to many people around the world. But you don't let everything around you affect you and get consumed into it. But that is what monarchy is, that you rise above things. You represent continuity and you don't go with the ups and downs. So, that basically questioning the fundamental premise of the monarchy. So, there is a fundamental debate here which is worth having. But it is very different from what people within palace would have. I don't really agree with a lot of what's in here.",

This as the fighting grinds on.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says tens civilians were killed in a Russian strike in a town in the Donetsk. In Kherson in the south, he says that four police officers were killed by Russian minds. CNN's Scott McLean is following developments and joins us now live from London. Scott let's return to the lies that we're getting about cluster munitions. Is it likely that the U.S. will grant this request? And what impact would using more cluster munitions have on Ukraine's moral authority and global support in this invasion from Russia?",

      "sentences": "Yes, you bring up a very good point, Bianca. And that is that Ukraine has tried to claim the moral high ground in this conflict with how they go about this war and how they go about defending this country in trying to limit civilian casualties. Obviously, it is very difficult to do that when we are talking about cluster bombs.And a good example of that -- there's far too many to list all of them. But a good example that came back in April when a Russian bomb that a U.N. report found was a cluster bomb hit a train station in Kramatorsk, in the eastern part the country. That report found and it killed 60 people and injured more than 100. The aftermath of that was absolutely horrific. Now, the Ukrainians say that having more of these weapons would change the course of the war and help it end sooner. And I can show you why they think that. When we are talking about normal bombs, the immediate, the most deadly area that's destroyed, is a width of about 50 meters or so. When we talk about cluster munitions, there are two explosions, one which detonates in the sky, sending a bunch of smaller bombs out onto a wider area, about 100 meters wide. And that is when those bombs go off. And so, you can understand why it is so hard to limit civilian casualties. Now, the Ukrainians insists that, look, they want to use these against concentrations of Russian troops, against military targets only. But of course, war as we know, is complicated. And Russian troops are not exactly siloed off from the rest of the civilian population. And so, it is very difficult to do that in practical terms. The other part that's concerning is that some of those little cluster bombs, some of those little bomblets, do not actually detonate. And so, they're left behind as sort of de facto land mines for civilians to come across later. And that is part of the reason why the U.S. Congress has made it very difficult for the United States to actually send these weapons to other countries, to transfer them to other countries. And that's part of the reason why the Biden menstruation so far has said no. But they also haven't really seriously consider it yet. A former defense secretary though, Bianca, said that they should. Listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) LEON PANETTA, FORMER U.S. DEFENSE SECRETARY: The Russians are not playing by the Marques of Queensberry rules. They've use cluster bombs. They're sending missiles into schools and to hospitals. They've had no regard for human life. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

One model of the weapon they actually phased out back in 2016 because there were so many of those bomblets that were not exploding. That's the model that the Ukraine's actually what because they say it's more effective. And if they don't have it, it'll just collect dust in the U.S.",
