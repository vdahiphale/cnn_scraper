      "sentences": "Today, the Congressional Task Force investigating the first assassination attempt against former President Trump is calling for a briefing with the Secret Service about the second apparent attempt that happened yesterday. Lawmakers say they remain deeply concerned about the threat of ongoing political violence.Let's discuss with Republican Congressman Dan Meuser of Pennsylvania. He actually witnessed that assassination attempt of former President in Butler, Pennsylvania back on July 13th firsthand. Congressman, thank you so much for being with us. Earlier today, President Biden said that the Secret Service needed more help. He's calling on Congress to respond to the agency's needs. Do you agree that the ball is in Congress's court, or do you think the administration needs to do something now? REP. DAN MEUSER (R-PA): Hi, Boris, great to be with you. Listen, I don't want to sound just political right out of the gate here, but the Homeland Security has oversight of Secret Service. They could certainly add and move people around. I know their resources are low due to the fact that the recruitment is way down for various reasons, but they could certainly provide the level of resources necessary and security to keep the former president safe. It's not a question of what the protocol is for whether he was the current president or if he was the vice president or if he's a former president. The protocol should be to keep him safe, to do the risk assessments. And you know what? They failed to do that. Homeland, Mayorkas, Harris, Biden, all talk, no action. Let's hope at least now, after the second assassination attempt, there is some action. And if it requires congressional, you know, they love doing this, Boris, come on, saying how, oh, we need Congress to act on the border. We need Congress to act on this. I mean, it's like it's like a blame game. Fine, we will act. Watch us get voted down like we did on H.R. 2. And again, not to be too critical here, but that seems to be the regular routine.",

MEUSERBut the truth is that the rhetoric has been pretty, pretty awful. Now, it's a two sided thing. I understand. But if you look at even things that that Tapper has said on your show about how our long nightmare is over, how Trump is buddies with Putin, he stands with Putin. He's so basically he stands with a murderer. He stands with a thug. He's evil. I mean, that's come out of the first lady's mouth. How many times has President Trump -- Biden and Harris said, you know, he and the MAGAs are undermining our democracy. They're a threat to our democracy. I mean, I could quote so many. So, you know, it really comes down to and I and I honestly believe this. We disagree strongly with the left's policies. We don't dislike them. They seem to dislike us. So that I think is, is, is, a problem. I don't mean to generalize it, but we all -- both sides. Let's even say it -- on both sides. We've got work to do. And I'd like to be part of creating a policy discussion. And remember that we're all Americans in the end.",

But I am curious about how you make assessments, given, as you said, that it's a two way street, because pretty much since he wrote down the escalator back in 2015, Donald Trump has been a firebrand.He's made accusations that Hillary Clinton, that Barack Obama, that Joe Biden, that Kamala Harris are all trying to destroy this country. He also uses rhetoric that dehumanizes people, including immigrants. And notably, there was a mass shooter in El Paso a few years ago that echoed that specific kind of language. So I wonder what your message would be to the former president himself. As you said, it's a two way street on toning down the rhetoric.",

Because, you know, when he says things like Comrade Kamala or Sleepy Joe or, you know, it's stupid people doing the Iran nuke deal and things like that. Look, he also said that the illegals that are coming here are poisoning our youth and poisoning our citizens.I've heard it all. But truly, what he meant there was the fentanyl, the drugs, that sort of thing. They're poisoning the blood. It gets -- it gets presented, in my opinion, throughout much of the media in the darkest ways possible. And Vice President Harris and Joe Biden, you know, it very often gets painted in the in the best way possible. So and but then you have other networks that that certainly laid out in the opposite of that. All I would say is we ought to -- we ought to really consider our, our language, not make things personal, lose the personal attacks. Let's have a policy debate. Let's, let's do our best to find common ground. But where we can't, that's where elections come in and people are going to vote for which way we want our country to go.

This coming from the Marine Board of Investigation and what they did was they provided new details in terms of what happened as the Titan was descending on that fateful day. They showed animation, some of it you see there as the Titan descended and they married that to communications with the ship that was on the surface at the time, the Polar Prince.One of the last messages the ship received was at 10:14 a.m. from the Titan that said, all good here. It was then at 10:47 a.m., a short time after that, that the Titan had sent a message that said, dropped 2H, which indicated something was wrong. They were in trouble and needed to ascend back to the surface. Of course it was just moments after that that the Titan imploded. Now as you know many experts had warned OceanGate's CEO Stockton Rush that they had safety concerns with the construction of the Titan. They wanted it to be classed. They wanted it to be certified by a safety organization before it went on these expeditions. One of the first witnesses that was called was OceanGate's former director of engineering who talked about why Rush did not want to have the submersible classified. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
