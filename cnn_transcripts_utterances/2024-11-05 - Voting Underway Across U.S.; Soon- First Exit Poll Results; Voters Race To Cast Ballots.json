Now, is that your stealth voter if there is going to be one? Women who feel that society says you've got to go for Harris and bring your daughter to vote, and if you don't that you're the stealth Trump voter? TIM PAWLENTY, (R) FORMER MINNESOTA GOVERNOR: I don't think there's any doubt about that, Erin. I know a number of them personally. There are people because of their job, their neighborhood, their profession, their family relations who do not want to admit that they voted for Trump, and it is the Trump stealth voter.
