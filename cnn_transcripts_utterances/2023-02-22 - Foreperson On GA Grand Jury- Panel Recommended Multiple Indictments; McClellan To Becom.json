In this case, because it's a special grand jury, in Georgia, the rules are a little bit different. And she is able to go out and speak publicly about some things related to the case. Obviously, we saw a lot of that from her yesterday. We should note that the district attorney's office, they are not the ones that are responsible for authorizing whether these special grand jurors can speak publicly. And I'm told they did not know she was going to go public until she started doing these interviews. But Emily Kohrs is that foreperson. She not only dropped hints about what was in the report, she made clear that after the months and months that the special spent investigating the former president and his allies' efforts to overturn the 2020 election, that she hopes the district attorney does something. Take a listen to what she said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

The mere fact that you have the right to do something -- and she has a right to speak, as a citizen, and even the grand jury rules in Georgia, you know, as long as she's not speaking about deliberations, she's allowed to. The mere fact that you have the right doesn't mean you ought to do it. And you can create serious problems for a prosecution or a court by speaking publicly. Number one, any defendant who is charged with a crime can immediately now move to have that indictment thrown out on the basis of saying, look, Your Honor, even before this was even a case, my client -- the grand jury was out there talking about how indictments were coming, dragging the names -- teasing that indictments were on the way and it's impossible to get a fair trial for my client. She handed them that. And that will continue through any trial.

If you were -- if someone was on a grand jury for several months and ultimately came to a conclusion that a defendant should be charged with a crime, certainly, they're invested in it and have a right to say that it's disappointing, that it happened.The problem is that in making the statement, she's undermined the integrity and the independence of the grand jury. It now appears that they are just an arm of whether it's the elected prosecutor or sort of political opponents of people who might be charged with crimes.

And developing opinions about it, developing opinions about defendants. That, too, can taint the prosecution. If this individual who we're hearing from really wants these people charged with crimes so badly, she better shut her mouth about them. Because ultimately, she could imperil their convictions, if they ever reached that point. And on appeal, after someone's been convicted, that's when attorneys can raise an argument like, hey, look, nothing was fair from the beginning here, on account of the fact that the jury pool was tainted by information that was presented to them, even before we got into court. It's just, again, nothing fatal has happened here right now.

Number two, what do you think you can get past a jury? If that's six or 11 or 12 or how many people? If you think and are convinced and can credibly say that we think that we can get this past a jury unanimously, beyond a reasonable doubt, that's who you charge with crimes.
