I'm Kasie Hunt.The Arizona Supreme Court has just taken the state's abortion laws back to the Wild West quite literally. Yesterday, the court ruled that the state must adhere to a near-total abortion ban written in 1864. The 4-2 ruling by a conservative majority revived a law that had laid dormant until the U.S. Supreme Court struck down Roe versus Wade in 2022. After the decision was announced, Arizona's attorney general made it clear that she does not plan to enforce this Civil War-era law. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KRIS MAYES, (D) ARIZONA ATTORNEY GENERAL:  Today's decision to reimpose a law from a time when Arizona wasn't a state, the Civil War was still raging, and women could not vote will go down in history as a stain on our state and on the Supreme Court. As long as I am attorney general of the state of Arizona no woman or doctor will be prosecuted under this draconian law. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And so, it's just -- the dynamic of how politics is usually done -- what Republicans normally do and what Democrats normally do -- the basis for that has totally changed. And we're seeing this in Arizona. There's probably not another state right now that's so distills exactly what America is up against.This law in a place that's such a battleground state means that the voters that I've been talking with -- the leaders of the anti-abortion groups and the Democrats putting forward a push to really enshrine abortion rights in the state's Constitution -- this clash shows the ways that abortion, as we show in our upcoming book, is about so much more than politics. I mean, this gets at the deepest, most closely held beliefs that Americans have about religion. Abortion is, of course, a law but it's -- or it's about health policy, but it's a symbol of religion, race, what it means to be a woman, really, fundamentally. So I think when we're hearing people talk about their big reactions to this law we are also hearing their feelings about their future as women and about families, and just what life with this next generation of the nation will even look like.",
