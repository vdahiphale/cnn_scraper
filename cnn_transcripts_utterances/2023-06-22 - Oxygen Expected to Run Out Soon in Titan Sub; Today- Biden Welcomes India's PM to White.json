And that is what rescue efforts were focused on today. When we talk about those banging noises, again, the U.S. Navy is saying, look, so far, it's inconclusive. But the point is that we will see more equipment on the scene later today, probably likely about ten ships as, all offering support to try and pinpoint exactly where that noises coming from and then being able to penetrate further depths to see if they could actually find that submersible.You know, Christiane I know what we heard from the doctor was incredibly chilling right. Do you have to think of those people in that claustrophobic Titan, trying to conserve oxygen. But experts I've spoken to, look, it is possible. And again, CEO Stockton Rush is on board. He has designed this and he knows that the backup capacity of oxygen is. I know, speaking to officials here in Canada that's what they're pinning their hopes on, because they know that anomalies like this have happened. Before people have survived longer than the prescribed oxygen said that they should have. What is key, though, is the fact that the capacity to actually deep dive today will grow. And that's an important point both by a French team that there, but also other equipment that has to play from St. Johns further to the east of here at that site. What they're hoping for though is in the last few hours, in the coming hours that they will, again, hear those noises. And that will give them some clues. I will say a coast guard was out there already yesterday. It does what they call side skin and just to pinpoint that they are able to actually skin the seabed and be able to more accurately see where those noises are coming from. Christine, this will be a critical day in the search given that the Titan has gone missing now since Sunday.",

They're because back in India, we've barely seen India's prime minister invite the media, talk to them and take questions from them ever since he was prime minister, elected prime minister in 2014. And the last nine years, it's been very rare. But that is going to be the exception to the norm, isn't it?When we're going to see him with the U.S. president after the joint statements, and what we have been told is that yes, he will be taking one question. And, this is after lengthy negotiations between the two sides according to two U.S. officials who will privy to this issue. So, yes, today is going to be one of those rare days, Christine, where the Indian journalists back in New Delhi will be watching closely because we don't get to speak to the Indian prime minister and press conferences very often. But, along with that, I think that just taking a step back, let's just talk about what this meeting means both for India as well as the U.S. I think the U.S. president, Joe Biden, knows that they're trade-offs, really because back, home and overseas, there has been more criticism on Narendra Modi's government, the alleged human rights violations, the sliding democracy, backsliding a democracy, be it also a lot of controversial laws that have impacted more than 200 Muslims here in India. There's been heavy criticism even on shrinking press freedom in India. So, Joe Biden is aware of that. But he's also, along with, that aware of how important India is as a counterbalance to China in Asia. And, that's a very, very important strategic partner for Biden, for the White House and for the U.S. administration. We are going to see a lot happening, they'll be a lot of photo-ops and yes I think one of the biggest takeaways, here, would be that Narendra Modi will be taking questions from the media today.

Still unclear but literally this video taking just moments after the tornado struck this town in the Texas panhandle. You could see people searching through the rubble, terrifying moments homes flattened and you could see the snap, trees completely turned over, RVs flipped on its side like they were toys, I mean, just incredible power within the tornado. And it seems like we've been going day, after day, after day talking about some of the latest tornadoes that happened to hit these populated centers. Remember, it only takes one to reach an area where humans live and we got that path of destruction, 11 tornadoes as Christine just mentioned, but, also the 47 reports of wind damage. And this is significant because in Houston, if this 97-mile-per-hour wind gusts, at Houston airport, actually confirms this would be a record wind gust for that particular location and to put that into contest this wind hasn't happened since Hurricane Ike back in 2008. And this was not associated with the hurricane. It was associated with a thunderstorm. That would be equivalent to a category two hurricane for instance. There's a thunderstorm watch in place across the eastern sections of Colorado. We have 5 million Americans under severe weather threat today, including Denver.

So nice to see this morning. Thank you for coming by here. You know, the entire world, David, is fixated on what's happening in the Atlantic Ocean right now. Even with all the known risk to travel to the ocean floor, to see the Titanic, it is still this object of fascination. Tell me, why do you think the Titanic is still such a draw that people would take such big risk to try to see it? DAVID SCOTT-BEDDARD, CHAIRMAN, BRITISH TITANIC SOCIETY:  Well, adventurers will always take risks, Christine, whether it's climbing Mount Everest or sailing solo around the world. And Titanic is one of those unreachable, on obtainable things for most of us -- unless you've been working in research, and our lucky to dive the wreck in the past. Or, now, of course have these adventures have paid a great deal of money to go down. They do play an important role when they're down there. The specialist, they do take part in some of the research while they're there. Why has Titanic such a draw? Well, of course, she sits majestically on the seabed, incredibly rare for a ship that sunk to be sitting upright. And she still looks very much like a ship, and I think maybe if she was lying crushed on her side the desire to go and see her certainly wouldn't be as great.",
