We are live in Tel Aviv with the very latest for you. Then the clock is ticking as U.S. aid to Ukraine remains stalled in Congress. Is this the last chance for funding before the 2024 presidential election? We will explore that. Class and music revival for the 2001 hit, \"Murder on the Dancefloor\", I speak to Sophie Ellis-Bextor about how the film \"Saltburn\" has catapulted her song into the limelight again. But first this evening, he is under growing pressure both at home and abroad. But Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is standing firm on his handling of the war with Hamas and what might happen after that. He insists he won't settle for anything less than total victory. Those are his words. Mr. Biden is also pushing back against the fundamental cornerstone of U.S. efforts to bring peace to the region. That is the establishment of a Palestinian state. Have a listen.

But the timing as it relates to the United States and an international audience is also extremely notable. And that's because over the last several weeks or in particular, as the Secretary of State, Tony Blinken was here in Israel. What he was talking about and what he was pushing for was a kind of using this war as an opportunity to not only create a Palestinian state, but also to put the state of Israel in a better position in the region longer term. Effectively reviving that notion of Israel-Saudi normalization of better integrating Israel into the region, all in the U.S.' views to provide more security for the state of Israel. And yet, here is the Israeli Prime Minister once again, not for the first time as you noted, effectively rejecting the creation of a Palestinian state, saying that in his view, it is at odds with the safety and the security of the state of Israel.",

Pentagon officials have not held a single meeting since last month to decide what to send Ukraine because there is no money to fund the aid packages. CNN's Natasha Bertrand joins us now with more from the Pentagon. And Natasha, only this week we heard that President Biden had met with House and Senate lawmakers to discuss this really what was at stake here for Ukraine. Has that helped move the needle at all?

But the president did emphasize to the lawmakers that visited the White House just a few days ago that without this money, the Ukrainians will probably run out and run out soon of artillery ammunition as well as air defenses, two really key capabilities that the Ukrainians need, of course, to fend off the Russians. So, the question now is whether Ukrainians -- whether the lawmakers here are going to be swayed by this. It doesn't appear at this moment that there is a lot of momentum moving forward in that direction. But you know, the U.S. has emphasized repeatedly, you know, in conversations with us, officials have said that if they don't get this funding, then that really is going to be to the Russians' advantage, that the Ukrainians likely are not going to get money beyond this $60 billion, and even if they do get it in that military funding more this year. In other words, before the election and Donald Trump may be reelected. And he has said many times that he does not believe that the U.S. should be funding the war in Ukraine. And so there is a fear here that this is really the last chance that the administration has to get this military assistance and funding to the Ukrainians before the 2024 election and before next year.",

A huge crowd gathered now outside the Supreme Court, the site of course, of the Dobbs decision less than two years ago that overturned Roe. And it's been really interesting listening to the language of the organizers and the speakers that we heard from on the National Mall just a little while ago, who really seem to change their language this year given the political moment heading into an election where many expect that abortion is going to be on the ballot now in 2024. The theme really tells the story. The theme of this year's March For Life was With Every Woman For Every Child, putting the mother first. And that's what we heard in a lot of the speeches of focus on health care and access to resources for mothers. And a big part of that it seems speaking with organizers and some of the anti-abortion organizations that took part in this, was that they know that this has been a losing issue here over the past couple of years. We have seen several referendums put to voters and go in the favor of abortion access, pro-choice initiatives even in red states like Ohio and Kansas and Kentucky. Even House Speaker Mike Johnson spoke a little while ago during the program for the March For Life. He had really tempered language. He didn't talk about restrictions or the possibility of any sort of national abortion ban, federal abortion ban. Instead, the only legislation that he even referenced was about health care for mothers, access for mothers. And so again, it speaks to how anti-abortion activists may be framing their messaging heading into this election where as you mentioned, the Biden administration, the President, Vice President heading out to take this case to the voters traveling around the country to talk about access to women's reproductive health care. They believe it's going to be a winning issue for them on the Democratic side, Isa.",

Now, Baldwin was indicted in the state of New Mexico on two counts of involuntary manslaughter. The October 2021 incident on a film set killed cinematographer, Halyna Hutchins, who was struck by a live round of ammunition fired from a prop gun held by Baldwin. Baldwin's attorney has previously said his client is not guilty. Last year, if you remember, special prosecutors dismissed the same charges against Baldwin.
