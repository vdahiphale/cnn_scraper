He got himself through that first one by having a ticket to a different flight.But the second layer is when the gate agent checks it. as they check in. You've done it. You can see it. and it gains and says, yes, everything's OK. But if there's a duplicate ticket that's scanned, that system is designed to make that warning at that point before anybody ever gets down the down the runway into the airplane. So there's definitely some vulnerabilities in that system, whether it's human failure, whether it's a systemic failure, that is yet to be determined, but it is a serious failure in my mind.",

But if you think about just the HIPAA regulations, about regulatory information or information about your own personal health.Now, if there's a HIPAA violation, which there could possibly be here, if they're asking for health information about passengers or even employees of the airline, they can ask that information. If that information is transferred or moved without the permission of the person that's -- that owns that data, which is you, for your own health care information. Then that can be moved and it's actually a federal crime and it can be a civil penalty of up to $25,000 to 35,000 dollars per event. So it's a very serious thing as well. And privacy of information in today's world -- as you know, I had my I.D. stolen from me and I have to use different Social Security numbers and everything else. So it's definitely possible to happen and it does. But when it happens with your own personal information, that becomes very serious and it needs to be looked at.

All six of the former law enforcement officers pleaded guilty back in August to federal charges. Attorney General Merrick Garland spoke out against their heinous acts, attacks earlier this week. This morning, former Rankin County Deputy Brett McAlpin, who you see there on the left, was sentenced to more than 27 years in prison. Now he was the highest-ranking officer on the scene. And soon, the man on the right, that is former Richland Police Officer Joshua Hartfield, will learn his fate. CNN senior national correspondent, Ryan Young, joins us from Jackson, Mississippi, where he has been following this case. But also, you've been in court throughout these proceedings, Ryan.

A team of us have been following the story for almost a year now.And today, when we talk about the racial motivated part of this, what we are also learning is there are plenty of people who are white, who are showing up to now complain about these officers and the role they played. We learned that the fourth-highest-ranking member of the sheriff's department -- that's Brett McAlpin -- he actually showed up off duty in civilian clothes and watched all this go down. Eddie Parker really put it -- summed it up really well. He said, \"Everyone's begging for mercy now, but that night, while we were being tortured, beaten, waterboarded, tased over and over, shot, we begged for our lives and no one felt for us.\" So you can understand the pain that's still going on here. Gets 27 years. On top of all that, what a lot of people sort of were concerned about or even talking about in the gallery was the fact that McAlpin's attorney was a black man. Take a listen to some of the defense and some of the reasons why he thought his client should have gotten less time. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

I just got it.Now of course, I'm also interested in how the nation is picking. Well, most folks -- most folks are like me, guys. Most folks or the plurality of folks picked UConn, 26.1 percent. Who was the most popular non-number--one pick to win at all? How about Arizona at 6.6 percent? I'll note, earlier on in the week, it was Kentucky. So these numbers have been moving around as more and more folks have been picking in their team, unlike you two. And how about the biggest first-round upset? Nearly 48 percent picked Oregon to advance. They're an 11 seed. That's the force most upset ever, ever. So we'll see if the Ducks are able to advance. And then, of course, a bizarre stat. Cinderella in 2020. And 0.3 percent for over 5,000 fans picked all 16 seeds to advance. That's a very bad idea. But I guess some people want to roll the die -- guys?",
