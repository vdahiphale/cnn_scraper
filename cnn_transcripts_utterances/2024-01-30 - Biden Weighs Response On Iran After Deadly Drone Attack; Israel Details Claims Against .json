In other words, a Goldilock strike.Monday, Biden met with his national security advisors, who say Iran backed militants were behind the attack. Iran, though, is denying any connection to the drone strike. And while White House officials have repeatedly insisted the U.S. does not want war with Iran, the option of strikes on Iranian territory remain on the table. Sunday's attack on the U.S. base, known as Tower 22, was the deadliest on us forces in the region since the withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021 and marks a significant escalation since October by militants targeting U.S. forces. Those attacks have been over us support for Israel, and since the war in Gaza began, hostilities within that region have been escalating almost daily. Sunday's attack was the first to claim the lives of us military personnel. CNN's Natasha Bertrand reports the U.S. president is now vowing retaliation. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

And that requires him that whatever response he does first tactically is not such that it will be yet another reaction from these different militias or from Iran, particularly if the strike is directly aimed at Iran and so that it stops there and doesn't go further. But then strategically, the president should have come to the viewpoint at this point that the continuation of the war in Gaza is a threat to us national security because it fuels tensions throughout the region and fuels particularly for specific fronts that target the US. And as a result, if we don't want to have an escalation in the region strategically, then we need to get a ceasefire in Gaza.",

The Iranians certainly have a degree of control and they probably can do much more to rein them in, but they don't have complete control. Take a look at, for instance, what the Houthi spokesperson said last week. When asked as to whether the Houthis in Yemen are an Iranian proxy, he said, rest assured, if the Houthis were a proxy of Iran, they would not be in a direct confrontation with Israel right now, which seems to suggest that the Iranians are not terribly happy, at least with the extent to which Houthis have been attacking ships in the region.

And I think from the standpoint of some of the Republicans, they've been looking for a war with Iran for the last 15, 20 years. Some others are just using it as a political tool because they can push for it to look tough. And if Biden goes ahead and actually strikes Iran ends up in a war that actually will benefit the Republicans electorally because it will be very, very unpopular with the American voters.

But a source familiar with the discussions tells me that a broad framework was agreed to by those parties who were in Paris that would include an initial phase of civilian Israeli hostages released by Hamas and other groups that would be accompanied by a six-week pause in the fighting. That pause could be extended if more of the hostages are released, including the IDF soldiers, both men and women, and the bodies of hostages who are still being held in the Gaza Strip. Now Hamas would expect Palestinian prisoners to also be released from Israeli prisons. Three Palestinian prisoners for every civilian hostage. That ratio could go up with the IDF's soldiers.
