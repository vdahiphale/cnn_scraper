From there, officials say he moved around the city before checking into a local hostel. That stay giving investigators this picture of what they're calling a person of interest after this moment of flirting with a female employee, we're told, was captured on camera. And breaking just moments ago, the parent company of UnitedHealthcare, notifying employees of enhanced security at its campuses. Former FBI profiler Candice DeLong joins us now to unpack all of this for us. Let's talk about that bus ride arriving in New York long before the shooting. What do you make of that timeline?

I mean, look, we've spoke with healthcare experts who say this is a thing that often -- these healthcare claim denials are a thing that often causes people anxiety and frustration. And it's a really common problem. More than half of Americans, 58 percent say, that they have experienced some kind of problem with their health insurance over the past year, including denial of claims, preauthorization issues, those kinds of things. And of that 58 percent, 15 percent of those respondents say that it actually caused problems with their health anxiety or delays in the treatment that they received.

So, it is hard to find information about which of the insurers perhaps denies more claims than others. One of the interesting things that UnitedHealthcare has come under fire for in particular is its use of artificial intelligence to decide about claims. There was a lawsuit filed last year, a class action over the use -- alleged use, I should say, of A.I. to deny claims for elderly patients. And it found that most of those claims in the end after they were fought over were approved.But I think there's a sort of growing feeling like these companies have a lot more power than the individual patients that they're dealing with.",
