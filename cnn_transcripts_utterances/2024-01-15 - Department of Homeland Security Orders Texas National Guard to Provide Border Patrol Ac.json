And I want to leave you with a statement, because it's very telling in this letter. It says, \"Some of the barriers placed by Texas and the armed soldiers deployed by Texas are on federal land, specifically, Texas National Guard is blocking entrances through federally owned and maintained border barriers with armed soldiers.\" And Poppy and Phil, the DHS has given Texas until Wednesday to give Border Patrol access.

That was President Trump over the weekend urging his supporters to turn out to vote in Iowa, even if it's quite literally the last thing to do.Now Trump supporters are by far the most enthusiastic to caucus tonight. You can look at the numbers right there and in just a few hours, we're going to see if that enthusiasm will actually translate into votes. Here is where his base is coming from, and I think it's important to know. As we look at this map right now, it's all gray. We've been talking about polls, we've been talking about projections, we've been talking about ground games, it's about to fill in and that's what actually matters -- when people start to vote. Now, if you flip back to 2016, you'll remember Ted Cruz actually upset Trump. Trump was bleeding in the polls going into the day, Cruz ended up winning because of a ground operation. And the large reason why he won was in places like up here in the northwest part of the state, also down here as well. What are these places most known for? These are the more evangelical areas of the state. These are also areas where the education level is a little bit lower. What do we mean by that? Well, let's take a look at the actual evangelicals. The darker parts of this state, right now, the boxes that you see that are more of a dark brownish color right here, these are the heavier evangelical populations, in the northwest part of the state down here in the south as well. These were areas that Cruz was able to take significant advantage of peeling off evangelicals from Trump. That has started to shift over the course of the last several years. You can see it in the polling where Trump is actually leading in polls of evangelicals. So what does that mean for DeSantis? It means he's going to have to hope in places like up here where Ted Cruz not only just beat Trump, he dominated Trump in the northwest part of the state, can he actually have an impact there to hold on to votes like that? The bigger issue, of course, as well is not just where evangelicals are, but also in the other rural parts of the state. Those don't have college degrees. This has always been Trump's base -- White, rural, less educated. Can DeSantis peel off any of those votes as well? It is an open question right now, but there is no question at all, Donald Trump heading into this race with a major advance in the polling, both writ large, but also with certain subgroups like evangelicals -- Poppy.",

In 2016 for some context here, evangelicals made up two-thirds of Republican caucus goers. That's when Ted Cruz beat Trump to win the state and on the heels of this poll, \"The New York Times\" asked several pastors which way they were leaning and why.

And why is it him over the former president? DR. TIM LUBINUS, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, BAPTIST CONVENTION OF IOWA, SUPPORTS RON DESANTIS:  Well, like everyone, our faith informs any of our decisions and my faith is the Christian faith, and so the object of the faith is Jesus. And I'm informed by studying the Bible and community, our community of other believers. And my faith looks for somebody who is somebody of integrity, who is principled, and who's a proven leader and that is the description of Ron DeSantis.
