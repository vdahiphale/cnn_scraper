We coordinate with each other, but there's really no central command and control.Each one of us, he says, quote-unquote, \"basically acts according to their own national interest.\" And in fact, the United States itself has made it very clear that Hezbollah has been acting with restraint. Hezbollah has not targeted Islamabad's population centers but if you look at what's happening in the past few weeks, it's really Israel that has been pushing Hezbollah to the limits. It's provoking Hezbollah. It has been killing its, I mean, top commanders in the field. It's had attacks Hezbollah in the very heart of its social base in Beirut and the south. It has killed scores of Hezbollah members in Syria. More in the past three months, 19 Hezbollah fighters, than in the past year. And the United States is terrified, is terrified and is really trying to basically pressure Israel not to provoke Hezbollah. Israel also, Fareed, and the Defense Department, the U.S. Defense Department, has been furious. It targeted the Lebanese army 34 times in the past three months. And if you ask me what's happening here and I probably -- I might come across as too cynical, but I think Netanyahu's political future depends on the continuation of the war in Gaza and probably its expansion.

Public reckoning for his strategic failure on the 7th of October and for his failure to deliver on his promises. I mean, let's take stock of the last 100 days.",

He won against two rivals who both in various ways favored a warmer relationship with Beijing.In response to the election, a Chinese government spokesman said the basic fact that Taiwan is a part of China will not change. Joining me now is Bonny Lynn, the director of the China Power Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. Bonny, welcome. Give us a sense of Lai Ching-te.

I think there's a general impression that everybody in Taiwan wants independence but when you look at the polling, that's not the case. Most people in Taiwan just want the status quo. They're not independent, but they are basically in de facto independent. And if you look at this poll, he wins 40 percent of the vote and the other two candidates together take 60 percent.Does that tell you that there's sort of a majority of Taiwan is uncomfortable with this more assertive, anti-Beijing, pro-Washington position?",

So one way to look at this is, and this is how China looks at it, is that Lai does not have the popular vote in Taiwan and nor does his party have control of Congress. Hopefully, and China has that perspective, it will put some moderation in terms of how China views Lai as well as Lai's ability to influence Taiwan's cross-Strait policies.",

In the last couple of months, particularly since the Biden-Xi meeting outside of San Francisco, we've seen U.S.-China relations stabilize to some extent.I would still say competition still defines U.S.-China relations but it is interesting to watch what has happened in the last week in U.S.- China relations. Almost every single day of the past week leading up to Taiwan elections, we've seen some form of critical U.S.-China engagement. Monday and Tuesday, we saw military to military talks between U.S. and Chinese militaries. On Wednesday and Friday, we saw Minister Liu Jianchao from China's International Liaison Department of the Chinese Communist Party, engages with principal deputy National Security adviser partner as well as meet with Secretary Blinken. We saw on Thursday, a call between Secretary Mondo and her Chinese counterparts. So we have a good up tempo of critical engagements between U.S. and China leading up to the elections.

That story when we come back. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) [10:50:45] ZAKARIA: When I was in Ukraine, I had the opportunity to sit down with Mykhailo Fedorov, the deputy prime minister for Innovation, Education, Science and Technology. Fedorov is the man behind Ukraine's drone fleet and we aired an interview about that. But Fedorov also serves as minister for Digital Transformation and what a transformation it is. In this war-ravaged country, the citizens can now pay taxes, receive benefits, get a driver's license and more all via an app. As it fights for its own survival, Ukraine is showing the world how to make government tech savvy and nimble. I talked to Fedorov about these efforts and I wanted to bring you that conversation now. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

They have their driving license on there. They have a national id. They have the equivalent of our Social Security card on there. But many, many more apps like -- is this now -- is it a kind of digital first strategy where the primary documentation is now all digital?MYKHAILO FEDOROV, UKRAINIAN DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER (through translator): Yes. We have special laws. We have become the first country in the world to adopt laws making electronic passports comparable to physical passports. We even have an option to get electronic driver's licenses without getting plastic licenses. This is our country's strategy and we are implementing it actively. And today, our core app Diia is used by more than 70 percent of all Ukrainians. It is very popular. And all the services are launched first online and then offline. So, this is our strategy, launching digital first.",

      "sentences": "And with this app, Diia, what can -- what can an average Ukrainian do on that app that -- you know, that we would not think you can do digitally?FEDOROV (through translator): Your electronic passport is there. You can get any kind of services using this passport. You can pay taxes. You can receive fines for parking illegally or traffic violations. You can donate to the armed forces. You can get any certificate you may need to submit to government agencies. And during the full-scale war, you can also get Social Security payments and benefits if you live, for example, in the area of hostilities. The government understands that and makes targeted payments. And if you are in the occupied territory, you can even use Diia to provide information about the movement of enemy equipment and inform the armed forces about the enemy's location. And more than 500,000 Ukrainians have provided information about the enemy in the temporary occupied territories. ZAKARIA: And you can file for damage payments, right? If your building is bombed by the Russian, you can just go on your app and say, you know, my building is bombed, I'm putting in a claim for, you know, kind of a reimbursement. FEDOROV (through translator): Right. Right. Today, this is the most relevant service for people whose real estate has been damaged or destroyed. They can use Diia to file such a claim and then the claim gets to a special register. Everything is checked automatically. A very few bureaucrats participate in it. Everything is transparent. Everything is documented. Every action is logged electronically. And therefore, the service is rather transparent. And the World Bank sees that. They see how all of it is built. And donors are helping us to rebuild the country because the process is quite convenient on the one hand and very transparent on the other.",

We want to have our own Google, Apple, and other big tech companies. To do that, we need to transform our educational system. We want to build the most convenient, comfortable country in the world in terms of government services. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
