And he signed a federal plea agreement with prosecutors back in September that hinged on just one thing, Alex Murdaugh had to be honest and forthright. Last week those prosecutors said that he had failed a polygraph and asked the judge to hold Murdaugh in breach of that agreement, releasing prosecutors from their end of the deal.Now, Murdaugh's attorneys today are going to argue that they haven't seen that exam yet and that they say the polygrapher distributed - or exhibited weird behavior, odd behavior, talking about another high- profile crime. It is the latest in many twists in this years-long saga with Alex Murdaugh.

(END VIDEOTAPE) GALLAGHER (on camera): So, why does this matter, how long he's sentenced, if he's already serving two life sentences for those murders? Well, the original plea agreement would have allowed Murdaugh to serve his federal sentence concurrent, at the same time as those state sentences. And why, at this point, federal prosecutors say they might want that to now be consecutive, after the state sentences. All this hinges on whether or not Alec Murdoch win that appeal for those murder charges. If he does and this federal sentence was served consecutively, John, this would effectively keep him in prison for the rest of his life between the state and the federal charges, even if he were able to successfully appeal the murder charges.",

You are on the phone with us and I know you're going to be in court today. Your clients are the victims of Murdaugh's theft. What do they want to see happen? What will you be arguing for today? ERIC BLAND, ATTORNEY REPRESENTING VICTIMS OF MURDAUGH'S FINANCIAL CRIMES (via telephone): We will be arguing, Sara, for a concurrent sense so that that means - against the concurrent sentence so that he will be serving it consecutively, meaning the federal sentence will be served after the state sentence of 27 years has completed. Now, he's a 55-year-old man. So, the odds are he's going to die in prison. But we want to make sure that there's no opportunity for him to get out or get his state sentence reduced. And by having the federal sentence served consecutively, that will ensure that if the murder charges and convictions are reversed, he still will serve the rest of his time. Remember, this - this is a career criminal who's hid (ph) for the cycle. He is a double murder. He is a convicted thief. He's a convicted money launderer. And he's an extremely dangerous man who is constantly scheming with his attorneys to try to game the system. And so it's up to this federal judge today to give a consecutive sentence, instead of a concurrent sentence.

And they just passed a bill last month and they're ready to blow up the House again. We've had three speakers already in the past year, including Patrick McHenry, Kevin McCarthy, and Mike Johnson. And now Marjorie Taylor Greene is setting this up so we might have a fourth speaker. They haven't done anything to raise the minimum wage or create new jobs. They haven't done anything about health care. They haven't done anything about education or housing, or anything that the American people wanted them to do when they came into office. They said they were going to address inflation and corruption. They haven't done either of those things. They've spent all their time wasting their effort on trying to impeach Hunter Biden, who's not even the president of the United States, because they're trying to go after him to get to Joe Biden.And so it's a reflection of the fact that the Republicans are not a serious governing party. They've seriously become only a grievance party. And I don't know how Mike Johnson works his way out of this situation.
