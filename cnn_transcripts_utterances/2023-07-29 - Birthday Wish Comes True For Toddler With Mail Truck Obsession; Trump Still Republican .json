And while consumers cut spending on home improvement, furniture, lodging and online electronics, they are splurging on entertainment.Bank of America said that this spike is likely driven by the highly anticipated releases of \"Barbie\" and \"Oppenheimer.\" That is helping what had been a lackluster summer movie season. And \"Barbie\" alone raked in $155 million of the domestic box office during its debut weekend. That film is distributed by Warner Brothers, which like CNN is owned by Warner Brothers Discovery. \"Oppenheimer,\" the Christopher Nolan film brought in another $80.5 million. Combined, this debut was the fourth highest grossing industry weekend of all time in North America. Just the latest example of how despite high inflation, Americans are still spending and that is driving what is turning out to be a surprisingly resilient U.S. economy. That people aren't spending lavishly on goods right now but they are spending on experiences, restaurants, trips, movies, and of course, concerts.
