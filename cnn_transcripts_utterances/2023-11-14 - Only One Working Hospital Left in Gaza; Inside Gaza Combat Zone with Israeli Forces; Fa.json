I want to bring in Dr. Mads Gilbert of Norway. Now he specializes in emergency medicine and anesthesiology. He is now in Cairo, trying to get to Gaza to help. I have to say, Dr. Gilbert, you and I spoke I think, 4.5 weeks ago when you just arrived in Cairo at the time. You were hoping to get access into Gaza. I can only imagine how frustrated you are at this point. Just describe that frustration for me, if you will. DR. MADS GILBERT, PHYSICIAN AND FORMER VOLUNTEER, AL-SHIFA HOSPITAL:  Yes, thank you, Becky. I think I am not the only one with this immense frustration. I think the whole U.N. family and the whole global NGO family, we feel the same. We feel this, as the hours pass by, we get more and more information about the number of people dying unnecessarily, because they can't be given proper treatment. And of course, let alone the constant bombing from the air, sea and ground, which has caused massive losses. I calculated yesterday, I summed up the U.N. numbers. For the first four weeks, there are 12,000 killed and 28,000 wounded. And of the 12,000 killed, it is 6,000 children killed or missing. So this is a massive disaster. We see now that there are almost no functioning hospitals because of a lack of electricity and water, food actually and, of course, the last 24 hours, oxygen, oxygen.",

They have been building 10 hospitals in the north. They bombed a Turkish hospital, the adult cancer hospital; they bombed (INAUDIBLE) the pediatric cancer hospital. They bombed the eye hospital, the psychiatric hospital and so on and so forth. And they have been besieging the Jerusalem hospital, which is a Red Cross hospital, in the middle of Gaza City for a week and bombed it relentlessly. So this excuse to claim that there is a command center -- well, show us the proof. And number two, you are not allowed to attack a mixed civilian and military target. And hospitals are protected by international law. Even if you found a soldier there, you could not bomb it. I have never seen a soldier, I've never seen any of the rank and file in the hospital. I have seen the minister of health. He should be there. Otherwise, I have seen absolutely no proof. And I think these are, you know, trying to hide.

And she went on to explain just why there is not this free license to attack under international humanitarian law. Perhaps that is something we can discuss. I also wanted to bring this up with you, Doctors without Borders tweeting the following. \"This morning, in Gaza, bullets were fired into one of three MSF premises located near Al-Shifa Hospital and sheltering MSF staff and their families, over 100 people, including 65 kids who ran out of food yesterday night. We have been trying to evacuate them for the past three days. \"MSF is asking the Israeli army and Hamas for safe passage for them to leave the epicenter of intense fighting currently going on in Gaza City.\" No food, bullets being fired, Mads, these are hospitals.

Leading the march here, many have spoken about their frustration, the lack of answers they're receiving, the demand that the government do everything it can to release the hostages. Some 240 still held in Gaza, from the very young, their grandparents, grandmothers and grandfathers. The message that they are trying to send to prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu and the war cabinet is do whatever it takes. Make whatever deals necessary to bring them home as soon as possible, regardless of the deal. Their priority, not destroying Hamas, not destroying the tunnels but bringing families home. For the past two weeks or so, they've been outside the defense ministry when the (INAUDIBLE) met, trying to make sure that the government hears them in that way. They feel that that hasn't been enough. So now they've taken to the streets of Tel Aviv, where they will march from here to Jerusalem over the course of the next several days. This march, very reminiscent of a march from more than a decade ago, when the family of Gilad Shalit, an Israeli soldier, who was held prisoner in Gaza for give years, decided they, too, had had enough and marched from their home in northern Israel to Tel Aviv. By the time they arrived in Jerusalem, they had thousands with them and put a tremendous amount of pressure on Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, to make a deal to free their son. This the same idea but now the family of 239 or so hostages, trying to put that same sort of pressure to bring their family home, to try and demand answers. And this is the way they are doing it now -- Oren Liebermann, CNN, on the streets of Tel Aviv. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

You are watching CONNECT THE WORLD from our programming hub here in Abu Dhabi.There are fissures between or within the Biden administration on its approach to the Israel-Hamas war. On Monday, secretary of state Antony Blinken emailed his staff, saying, quote, \"I know that for many of you, the suffering caused by this crisis is taking a profound personal toll. The anguish that comes with seeing the daily images of babies, children, elderly people, women and other civilians suffering in this crisis is wrenching. \"I feel it myself. We're listening. What you share is informing our policy and our messages.\" CNN's Jennifer Hansler joins us now from the State Department. We have reported that there are fissures between departments. Speak to what we know about the narrative that is evolving at the State Department and how that might be different from that at the White House at this point.",

Of course, a lot of what the disagreement comes from isthis idea of a cease-fire, which we have seen top levels of the State Department and the White House double down on their opposition to such a cease-fire. They are saying that it is not the time. We have heard from officials here in the State Department and a lot of these listening sessions that Blinken talked about have been rather contentious. Of course, the White House is the one here who is ultimately shaping the policy. It is up to the President of the United States to shape that policy. So as much as Blinken is saying they are listening to what the employees here have to say, at the end of the day, it is President Biden who sets the policy here. Now the State Department spokesperson Matt Miller was asked by the dissent memos yesterday at a briefing. He would not speak to the memos themselves. Those are classified; that channel is private. However, this is what he had to say about divisions writ large. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MATT MILLER, SPOKESPERSON, U.S. STATE DEPARTMENT:  So I would say that the State Department -- like every organization, not just in government but around the world -- contains people with a diversity of views. And one of the things we think is one of our strengths -- you've heard me talk to this before. You've heard the don (ph) talk to this last week. I think you've heard the secretary talk to this at times. One of our strengths as an organization is that we have that diversity of views and that we welcome people to make those views known.

Next hour, U.S. President Joe Biden heads to San Francisco for the APEC summit and a meeting with Chinese president, Xi Jinping. They will sit down Wednesday, at an undisclosed site near the city. There has been a flurry of high-level diplomacy ahead of this meeting, aimed at mending strained ties.

Well, as Phil Mattingly first reported this morning, there has been some kind of agreement in principle -- we will not know until it is officially signed -- to limit the movement of these chemicals from China to Mexico that eventually have made their way into the United States. It has been a top priority, actually very much a bipartisan priority. We saw a delegation from the United States come here to Beijing just about almost eight weeks ago, Becky. Chuck Schumer was there, as well as leading Republicans. And they actually met with Xi Jinping himself. And they expressed to them, some of the stories of heartache that they have reported in their own individual districts. And that is actually very interesting. It was interesting for Xi Jinping, I am told because that is not something he necessarily hears from. He hears from lawmakers on a much more national scope, not so much on the local level. And that he spent more time with them than they anticipated. So it led to this. This is something that was not necessarily off the conversation list. So I think that if this does happen, indeed, Becky, there certainly will be agreement on both sides of the Pacific that this was an effort in goodwill to get done.",
