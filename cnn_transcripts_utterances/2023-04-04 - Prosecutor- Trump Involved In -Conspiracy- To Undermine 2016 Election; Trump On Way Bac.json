The former President right now in the air heading back to Mar-a-Lago after appearing in court in downtown Manhattan where he pleaded not guilty to 34 counts of falsifying business records in order to hide damaging information from the public. Those are the charges.And according to the indictment, from August 2015 to December 2017, the defendant, I'm quoting and that obviously is Donald Trump, \"orchestrated a scheme with others the defense,\" the indictment reads, to influence the 2016 presidential election by identifying and purchasing negative information about him to suppress its publication and to benefit the defendants electoral prospects. Now, according to the statement of facts which accompanies this actual indictment, which they go through here through here, $130,000 were paid to adult film star Stormy Daniels, $30,000 to a doorman, and $150,000 to another woman, which it is clear from the statement of facts is Karen McDougal. It is an unprecedented chapter in American history. And good afternoon to all. I'm Erin Burnett here in New York.",

He also said he understood the potential conflicts and that he was entitled to a conflict free representation. I mean otherwise he seemed to be, you know, a little bit hunched forward while they were talking. He looked over at the photographer's when they were taking the pictures at the start of it.

In fact, just a few moments ago, his campaign sent out yet another fundraising appeal. They'd been doing them virtually, most every hour for the last several days. And he writes this, as I fly back home Mar-a-Lago, we're living through the darkest hours in American history, but he adds, I am in great spirits.So certainly, I'm told by talking to advisors, he will have a defiant tone. Even though you can clearly see by the look on his face in the courtroom, as Kara was just describing there, this absolutely took him aback. He was sitting in a legal proceeding, he had no control over what was going on. He was really alone in ways that he has not been for certainly, since he's been president, even long before that.

So his advisors expect him to sort of wrap all of this together in his speech from Mar-a-Lago this evening, saying that he is the victim of all of this. So, there's no doubt that, at least for a moment, he has frozen this presidential campaign in place. He is the Republican front runner without a doubt. But it is also clear that this legal case, the courtroom now is a central stop on the campaign trail. But look for tonight's speech to not be about the nuances of the law, if they should throw these cases out, but about his politics, and why he believes he should be the Republican nominee and indeed, the next president.

Remember, Erin, right now we do have this very bare bones indictment, which I should add, it is not required for a prosecutor to give the entire -- entirety of their entire argument, their entire trial. That's really what we want to consume as part of the court of public opinion. But they have no requirement to give everything, to give notice and opportunity to be heard to kind of due process.And there's a lot said today, Erin, about the fact that, well, this obviously is for the federal government. Well, listen, they're talking about a thing called preemption, which means that listen, the federal government, they have their role, there are federal laws, and you have state courts and state laws and one has to stay in their lanes. But although the FEC has been very clear over time, the campaign contribution world is our own, there are things that they will not preempt, and one of them is a candidate's personal financial disclosure as one. There are other areas in state law that might allude to the fact that look, it's about campaign finance, but not right under the wheelhouse of your laws, there have been court to uphold the ability of a state prosecutor to do those things. And so, I know this is not as serious to many as a January 6 insurrection or the transition of power from one president to another. But as Alvin Bragg detailed, you're still talking about transparency and disclosure and the ability to know how money is being spent, for what purpose, for the transparent benefit of the electorate. That appears to be the lane that they're in, in New York State, and that's where they're falling right now. But I fully admit, this is quite the Achilles heel. The more you're explaining in politics, the more you're losing than where you're trying to explain the nuance of a law in a courtroom, the less a jury is enticed into convicting. We'll have to overcome quite a bit today. But finally, Erin, think about it, in our American history, voters have not been averse to trying to reelect or elect a candidate when there is consensual sexual activity involved. I point to President Bill Clinton, who was reelected even after admitting and lying and under oath.

Clearly, it seems to me with Michael Cohen and Donald Trump discussing this, which we had CNN known about.And then, there was another one that said, the defendant directed lawyer A, Michael Cohen, to delay making payment to woman to as long as possible. He instructed his lawyer that if they could delay the payment until after the election, they could avoid paying all together, because at that point, it wouldn't matter if the story became public. So what they're trying to do is say, this was all about the election, because of course, it would matter to his family and his young son if it became public before the election or after the election.
