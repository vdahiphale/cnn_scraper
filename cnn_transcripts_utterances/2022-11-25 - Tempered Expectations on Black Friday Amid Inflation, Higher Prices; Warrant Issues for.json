And happening right now, the holiday shopping season in full swing as consumers flock to find the best Black Friday deals today. Will inflation push people to cut down on their holiday spending? There are some positive signs for retail sales. Despite the higher prices, the National Retail Federation expects more than 166 million Americans will do some shops this weekend, that a significant increase from last year. Ahead, we're going to take you to one of the largest department stores in the U.S. to see how those crowds are looking this morning. Plus, an arrest warrant now issued for the friend of an American women killed while on vacation in Mexico, what authorities are saying about the circumstances under which she died. And just incredible survival story, the U.S. Coast Guard rescued a man from the Gulf of Mexico after he fell over from a Carnival cruise ship. What we're learning about the search and rescue operation and just how long he survived in the water. Let's begin this morning though with CNN Business Correspondent Alison Kosik. She is at the Herald Square Macy's in New York City, a lot of history there. Alison, you're our person on the ground. What signs are you seeing this morning? How busy of a day is it going to be? ALISON KOSIK, CNN BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT8:  Jim, good morning. The rain that is coming down here in New York City now putting a damper on the holiday shopping spirit that we're seeing right here at Macy's in Herald Square, in the middle of New York City. I was inside earlier today before they opened the doors and there were a couple of hundred people waiting outside in the cold and in the dark to get in when those doors opened at 6:00 A.M. Eastern time. So, whoever said that Black Friday in-store shopping is dead, I would say it is not. We are in the middle of a big shopping extravaganza. I'm talking from before Thanksgiving Day yesterday all the way through Monday, Cyber Monday. 166 million people are expected to shop during this long holiday shopping weekend. Just today, Black Friday, 115 million people across the country are expected to shop with more than half shopping in stores, as I said proof of Macy's behind me. You know, one thing weighing on everybody's minds, though, the shoppers who I talked to, is inflation. It is kind of elephant in the room. Many shoppers that I talked to, they're feeling it impact how much they can spend and what they could spend on. Many shoppers telling me this year, they'll have to stick to a budget and really make choices that they wouldn't otherwise have made. I want to you listen to one shopper who I talked to earlier. Listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Department stores will be killing. They're looking at a 25 percent growth year-on-year. So, it says the consumer is back in the stores. We're back to a more normal, like a pre-pandemic Black Friday.Black Friday is not the only day. It is one of the biggest shopping days of the year. But we're looking at a holiday season that is going to be growing and forecasted at about a 7 percent growth rate. So, yes, there is a lot of inflation but the consumer is still pretty healthy.",

Mexican prosecutors say the victim's death was not an accident, the result of, quote, a direct attack that involved one of her female friends.CNN's Ryan Young has been following all of this for us.

Of course, when you talk about the internet, making this happen, a lot of black social media pushing this forward, black Twitter is all involved in this. The reason why is because people had questions about exactly why this woman died.And there is a video online that we cannot show you just because we haven't been able to authenticate it for ourselves, but in the video, you can see that lass looks like more than 30 seconds, there is a woman hitting another woman over and over again. And the second woman is not fighting back. Now, we've got in contact with Shanquella Robinson's father and he says that his daughter that is in that video. So, you can understand why these parents were so upset in the very beginning. According to our affiliate, WBTV, the friends came back from Mexico and indicated that she died from alcohol poisoning. But when you look at the death certificate, you can see she actually died from a spinal cord injury. So, things did not match up at all. And these are not new friends or someone that she just met. These are people that she knew from college. So, all these questions have been going back and forth. The FBI is now involved. And it is that internet constant traffic of people saying, hey, when is she going to get justice, to help keep this in the consciousness for so many people. But listen to a friend of talking about how painful this has been for them trying to figure all of this out. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) K'DAHJAH VINSON, FRIEND OF SHANQUELLA ROBINSON:  I'm glad that it is getting the attention that it needs because I wish it was like this from day one. I'm more so disappointed that she was around people that she thought were her friends. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And authorities are saying that this unidentified man was a passenger on a cruise ship, the Carnival Valor, which took off from New Orleans on Wednesday on a five-day cruise bound for Cozumel, Mexico, and it was on Wednesday night that this individual was at the bar with his sister when his sister says that told her that he was going to restroom but he never came back.She reported him missing to the ship at noon on Thursday. At about 2:30 is when the ship contacted the U.S. Coast Guard. They got involved in the search and rescue operation. The cruise ship also got involved, stopping in its tracks, retracing its route to contribute to that search and rescue operation. The man was eventually spotted floating in the Gulf of Mexico by crew members of a vessel that was also in the area. He was airlifted and transported for medical treatment. But earlier this morning on CNN This Morning, a lieutenant from the Coast Guard described the rescue and said that this is just nothing short of a Thanksgiving miracle. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) LT. SETH GROSS, SEARCH AND RESCUE MISSION COORDINATOR, U.S. COAST GUARD:  I'll be honest with you, a 17-year career, this case is unlike anything I've been a part of it. So, I think it kind of blows the norm -- the normalcy out of the water here and really just shows the will to live is something that you need to account for in every search and rescue case.

This is probably the biggest development in the police investigation that we've had since that shooting that claimed the lives of six people at Walmart in Chesapeake, Virginia, on Tuesday.According to the city of Chesapeake, police did a forensic analyst of the shooter's phone, which they found on the scene, and say they determined that there was a note on that phone. It was entitled death note on the phone. They released a screen grab of that on their Twitter account this morning. Look, the note talks about his grievances against himself, against his co-workers. It talks at length about God and the Holy Spirit and essentially feeling inadequate and angry about things. Look, we don't talk a lot about these because, essentially, they are excuses for murdering people, six people at that Walmart, but I do want to read you these two excerpts from this here. One of them saying, the associates gave me evil twisted grins, mocked me and celebrated my downfall the last day. That is why they suffer the same fate as me. It also says, I wish I could have saved everyone from myself. May God forgive me for what I'm going to do. Again, it was entitled death note. The city also adding that there were talks about, we discussed that search warrant that was executed at the shooter's home, Andre Bing, 31 years old, after the shooting occurred. They say that they found a box of ammunition, various items in there in reference to that 9 millimeter semiautomatic handgun that they say he was armed with, in addition to several magazines that were on the scene at this home. They found the box receipt and other paperwork. And, again, he purchased that gun on the morning of the shooting there on Tuesday. And, look, most important in all of this, the community of Chesapeake trying to recover from this reeling from that shooting and those victims who I want to show their faces and say their names again, because they are center of this shooting, Lorenzo gamble, Brian Pendleton, Kellie Pyle, Randall Blevins, Tyneka Johnson and a 16-year- old boy who was killed, all of them working at Walmart. They were co- workers of that shooter, Andre Bing, who, again, was the overnight team lead at Walmart, according to the company, and had been with Walmart since 2010. Many of the survivors we spoke with described the shooter as somebody who was often paranoid or who was condescending and mean to them as employees and still, though, that they didn't expect this to be the way that that was going to turn out, Jim.",

And so there is a very low likelihood that this will pass during the lame duck, even though the president has said that he wants to get something done.He has talked about what he was able to get passed earlier this year with a modest bill on gun safety. But in terms of this more far- reaching effort to try to ban assault weapons, it just doesn't seem like the math is there and Republicans who are going to take control in just a matter of weeks have said they have no interest in restricting gun rights at all.",

There is pressure for them to try to fund the government far into the future as well as to raise the debt ceiling. But Republicans are salivating. They realize that they're going to on the cusp of power in the House that they haven't had for quite some time. They are going to be able to use some of the levers of power, including things like the debt ceiling, including things like funding the government to try to pressure Joe Biden.And so Biden hasn't specifically laid out what he wants to get done during the lame duck on those two major issues, but I would not be surprised if he tries to put some pressure on his fellow Democrats to try to lend him a hand ahead of next year, which is going to be full of oversight and investigations and all kinds of political brinksmanship as well.",

So, it may be -- these may be some of the last bipartisan major bills that we see over the next several years as we start to get into campaign mode, thinking about 2024, thinking about the next presidential race.
