      "sentences": "Thank you for getting an early start with us, I am Kasie Hunt. And we start this morning with breaking news. We are following this news out of Iran. Five Americans, the U.S. government says have been wrongfully detained there are expected to be released today. That's according to the Iran's foreign ministry.A Qatari jet is on standby to bring them home. Five Iranians in U.S. custody are also expected to be released. Let's bring in CNN's Natasha Bertrand here in Washington. Natasha, good morning. What do we know about what's happening right now and what brought this deal about?",

      "sentences": "Yes, Kasie, this has been a deal that has been in the works really for the last six to seven months, and it began to crystallize just last month when the Iranians did release five of those Americans into house arrest after they had been imprisoned for several years. And the administration had been working with the Iranians through the Qataris to try to get these American-Iranian dual nationals released from Iranian custody.And now, we are seeing that according to Iran's foreign ministry, that appears to be moving forward today. We are told that as part of this deal, the U.S. has also agreed to release $6 billion worth of Iranian funds into an account that Qatar will oversee, that Iran can then use for humanitarian purposes. Also as part of this deal, five Iranians will be released from U.S. prison. And they will be released in exchange, of course, for these five American-Iranians that are being released from Iranian custody. Now, this really ends a long nightmare for these dual Iranian-American citizens, one of them, Siamak Namazi has been in Iranian custody really since 2015. And he has been extremely angry with the Biden administration for what he perceives as a lack of action on their part. He's also angry, of course, at the Obama administration which negotiated a similar deal with the Iranians back in 2016, that saw Namazi left behind as part of that deal at the time. So, this is a really key moment for the Biden administration, which has made the release, and the bringing home of wrongfully-detained Americans overseas, a central part of its foreign policy. Now, of course, this has already received a lot of criticism here at home because of that $6 billion that I mentioned earlier. Republicans really seizing on that, saying that it amounts to a ransom payment, but of course, the administration says, look, we see an opportunity here to get these five Iranian-Americans home, back to the U.S., back to their families, and we are going to seize it. And of course, emphasizing that this is not U.S. taxpayer money, this is Iranian money that will be transferred into accounts overseen by Qatar and by the U.S. Treasury Department for their disbursement, Kasie.",

So things like medicines, medical supplies, food, things that the Iranians have said that they need, and that the administration now is willing to provide, granted, of course, that it is closely watched and closely scrutinized by the Qataris and by the U.S. Treasury Department.The administration says the Iranians are not going to be able to use this money for just anything. It is not Iranian cash just going into their coffers, and importantly, it's not money that the U.S. is paying to the Iranians, of course, to get these prisoners out. So, all really important points that we should expect if this prisoner deal goes through the administration to continue to emphasize today, Kasie.",

      "sentences": "I think the main motivation here for Iran will be the money. We've seen that in previous deals. We've seen that most recently, perhaps, if you analyze the rapprochement that they've had with Saudi Arabia, and the fact that Iran is longer supporting the Houthis and giving them cruise missiles and other weapons to fire into Saudi Arabia.Part of that deal which called for, you know, an end to those particular tensions foresaw better economic and business relations between Saudi Arabia and Iran. So Iran is desperately short of money. The leadership there knows that it has weakened because it isn't delivering to the people on many fronts, not just on the sort of economic front, but on a human rights front as well. So the leadership there is under pressure, and the deal that's been struck here is going to be a tough sell for both the Iranians as it is for the Biden administration showing that there are controls and constraints on this money that was Iranian money, not money that's being gifted from the United States taxpayer. And on the -- on the Iranian front, we've heard from both the foreign minister today and the president over the past couple of days, saying that this essentially, we will use this money as we see fit in proportion to our requirements is how the foreign minister put it or how the president put it. He said it's up to our government how to spend that money. And I think for those who analyze what Iran does with its finances will recognize that if Iran puts its hand into this bank account and withdraws money for humanitarian goods, be it food, be it medicine, whatever it is for the well-being of its people, it takes some pressure off the people. But it also takes financial pressure off the Iranian leadership to perhaps spend those moneys that they were going to spend on their own people, spend those monies equivalent on other  developments, be it nuclear, be it weapons, whatever. So that raises concerns and anxiety.",

All of that speaks to the pressures that the human rights pressures and expectations from the population. The discontent, particularly with the younger population, against hisolder leadership. The economic hardships facing the country that were witnessed by citizens, perhaps most acutely during the COVID epidemic, because there were -- people were dying in droves in Iran because there wasn't enough medical support. All of these issues are brought into focus for the Iranian leadership. They -- if they're going to hold on to power, they need to have more money at their disposal. Now, they are and do have some economic deals and are perhaps seeing that they're getting some political or diplomatic leverage -- we again, going back to that Saudi-Iran deal that was brokered by China recently, and the economic deals that are being done between China and Iran at the moment. All of those give the Iranian leadership a reason to believe that they can alleviate some of the tensions on them by having more money in their -- in their own pocket.",

Over the past few months, we have been wondering how is he going to try to defend himself in this case?And a good defense that he had at his disposal was that don't blame me, blame my attorneys, I was just listening to what seasoned veteran attorneys were telling me to do. And he would be somewhat telling the truth there, Kasie. There were people, attorneys like Sidney Powell, Rudy Giuliani, John Eastman and others, encouraging him to contest the election and to try to overturn the election. They told him it was legal, they told him there was precedent and he listened, or maybe not, according to this interview, he says it was all his idea. So if this impacts the trial, it could.
