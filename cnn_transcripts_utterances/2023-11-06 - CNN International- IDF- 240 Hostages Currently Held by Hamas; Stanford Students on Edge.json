He's meeting with the country's foreign minister, but he's not expected to see Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Erdogan has condemned Israel's actions in Gaza, saying they are crimes against humanity. Israel denies targeting civilians with its air strikes, but hospital officials and eyewitnesses in central Gaza say a blast inside a heavily populated refugee camp late on Saturday killed dozens of people and injured many more. Those officials blame Israel. The IDF says it's looking into the circumstances surrounding the blast. The IDF now has -- it now says that 240 hostages are being held by Hamas. They say the number can fluctuate based on updated intelligence. That news comes as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu tells Air Force members there will be no ceasefire unless all hostages are released, adding quote, we will continue until we beat them. Ofri Bibas Levy believes her brother and sister-in-law were kidnapped by Hamas on October the 7th, along with their two young sons. She says she's seen a video of her sister-in-law and the children being taken. Ofri joins us now from the Golan Heights. Thank you so much for joining us.",

I've been living my whole life under terrorism, threats from all kinds. It was bombing. It was missiles. It was shooting in the cities. It was out stabbing people in the cities.

It is also short sighted and not entirely rational. Because as I'vesaid before, you know, if you manage to eliminate all of Hamas, what next? The root cause of this conflict is an illegal occupation. It is routine human rights abuses, illegal settlements, disregard to UN resolutions, and international law. If we do not address these root causes, then you can kill the combatant but you cannot kill the cause.
