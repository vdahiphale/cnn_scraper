So, those are the main two bits that the demonstrators are protesting against.We've seen these protests taking place, for what, the past six months or so. Earlier today, they were blocking in the Port of Haifa, one of two of Israel's major ports on the Mediterranean. Haifa in the north and Ashdod in the south. They've been blockading Haifa. And their plan is to do something similar to Ben Gurion International Airport, just outside of Tel Aviv. This is the main in and out for international passengers, some 90,000 due in and out today.

But similar to Blinken's trip, officials are saying they're not expecting any significant breakthroughs. She is not expected to be meeting with the Chinese President Xi Jinping either. Yellen has long signaled the Biden administration's desire to improve communications with the Chinese and really lower the temperature between the world's two largest economies, which as we know, are deeply entwined. Back in April while giving testimony before Congress, she stressed the importance of maintaining ties with China and said that decoupling would be a big mistake. And then last month, at the Paris Finance Summit on stage with Chinese Premier Li Qiang, she said -- let me read it to you. As the world's two largest economies, we also have a responsibility to work together on global issues. It is something the world expects of us. And of course, you know, Yellen's trip comes at a time when there is real uncertainty to the global economy. China is struggling to reboot its economy post COVID, and the U.S., you know, trying to contain inflation and avoid a recession. Global challenges and mutual areas of concern will no doubt be on the agenda, but the airing of grievances will no doubt be on the agenda. But the airing of grievances will no doubt be a priority. The U.S. has imposed sweeping restrictions on China's access to advanced technology, specifically semiconductor technology, citing national security threats to the U.S. This is very much upset the Chinese. Well, you know, as far as America is concerned, the scope of China's new counter espionage law and the challenges that they could present for foreign companies is quite alarming. We know that Yellen will be meeting with American companies operating in China. Obviously, a lot to discuss on her three-day visit.

Who has said that 700,000 Ukrainian children are now in Russian territory as a result of Russia 's invasion. Which I just had a quick look at the statistics, that would make it about 10 percent of under 18's in Ukraine. CLARE SEBASTIAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT Yes, I mean, look, it's strange, this number is startlingly high, orders of magnitude higher in the 19,500 children that President Zelenskyy said Russia had illegally deported as of early June. He also said they've brought some 371 back. He doesn't offer any evidence. He then proceeds to use this as a way of accusing Ukraine of mistreating, he says, Ukrainian teenagers in the southeast of the country. He does say that this is in recent years. The timeline is kind of vague. Some of it might have happened before the actual all out invasion of Ukraine. And he says that this was part of program to protect orphans, children abandoned in the war zone, and that they include, in some cases, their parents and the caregivers, if they were at orphanages. But this is really important to watch, because obviously, there is evidence that this is happening. Enough evidence to, frankly, indict the president of the country. As the president of Russia, Putin is indicted in March, along with his children's rights commissioner. And particularly important to watch as we see Ukraine take another potential step towards justice in this war. In the next hour, they will be opening an international center in the Hague to investigate the crime of aggression. This is a leadership crime, looking at the potential decisions that led to the invasion itself. This is the type of crime that really has not been prosecuted in any way since the Nuremberg trials after the Second World War. This isn't the tribunal itself, but it is perhaps a step on the path to that, for a tribunal for Russian leaders as a result of this war. NOBILO: But what power does something like that have? It just seems like there's depressingly little muscle behind and it and use these international institutions, or perhaps, even the launching of this new international center at the Hague at this time while the conflict is active and all the officials involved are in Russian territory or in the war zone.",

When you see this comment from this Russian lawmaker, saying in 700,000, why would you come out with that comment when your president has been indicted and there's clearly evidence that this is happening and the world sees this as a war crime. I think there is an understanding in Russia that there's not very much that can be done to actually reach the leadership of the country itself. But it would be very important symbolically for Ukraine to get this off the ground.",
