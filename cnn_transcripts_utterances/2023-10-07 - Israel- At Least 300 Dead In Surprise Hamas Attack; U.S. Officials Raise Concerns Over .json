I'm Jake Tapper and you are watching special CNN coverage of Israel at war.Israel's cabinet convened late this evening after the surprise coordinated terrorist assault by Hamas that so far has left at least 300 Israelis dead. Many of them civilians and 1,500 injured. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told his government that Israel is, quote, embarking on a long and difficult war forced upon us, unquote. Netanyahu went on to say, quote, the first phase ends by the destruction of the majority of the enemy forces, end quote, we will restore security to the citizens of Israel and we will win.

Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei posted this disgusting message, quote, God willing, the cancer of the usurper Zionist regime will be eradicated at the hands of the Palestinian people and the resistance forces throughout the region. He did that with a video of Palestinian terrorists Hamas attacking if memory serves attendees of a peace concert, attending, again, just revolting the words of Iran Supreme leader. Thousands of Iranians gathered on the streets of Tehran to celebrate the bloodshed, to celebrate the innocent civilians murdered as Iranian state media showed parliament members cheering death to Israel. Obviously, that does not represent the Iranian people writ large who are in many ways prisoners in their own country, but it is also true that long held hatred of Israel has only grown as Israel has inched towards normalizing relations with Saudi Arabia in a U.S. back deal that would have been troublesome for Iran. Iran is Shiite and the Saudis are Sunni, and those two sects are at odds quite often. As the Washington Post's Max Boot noted earlier today, quote, \"Indeed, while we don't know for sure why Hamas chose to strike exactly now, this could well be part of a larger attempt by Iran and its proxies, including Hamas, to prevent historic reconciliation between Jerusalem and Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Max Boot is also a senior fellow for the Council on Foreign Relations. He joins us now. Max, thanks so much for joining us. The U.S. officials say it is still too early to say definitively if Iran was directly involved in this attack, but we do know that Iran funds and arms Hamas. We know that Iran does not like the idea of Israel and Saudi Arabia forming any sort of diplomatic alliance. Put this into the larger perspective, if you could.",

On the one hand, you have Iran and the so-called Shiite crescent with its proxies being very prominent in Iraq, being very prominent in Syria, being very prominent in Yemen, and also, of course, in the Palestinian territory, and in particular, Hamas receives major support and arms and money from Iran.On the other side, you have Israel and the Sunni states, especially the Saudis and their Emiratis, with U.S. backing, who are very much attempting to contain Iranian influence and power. And that is what is responsible for this historic reconciliation, which has already happened between Israel and the UAE and Bahrain, and that is now in the process of occurring between Israel and Saudi Arabia. But, clearly, Iran, with its brutal proxy wars, is able to basically come up the works. And that's what they're trying to do, I think, right now is to prevent that reconciliation by creating this horrific war in Israel's backyard that will inflame the entire region.",

I think less so over Hamas, but nevertheless, there is a substantial relationship. But again, we can talk about Iranian complicity. [11:10:10] But the question is, Jake, what do you do about it? And, of course, we already have a lot of sanctions on Iran. We could try tightening those sanctions, but the reality is we've found in the last few decades is that it doesn't take that much money to sponsor terrorism. You can -- you're never going to be able to cut off all the money that Iran uses to support these extremist groups.

I mean, up until now, the Israeli calculation has been that they will retaliate for Hamas attacks, but they don't want to go to the extent of actually destroying Hamas because they don't know what's going to come after Hamas.And basically, the Israeli security establishment position has been better than the devil you know than some other devil that may come along down the road. And their concern has been that if Hamas is not there, you could have an even more militant organization, hard as that may be to believe. But there are even crazier organizations like Al- Qaeda that could take over or you could have just share chaos. Or in some ways the worst thing from the Israeli perspective is to have to go back in and to reoccupy the Gaza Strip because, of course, Israel evacuated Gaza in 2005. And most Israelis have no desire for another costly and brutal occupation. But if you destroy Hamas and there is no effect of authority over the Gaza Strip, somebody has to roll. And, unfortunately, the Palestinian Authority is probably too weak to do that. The Egyptians, Jordanians, Saudis, they're not going to -- I don't see them providing troops. Certainly not working with the Israelis to pacify Gaza. And so basically, at the end of the day, Israel is going to be left with this terrible dilemma in whatever military operations they undertake it. Yes. They can militarily defeat Hamas. There's no question that the Israeli Defense Forces are going to be much stronger than Hamas. There's going to be horrible, terrible, brutal fighting that's going to go on. And there will be heavy casualties on both sides. At the end of the day, I don't doubt that the Israelis will prevail tactically and militarily. But then the issue becomes now what? How do they create any kind of peace and order going forward in Gaza if they completely eliminate Hamas? That has been basically the question which has held Israel back in the past. But right now, I think what Israel is finding out is that the status quo is not as sustainable as they thought. That they thought they had deterred Hamas from these kinds of major attacks and clearly they had not. And so now they're kind of running out of options and having to kind of go all out in a military campaign without a clear end game.",

This is exactly why they did it. They wanted to put some sort of barrier, some sort of check on what's clearly going to be because it's already been announced a very aggressive air.

The real question is because of our intelligence collection on Iran, which is usually pretty effective, the operational security of this operation, given the scale of it by land, by sea, by air, by incursion into Israeli towns was on such a scale that secrecy here on the Hamas part was paramount.It's not just an intelligence failure on the part of Israel, Jordan, the United States, all of the people who pool intelligence, but it's a success on the part of Hamas in terms of operational security, bringing Iran in operationally could have added to that risk.

Back with our special coverage of Israel at War.Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu declared war after Hamas terrorists launched a surprise attack on the Jewish Sabbath also on a Jewish holiday, Shemini Atzeret, firing thousands of rockets, shooting civilians, kidnapping many civilians, along with some Israeli soldiers. The death toll is expected to continue rising. So far, the Israeli government says at least 300 Israelis were killed and 1,500 injured. Israel has been firing back overnight with strikes in Gaza, in the region. Day is now beginning to break. The state of Israel, since its founding in 1948, is widely known to have some of the most sophisticated military and intelligence capabilities of any country in the region. It has thwarted numerous plots over the year -- years and with American funding assistance, its Iron Dome has given Israeli some sense of security from air attacks. This time, of course, Hamas went decidedly low-tech in many ways using bulldozers, gunmen using paragliders, trucks, motorcycles, a multi-pronged attack that as far as we know, Israel and the U.S. just simply didn't see coming in anyway. Let's bring in retired Air Force colonel and CNN military analyst Cedric Leighton, and CNN's Pentagon correspondent, Oren Liebermann, who before he moved here was our Jerusalem correspondent. Oren, I've seen a lot of, especially academics and journalists in Israel saying, one of the reasons why the response from the IDF, the Israeli Defense Forces, was took so long, was it so much of the IDF is on the eastern part of Israel, in the West Bank, protecting settlers, you know.

And it wasn't just the failure of intelligence to see it coming, it was then the failure of the military to stop it once it started and the failure of the military to respond. Sure.

We've seen a few howitzers, armor personnel vehicles going in. But it's nothing compared to what is expected to be deployed here.But with daylight, there are people coming here to try to see their family that they -- that they lost contact with yesterday. Gentlemen standing behind me here really wants to get in touch with his son and his former partner, his former wife, who are -- who are in one of the communities close to -- close to Gaza. These are areas now that the Israeli Defense Forces believe that they have secured. The police station in Sderot, just a few miles away, was secured a little earlier. But it's still hard for people to get in touch with some of their loved ones, and that's a concern. So we're seeing a few people showing up this morning here to this -- to this checkpoint, asking for permission to go through. That's not happening yet, and this is still a controlled zone, Jake.",

I know what that is throughout the history of the Jewish people. These are massacres of Jews. This terrorist strike this terror army went into Israel and slaughtered 300 Israelis. And for perspective, I mean, Israel is a small country. You know that. For perspective, in American terms, that would be as if over 10,000 Americans were slaughtered. And the barbarity and the brutality that we witnessed in videos like this. And in the stories that we've heard from friends and relatives in Israel, and again, small country, small Jewish community around the world, so many of us have been in constant contact with people that we know across Israel. This horrific action was carried out by a terror group that has no -- that was intent on trying to do something horrific and slaughtering Jews. And I'll just say this. What that shows is the difference between this terror group and what we're going to see in the coming days. And that's the last point on me, Jake. The fact is that going forward, Israel is going to take the necessary action to protect its citizens just like any other country in the world would just like any person around the world would expect from its leadership. And every casualty, every fatality in that battle as a result of what happened by Hamas is Hamas's fault that the Israeli soldiers will regret every loss of life. These Hamas thugs, these terrorists, these disgusting awful attackers, they relish in it. And the desecration of bodies and the treatment of live bodies, the hostages that are now in Gaza and the parading around of dead bodies as well. It's disgusting. It's something that every person who has some sense of decency around the world should look at. And so reason that so many world leaders are standing firmly and clearly with Israel as we all should.",

That's what happened yesterday. Again, I think there'll be lots of -- I know throughout the -- throughout the day, there have been people trying to figure out exactly what happened here. It's a really important exercise, but we need to focus on what's happening at the moment. And that's the fact that this terror we came in has now launched over 5,000 rockets all across Israel, 1,900 plus 2,000 people already acknowledged to be injured. And reservists from around the country, some multiple generations within the same family being called up in the citizen's army that Israel has to defend their country. That's what we're focused on at the moment.",

We heard in Congress from Greg Meeks. I thought he made clear that -- he's in your conversation with him, the ongoing discussions he's having with leadership about how this would get done. And I trust that it will. I have no idea how.But I do know that the statements from a -- from a huge number of members of Congress, a House and Senate, just like leaders around the world have been incredibly supportive of Israel and the face of this horrific attack and the -- most importantly, Secretary Austin and the President of the United States made clear the commitment of the United States to Israel's security. I don't know. There are a lot of things that I don't know about what's happening in Congress. Jake, we're all trying to figure that out. There's never been a moment where a Speaker of the House has been kicked out. That's something that the internal politics in which they'll have to figure out. But at a moment like this, when a close ally is facing the kind of risks in the aftermath of this really terrible massacre, we're going to have to figure out how to do that. And Congress will have to figure that out. And I'll look forward to the conversations that I'll be having with my former colleagues, Democrats and Republicans alike who are -- who are dedicated to doing what's necessary to stand with our ally.",
