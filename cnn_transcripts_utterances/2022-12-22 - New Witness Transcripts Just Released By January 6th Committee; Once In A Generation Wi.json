The less you remember, the better, Passantino said, according to Hutchinson's testimony and he allegedly advised her to stop talking to the committee, saying contempt is a small risk.Hutchinson told the committee, Passantino, who was paid for through allies of former President Trump, never explicitly told her to lie.

It reads like the transcript of someone who is formerly a member of an organized crime family that's rebelling against having to take the -- you know, the organization's attorney. There are just lines in here that you can't possibly make up where Mr. Passantino allegedly says to her, we just want to focus on protecting the president. We know you are loyal. They dangled job opportunities to her to be discussed immediately after she testifies in each one of these three interviews. At one point she says, he never said to me I have to be loyal, but I knew the repercussions, I'd been in this world. So, she knew exactly what was happening here. She really struggled with how to deal with that psychologically and emotionally. She felt a lot of guilt about it and ultimately was responsible for provoking the third interview, which is where she really let loose with the actual full facts in accordance with the question she's answered.

You can tell your client, don't recall is not perjury, that's fine. What you can't say to them is, even if you remember, just say you don't remember. And it certainly is very improper for him to be talking about things, like loyalty and protecting someone else. He should be saying to her, my loyalty as your lawyer is to you, I want to protect you, here are the consequences if you don't tell the truth. Sometimes I have clients ask me, hey, what if I just lie about it? And I'll tell them, I can't tell you to lie, here's what could happen if you do, and here's how they might figure out that you're lying.

I think she sort of knew that she had information that would be relevant to the committee, that would be damaging to the former president, and that having an attorney from the Trump orbit was not going to be in her best interests.

But telling someone, they don't know what you know so it's okay to say you don't remember something, that is just absolutely teeing someone up to dissemble, to obfuscate what they actually know. And let's look at this relationship between them begins on a bad note. He refuses to give her an engagement letter. An engagement letter is the basic agreement that you sign with any attorney you're working with that lays out the obligations on both sides. He refuses to tell her who's actually paying his bill. I mean, it's just replete with red flags that lead you to believe that this was not for her benefit, it was in fact for someone else's. And that cuts at the core of the ethical problem.",

And, honestly, they were taking advantage of the timetable and it being in the committee. If that was in court, that could be challenged. And it may -- there's nothing inherently privileged about where the money comes from. That could be drilled down on if they go before a grand jury and they're trying to invoke that or got in front of the judge, chief judge who oversees the grand jury.

Russian forces still pounding the city, as they've been doing for months now, driving most of its 70,000 residents away. These days, it's eerily quiet here. Silence broken only by rushing soldiers and Russia's deadly bombardments. Only a handful are staying, braving the Russian artillery roulette. They gather in underground shelters. Power, water, heating only available in aid stations like this. There's Wi-Fi too, a chance to call family, get a warm drink. For Dennis, it's this that keeps him going. We're holding on, surviving, he says. His father stayed behind, and so did he, betting on Ukraine. We hope our soldiers will defend Bakhmut, he says. To make sure they're able to do so, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy traveled all the way to Washington. PRES.
