Dianne, walk us through what happened in court this morning. I mean, it was just incredibly remarkable to hear from Judge Clifton Newman reflecting in a very measured way, talking about these crimes that Murdaugh's been convicted of, but also the person that he saw him become. DIANNE GALLAGHER, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENTAnd what we saw today, the judge alluded to, the judge said, you had such a beautiful family, friendly people, you were gregarious and friendly. How did you go from that to this? The judge said that Murdaugh had argued before him in the past. They knew each other. He removed a portrait of Murdaugh's grandfather from that exact courtroom behind me where this murder trial took place. And Alex Murdaugh was convicted of murdering Maggie and Paul Murdaugh because he wanted to ensure a fair trial. I was astonished at the powerful words of Judge Clifton Newman and just how raw he got with Alex Murdaugh before he sentenced him to two consecutive life sentences for those murders.

The judge referenced this when talking about it, that we have -- he's been convicted of murder. He will spend the rest of his life in prison. But there are 90 plus additional charges that the judge still has to preside over with dozens of victims from financial crimes, from other type of fraud crimes that are related to Alex Murdaugh.And, look, we just heard from the father of Mallory Beach, whose daughter was killed in a boat crash. Paul Murdaugh was charged in before he died driving with that boat. He had pleaded not guilty. And those charges were dropped after he was murdered. But Mallory Beach's father said that, you know, this sentence was something he could, you know, this felt like the closest thing they would ever get to justice. Eric Bland, the attorney who represents Gloria Satterfield, the Murdaugh family housekeeper who died after an alleged fall at their home, and then Alex Murdaugh admitted on the stand and has admitted in court in a settlement agreement to stealing millions of dollars from her sons. He talked about this. There are so many people who are impacted by this here. You know, Amara, one last thing, including the judge himself. He focused in on the fact that he felt sorry for Alex Murdaugh, seeing him in the media as a grieving father and husband to start with. Judge Clifton Newman's son died right before unexpectedly this trial began. He spoke himself as a grieving father to Alex Murdaugh, a man who again has just been convicted and sentenced to life in prison for killing his own son and wife.",

You know, Alex Murdaugh was an incredible lawyer in South Carolina, very well respected. And to see the fall from grace in this courtroom today and to hear how Judge Newman characterized that and spoke directly to Alex about, you know, his family, you know, his experience with Alex and how, as he's imposing the sentence of life without the possibility of parole, you know, how he was so moving. For those of us who've been watching the trial, it's so moving to see that because oftentimes we don't get to see that from judges. And Judge Newman has been just a consummate professional and incredible judge and to hear the way that he spoke on behalf of the victims as well was very important.",

And in terms of the prosecution did not seek the death penalty, so he wouldn't have been able to sentence Alex Murdaugh to death.But what I need to point out is that by Judge Newman saying, look, I'm not questioning why you didn't seek the death penalty, but I would just note that the Murdaugh family has controlled justice in this county for over a century. And during that time, the Murdaugh family, as solicitors, has requested a death penalty for far less crime, something as far less brutal than these two murders.

But I do believe that Judge Newman did make the right call atadmitting that evidence. Certainly that will be the subject of an appeal as well as a post-conviction relief appeal that Alex Murdaugh will be likely claiming ineffective assistance of counsel. There are two separate issues that he can take up, obviously, post sentencing here today, that will be a long road ahead for Alex Murdaugh.

So there's so much frustration here.And yes, it does snow in these mountains during the winter, but the past few weeks, it has been unprecedented, with the first ever snow blizzard warning. So, of course, people were just not prepared for the amount of snow that we got. I've been speaking to a number of residents virtually because there's no way to get up the mountain. And the concerns are very similar. They're worried about food. The roof at one of their only supermarkets in the area collapsed because of the snow. So they're worried about food for themselves, for their pets. They're worried about medicine because the pharmacy is closed and they are tired.

We're talking about a laundry mat. You can see the sign of this place that fell from that roof and hit that car. There's a gas station across the street that was also hit by this tornado. And as you can imagine, the folks out here, they were quite antsy. They were incredibly worried about the fact that they got this emergency alert last night. The National Weather Service out here had been telling them for days that this bad weather would be making their way out here. In fact, we're told that there were several people inside of this laundry mat yesterday when that emergency alert went out. There was one man who told us a woman inside was worried about coming out to get her children that she left inside of a car. The man told her, look, ma'am, it is way too dangerous out there. The winds were coming in. It was starting to rain, and so they waited inside. That's when that tornado ended up hitting. Now, we talked to the mayor of Shreveport earlier this morning.
