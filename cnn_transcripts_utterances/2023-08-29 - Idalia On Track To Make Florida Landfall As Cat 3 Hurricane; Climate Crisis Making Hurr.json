This is a storm that gained additional strength early this morning.It's compounding what scientists have been warning for the last several hurricane seasons, which is that climate crisis -- the climate crisis we're seeing is making hurricanes intensify at a faster rate, and that's creating potentially deadly storm surge conditions. My next guest is Michael Mann. He's the director of the Penn Center for Science, Sustainability and Media at the University of Pennsylvania. He has a new book about the climate crisis called \"Our Fragile Moment,\" which is a very appropriate moment that we are in right now. Tell us a little bit, Michael, about what you're seeing and how the climate crisis is affecting this particular storm as we see this unusually warm water in the gulf.",

      "sentences": "Yes, thanks, Brianna. It's good to be with you.And you put your finger on it. We have bathtub-level warmth with these waters in the Caribbean and the tropical Atlantic. It's been a record year. It's been the warmest year we've ever seen when it comes to Atlantic Ocean temperatures. And global temperatures as well. A piece of that could be this transition we're undergoing from a La Nina to an El Nino event, that's a sort of natural fluctuation in the climate. But it's riding on top of this tide of an ever-warming planet from carbon pollution, from the burning of fossil fuels. And the heat isn't just at the surface. It's penetrating deeper into the ocean layers. And that's when you see the sort of intensification, these rapid intensification events, when you have warm waters, not just at the surface, but below the surface. Because the hurricane churns up those deeper waters. And when they're cold, that dampens the hurricane because it's the warmth of the water that drives, that strengthens the storm. But when the churning of those waters doesn't bring up cold water anymore, because that warm water is penetrating deeper and deeper, that's when you see these very rapid intensification events. And there's a real worry among a number of observers right now that Idalia could, in fact, strengthen into a cat 4 hurricane before it makes landfall.",

And again, they will continue to assess the situation.There's two things I want you to remember about gas prices, Jim. In the short term, even if this hurricane doesn't affect you, it could affect your gas prices. And even in the long term, throughout the entire hurricane season, you do want to keep ahead of that forecast because it may affect what you pay at the pump. Let's get first to the prices, Jim. Right now, the price today is $3.82, the national average, up $0.07 from about a month ago. And it's getting very close to that all important $4 a gallon price. And the problem there is that both psychologically and for inflation, that's a bad thing. What could still affect it? Jim, it's all of those things that Michael was just talking about. And what happened was the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration upped their hurricane forecast. We now have not a normal season on the horizon, but about a two in three chance of a worse-than-expected hurricane season. That will certainly impact gas prices if that comes to fruition. We were just discussing Chevron. They said three already evacuated. More to come if this storm intensifies. And again, they're expecting it to be temporary. How great is the damage? They want to keep people safe. How long does it take before those facilities get back online? That's all important, Jim. And again, we have to wait and see what the hurricane season brings. It will directly affect the prices you pay at the pump over the next few weeks, at least -- Jim?",

Months ago, this cohort of Uzbek nationals traveled to the United States across the southern border and sought asylum in the U.S.They were vetted according to standard U.S. procedure and then they were released into the country pending a court date, as is typical in this kind of situation. It wasn't until later, in recent weeks, that the U.S. Intelligence Community learned that these people traveled to the United States with the help of a smuggling network that included an individual with some pretty troubling ties to ISIS. This obviously raised a lot of alarm bells across the federal government. The FBI really kind of scrambled into action to try to locate all of these people, assess them, investigate their backgrounds, determine whether or not they're a threat. Work that we should emphasize is ongoing. So big response inside the federal government to this.",

And so, at U.S. request, the Turkish government arrested members of this network, including the ISIS-linked facilitator.And that allowed the U.S. to quickly get a sense that this person was not actually a member of ISIS. He's more like an independent contractor with some personal sympathies for the group, right? And so that gave them some confidence fairly early on that this was more likely kind of a run-of-the-mill human smuggling case rather than a potential terrorism case. And U.S. officials are saying on the record at this point that there is no indication that any of these individuals inside the United States are planning any kind of ISIS plot or part of any active planning or even have connections to the terror group at all. But that said, Brianna, there are counterterrorism and intelligence officials inside the U.S. government who we spoke to in the course of our reporting who said this whole episode really illustrates a pretty troubling vulnerability. It illustrates the possibility that terrorist groups could try to sneak across the southern border, sort of hiding in the kind of surge of migrants seeking asylum in the United States. Obviously, long been kind of a boggy man on the political right. But for some counterterrorism officials in the U.S. government, they say this is the test case that shows the chink in the U.S. armor.",
