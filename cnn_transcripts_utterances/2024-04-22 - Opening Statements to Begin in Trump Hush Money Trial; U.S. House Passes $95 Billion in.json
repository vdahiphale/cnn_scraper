      "sentences": "It's Monday, April 22nd, right now on CNN THIS MORNING. Opening statements set to begin in Donald Trump's hush money trial. New CNN reporting on who prosecutors plan to call as their first witness. A foreign aid bill passed by the House, leaving hard right Republicans and Hamas infuriated.And a crisis on campus. Jewish students at Columbia University urged to stay home for their own safety. All right, 5:00 a.m. here in Washington, but this is a live look at New York City on this Monday morning where   opening statements are set to begin in the Donald Trump trial. Good morning, everyone, I'm Kasie Hunt, it's wonderful to have you here with us. Opening statements in the historic criminal hush money case against Donald Trump set to begin just a few hours from now. CNN has learned that David Pecker; the former Chairman of the \"National Enquirer's\" parent company is expected to be the first witness called by the Manhattan DA's office, according to a person familiar with the plans. Pecker was a central player in the alleged scheme to pay hush money to adult film star Stormy Daniels to cover up her alleged affair with Trump ahead of the 2016 presidential election. Pecker is the first in a string of witnesses expected to take the stand. They include Trump's former fixer, Michael Cohen, Stormy Daniels herself, the former Trump aid Hope Hicks and Karen McDougal, who was also alleged that she was paid to conceal an affair with Trump. The former president briefly spoke to the media after jury selection wrapped up on Friday. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

He's the first senior military official to resign over the Intelligence failures that led to the deaths of over a 1,000 Israelis, hundreds more taken hostage. CNN's Max Foster is with me now.Max, good morning, great to see you. This is really kind of the first significant move toward Israelis, the Israeli  government taking accountability for having been on watch when October 7th unfolded. What do you see in this move here? MAX FOSTER, CNN INTERNATIONAL ANCHOR &amp; CORRESPONDENT:  Well, the Intelligence agencies, a while ago, didn't they? They -- you know, they admitted there were Intelligence failures and on a pretty epic scale. If you look at the fallout from what happened on October the 7th, but also the fallout since then as well, the reaction, this war that's come out of it, and the -- you know, the -- you know, the pain that Israel has been through. So, this is someone finally taking account and responsibility for that. The question is whether or not, you know, it's enough. This is just one senior Intelligence officer where many people are pointing the finger at Benjamin Netanyahu, the Prime Minister who was ultimately -- who is ultimately responsible for, you know, the reaction, and someone who is, of course, plugged into Intelligence. And you know, whether or not he saw that Intel and whether he was part of that failure. So, I don't think this is the end of it, but I think there will be some satisfaction at least that someone is taking responsibility.",

I mean, certainly, it changed the politics on the ground here in Washington in terms of the movement of aid to Israel getting out the door and the House Speaker Mike Johnson finally acquiescing to the pressure around that. Is this all unfolded? What is your sense of how events have kind of turned things for Netanyahu, even of course, as we have the administration, the Biden White House basically saying they want to make moves against a West Bank unit, that military unit accused of human rights abuses. That is a significant thing that they are, you know, basically going against the Israelis in that way. That's not something we've seen either.",

Although related in that big bill that the House passed over the weekend, foreign aid bill, they also sent a TikTok ban to the Senate, it's a little bit modified from the one that they had done before. It gives him a little bit more time. What did you make of that?And I know -- you know, we've talked a lot about this here, and I know you are on the -- I'm actually not active on TikTok, but you are. I would highly recommend to everyone that they follow you if you're -- if they're on the platform, because I certainly have learned from you in terms of how you use it. But I think it really does kind of underscore the fear that a lot of lawmakers here in Washington have around China's control over the platform and the influence it has -- I mean, even how they've conducted their campaign against it, has reinforced everything that lawmakers have been saying, because they've been flooded with these calls, saying, hey, look, China wants to influence our political process. They're doing it right now.",

And it certainly bears -- you know, you could argue there's a possibility that there could be a lot of Chinese influence on the app, whether or not they're using that isn't quite clear.But it certainly does expose a lot of people to the potential of, you know, Chinese authorities having access to at least the data on the app. That's what all the question and concern is in Washington. Lot of legitimate concern as well, and big questions being asked. It has however taken hold in America in an extraordinary way. Lot of young people quite dependent on it, but also a lot of brands dependent on it. So, what I'm interested in seeing is if this gets through the Senate, you know, we know that Biden is going to sign it if it does get through the Senate. What happens after that? Because the idea that it would be closed down pretty quickly if China or if ByteDance doesn't sell it, you know, isn't necessarily the process that might play out, because there are so many vested interests in America in this app. You wonder if it will get caught up in all sorts of legal cases and they'll survive a while because of that. And you can't really imagine a situation where the Chinese government would actually allow it to be sold by ByteDance. So, maybe it's not a ByteDance decision in the end.",
