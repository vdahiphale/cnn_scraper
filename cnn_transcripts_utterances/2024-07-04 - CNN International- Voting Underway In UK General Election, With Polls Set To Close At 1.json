Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, surprise the country and much of his party by calling these snap elections months earlier than necessary. Voters have two hours left cast their ballots to decide their next leader. The prime minister voted earlier in his Yorkshire constituency in the north of England. Labour leader Keir Starmer cast his ballot in London. CNN's Nada Bashir is at a polling station in London for us. Nada, break down for us exactly how this election works. And crucially, when will we begin to find out the results?",

Now, of course, at those voting today, casting their ballots will be voting for their local member of parliament. And it's then, of course, the party's when we count this that it'll see whether or not they have secured that majority the figures.They're not voting directly for the prime minister, but rather for the parties here, a little different from the United States. But, of course, voting has been taking place all day. There are tens of thousands of polarization just like this one behind me up and down the country. Polls opened at 7:00 a.m. They are about to close and just under two hours and it's at that point that the vote counting begins. And it's a process that will continue through the night. Now, we will see early exit polls coming in overnight, giving us a steer or where exactly the country is heading, where perhaps those votes are leaning. But, of course, the actual results will not be announced until Friday morning. Many people will be staying up overnight. Many of my colleagues will certainly be staying up overnight to keep an eye on those votes coming in constituency by constituency until there is a clear majority announced. And, of course, this is a huge potentially game-changing election. We can't get into the policy details because there's reporting restrictions are still in place until polls close at 10:00 p.m. but there are huge amount of local, national, and international issues at stake here. And, of course, this is the first time that Brits have gone to the poll since 2019 when Boris Johnson was elected prime minister. We've seen numerous conservative party leader since then. We haven't seen a general election. So this is a significant moment, of course, for the British public to express their views to cast their ballot just under two hours left to go. And, of course, whoever does win this election is also an election year in the United States. There'll be crucial partners. This is certainly a significant, potentially game-changing moments for the United Kingdom -- Jim.",

That is not something that Democratic governors who went to the White House the waiting to hear from a president that he was up to the campaign ahead, were too pleased to hear.

It happened in his presidency with its legislative agenda. That's how he sees himself, and that's how he wants to see this moment. But Democratic operative saying to me things like they're trying to say that this is like every other moment they faced not realizing it's a totally different moment. We will see how this plays out, but there are, I would say, more people than you would guess from the public comments, who are ready to say that Joe Biden should go step aside, but also more people who are telling me that they are still ready to weather this out and see if they can do it, in part, that's because they are thinking about what kind of chaos would be set off were he to step aside and just have crazy that is.

Now, now look to answer your question about the language of the former president, Jim, you know, people talk like that. What he said about the vice president, there's a reason a lot of people don't want President Biden to step out because they're kind of worried that the vice president might not be able to take this thing across the finish line for Democrats.

He is at NATO foreign policy has always been his strong suit. He loves meeting with these foreign leaders and love having those when we get to host it here in Washington, D.C., which will be great. He'll do a press conference. So, this is where, you know, Joe Biden likes to govern. He is -- he -- that is where he spent most of his career is governing.

It's been interesting talking to the Trump's campaign for the last several days because over the weekend, they didn't really actually anticipate how real the possibility that Joe Biden could ultimately step aside, how real that concern was within the Democratic Party. When I talked to a number of Donald Trumps senior advisors, as well as people close to the former president, they really thought that this was going to blow over days after the debate. And Monday, I was getting calls from all different corners of Trump world of them panicking on their own about what do you think is going to happen? Is he going to drop out? Who would replace him?So they are very much watching all of this unfold with the rest of America. Now for, as, for preparations, they're biding their time right now. When I talk to them, they say, look, we actually want to see how this shakes out before we begin, you know, launching attacks on a number of different candidates, we want to see what happens with Joe Biden. But it's interesting because if you'll remember, Jim, months ago, Donald Trump was saying that he didn't think Joe Biden would make it to the Democratic National Convention in August, that he was ultimately going to be forced out by his own party. Now that it's becoming a much more real possibility. Many people within Trump's campaign actually think Joe Biden would continue to be the best candidate for them to be in part of that is because they have spent a series of months over a year building out their entire general election campaign infrastructure, massive data operation, ad spending, all of that focus singularly ongoing after Joe Biden. And so, they recognize some of the issues they're going to face if it is ultimately another candidate. Now, I did talk with one Trump senior adviser who said that the RNC has had books. They described them as books of opposition research. They called it rolling books that they've been gathering opposition on a number of top Democrats, including people like a governor, Gretchen Whitmer, Governor Gavin Newsom. A series of top people, Senator Mark Kelly is another one. They brought up that they think who are always running for something as one of them put it, that they continue to have this book of research on all of these people. However, again, they still do believe that perhaps Joe Biden is going to be the candidate that would be easier for Trump to beat. So that's really where a lot of this comes down to. I will also say that on the other hand, there are also people in Trumps circle who continue to try to defend the former president and say, look, this election is going to be one on the issues. The same core issues that they are running on now, which are immigration crime, and the economy where Trump polls better than Joe Biden. They believed that he will continue to dominate those issues as they look ahead to November, regardless of who is at the top of the Democratic ticket. But I really can't stress enough how much uncertainty there is within Trump world. They really do not know what is going to happen and what it means for their campaign -- Jim.",

What they say in some of their research is that you want to see if people around you, if they start to comment or joke about threats of violence, maybe they're having a tough time coping with stress. Maybe they were once outgoing and involved in activities. And now they've receded into isolation. Those are all things that we should be looking out for.

Have a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DR. KARIE GIBSON, FBI BEHAVIORAL ANALYSIS UNIT CHIEF:  You have somebody who at one time in their life was functioning in a way where they were handling the stress.
