And this is a special edition of\"Connect the World\" where we will also keep you updated on the temporary truce between Israel and Hamas, the latest on the release of any further Israeli hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners. Stay with us here on CNN. We kick this hour off though with climate records which continue to fall like dominoes. The COP28 Climate Summit is wasting no time taking action. About an hour ago, it formally adopted a climate damage fund to help nations hit the hardest by the crisis. It's also worth noting that one of the trickiest issues for this gathering is the language around fossil fuel use, a primary driver of the climate crisis. Have a listen to what the summit's President said earlier today when he opened the event. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SULTAN AHMED AL JABER, PRESIDENT, COP28: We must look for ways and ensure the inclusion of the role of fossil fuels. I know there are strong views about the idea of including language on fossil fuels and renewables in the negotiated text. We collectively have the power to do something unprecedented. In fact, we have no choice but to go the very unconventional way. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Now this sounds like jargon, but it'scrucially important because for years, there was debate between developing nations and wealthy nations. How are those who were historically responsible for causing the climate crisis going to fund those nations that are impacted by floods, by droughts, by hurricanes, by typhoons that are caused by the climate crisis, and they can't afford to pay. So this is a big moment. It is a good moment for this meeting, right on the first day of two weeks of meetings. The details will be important. Already the UAE and Germany pledged $100 million to fund this. The U.S. just over $17 million, which will raise a few eyebrows, but more money could come in. It will be temporarily run by the World Bank, something that is uncomfortable to some smaller nations. But it is a very important step. But that's loss and damage.

Chief has said that Pakistan is responsible for less than 1 percent of greenhouse gas emissions, but its people are 15 times more likely to die from climate related disasters and people elsewhere. That was brought to light in 2022 when one third of the country was submerged as deadly floods spread across the South Asian nation. Now of course, we are against the backdrop of a vital climate conference this week. And at COP27 the last edition, Pakistan joined other developing nations and played a key role in advocating for this global loss and damage fund that we have been talking about to help countries recover from climate induced disasters. And as we've been reporting in the last few hours delegates here in Dubai at COP28 has formally adopted that fund. This morning before that announcement was made, I sat down with Pakistan's Interim Prime Minister in Dubai to discuss how last year's flooding exposed Pakistan's vulnerabilities, have a listen. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ANWAAR-UL-HAQ KAKAR, PAKISTANI PRIME MINISTER: The reality check was there and we knew at that moment that climate change is no more at fashionable conversation point. It has haters at home, and it had haters at heart. At the same time, we did realize that we are not the one who is primarily responsible for contributing and bringing this climate disaster, in which two of our promises have sent them, but were just not particularly above stocking.

But as has been the case so often over the course of the past seven days, that process we expect to play out over the course of the next several hours.

And then following that of course, is the release of 30 Palestinian women and children held in Israeli prisons only then will we get any sort of acknowledgement if we get acknowledgement from the Israeli government that there might be an extension of that. The Qataris have tended to announce it a little bit earlier than that. But that, of course, is the key question especially with Secretary of State Antony Blinken here. At some point this runs into the question of cold hard math. Are there enough Israeli women and children held in Gaza still to continue this for another 24 hours? The Israeli government has suggested they believe there are enough, and then it's a function of the diplomacy. Is there the diplomatic push to make this happen?

Now, it's always, it's important to keep in mind that although we're so focused on Gaza that the West Bank, East Jerusalem continued to be occupied and continued to be a source of potential extra layers of complications and violence as the fighting is paused in Gaza. But most people believe it will soon resume. And in addition to that one as you said one Palestinian 21-year-old man was killed by Israeli forces in the town of Beitunia. That was in the early hours of this morning, leading up to the release of yet again another group of Palestinian prisoners and detainees. The Israeli forces went inside the town of Beitunia.

Now in areas like the West Bank, like Beitunia those are in theory what's known as Area A, which is supposed to be under the security and administrative control of the Palestinian Authority. But these categories Area A, B and C really don't have much meaning because we see that on a daily almost hourly basis.

It goes to the Nitsana crossing where the Israelis verify what's in each of these trucks. And then it's only then that they can go back to the Rafah crossing into Gaza, get unloaded their goods, and then those get reloaded back onto trucks to transport them across the Gaza Strip. We met a driver here, Becky, who has been waiting for 10 days to make that journey because it's a bit of a holdup there. We understand probably several 100 trucks waiting to that process in Nitsana for that Israeli verification process before they can make their way into the Gaza Strip. And that is slowing down things considerably. We've also been to the Al- Arish airport here in North Sinai in Egypt, where more trucks more flights are coming in. While we were at the airport, the military air airport, which has become the logistics hub for this operation to get aid into Gaza.

Well, COP28 attendees know full well that the world remains heavily reliant on fossil fuels, even with the ongoing clean energy transition and that transition is very real. But this means oil producers will continue to hold great influence over energy prices and the health of the global economy at least for years to come. Well today, OPEC Plus officials are holding virtual meetings to discuss whether to extend recent production cuts. Now this group includes many of the world's largest oil producers and exporters. Oil prices are on the rise perhaps in anticipation of further limits to production. Anna Stewart joins me now from London. There's always a reason why the price is going up, whether or not we see cuts, but this is one of the reasons likely. Look, it's really sort of -- it's an interesting backdrop to this virtual meeting today that I'm here at this COP28 meeting where we're talking about introducing language on phasing down or even phasing out fossil fuels very unlikely on the phasing outside.

      "sentences": "Normally in the way we mentioned tires like black gold. It's a very integral part of the transport sector. Normallywhat happens with the tires, the majority people will make it a scrap or they will send it to landfill? We educate people to how to take these tires to give them a second and third life. We will take these tires from the end users, we will take it to our factory to the repainting facility, where we reproduce these tires to an exactly replica of a new tire, which will give up to 60 to 80 percent of the life of the same new tire. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (voice-over): Trucks that used to be loaded up to 85 and 90 tons could not use retreaded tires due to safety concerns. With the 65 ton legal limit in place now, more truck owners will be able to use retreaded tires. With the expected increase in tire retreading, as a result of the new law, the transport sector can divert nearly 28,000 tons of tire waste away from the landfill over the next 12 months. Legislation is a crucial first step towards environmental sustainability in any sector. And it doesn't always need to reinvent the wheel to make an impact. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
