Israel's military withdrew from Al-Shifa Hospital after two weeks of fighting. The damage, the complex and the people sheltering is substantial. Also, a blow for Turkish President Erdogan as the opposition party sweeps local elections. We will be live in Istanbul. And Donald Trump marks the Easter holiday by lashing out at his political opponents. We will tell you what he had to say. Gaza's Civil Defense says Al-Shifa can no longer be called a hospital after Israel's 14-day siege. Hundreds of residents rushed to the scene of what was once the enclave's largest hospital, after Israeli forces withdrew. A spokesman for Gaza's Civil Defense says at least 300 bodies have been found on the hospital ground so far. CNN is unable to independently verify that figure. Video from the scene shows utter destruction. One journalist working for CNN says the scene resembles a horror movie. For its part, Israel says it completed quote, \"precise operational activity in the area and killed more than 200 militants.\" CNN's Nada Bashir joining us now live from London. Nada, tell us more about this 14-day operation at Gaza's largest hospital. I mean, eyewitnesses are talking about complete destruction of the complex and that is what we're also seeing in these videos.",

      "sentences": "Absolutely. Over the course of the last few weeks, we have been hearing troubling testimonies from Palestinians trapped in and around the Al-Shifa Medical Complex as well as those living in the area, where over the course of the last two weeks we have seen the constant shelling as well as that ground siege by the Israeli troops surrounding the hospital complex, and of course, airstrikes in the area as well.And as you mentioned, Amara, according to authorities, some 300 people are believed to be -- have been killed over the course of the last 14 days. That figure could potentially rise. We are only just really getting footage in from the scene around the Al-Shifa Medical Complex following the withdrawal of Israeli troops. And it has to be said, some of the footage that we are getting, it's simply too graphic to show, corpses strewn around the complex, some buried beneath the rubble. And of course, we have heard from the Civil Defense in Gaza saying that many of the buildings around the complex have been completely destroyed or burnt down, some of those buildings still on fire in the early hours of this morning. As you mentioned, Amara, the Israeli military says that this was a precise and targeted military operation that they were focusing on Hamas militants and that they discovered a number of weapons as well as intelligence documents at the complex. They accused Hamas of using Al-Shifa as what they've described as a terrorist base. But, at this stage, the only evidence that really has been provided by the Israeli military is those weapons that were discovered as well as what they claimed to be intelligence documents. Of course, CNN does not have independent access and cannot independently verify these claims. But, what we do know is that for the last two weeks, there have been hundreds of civilians and medical staff trapped within and around the medical complex. We've been hearing from doctors over the last few weeks, telling CNN that they've been struggling to move in and around the medical complex's buildings for fear of being targeted by snipers. And of course, those civilians who have been able to escape and evacuate and who have moved southwards, as per the orders of the IDF, have also shared quite troubling testimonies. We heard from some who had moved southwards after being able to flee the hospital, they said that they had been interrogated, some, including teenagers who say that they had been stripped and forced to undress by the Israeli military. Again, the Israeli military says that this was targeted at Hamas fighters, that they killed more than 200 Hamas militants. And also, of course, the Israeli military says that it has worked to ensure the protection of civilians and medical staff. But, that really does stand in contrast to the testimonies that we've been hearing from Palestinians on the ground.",

      "sentences": "Yeah. I mean, this is a huge turning point for the opposition. This is the first time that the CHP has won the popular vote in Turkey since the late 1970s. And so, now, the majority of the Turkish population lives in a CHP or soon to be CHP-controlled municipality. And again, they also managed to win in some very unexpected places. And I'll give you one example in particular, Adiyaman in the southern part of Turkey. It is well known as a religious, notably conservative place. The CHP didn't even bother to run a candidate in the last election. This time around, they managed to take it from the AK Party.Of course, Ekrem Imamoglu, the re-elected mayor of Istanbul, is widely considered to be one of the very few opposition figures with the strength to potentially take on Erdogan or his party in the next election race. And now, his hand is undoubtedly strengthened, but so are others now. There is also talk about the mayor of Ankara, who just won reelection, almost doubling the vote tally of the AK Party. It's not clear what were his -- if he is ambitious enough to run for the presidency. But, there is at least talk of a few strong candidates. And this is a noted difference from the kind of discord and disorganization that we've seen of the CHP in recent years. Obviously, the results could provide a check on the central government, and they could also send a very strong message to Erdogan's party that he will need to work with the opposition to get things done. Erdogan made some not so subtle comments over the last few months, suggesting that in the aftermath of the earthquake in the southern part of the country and in preparations for the next coming earthquake here in Istanbul, that he would prefer or that districts would get more money and more help if the local governments were the same as the ruling national governments. Clearly, that did not go over very well. And clearly, voters have sent a strong message, Amara.",

      "sentences": "Well, the French have already put a couple of things on the table over the weekend in advance of the meeting. The Defense's Minister, the Armed Services Minister said that they will be sending hundreds, those were his words, hundreds of armored vehicles, not new ones, old ones, but serviceable, obviously, for the Ukrainian military, said because they're in desperate need of those around the frontlines to protect their troops as they move them around.They will also be sending a new missile system, the Aster 30. Now, this has a payload of about 450 kilograms of explosives. So, that will pack a pretty powerful punch. And it's exactly that sort of longer- range weapon that Ukraine has been looking for to improve its air defenses, which it continues to say it needs. But, we heard from President Zelenskyy over the weekend saying, look, absent a real uptick in the funding that we're getting and the weapons coming through, and this is a point for the United States very clearly, we'll have to start tactically withdrawing from some frontline positions. They're running out of ammunition. They don't have enough to match what the Russians are firing at them every day, and that's leading to an imbalance on the frontline. So, they need to adjust accordingly. So, I think from a French perspective, they're talking about what they're going to be doing, $3.8 billion closer -- just over $3 billion worth of military aid going to Ukraine, a substantial amount. But, of course, the French would be looking to the United States to come up with that long term tens of billions of dollars funding that's been stuck until now.",

COHEN: Well, it's not completely clear, but they have had people in the water who, broadly speaking, are doing that work. But, at this point, they are focused on getting enough of the debris out so that they can do those searches. In short, they're trying to get a lot of the wreckage out so that eventually crews can go down and continue that recovery effort. But, it's going to take clearing a lot of that debris because we're talking about depth, water depth, that's close to 50 feet. It is dark. It is murky down there. And so, we hit a point during the recovery effort in those first few days where essentially official said divers can't safely do their work in that dark water with all of that debris.

In a lengthy post on his social media platform, Trump attacked the numerous prosecutors and judges involved in the cases against him. He used words like evil, sick, corrupt and deranged. Trump's recent posts come close to violating the gag order imposed on him by Judge Juan Merchan in the New York hush money case. He did conclude the post by wishing a Happy Easter to everyone. But, it was clear that Easter blessings were far from his main message that day. And there are growing concerns that Trump's rhetoric is creating a dangerous situation for public servants involved in the U.S. legal system.Let's bring in CNN National Security Reporter Zach Cohen with more on that. Hi there, Zach.

COHEN: It absolutely could. And look, prosecutors are seeking clarity from Judge Merchan on that exact point. They want to know where the bounds of this gag order is, partial gag order, do lie. And ultimately, the judge is in a difficult situation here. I think it's safe to say, as we've seen other judges grapple with similar scenarios with Donald Trump, that Judge Merchan doesn't have any interest in trying to put -- or putting Trump in jail if Trump does violate the terms of a gag order in the future. It's an open question, how much does Donald Trump care about a potential fine? So, really, how do you enforce a gag order if you put one in place, and if you do put the bounds of that gag order? You extend the bounds of that gag order to include things like your family. But, at the same time, Trump is out there saying things about somebody who has nothing to do with the case, in the case of Judge Merchan's daughter. So, it's really a difficult situation for the judge, and it'll be interesting to see how he responds to prosecutors who are seeking clarity on that exact point.",

Much of it is a centering around the minority vote. For decades, Democrats have been able to count on strong support among black voters. But, polls suggest that Trump is getting significant support in black and Latino communities. And of course, Democrats are also worried about a recent trend of declining turnout among voters of color. CNN's Edward-Isaac Dovere has been taking a look at the Biden campaign's efforts to get out the vote in the black community. He is joining us now live from Washington. I mean, this has to be a major concern when it comes to black voter turnout for President Biden. EDWARD-ISAAC DOVERE, CNN SENIOR REPORTER: It is. And the concern here is not, as you point out, whether they're going to see a huge move of black voters toward Donald Trump, but really just whether they can get to some point where they can change the decline over the last decade in black voters turning out at all. That is important. It's votes that they need to be able to win in places like Milwaukee, Atlanta, Charlotte, Detroit, Pennsylvania, has Philadelphia and Pittsburgh in it. All of those cities are in swing states, in battleground states that Biden needs to win. And to do that, likely, it's going to take changing this situation that has existed for years among black voters, and that means really revamping the entire outreach that's going on for black voters across the country. I was in Milwaukee reporting the story, and one of the things that I heard is that they, in reaching out in all these new ways, they're trying to get to black voters. Over half of the people that they've contacted were not even contacted by any campaign in 2022 or 2020. That is a huge deficit that the Biden campaign needs to make up now.",

The former attorney is already serving two life sentences for the murders of his wife and son. Murdaugh pleaded guilty last September to 22 federal charges that include conspiracy fraud, and money laundering. But, what should have been a straightforward hearing became complicated after prosecutors say Murdaugh failed a polygraph test. CNN's Diane Gallagher joining us now from Charleston, South Carolina. There is always a new twist in this case. What's the latest? DIANNE GALLAGHER, CNN U.S. NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: It's never straightforward when it comes to Alex Murdaugh. Amara, this should be the final sentencing when it comes to the major charges with which he is charged. But, there is this additional layer here. When he signed the agreement with federal prosecutors back in September, it all hinged on his ability to be honest and forthright. And now, prosecutors say he failed that polygraph test and he has voided the agreement. Now, Alex Murdaugh's attorneys say that, look, there was some odd behavior from the polygraph or talking about previous notorious case that he had done and confusing language, and they are saying they haven't seen the exam yet. They're asking the judge to either deny or delay the prosecutor's motion to hold him in breach of this agreement.

Russia is calling up 150,000 civilians for military service. It's an increase of 20,000 people compared to the last decree in September, and it also follows new rules that already raised the upper age limit of conscription from 27 to 30-years-old. Let's get a frontline perspective now on how this will impact the worn out -- what it all means. Michael Bociurkiw is a Senior Fellow at the Atlantic Council, and a former spokesperson for the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe. He is actually joining us now from a key Ukrainian port of Odessa. Michael, it's great to see you. First off, I just want to get your reaction to this conscription announcement. It is a routine announcement. But, what's different this time is the fact that the maximum age has gone up to 30 from 27. Correct?",

And everything that's happening with this conscription drama is pointing to signs of a very, very desperate Vladimir Putin, and 20 -- when the war started in 2022, the conscription target was 134,000. Now, as you pointed out, it is 150,000, and they had lowered the age.The other thing they've done is they've also made it easier for authorities to get a hold of people to either draft them or send them conscription notices. And also, the penalties for avoiding the draft are very, very severe, everything from taking away your driver's license to freezing you out of bank loans, to preventing you from leaving the country. Now, parents of those who are conscripted are very, very worried because there are credible reports that a lot of these young men have actually been sent to the frontlines to Ukraine, even though they're not supposed to dig trenches, foxholes. There are even reportedly conscripted men on that ship, the Moskva, that Ukraine blasted away early in the war. So, there you have it.",

I think there are two factors at play here, Amara. One is that terrorist attack in Moscow. I think Vladimir Putin is using it to not only clamp down on a descent, but also to get more mobilization for the war. The big fear here is that their next target will be the second biggest city in Ukraine, Kharkiv, possible encirclement of that big city, in addition to all the bombings that has been happening, and they'll try to take that.

They're getting worn down. They're not getting enough sleep. People are working from their homes to avoid the alarms. They run for those shelters.
