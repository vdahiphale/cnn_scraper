Nice to see you this morning, Steve. The recovery from Hurricane Ian has taken a lot of the focus off of this race. Crist has an uphill climb here to close the gap. What is his strategy?

I think tonight we're going to see him really step on a debate stage for the first time in four years and give voters in Florida, but also political consultants and maybe future primary voters a chance to see him go head-to-head with a Democrat and build his case for what might be a presidential campaign as soon as 2023.",

A surge of respiratory illness has overwhelmed pediatric hospitals. According to the CDC, there were 7,334 cases of RSV detected by PCR tests in the U.S. in the week ended October 15. That's higher than any week in the past two years. Health officials say the symptoms of RSV typically appear four to six days after an infection and they include runny nose, decrease in appetite, coughing, sneezing, fever, and wheezing. With RSV cases spiking, the former FDA commissioner is warning parents not to let their guard down. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB, FORMER FDA COMMISSIONER:  For parents who have children who have an upper respiratory infection, many times they are testing them and finding out it's not COVID and feeling relieved. I think they still need to be vigilant that it could be RSV, it could be early flu. So if you see progressive symptoms, seek out help from a doctor. There are treatments that are available that could help children with RSV. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Miguel Cardona vows to keep moving full speed ahead to implement President Biden's student debt relief program. That's even though a federal appeals court put a temporary hold on it last week preventing the administration from canceling any loans. CNN's Joe Johns has the latest. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JOE JOHNS, CNN SENIOR WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT (on camera): Christine, the 8th Circuit Court of Appeals telling the Biden administration to hold off and not start canceling loans under its debt forgiveness program until the court can take a look at it. One of the questions that has been raised is whether the Biden administration needs the approval of Congress before the president can start canceling these loans. The administration says the White House already got the approval of Congress way back in 2003. Another question is whether the six states that sued can show a concrete injury to the court. The Biden administration, for its part, has said it's full speed ahead. It's going to continue taking applications for these loans as well as reviewing applications for the loans even though it can't start canceling debt. Over the weekend, the Secretary of Education writing in an op-ed, \"Amid some Republicans trying every which way to block the Biden administration's debt relief program, the department is moving full speed ahead with preparations for the lawful implementation of our program so we can deliver relief to borrowers who need it the most.\" The administration has a deadline of Monday to submit a response to the lawsuit. On Tuesday, the six states that sued will deliver their reply. Joe Johns, CNN, Rehoboth Beach, Delaware. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Protests have entered their sixth week as students defy authorities to take to the streets in university campuses around the country to voice their opposition against the Iranian government.The nationwide protests were sparked by the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini back in September after being arrested by the morality police for wearing an improper hijab. And those protests have now spread to workers and labor unions calling for strikes. It comes following a show of support over the weekend by the Iranian diaspora in solidarity of what is happening in Iran. The largest protest was staged in Berlin. Eighty thousand people turned out there in a sea of red, white, and green calling for an end to the Iranian regime. Meantime, as you say, the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran has confirmed that its email system was hacked. The government claims it was a foreign country. The anti-government hacker group Black Reward, which has been encouraging people to take the streets in protest, says it's behind the breach. It published 100,000 email messages and plans of the Bushehr nuclear power plant. It also claimed responsibility for the hacking of Iranian state T.V. last week. The hackers have issued an ultimatum to the government to release the detained protesters or it will publish more sensitive and embarrassing documents -- Christine.",

London has also opened slightly lower, but Paris and Frankfurt are up. On Wall Street, stock index futures are leaning down just a little bit. All three major indices surged Friday, marking Wall Street's best week since June. The hope, after one more big rate hike, the pace of tightening may slow starting in December. The Dow is now up three weeks in a row, the longest weekly winning streak of the year. A critical week ahead for investors, homebuyers, and consumers. New readings on home sales and prices as mortgage rates approach seven percent. And the first official look Thursday at third-quarter gross domestic product. The U.S. economy shrank in the first and second quarters but is expected to have rebounded in the third quarter. We'll also hear from hundreds of American companies as they navigate high inflation and rising interest rates. An earnings trend is emerging here. CEOs see headwinds ahead but right now, profits are solid and consumers appear to be in good shape. From American Express, quote, \"We have not seen changes in the spending behaviors of our customers, but we are mindful of the mixed signals in the broader economy.\" And this from United Airlines. \"With hybrid work, every weekend could be a holiday weekend. That's why September, a normally off-peak month, was the third strongest month in our history.\" More airlines report earnings this week. For investors, it has been a tumultuous October. The Standard and Poor's 500 is down 22 percent this year, on track for the worst year since the Great Recession. Of course, inflation is coursing through the economy with higher prices for all kinds of goods, forcing big food companies to raise their prices, too. I sat down with the CEO of Kraft Heinz, Miguel Patricio, to ask him how consumers are changing their habits to cope with these higher prices and how Kraft Heinz is coping with new supply chain problems.

Police actually greased the street lamps to try to prevent the fans from climbing them, but no grease is stopping an excited Phillies fan, as you can see.Meanwhile, the Astros now heading into their fourth World Series in the past six years as they completed that sweep of the Yankees. Rookie shortstop Jeremy Pena once again coming through. He hit a huge 3-run blast in the fourth to tie the game. He was named the ALCS MVP. In the seventh inning, it was a tie game when Alex Bregman comes to the plate. He hits this single into right. Pena would score to put the Stros up 6-5. That would be your final. The Yankees crowd that was chanting \"We want Houston\" less than a week ago is left just stunned. Now they wonder if Aaron Judge has played his last game in pinstripes. He is a free agent. All right. In the NFL, Dolphins quarterback Tua Tagovailoa returning to the field after missing two games while recovering from a concussion. And Tua wasn't holding back at all in this one. First quarter, scrambles instead of sliding and lowers the shoulder into the defender. Coach Mike McDaniel said he had talked with Tua about not putting himself in bad situations and Tua actually apologized for running that one. No one scored in this game in the second half -- you can see Tua's family watching on there -- but the Dolphins would get the win 16-10. All right, the nightmare season for Tom Brady, meanwhile, just continuing yesterday in Charlotte. The Panthers -- they fired their coach and traded their star running back Christian McCaffrey over the past two weeks, but still able to just dominate the Bucs 21-3. Tampa Bay is now 3-4 on the season, marking the first time since 2002 that Brady is below 500 after seven weeks in a season. Brady, just eight touchdowns in seven games into this season as well. Nothing going right for them in Tampa. All right -- and finally, check out this viral video of Freddie the Falcon going full dirty bird in a game against a youth football team. After giving up the long play, the mascot delivered that big hit, knocking the kid out of bounds. And then they kind of got into it after he taunted him a little bit -- a little shoving match right there. The rest of the team getting involved. And, Christine, we saw blooper of the Braves with a big hit a month ago. I don't know what's up with these mascots. They -- they're just after these kids.",
