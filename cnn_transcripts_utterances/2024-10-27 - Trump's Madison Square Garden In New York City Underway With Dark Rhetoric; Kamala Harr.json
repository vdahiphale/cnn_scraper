At one point someone referred to Puerto Rico as a floating island of garbage. Someone else referred to illegal immigrants as effing illegals. The other one people called Kamala Harris the devil. Someone else called them the anti-Christ.And we're hearing a lot of language here tonight. It's clear they're treating this experience, they're treating this rally really as like an RNC part two. This is the second time he has had this kind of speaker line-up. We just saw Hulk Hogan speak. We've seen a number of I would say, quote-unquote, \"celebrities.\" I'm using that term a little bit loosely here. But people who are taking the stage for Donald Trump, they are ramping up the crowd. And Jessica, there are thousands of people here. I'm not sure there's a single empty seat right now in Madison Square Garden. It is packed. And this is not just New Yorkers but also people from across the country. I've seen a number of former administration officials, former aides. It's kind of a homecoming for the former president, something that he'd been wanting to do for quite some time. They just never thought it was actually going to line up given the scheduling and the fact that New York is such a Democratic-leaning place. Even after they signed the deal to do Madison Square Garden, they were wary of publicizing this event because they were afraid that if it was too close or too far from the actual event that somebody might step in and try and get Madison Square Garden or try to get Democratic politicians to come in and step in and reverse the decision to actually do this event. But it is very important to Donald Trump and we'll see what his closing messages when he takes the stage just days before or roughly a week before people head to the polls on election day.",

      "sentences": "Well, a couple of things. When we talk about New York, in particular, we know that this is just important to Donald Trump because it is Madison Square Garden, because it is a homecoming for him, but there are also Republican operatives here in the state who hope that this helps with some of these vulnerable New York House seats. Actually Donald Trump held a call with these New York House lawmakers who are up for reelection and who were in this kind of tenuous positions, trying to get people to get out and vote.Donald Trump privately has said he thinks he can win New York, but if you talk to any Republican operative or even his senior advisers, they don't believe that's true, but as a whole, we're seeing a lot of different strategies when it comes to him going to these blue states. One, he is trying to drive up the popular vote. He is trying to chip away the margin there, but two, his campaign says that this really is a national media campaign, that at the end of the day doesn't necessarily matter where he is. He's in a swing state at a rally or if he's at Madison Square Garden, particularly given the fact that, one, New York City is the biggest media market. But two, they believe an event like this with these thousands of people where he fills an arena is going to get the same level of national attention, if not more national attention, than a rally in a swing state. So that's part of their strategy here moving forward. One of the things to keep in mind here, this is a strategy that hasn't really been relied on. But we're really not going to know if it's working or not until after the election.",

He is not somebody you want to be standing next to in a close election and all of these are really closely contested.If this is a wave year for Democrats, if Kamala Harris pulls out lots and lots of people in the early vote totals that we've seen just in our first day suggest that that might be the case, it's going to swap these Republicans.

There's a lot of sexism out there. There are a lot of ideas that are buried somewhat deeply for a lot of men where they'll look at a Kamala Harris as they looked at a Hillary Clinton, and they'll say there's something about her. She doesn't look like a leader. I don't like her laugh. She doesn't seem strong enough. You know, that kind of a thing isreally buried kind of deeply and they're bringing that out. They're sort of addressing it somewhat directly in this final week and a half of the campaign. It's a very touchy subject. It's kind of hard to get to. It doesn't lend itself to easy talking points. But Michelle Obama I think said something that needed to be said, which is like, look, this is not necessarily going to be like every election you've seen before, and you've got to examine your own attitudes about women in leadership if you want to really have a kind a clear vision of what this election is about.",

One in a series of terror attacks we've seen in recent weeks here in Israel. There was also a stabbing attack targeting soldiers today. In addition to that, the IDF announced today the deaths of six Israeli soldiers, one of them from ongoing fighting in Gaza, five others from fighting in southern Lebanon. Two other fronts, of course, of this war. And then sources tell me today that as part of Israel's strike on Iran overnight on Friday and into early Saturday morning, a strike that involved some 100 Israeli warplanes, that some of those warplanes breached Iranian airspace during that attack. Not all of those warplanes, but some of them. And that shows a significant Israeli capability to strike far away at Iran, hundreds of miles away, an operation that requires refueling in the air for many of these fighters, but also in the course of it to take out Iranian air defenses and in this case, breach Iranian airspace. So you have all those fronts in Lebanon, in Gaza, between directly Israel and Iran, and of course, a front you might call it here inside Israel, ongoing terror attacks in this country and in each case, them getting more dangerous, not less so.
