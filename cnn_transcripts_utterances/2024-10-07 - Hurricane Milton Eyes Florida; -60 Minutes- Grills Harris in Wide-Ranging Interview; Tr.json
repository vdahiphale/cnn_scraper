A very dangerous storm.But hurricane hunters, both NOAA and also Air Force, have flown into the eye over the past couple of hours and found that we've lost a little bit of intensity. That is great news because just in 36 hours, from yesterday morning to this afternoon, we went from 50 to 180. Okay, so now, we're 165. Close enough. Here's the hurricane warnings are in effect for almost the entire central part of Florida because the winds will be all the way to the East Coast at hurricane force. There will be millions of people without power. And we know where a lot of these power company trucks, these mutual aid trucks are. They're in the Carolinas trying to put the power back up here. But look at the purple. This is major category winds all the way from Cedar Key all the way down to Fort Myers. That's 110 plus. And then, yes, hurricane force all the way to Cape, all the way to Cape Canaveral, all the way to the East Coast of Daytona Beach. We will have surge. This is the next thing. Are we going to have wind damage? Absolutely. Are we going to have surge potential? Without a doubt, because this is a Category 5. And even though the forecast is for it to go down a little bit, it will still carry a four to five surge with it, 10 to 15 feet of surge. How does that compare to Helene where things were wiped out around Tampa? Six to seven. Now, we're talking 10 to 15.

Thank you.(LAUGHTER) Laura, let me start with you here, though, because Harris, she has been under a lot of pressure to have a number of interviews. She was criticized very early on about being not only absent from the visible part of the Biden administration as much as she could have been, and also now about top of the ticket. Do you think that the \"60 Minutes interview, which is one of the toughest she's had to date, is that going to quiet her critics? LAURA BARRON-LOPEZ, CNN POLITICAL ANALYST, WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT FOR PBS NEWSHOUR:  For critics in D.C. and in the Beltway, maybe not. But I think that there are voters that that answer really stood out to me in terms of that answer's ability to speak to them, where she was talking about, I want to be someone who builds consensus. And I say that because I was just in Arizona. I talked to a two-time Trump voter there and a number of others who had voted for Trump in the past. But this two-time Trump voter, moderate, lifelong Republican woman who considers herself in alignment with Harris on abortion isn't necessarily convinced she's going to vote for her yet because she wanted to hear more from Harris about what exactly she would do to find compromise on a host of issues, how exactly she would work with Republicans, whether it's on immigration, whether it's on the economy. And so, Harris kind of sounded like that voter in that answer. So, I wonder if that voter is listening to the \"60 Minutes\" interview and seeing someone in Harris, who may be willing to compromise with the party that this voter has been a part of their entire life.",
