But NATO's top military chief downplays the quote, \"rubble(ph)\" they've managed to take. That interview in just a moment. Also ahead, a CNN exclusive investigation we have learned that despite traveling on an Israeli-agreed route, Israeli forces fired on a United Nations convoy carrying vital food supplies in central Gaza. And then later, Republican lawmakers are facing questions as one of the key informants that they were relying on for allegations of the Biden bribery scheme was already charged with lying to the FBI, that also appears to be linked to Russian intelligence. Those details, that's coming up. But first tonight, we start with desperate days in Ukraine where Russian forces are looking to roll on after capturing the key city of Avdiivka. Kremlin forces are probing Ukrainian defenses across that long sprawling frontline hoping to capitalize on the foreign aid stalled by in-fighting in the United States. Now, Ukraine says it's holding the line in the south, but it's also facing severe troop shortages and has been doing for many months, pleading for ammunition. All this as Russia is gloating. The Defense Ministry says a top general has been in Ukraine awarding soldiers near the frontlines as you can see there. And the Defense Minister has boasted Russia is producing thousands of drones a day. For the very latest, CNN's Fred Pleitgen joins me now, he's recently left Ukraine, and he joins us now from Berlin. And Fred, following that win, of course, that we've been reporting -- you've been reporting on Avdiivka, the Russian forces do seem to be on the offensive, both are on the -- on several fronts, the east and the south. What could be the potential moves here? What concerns you?",

Right now, there's really two areas that the Ukrainians are very concerned about. And we did have a very good map that you were just showing there some of those really focal points that the Russians have been focusing on. One of them is actually up in the northeast of the country, and if we look at that map again, you can see a town there called Kreminna, which is a forested area, there's a pretty heavy fighting going on, and the Ukrainians say around that area and to the north of the area that the Russians have assembled a huge force to try and gain ground there. There's a river that they want to reach and also a border, and we can see that a little bit in white, that's a regional border. Other regions that the Russians say that they have annexed, called the Luhansk region which they now want to take the rest of. That's at least what the Ukrainians believe. And then if you look at a time that we've been speaking about so much over the past, really, one and a half years here on your show, the town of Bakhmut that the Russians really wanting to advance from there, moving on to a town called Chazifia(ph), which is a little bit west to that. I know from the Ukrainians on the ground there that they're also having a lot of trouble holding those Russian assaults back.

Instead of what the Russians are doing, the Ukrainians are looking at the lives of their soldiers. Even if that means to give in some territory at some point.

The U.S. Republicans impeachment inquiry into President Biden is potentially hanging on by a thread after one of their core allegations of a Biden bribery scheme appear to have been made up. The claims came from former FBI informant, Alexander Smirnov the GOP spent months touting his credibility. But Smirnov was just charged with lying to the FBI, and prosecutors say he admitted some of the supposed dirt he had on the Bidens came from Russian Intelligence officers. Meanwhile, U.S. House Republicans are trying to flip the script by blaming the FBI and asking why they relied on the informant in the first place.

There was the whole issue of the Russia investigation and the factthat it appears, according to assessments by U.S. intelligence agencies, that the Russians intervened in the 2016 election because they wanted Trump to get elected because they saw it in their interests. And Trump almost never argues with Putin, whether that's because he sees it in his interests. I think there's an extent to which he admires Putin. He sees him as a strong man. He's often said that he's a genius. And of course, when everybody is trying to tell the former president to do something, i.e. condemn Putin, he's not going to do it. I think there's also a synergy between Putinism, white nationalism, also represented by Victor Orban in Hungary, and the Make America Great Again movement.

And his first term, he often appeared to be doing things that were as much in Russia's foreign policy interest as America's, and I don't think that would change. And of course, it's in Russia's interest for Trump, for example, to take aim at the western alliance and to attack U.S. allies as he's also been doing recently.",

People like Former Congresswoman Liz Cheney or someone like Utah Senator and Former Republican Nominee Mitt Romney, who's retiring at the next election. Trump has so transformed and co-opted the Republican Party and is reflecting what people think in the grassroots of the party. For example, on the issue of no more aid to Ukraine, that anyone that wants a career in the GOP, at least for the foreseeable future is either going to have to get in line or accept that their criticism will drive them out of the Trump Republican Party because of the Make America Great Again movement. The question is, is there a majority of Americans that want to vote for that in November's election, and that's what we're going to find out.",

The White House says it's aware ofreports of her arrest and it's urging Americans to leave Russia immediately. Pictures have emerged of Karelina practicing ballet in what looks like New York, as you can see there. Her employer says she was visiting family in Russia when she was arrested. The employer says, she's accused of donating a little more than $50 to a Ukrainian charity in the U.S. In addition to Karelina, Americans, Evan Gershowitz, as you know as well, U.S. Marine veteran Paul Whelan, are also being held in Russia. Of course, we will stay across that story for you. Well, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken is in Brazil where he met with President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva ahead of G20 meetings. President Lula da Silva says they discussed the G20, energy transition, as well as peace efforts both in Ukraine and in Gaza/ The G20 foreign ministers are meeting in Rio de Janeiro. And among those who will be attending is Russian -- Russia's Foreign Minister Lavrov. Joining us now with more is Journalist Stefano Pozzebon. And Stefano, let's start then with what that meeting between, as you saw video of it, between President Lula and Secretary Blinken. I wonder what came out of it. I mean, I ask this because we -- Lula, I think it's fair to say, has been in the middle of a diplomatic spat over some comments he has made. The -- was this addressed? Was this discussed?",

We don't know in detail what Blinken and Lula discussed. Like you said, on the agenda, there was the G20, which is organized in Brazil later this year, transition corporation, but of course, it's likely that the most pressing issue was geopolitics. And the role that Lula insists on playing in trying to bring peace or bring about peace negotiations, both in Gaza and Israel. Over the weekend, he compared the attacks of the military action from Israel to the Holocaust. And of course, Blinken, we know from a State Department spokesperson, Blinken said that the U.S. do not share those remarks, that they took criticism of that, but at the same time that they hope to work together to find new solutions. And to bring Brazil and Lula himself to the table of other negotiations. Of course, these happens as the Russian foreign minister is also in town. Blinken and Lavrov took part in a photo together with all the other foreign ministers of the G20. So, there is a lot of going on and a lot of chess play behind the scenes between these three countries. Brazil on one side wants to play a mediating role between the United States one side and Russia on the other. It's interesting here because, of course, there is a lot of cooperation between all of these countries and Latin America --",

So, it's -- it goes straight to what happened, also over the weekend which is a different story from another Latin American country.Ecuador had to seemingly stop the envoy of weapons from Ecuador to Ukraine due to a trade barrier imposed by Russia on the Ecuadorian banana trade. It's a fascinating story. But the bigger picture means that most Latin American countries, both here where I am in Colombia, Brazil of course, Argentina, and Ecuador, and Peru, want to stay out of the conflict and try to do good business with both the West, the United States, and the European Union, and with both China and Russia. Brazil, for example, exports to all of these countries, both the U.S. and China are major international economic partners for Brazil. And of course, it's why this is -- this is why Latin America is trying to portray themselves as an equally distanced region that can perhaps help bring together. At least more on Ukraine, the Gaza and Israel situation is a little bit more problematic here. For example, Gustavo Petro of Colombia is a vocal supporter of the South African action at the ICJ against Israel. But at least on Ukraine, the entire region is trying to portray themselves as neutral and advocating for a peaceful solution. Isa.",
