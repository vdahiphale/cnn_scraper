Is he going to keep intact the Election Integrity Unit to ensure misinformation is not into the conversation during this upcoming election and after and all the way through to certification? Will he put in place a true content moderation council with actual authority to take down posts that are harmful to communities? And will he take serious the message that we're sending not only from the African American community, Jewish community, Latino and LGBTQ community?

If you talk about the former president, he has demonstrated that there's no justification to put him back on the platform because he has not changed his ways. He is still an election denier, although he knows he lost the election and will still use tribalism and other racial tropes to cause division in our society and he plays to the lowest common denominator.

They're using this military drill vigilant storm as an excuse to go down their list of weapons testing.Although Kim Jong-Un has felt emboldened this year, increasingly so, to go down that list anyway because diplomacy with the United States fell apart really beginning in Hanoi with the former U.S. President Donald Trump. And then you have now this authoritarian alliance with Russia and China and, to a lesser extent, North Korea all having each other's back regardless of what the West says, regardless of pressure from the United States. Xi and Putin are in no mood to work with the United States on punishing Pyongyang. And Kim Jong-Un knows that, which is why we've seen at least 30 missile launch events this year. And we're talking about events that includes a 24-hour period and number of missiles launched. So yesterday, with 26 launches, more than two dozen, that counted as one event. That was event number 29. Event number 30 today, the failed test of the intercontinental ballistic missile, the most powerful ballistic missile that North Korea has made that, theoretically, could hit almost anywhere in the world, including the U.S. It was supposed to go on a trajectory over Japan but failed midflight. It only traveled about a third of the altitude that the previous successful test of this ICBM back in March accomplished. And so, in Japan, just like in October, there were air raid siren. It was a national emergency alert. But then, all of a sudden, this ICBM disappeared, presumably having failed after the first stage of flight. And what Kim Jong-Un has also achieved here is to strengthen the American alliances in the region, analysts say, because now with a hawkish South Korean president, who does not, like his predecessor, believe in trying to do anything possible to make peace with the North, he wants to show force. The president there -- the statement about that, I'll read a part of it. It says, \"It was necessary to demonstrate a solid combined defense posture of the bilateral alliance under the current security crisis heightened by North Korea's provocation.\" So North Korea says it's the U.S., the U.S. and South Korea say it is North Korea that's escalating tensions in the region with no end in sight.",

A sobering finding from United Nations researchers based on satellite data.
