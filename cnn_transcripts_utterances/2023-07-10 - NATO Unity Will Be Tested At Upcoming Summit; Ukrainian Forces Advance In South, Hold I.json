One of President Biden's recent trip to the U.K. was also to Northern Ireland, where he met briefly we Rishi Sunak. Perhaps a follow up discussion on that, although Jake Sullivan, President Biden's National Security Adviser played down the likelihood on that, and frankly, there hasn't really been any political movement in Northern Ireland on that particular issue. Obviously talking about Vilnius, talking about Ukraine, talking about the type of path that Ukraine can have to becoming a full member of NATO, which is what it wants lately, conversation focusing on by lateral with a number of different nations committing concrete, financial and military goals and targets to continue to support Ukraine, but it's not expected to actually bring Ukraine into NATO on this trip, but that will likely be part of the conversation are talking about AI, they will talk about green technology.

So that tells us there's definitely slowing. But it's also really important to take a look at those levels of jobs, because a number of jobs are adding is still really quite remarkable given how many jobs we have and how fully we've recovered.

I traveled the country speaking with people who were taking care of family members with dementia. I also went internationally and tried to learn about different dementia care models. And you know, what I and my family experienced is what a lot of caregivers experience. You know, your family member, my father in my case, was a very mild-mannered man. He was a scientist, very bright, published in the top papers in the world. And when he developed dementia he turned into a different person. He was -- he became short-tempered. Obviously you know, he lost his memory. What I learned is that Alzheimer's very often starts in the part of the brain that doesn't code short-term memories. That is the reason why people start to forget things. But then it moves to an adjacent part of the brain that is responsible for emotional regulation. That's why people start to become short- tempered and emotionally volatile. And eventually it sort of spreads to other parts of the brain that control more basic functions.",

JAUHAR: I mean I think dementia has a lot of stigma associated with it. You know, after my father developed his initial symptoms we never even mentioned the word Alzheimer's. It was actually my mother who said it many, many months after my father started to behave in a very erratic way. You know, he would stop the car on the road from coming back from the shopping center and asked people for directions. Finally she sort of -- we were on a walk one day and she said, does your father have Alzheimer's? And I realized that, you know, we never mentioned the word because Alzheimer's has such a stigma associated with it. You know, it sort of connotes a sense of loss of independence, possible institutionalization. And so I think a lot of people just don't want to think about it. But the reality is, as you pointed out, that so many millions of people across the world have it. So many more millions will develop it because of aging. So this problem is coming for us, whether we are prepared or not.",

Alzheimer, the man -- Alois Alzheimer, the German psychiatrist who first identified the plaques that are now thought to be, you know, sort of characteristic of the disease. There were no treatments back when, you know, he identified the disease. For the intervening century or so we have essentially been stuck in a rut where there are no treatments available to improve, you know, really memory or you know, retard the progression of the disease. So I think it's something to be celebrated that there is a drug. And there are actually a couple or more in the pipeline that are coming that really going to be -- you know, provide some benefit. How much benefit really remains to be seen. The fact is that dementia and Alzheimer's as I wrote in my book remain really the only chronic medical scourge that has no treatment.

JAUHAR: You know, I was unprepared for what I and my family and my father was going to go through. I needed a book that was going to show me the way. That was going to sort of map out the path. There was no book available. There were some self-help books. But what I needed was a book that was both sort of a wrenching personal chronicle of what a family goes through but also a book about the science and history to sort of orient us and give us like I said sort of a blueprint for the disease so you know where things are headed. I, as a caregiver, was most frustrated when I didn't know what the heck was going on. Why was my father behaving this way? Why didn't he remember what he had for lunch? Why was he, you know, acting so emotionally unstable? Why was it happening at this particular time and didn't happen, you know, say several months earlier? What I would like people to learn from the book is what is Alzheimer's? How does it affect the family? And what can we do as caregivers to improve the lives of those we love, those we care for. They are still people, you know, even though so much of their person is defaced by the disease. So my hope is that the book will provide knowledge and clarity, and ultimately some comfort and solace to people who are going through this really just incredibly difficult journey.",
