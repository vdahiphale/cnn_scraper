They can pass the bill to cut IRS funding 10 times. It's going nowhere. So this is what they see is their deliverables and they want to have these hearings and -- this is -- they're going to be following through. I mean this is what they're chomping at the bit to do.",

Are they too far out ahead of the facts? Chairman Comer says he wants to know if the President's been compromised. He wants to know if Hunter Biden's international dealings and Frank Biden, the President's brother, also uses the family name. There's no question about that. There's just no question that they have traded on the Vice President's name or Senator Biden's name. He's now President of the United States. What's fair and what's out of bounds when it comes to oversight of the President's family and the finances?CARRIE CORDERO, CNN LEGAL &amp; NATIONAL SECURITY ANALYST: So a lot of this, when it pertains to his family, is clearly in the political realm and I think especially the fact that the prior Congress led by Democrats went after the former President's taxes in particular. So you have this financial piece that was looking at his family businesses and then there were other criminal investigations in other parts of the country, New York, et cetera, that were looking at his family business. So this family piece I do think has this incredible political lens on it. However, there are other aspects of the congressional investigations that are going to take place that I think have actual policy implications and deal with issues. So for example, the look at the tech companies and how the tech companies like Twitter engaged with the administration to potentially limit or the allegation is that they limited information coming out. That bigger issue of content moderation and how tech companies interact with law enforcement and intelligence community agencies, those are issues that there are members of Congress and there is more of a public appetite for understanding how that type of thing works.",

In the last two weeks, there have been five atmospheric events, and in the next 10 days, there is expected to be four more. There has been no relief for areas all across the state, not just in Northern California, but also Central and Southern. And so what's happening is that the soil is just drenched and there's no opportunity for it to dry in between these storms. And that's exactly what you're seeing here.This is just a small example of what's happening all over the state. We're standing in a roadway. Half of it is covered in mud and dirt. The hillside has completely washed away. You see, a tree has been uprooted all of these plants and the vegetation has fallen here. The soil has just turned into mud and these are creating very dangerous situations, 17 people have died due to storm related accidents. If you take a look over here right behind me, you can see right underneath the Golden Gate Bridge, massive waves and all of this crashing in here into the rock side and the hillside here. So we're seeing these conditions all over the state. It is very dangerous. Thousands of people are under flood watches and warnings. People are being asked to stay at home and including, not drive. It just takes six inches of rain for cars to be washed away. And so many rescues are happening because people are stranded as they're going about their day. And there's just a fire hose of rain that has swept all across the state. Now, on the flip side of this, the only good thing that is coming from this is because here in California, it has been years of historic drought. And so all of the reservoirs are filling up and the snow pack has reached historic levels, 30 percent of the snow pack is funneled into the water system here for California. So if there is anything good that comes from this, it is that there will be water for the state after years of historic drought, but, of course, creating very dangerous situations here because there has been no relief.
