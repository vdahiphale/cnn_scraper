We know that resignations have been rolling in from the President's senior staff, union workers as you just reported, they are protesting in downtown Seoul. And security has been tight around the parliamentary building calls, of course, growing for the President Yoon Suk Yeol to resign or to face impeachment.Now here is what went down. Late on Tuesday, 10:30 p.m. local time. That was when the South Korean president declared martial law in that surprise address and he accused the main opposition party of anti- state activities of sympathizing with North Korea. And I want to show you this video. In this CCTV footage, you see the South Korean army storming the parliament during the President's martial law attempt, and the backlash to this was swift. His move sparked demonstrations. It sparked and spurred thousands of people to turn out to protest outside the National Assembly lawmakers, they voted to block the martial law decree, and in the early hours of this day, you backtracked, he withdrew the order, along with the troops that he deployed to carry it out. Resignations have been submitted by the president's chief of staff and more than 100 senior secretaries. Lawmakers are calling for more. In a statement to reporters out on Wednesday, the leader of the ruling party apologized to the public and called for the defense minister to be fired. Let's bring up the statement for you. This is what we heard from Han Dong-hoon saying this \"The Minister of Defense who recommended this martial law should be immediately dismissed and others responsible must be held strictly accountable.\" Meanwhile, the main opposition party is calling for yin to resign or face impeachment. In a statement from a senior Democratic Party M.P. we heard this. \"Even if martial law is lifted, he cannot avoid treason charges. It was clearly revealed to the entire nation that President Yoon could no longer run the country normally. He should step down. Now, workers from the largest union in South Korea, they are protesting downtown Seoul. They say they will continue to do so until President Yoon steps down. This is South Korea's biggest political crisis in decades. It's a move that stunned allies and stunned observers all around the world and the fate of the South Korean president is unclear.

So, that is part of the critical nature of the relationship between the U.S. and the South Koreans there. The U.S. of course has been in touch with the South Korean government, and that includes military to military conversations here according to the Pentagon, although they haven't detailed the extent of those conversations. There were -- throughout the hours that this took place, there were no changes to U.S. military force posture there and no additional rules or curfews that were imposed on U.S. service members there, according to the Pentagon. But this is a situation they're obviously watching and continue to watch very closely. And that of course includes, because of North Korea, this is sort of a situation where you might expect to see Kim Jong-un trying to take advantage of this and carry out a ballistic missile launch, or a drone launch, or a military exercise that would sort of flex his muscle, especially because the South Korean president blamed what he called North Korean communists for the situation that led him to declare martial law. But at least as of now, the Pentagon says they haven't seen any indication of any major change from North Korea. But of course, given -- frankly, given how sensitive the entire region is and given Kim's history of sort of taking advantage of a situation and -- or a perceived insult and carrying out some sort of military test or exercise, this is something the Pentagon is still watching very closely.

But look, the President always gets the benefit of the doubt on his nominees. RAJU (voice-over):  But there's little margin for error, since just four GOP defections could derail the nomination, with all Democrats in the 53/47 GOP Senate likely to oppose him. SEN. RICHARD BLUMENTHAL, (D-CT):  This nomination is doomed. RAJU (voice-over):  Several GOP Senators are undecided, including Joni Ernst, a survivor of sexual assault, who has spoken out against such crimes in the military and told CNN today, she planned to have a \"frank and thorough conversation\" with Hegseth later this week. All of it key demands amid undecided Senators for more information about Hegseth's past. RAJU:  What is the level of concern about him right now? SEN. SUSAN COLLINS, (R-ME):  As I've repeatedly said to you, I believe that we need an FBI background check to evaluate the allegations. RAJU (voice-over):  Hegseth has faced a series of damaging stories, including about a 2017 incident when a woman alleged he sexually assaulted her in a California hotel room, but no charges were filed as Hegseth entered into a financial settlement with the accuser and later contended their interaction was consensual. PETE HEGSETH, PRESIDENT-ELECT DONALD TRUMP'S PICK FOR DEFENSE SECRETARY:  The matter was fully investigated, and I was completely cleared. RAJU (voice-over):  This week, \"The New Yorker\" reporting that Hegseth was forced out of running two veterans' groups over \"serious allegations of financial mismanagement, sexual impropriety, and personal misconduct,\" including allegedly being intoxicated on the job. A Hegseth adviser called them outlandish claims from a petty and jealous former associate.",

Roger Wicker, who's going to Chair the Senate Armed Services Committee next year, which will be in charge of considering Hegseth's nomination told me, \"I'm sure we'll see it.\" When I asked him if he wanted to see that whistleblower report, as many other Republican Senators and Democrats are curious about the contents underscoring the challenges that Hegseth has ahead.

So, he could stretch this out and therefore stretch the embarrassment out, or he could decide to do what Matt Gaetz did and just chalk it up to experience. He's not going to be confirmed. I think that's pretty obvious.But the substitute is going to be very interesting. Now, we already know that some of this transition was incredibly sloppy. They didn't do the kind of background research that you have to do in order to keep yourself from having these sorts of embarrassments. So this time around, they're likely to pick somebody who's been vetted in other ways. The strongest possible successor would be Joni Ernst, Senator from Iowa. She has a military background. She cares deeply about sexual harassment in the military. She's very well versed in most of the military issues. I think she would be a very solid Secretary of Defense. I'm not as sure about Ron DeSantis and Senator Hagerty. But I think either one of them would obviously be superior to Pete Hegseth. I can't imagine, after having run for Governor of Florida and Senator from Tennessee, that they would have the same kinds of vetting problems that Hegseth has.",
