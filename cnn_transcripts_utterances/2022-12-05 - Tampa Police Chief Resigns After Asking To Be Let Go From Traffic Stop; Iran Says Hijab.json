She resigned this morning and says that she was not trying to do any harm or abuse power. That's why she asked him if his camera was on. She knew she was being recorded. You know, the Tampa city however has a very different take. I want to read to you what the mayor said today.Saying: It is unacceptable for any public employee and especially the city's top law enforcement leader to ask for special treatment because of their position. Public trust in Tampa's police department is paramount to our success as a city as well as a community. You know, in her resignation letter as well as in some documents tied to an internal affairs investigation, she apologized, called it even poor judgment to have that golf cart out there and says she doesn't want to get in the way of progress. So now what? Well, she has offered to pay any sort of fine that was a citation that could have potentially come from that traffic stop. That traffic stop by the way from about three weeks ago, and now Tampa is looking for a new police chief. No word yet on exactly when one might be named or placed. Just the mayor saying that it will be a national search. In the meantime, though, a lot of questions as to, you know, exactly why the now former police chief said and did what she did.",

      "sentences": "Yes, it doesn't seem as if the Attorney General is hinting at some changes or this review that's under way. The State Department says this is ambiguous and vague at best. The Attorney General in Iran does have purview over the hijab laws which have been in place for the last 43 years, since the Iranian revolution.They're totemic to the regime for the control of women, control of people, control of society, and these are partly what caused the protests in Iran three months ago. Women said they didn't want to wear the hijab. They protested. Of course, the protests have grown so much more since then. The government's gone through all of these oppressive measures with police shooting protesters, killing protesters, and they still have not been able to stop them. In fact, the protesters have now said, you know, not just remove the hijab, but remove the leader of the country. So, maybe this is the government trying to put a fix in there. But where the Attorney General perhaps spoke out of turn or is hinting again at this review that's under way, when he said that the morality police who enforce this law, he said that they would be abolished, and as you said, state media is rolling that back. He doesn't have purview over the morality police, but perhaps that is going to be part of this review. However, these types of politics in Iran can really be a smoke and mirrors issue. What's in the review? Is it a binding review? Will it be rescinded? If there's a review and it comes out, will it ever be enforced? So, none of the details behind this can we really see. All we can see is what's happening on the surface of the water, if you will, but potentially the government is rattled by the scale of the protests. But these moves, whatever they may be do seem to be shutting the barn after the horses bolted. The protests have gone so far beyond just the hijab now.",

Those red states, those are states are high or very high flu activity. It's almost the entire United States. Only six states are not seeing high or very high activity, and even, I'm sorry to say, COVID is making a bit of a comeback if you take a look at the week of November 26th. 33,000 people admitted to U.S. hospitals because of COVID. That's up 27 percent from the week before. Now the Biden administration says they're monitoring this.

And I think sometimes people forget that.So, what you do want to do is get your child vaccinated against the flu. What you don't want to do is hoard flu medications or things like children's Advil, children's Tylenol because if you hoard them, you're going to get some bad mommy and daddy karma coming at you.
