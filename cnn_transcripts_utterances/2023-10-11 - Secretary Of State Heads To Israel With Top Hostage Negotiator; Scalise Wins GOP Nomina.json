This, as Hamas is still holding as many as 150 hostages, several now confirmed to be Americans. A former U.S. hostage negotiator will join me live. And there may have been a vote. But tonight, there is still no House Speaker. Steve Scalise, nominated by House Republicans, to take the gavel, but it's unclear if he can actually get the votes to do so. I'm Kaitlan Collins. And this is THE SOURCE. Good evening. This is a special edition of THE SOURCE. We are tracking two fast-moving stories, on location, tonight. I'm Kaitlan Collins, in Washington. My colleague, Anderson Cooper, is in Ashdod, Israel, where tonight, 300,000 troops are amassing, along the Gaza border, as Israel has continued to bombard Gaza, with airstrikes, today, and disturbing new details of Hamas' atrocities continue to emerge. President Biden says that the terror group's attack marks the deadliest day, for Jews, since the Holocaust. And he reacted to reports of one of the more horrific details that we have heard.

But it is still hard to even hear those words, from the U.S. President.In Gaza, tonight, a humanitarian crisis is unfolding before our eyes. At least now 1,100 people, in the territory, in the Palestinian territory, have been killed. And all power has been shut off. Talks are underway, we are told, by officials, to set up a corridor, so that Gaza civilians could get out. But that's an incredibly difficult undertaking, and it's not clear where it will end up. Secretary of State, Antony Blinken, is also on his way, to Israel, tonight, with the nation's chief hostage negotiator in tow. Right now, it is believed that up to 150 hostages are still being held, by Hamas, in Gaza. The death toll, in Israel, has risen to more than 1,200 people. And the number of Americans killed now stands at 22. Among them, two brothers, who worked security, for their village, Amit, and Igal Wachs, who moved, to Israel, from America, to take care of their mom, who has cancer. Deborah Matias, a mom, who was killed shielding her son, from the bullets. And 34-year-old Danielle (ph) Ben Senior. She was one of the event organizers, at the music festival, that turned from a night that was supposed to be of revelry, into a scene of carnage. I want to get right to Anderson Cooper, who is in Ashdod. Anderson, I mean, those are just a few of the faces and the names of the 22 Americans that we know have been killed in this attack. I mean, you've been there. You're reporting from this country that has been consumed by grief. How is that impacting what you're seeing on the ground?",

Gaza is, with limited amount of space, reported from Gaza City, and you see rockets suddenly taking off, from a downtown street, then people get into tunnels and move locations. So, it's very easy -- very difficult to stop that, those mobile sites.And obviously, Israel has been pounding Gaza with all, for days now. And there has been this buildup of troops. So, I think the anticipation is now that there is this Unity Government, as they're saying, or Unity Cabinet, that is one more step, to sort of open up the capabilities, to have a ground assault. Nobody though is naive about what the reality of that will be, both from the potential, first, loss of civilian life, in Gaza. Civilians has nowhere to go. And as you mentioned, there have been talks, about possibly opening up some sort of a humanitarian corridor, to Egypt. In pasts, the Egyptian authorities have not wanted to have an open border, with large numbers, of Gazan residents coming and staying in Sinai, and in Egypt. So, they will have to get on board with that. And it remains to be seen if that will even happen. But it is -- nobody is naive, about what a ground assault, into Gaza, would look like, and the death toll that, could occur from that.",

I think, right now, the focus is on Secretary Blinken and Ambassador Carstens' diplomacy. And there are diplomatic levers that we can use, with the Iranians, with the Qataris, with potentially with our Turkish partners, a NATO ally. And so, that's going to be the focus.

But I think what happened here is we've become a little bit complacent. Both the United States and Israel, we relied so much on electronic intelligence, signal intelligence, reconnaissance with our satellites. And those are exquisite capabilities. But I think what happened here is the Hamas, and their terror sponsors, in Tehran, used old-school methods. They used runners and messengers. They did in-person meetings, and didn't get on the telephone. They met outside of Israel, in the region, the Wall Street Journal reports, in Lebanon, potentially in Tehran, and other locales. So, our adversaries know our capabilities. And, in this case, it looks like they took advantage of our reliance on technical means, and maybe a lack of human intelligence, and used old-school techniques. And maybe they learned from the mafia movies, if the FBI has a wire, speaking code, and meet outside the Italian restaurant, and avoid getting caught. And I think they used those sorts of very, very old- school methods that we've seen the criminal organizations use in the past.",

This wasn't war. I mean, killing babies and beheading babies and children? It's something we haven't seen, even from ISIS. I mean, this is bad. And so, there's going to be a Military response. But I think in due time that diplomatic initiatives will take place. And look, I applauded the Biden administration. I was glad to see Jake Sullivan, my successor, go to Riyadh, and go to Jerusalem, and obviously bringing Saudi Arabia into the Abraham Accords, which would strengthen the Accords, and strengthen peace, in the Middle East.

They are approximately 500 or 600 American citizens, in Gaza. There are fewer 100 foreign nationals, people work, the NGOs, journalists, U.N. workers. All of those people, the ones who would want to leave, might be able to do it. The negotiations, as far as I understand, are making progress.
