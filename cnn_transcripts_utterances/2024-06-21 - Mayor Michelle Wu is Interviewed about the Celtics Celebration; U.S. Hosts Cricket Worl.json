(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) LARRY HOGAN (R), MARYLAND SENATE CANDIDATE: It was obviously not something that we were seeking and didn't want and didn't have any interest in. And it's not something we're going to be promoting, that's for sure. In a state that Donald Trump lost by 33 points, doesn't really carry a lot of voters over to our cause. So, I don't think we're going to have any interest in accepting it. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And Hogan needs to look at Maryland like he did as governor, which is, I'm an independent guy. I'm not beholden to Donald Trump or any other person in my party. I put country over party and I put Maryland over party.So, in both cases, I think the political posture works for them. I mean Hogan's exactly right, Trump's not popular in Maryland. Now, there are some Trump voters there. Western Maryland is rural and there are some people out there who might have been invested in what Trump had to say. But overall, the Hogan brand is, I'm not beholden to a political party or its leadership. And he's keeping that up in his Senate campaign. And I think that's why he's one of the best opportunities for Republicans to pick up in a real blue state this cycle.",

And, most importantly, independents who are so crucial to this who will respond to this as well.The polling numbers seem to indicate that since Donald Trump's conviction, Joe Biden has gone up. And, in fact, according to the most recent Fox News poll, I think he's gone up five points since March. So, I think that the Biden campaign is on a slow, steady approach to try to take advantage of Donald Trump's conviction.

He played by the rules of the debate and he really came out looking great. It was too late then. But now that kind of style would work well for him I think.What am I worried about? Rabbit holes. You want to keep the debate focused on issues that work for you, inflation, the economy, immigration, national security, and which of us is really up to the job. But if he gets sucked down rabbit holes like January 6th, re- litigating the 2020 election and things that aren't over the target of why people have decided they want to fire Joe Biden from this job, it could be a lost night.

So, I don't think the format helps Donald Trump. The idea there's no audience, all that stuff is bad for him. And I think he's going to try to make it into a big show and a circus.
