I mean, we are hearing from a senior Hamas official that these -- the incident this morning, the horrifying incident this morning, really does have the potential to complicate or possibly derail these talks altogether.You just played that cryptic clip of President Biden saying he also acknowledges the very real possibility that this will complicate those efforts. At the same time, given the horrifying nature of this incident, and given the fact that aid organizations have been warning and shouting from the rooftops about the capacity and potential for an incident like this because of the desperation that you heard Jeremy Diamond describing there, I think there is also some optimism, potentially, or hope that perhaps this could be a watershed moment. That perhaps the White House is publicly now beginning to acknowledge that this policy of publicly supporting Israel while privately trying to apply as much pressure as possible has not been entirely effective in reducing the number of civilian casualties and in preventing an all-out humanitarian catastrophe. And again, as you heard, Jeremy said, we are now one step away, according from the U.N. from an actual famine. The implications of that, both politically for President Biden going into the election, but also geopolitically on the global stage. This is becoming a huge stain for America to continue to support this without trying to implement sufficient rigor to stop events like this from taking place to ensure the unfettered and free access of aid workers to this area. And every aid worker I have spoken to, Dana, says the same thing, which is, it is just not possible to do that unless you have some type of a ceasefire that really would allow that aid to get to the places where it needs to the most, because not only is not enough aid getting in. The aid that is getting in is stuck in the south. It's very hard to get to the north. The situation is so desperate there. And then you have this lawlessness and looting and things of this nature, Dana.",

He tried and failed to get an immigration bill done. That's not where the base of his party is.

I think this is one of the things that is really the secret to his success is he understands the place better than anybody else. You have a hundred people who look in the mirror and see a president looking back at them. And one of the jokes that McConnell always made is that he felt like he was the caretaker, the groundskeeper at a graveyard, that everybody was under him, but nobody was listening.
