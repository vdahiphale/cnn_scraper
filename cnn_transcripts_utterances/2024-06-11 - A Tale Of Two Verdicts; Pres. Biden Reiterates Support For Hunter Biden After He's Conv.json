      "sentences": "Tonight on 360, what happens now that the President's son is a convicted felon and why supporters of the convicted felon who's running for president are still complaining about the criminal justice system, keeping them honest.Also, a CNN exclusive, Clarissa Ward, goes inside a Syrian detention camp where families of ISIS fighters are being held in some fear the next generation may be being born. Plus, we have breaking news tonight, a bus hijacking, a chase and the deadly discovery at the end of it. Good evening. Thanks for joining us. We begin tonight, keeping them honest, with three facts about Hunter Biden's conviction today in Wilmington, Delaware, on federal gun charges. The first is the human impact it must have on a family that has certainly known tragedy, including a car crash that killed Hunter Biden's mom and baby sister, the death to brain cancer of his brother, Beau, and his own descent into self-destruction by crack cocaine. In a moment, Ronald Reagan's daughter, Patti Davis, joins us to talk about her own struggles with addiction. The second fact is that despite efforts to paint his trial as a counterpart to or even the equivalent of Donald Trump's New York trial, unlike the former president, Hunter Biden is not running for anything. The third fact is the one thing they actually do have in common. In each, the guilty verdict was rendered by 12 men and women who heard the evidence and seemed to have set aside any preconceptions they might have had going in. As one Biden juror told CNN today, politics played no part in their deliberations, nor did testimony about the degree of Biden's addiction, which he described as heart-wrenching. The verdict was unanimous. And just like in New York, there is every indication the criminal justice system worked and continues to. Beyond that, nearly everything surrounding the two trials and their aftermath is a study in contrast, starting with how each defendant reacted to the verdict. Quoting now from Hunter Biden's statement, thanking his wife and others, \"I'm more grateful today for the love and support I experienced this last week from Melissa, my family, my friends and my community than I am disappointed by the outcome.\" He goes on to say, \"Recovery is possible by the grace of God, and I am blessed to experience that gift one day at a time.\" By contrast, here's some of what the former president said after his conviction.

It's widely expected Hunter Biden wouldn't get anything anywhere near that. This is, of course, a first time offender. But juror number 10 told us he doesn't think that Hunter Biden should get any prison time. Another juror said that Hunter needs rehab more than he needs imprisonment or a fine. And while the jury is weighing in on sentencing, it is ultimately actually up to the judge to determine the sentence. And we expect while there is no sentencing date now, we expect it will be roughly 120 days after this verdict, which would fall in late October. So that's before Election Day, but likely after his next federal criminal trial, which is scheduled for early September out in Los Angeles.",

JONES III, RETIRED CHIEF JUDGE: No, the verdict didn't surprise me at all, Anderson. I think the evidence was overwhelming. And, you know, what I thought was notable and picking up on your lead, which I thought was spot on, in both of these cases, you had judges, one a state judge and the other a federal judge, saying, among other things, you must follow the law to 24 Americans, in these two cases. You must follow the law, whether you agree with it or not, and you're not to be concerned about the sentence that I may give if the defendant is convicted.

The evidence really did seem to be overwhelming and the charges were pretty straightforward in terms of what the jury was being asked to find. And I think the case also highlights the limited role that we give to juries in our system, now they're asked to apply the law, as they're instructed about the law, to the facts and not to render an opinion in the courtroom about whether they think this was a wise prosecution or what they think is an appropriate punishment. I mean, they're really quite limited.It's not clear to me that there are strong grounds for appeal. I mean, there is a Second Amendment issue on whether or not the law that makes it a crime to possess a gun if you have - are addicted to drugs, whether that survives a Second Amendment challenge under the Supreme Court's current jurisprudence on that, but that would really only go to one of the three charges. And so it could be that there are some issues with respect to the evidence that was admitted, but that would be subject to harmless error review. Maybe there's an appellate issue about whether or not he was entitled to essentially the benefit of the plea agreement that he had reached with the special counsel that previously fell apart, but I don't see those as being particularly strong.

And to have, you know, your dearest relatives on the stand and have to go through this has to be devastating to the President.

So they're all shifting. And the thing that they're doing, Anderson, is, you know, this whole - the mantra, and they all move as one, is this, you know, Biden crime family thing. Because really what's at play here is their strategy is to try and say everybody is corrupt, that everybody's swimming in the same murky waters, that Donald Trump is no different than Joe Biden, and that voters should discount the fact that Donald Trump is a convicted felon and has, you know, some other major cases pending against him.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) CLARISSA WARD, CNN CHIEF INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Cell phone videos of ISIS's brutal justice that the world hoped it would never see again. Shared for the first time with CNN, these images weren't captured in Raqqa or Mosul in 2016. They were taken in 2022 in the Al-Hol Camp in northern Syria, a sprawling dumping ground for the women and children captured after ISIS was defeated. Five years after the fall of the caliphate, ISIS's ideology lives on here. Security officials warn it is a ticking time bomb, ungovernable and hostile to the outside world.",

An SDF raid earlier this year netted this video of a training session for children inside the camp. The SDF claims young teenage boys are married off to repopulate the next generation of ISIS fighters, which they say may explain the roughly 60 births recorded here every month. This is where some of those boys end up after they are taken, the Orkesh Rehabilitation Center. Conditions here are much better than the camps, but there are only 150 beds and they are all full.

As the State Department determined and the courts agreed, she is not and never was a U.S. citizen. We also heard, Anderson, from her lawyer, who responded, if Hoda Muthana is not a U.S. citizen, then she is stateless, and that is a violation of international law that directly contradicts what the U.S. government has stated other countries cannot and should not do. And I should add, Anderson, that a senior U.S. official told us there are about a dozen Americans who are still in these camps in northeastern Syria. The repatriation process is not straightforward, though, because many of them, unlike Hoda, don't actually want to go back. We spoke to one woman who asked not to be identified.

They attempt to use stop sticks, but the bus avoids early attempts to stop it, all of it through Atlanta's rush hour traffic. At one point, the bus almost hits this truck. It swerves around the car and then veers into traffic as drivers scramble to get out of the way. MAYOR ANDRE DICKENS (D), ATLANTA: A gunman with a gun to the head of a bus driver saying, don't stop this bus or else worse will happen. This is the type of thing that obviously no one is, I mean, it seems like the movies. YOUNG (voice-over): Later, the bus narrowly misses another group of cars as it drives on the left side of the road before coming to a stop on this tree-lined road. [20:55:00] SCHIERBAUM: There were 17 individuals on the bus, including the bus driver. Unfortunately, as the mayor has stated, one individual has died of injuries, which we believe to be a gunshot wound. This is going to be a joint investigation by the Atlanta Police Department, as well as from the Georgia Bureau of Investigation. We currently do have in custody a 39-year-old Joseph Grier.

(END VIDEOTAPE) YOUNG (on-camera): Yes, Anderson, we're also finding out the man who was arrested is a convicted felon. But I want to tell you something. We were doing a news conference about that earlier shooting, and this started happening. I got a phone call from a source that was saying they could see several police cars chasing this car through the streets of Atlanta. It was very harrowing. In fact, they saw officers trying to use their car to block that bus.

This was sort of a dry run, you know, for the big event coming up. Anderson?",
