And then that would come with it the challenges that I think many critics and observers have seen in the India's democracy where critics argue that that rights and freedoms of speech and press and religion have been reduced during Modi's party's period in power. So, so some of those questions would still be very much open moving forward. There are a lot of things to look at right now. How the BJP will perform in states where it has enjoyed stronghold success in the past, whether or not they can break through into some of India's dozens of states and territories where they've been weak in the past. And there are suggestions if any of these polling results are true, that coalition politics may be much more important moving forward. So all the things that we should be watching very closely, as the counting continues in the hours ahead. And I just want to state again, the scale of this election, we're talking about 15 million poll workers that were involved over the course of the past six weeks, John, and record high heat wave temperatures, where you had dozens of workers dying, doing their job due to heatstroke and heat related illnesses in recent days.

But once you declare that yourself to be, you know, a messenger sent by God and that you do God's mission that obviously elevates the leader into a celestial realm while you sort of remain within the material world. [01:10:06] And also that removes all sort of aspects of accountability which are key to any kind of a democratic polity. So, I mean, early trends, obviously, and I think he kind of meant that, particularly for the state of Uttar Pradesh, where he uttered these words. And we see at the moment that they are poised to lose 25 seats, and, you know, the trailing 25 seats, they had a much bigger share of the seats over there in the last elections. And I think that sort of speaks well for the Indian voter, that through the fog of campaign rhetoric, and a lot of self- aggrandizement, as well as the way in which the media treats him with kid gloves in the Indian scenario. They were able to get alternative sources of information, and they were able to make their minds on issues other than these religious, anti-Muslim and elevation of the leader into a celestial realm. And this confirms what something that we've been hearing that bread and butter issues, issues concerning employment, you know, rising prices, those kinds of things seem to have played so far, a much bigger role than I think a lot of observers were thinking when they came up with the polls of the last week.",

Now President Biden would be using an authority that's called the 212(f) authority. This was a regulation that was actually used by former president Donald Trump during his administration and he received a lot of criticism, including from many Democrats at the time. So it's not hard to President Biden getting criticized for hypocrisy for leaning on this authority himself. And of course very hard to ignore the politics that are at play here given that border security is one where President Biden and Democrats have gotten so much criticism for, and really a lot of pressure to do more to get a better handle on the border. The timing, of course, is really significant as well given that we are just a couple of weeks away from that first presidential debate between President Biden and former president Donald Trump. Now, the White House is not confirming this forthcoming announcement that we expect again on Tuesday, but a White House spokesperson said this in a statement to CNN. They said, \"As we have said before, the administration continues to explore a series of policy options and we remain committed to taking action to address our broken immigration system.\" Now, the big caveat here, of course, is that there could still be some final changes that are made to the final text of this executive order. But when it does come, it will be sweeping. It will be a significant political announcement and Present Biden is certainly hoping that it is something that could strengthen his political hand before November. MJ Lee, CNN -- at the White House.
