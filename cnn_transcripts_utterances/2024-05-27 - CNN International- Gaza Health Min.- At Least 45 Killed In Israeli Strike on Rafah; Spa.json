But, so far, there is no clear indication of exactly when those talks will formally get off the ground, and also no clear indication yet of whether the bridge -- the gap between Hamas and Israel has been bridged yet on some of those key sticking points. A ceasefire agreements for now seems like the only way possibly out of this hell that we are currently watching in Gaza.",

On the diplomatic front, the Ukrainian President is in Madrid, where the Spanish Prime Minister has announced a weapons deal for Ukraine worth around $1 billion. Joining me live now with more on this is Melissa Bell, joining us from Paris. So, Melissa, President Zelenskyy is in Spain.

I think certainly the weight of the job very much present, and the weight of their decisions on a day like today, and it does sort of unfold with a degree of dignified remembrance. The President hosting Gold Star families here at the White House for breakfast this morning. We just saw him lay a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier in Arlington, and he will deliver the address at the memorial amphitheater. I was driving into work today, passed the World War Two Memorial on the mall, and I was reminded, Zain, we're coming up on the 80th anniversary of the D-Day landings.President Biden will be there in northern France next week, remembering the thousands of U.S. and allied troops who participated in the Normandy landings, all in the name of protecting democracy in Europe, and that is a theme that President Biden has struck on again and again, protecting democracy. We just heard him speak about it over the weekend, when he was speaking to graduating cadets at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, talking about the oath that they take is not to a President or to a political party, but to the U.S. Constitution, and reminding them that protecting democracy is not a guarantee that it requires every generation to defend it, preserve it and choose it, and I think that's a particularly resonant message. On Memorial Day, at a moment of fraught international tensions, the President confronting two grinding wars in Ukraine and Gaza. He has committed to not deploying American troops to those conflicts. And in fact, he reemphasized that commitment at West Point over the weekend. But, the risks for U.S. troops are not small. The U.S. has been dragged into the fray. It was only in February that the President traveled to Dover Air Force Base to be with families, as the remains of their loved ones came back after being killed in a drone strike in Jordan. And I think on that day and today as well, certainly the weight of this job, a searing reminder for the President of the consequences of his decisions on Memorial Day. Zain.",

At least 19 people are dead across four American states after a wave of severe storms, and the threat still persists. 120 million people are under severe weather warnings with that risk especially high towards the East Coast. There is also an ongoing tornado emergency issued for Kentucky. That's where this video you see on your screen was taken on Sunday. The Governor of Texas confirmed storms in his state killed at least seven people and injured about 100. The storms have knocked out power to hundreds of thousands of people, and they may impact travel in major hubs like Atlanta and New York.CNN's Ed Lavandera joins us live now from Cooke County, Texas. I see the debris. I see what some of this weather has actually left behind, behind you. And of course, on this Memorial Day holiday, people are cleaning up. They're cleaning up the debris. They're looking for their belongings. Just take us through what people are experiencing right now. ED LAVANDERA, CNN SENIOR U.S. NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Yeah. This is -- like, the shock has s kind of worn off, and now people are coming to the reality of what they're dealing with after this tornado ripped through this subdivision in North Texas Saturday night, just before 11 o'clock at night, and has just completely shattered and changed lives here. The families that you saw behind me there just a moment ago, there were four of them inside this home. The top of it just completely blown off. But, somehow, the little closet they were in stayed intact, and they were able to survive and walk away, which is terrifying because what they came out to discover, saying is when they -- another family, the remnants here in front of these cars that you see is actually the remnants of another home that had been blown more than 100 yards and just laid out there was a family of four. It was -- the mother and two children were dead right there on the scene. So, that is what these other family members came out to discover. As you mentioned, in this area, seven people killed, four of those victims were young children. So, just devastating stories that people are coping with here this morning. But now is the cleanup. As you can see in the distance here, using heavy equipment just to pile up all of the debris in these -- in this subdivision, that is really the best that many of these people can do at this point, because right now, they're trying to figure out what the future is going to look like, and the need for temporary housing, and the need for clothing is what's going to get them through the next couple of days and weeks. But, this is going to be a long-term ordeal for them to deal with. There were more than 100 people also injured in this particular area. The American Red Cross told us that the storm system that blew through North Texas kind of left a trail of destruction over 150 to 250 miles in the state. This is clearly one of the most severely hit areas in that storm system, but just simply devastating scenes and stories everywhere we look here.",

Take a look at this map that shows the heat risk in the United States, and you can see that it's shaded from coast to coast from light tan, which is minor risk to deep, deep red, which is extreme risk, and you see that in South Texas. Now, this can be deadly. And this is something that the Biden administration has taken very seriously. The Biden administration is expecting to release a new set of regulations in the coming months to protect workers who are forced to work in these conditions, some people don't have another option, but to work outside. And so, to protect those individuals, we're expecting some regulations in the coming months.Now, one of the factors that the Biden administration is looking at is the number of deaths that are related to the heat. Now, the numbers that I'm about to share with you are not just work-related, but overall for the United States. And these numbers are staggering. Take a look. In 2021, the number of deaths were about 1,600 in the United States. In 2022, that number grew to about 1,700. And in 2023, last year, there was more than 2,300 deaths in the United States. And again, these are heat-related. Now, all of this doesn't stop people from working out. You can see that people are out, working out here in Houston behind me.

Let's bring in CNN Legal Analyst Norm Eisen, who joins us live now. Norm, good to see you. I think it's important to really underscore to our audience that in order to prevent a conviction, the defense team essentially just needs to convince one juror, just one juror that Donald Trump is not guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. And of course, beyond a reasonable doubt, that clause is key here. If they're able to do that, it is highly likely that they could be a mistrial. Just give us your expectations of how this week is going to go. NORM EISEN, CNN LEGAL ANALYST, &amp; FMR. HOUSE JUDICIARY SPECIAL COUNSEL IN TRUMP'S FIRST IMPEACHMENT TRIAL: Zain, I've been in court for every one of those 20 days of testimony and I'll be there tomorrow morning, as first, the defense, most likely Todd Blanche, Trump's lead counsel, and then the prosecution in the form of their most experienced and talented, very talented prosecutor, Joshua Steinglass, takes turns, arguing to that jury. It is not easy to get a hung jury. Just five or so percent of all trials end in a hung jury. And here, the prosecution has put together a case that does not depend on Michael Cohen alone. In a sense, the unifying theme of those 20 days has been the corroboration and support from Michael Cohen, as he answers two key questions. And as prosecutors have answered them, number one, did Donald Trump participate in a criminal conspiracy to influence the 2016 presidential election by making that hush money payment to avoid another damaging scandal after Access Hollywood? And number two, in 2017, did he create false documents to cover up that criminal conduct alleged in 2016? In my view, this is a jury that will listen closely to the judge when he tells them, you must apply the facts and the law. I think the prosecution has the stronger case here. But, the defense has points that they will make as well about the credibility of Cohen. And we will find out either this week or the following week, in my view.

I don't think it matters to the jury. I think that Stormy was actually stronger under cross in defending herself. She made herself more credible.But, in the end of the day, this is really about Cohen's credibility, about the 2016 conspiracy, whether or not Trump participated in it or not, and the 2017 cover-up. Whether or not he really had that relationship, it doesn't matter. What matters is what I think the prosecutor proved that there was a lot of fear in the Trump campaign after the Access Hollywood tape and the scandal that created about another sex scandal.
