What we know is that on Thursday evening, the U.S. military observed this unknown object in U.S. airspace off the coast of Alaska. They send up some military aircraft to take a visual look at it. And the pilots who go up there aren't able to learn a whole lot. We're told that they were able to determine that it was unmanned, and that it was flying at about 40,000 feet, which raised some concerns for interference with civilian air traffic, which ultimately, of course, is what we understand led the president to order the military to shoot this item down.But at this point we're still being told by the Pentagon that they're still referring to this as an object. We've been told it is about the size of a small car, and that it had, it appeared to have no maneuverability, so it was just kind of riding the winds and the air wave, which made its movements fairly unpredictable. CNN is also told by a U.S. official that it did not appear to have any surveillance equipment attached to it. But at this point, we are really going to be waiting for the debris from this object to be recovered by, by U.S. northern command, by NORAD, by the Alaska National Guard, as well as the FBI, to kind of take a look at this and examine it, and try to figure out, was this something that was owned by a nation state? Was this something that was privately owned? Was it a drone? Was it another kind of smaller- sized balloon? We are told by the Pentagon that it is a different shape and size, obviously, than the Chinese spy balloon that transitted the United States last week, but still, big mystery, guys.",

You want to gather as much information as you can. The one thing you cannot reclaim is time, so you go back to the balloon, first appeared on the radar by the North American Air Defense Command out of Colorado Springs when it was over the Aleutians. So the discussion begins, what do we need to do? What do we think this is?And that object, that balloon was maneuverable, so it's continuing to move. And by the time you make some decisions, get a little bit more clarity, it's already over the United States, and that opened up some other challenges that needed to be addressed. In this case, obviously there was more preparation. Folks who were leaning forward. They had already worked through some of those challenges before, so there was reflection, there was understanding, there were after action reviews. So the joint staff, the joint staff and the Pentagon made a quicker decision and made a recommendation both to the secretary of the defense who then walked over to the president and the National Security Council in that advisory role, and said here are the option. The president very quickly said this is a no brainer in our case, primarily because it was at about 40,000 feet. That's a hazard to civilian aircraft. The balloon flying last week was up around 75,000, 65,000 feet, outside of the civilian aircraft normal zone. And the other thing was, you have flights from the United States to Asia always go over the pole, and so you would think over Alaska, no big deal, maybe we check it out a little bit. But at 40,000 feet and with the number of flights, the great circle routes, it becomes a hazard. So they made a quick decision, a good decision.",

You've got to give the benefit of the doubt to the joint staff and to the I.C., the intelligence community, and the National Security Council. This was an abnormality, if you will, an aberration, and they worked their way through it and made a decision to let it transit the United States. Right or wrong decision, that's what happened.So you've got to balance that against what we saw in Alaska just last night which was very swift, very certain, no regrets. And so any adversary -- and look, the use of balloons, or in this case, an object, it is not unusual for intelligence collection. It provides loiter. It can stay over the grounds longer. It provides layering between satellites and aircraft. So it's a capability that works well, so we should not be surprised to see more activity like this, frankly.

This is part of the landscape of nations as they posture and they try to figure out what the intentions are, the national security objectives and intentions, of their competitors, and possibly those that they want to cooperate with.

This is a significant advancement feat, and of course, there are search and rescue teams working around the clock. Many people have traveled from across the globe to support in this rescue effort. And of course, there are so many people here, and, again, across the border in northwest Syria, praying, hoping, that their loved ones may still be alive, that they may still be pulled out of the rubble.Of course, that hope is beginning to dwindle now days on since the earthquake hit, and concern, of course, is mounting that we will continue to see that death toll rising. In fact, in northwest Syria, the white helmets, which has been leading on that rescue effort, says they are no longer anticipating that they will find survivors. Rather they are focusing on the recovery effort. Some real concern there, of course, and troubling developments for families and loved ones of those still trapped beneath the rubble. Of course, there is a huge emphasis, a huge focus on providing aid and humanitarian support for all of those impacted by the earthquake here in Turkey and across the border in Syria. Of course, many people now displaced, particularly in Syria, where there were more than 4 million people in that region already heavily dependent on humanitarian assistance. We've seen the Turkish government announcing new funding. More than 140,000 volunteers and rescue workers working around the clock as part of Turkey's effort to tackle this and address the humanitarian crisis. But of course, there is also concern around the situation in Syria, because while we have seen aid being funneled into Turkey, commitments and pledges from across the globe, this has certainly been more robust than the aid response in northwest Syria, which has, of course, faced some issues with regards to logistics, but also getting that aid from Damascus into rebel-held areas. We've heard urgent pleas from aid groups to get the aid to northwest Syria, and it does appear that now those convoys are getting in across the border. The question is whether will we see the cross-line transfers of aid from government territories in that rebel-held territory in the northwest.",

He also serves as a partner at Moore Hall. Michael, we're always glad to have your expertise. We were joking during the commercial break, you flip over a rock and there is another classified document. What could this mean for Mike Pence? MICHAEL MOORE, FORMER U.S. ATTORNEY, MIDDLE DISTRICT OF GEORGIA: I think he is probably handling it the right way. And I'm glad to be with both of you here on the set. He has handled it the right way by saying he is responsible, and he is responsible for this, and he has allowed them to come to his home to do a search. I think on a grander scale, it has probably bigger implications what may be going on with the Trump documents case. The Pence case and the Biden case are completely different than the Trump case, but there is no way that there is not some overlap and correlation. That will be in the back of the prosecutor's minds as they think about what was found and what went on. In the Pence case, the documents are there, there is no question about it. But at the same time, he's given over the documents. He hasn't fought about it, he hasn't fought a subpoena, he hasn't tried to obstruct and give what I think are false statements about whether or not classified documents were there.
