I'm Rahel Solomon live in New York.And ahead on CNN Newsroom, Ukraine makes good on a promise right after getting the green light to use U.S. weapons to strike deeper into Russia. It has done just that. We're going to take a look at what this means, as Ukraine marks a grim milestone of 1,000 days of war. Plus, President Biden wraps up his visit to the G20 summit with a message to world leaders on fighting climate change, as a second Trump term looms. And President-elect Donald Trump doubling down on one of his most controversial cabinet picks, personally calling senators to get them to confirm Matt Gaetz as Attorney General. We begin with a major escalation in Russia's war on Ukraine. U.S. officials are now confirming that Ukraine used American-provided longer-range weapons to strike inside of Russia for the first time. The officials say that they were used to hit a weapons arsenal. It comes just two days after U.S. President Joe Biden gave Ukraine the green light to strike targets inside Russia with longer-range American-made weapons. After the reported missile attack early Tuesday morning, Russian President Vladimir Putin updated his country's nuclear doctrine. Under the updated doctrine, Moscow will consider aggression from any non-nuclear state, but with the participation of a nuclear country, a joint attack on Russia. Meanwhile, Ukraine is marking a bleak anniversary of 1,000 days of war. Ukrainian President Zelenskyy marking the occasion by pushing back on the Russian President, as he addressed a special session of European Parliament. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

The initial details that we first got about this were from the Russian state media quoting the Russian Defense Ministry saying or claiming that they had downed five out of six of these ATACMS missiles that were directed at the Bryansk region, which borders Ukraine, and one of those missiles, they said, fragments of which had hit the ground and caused the fire at a military facility, that was subsequently put out.But, it's important to point out that this is not the first time Ukraine has actually managed to pull off long-range strike inside of Russia proper, in addition to getting the green light to use these longer-range U.S. weapons. Ukraine has had its own indigenous drone program, for instance, that's been able to strike deep inside of Russia. So, this has been, I think, a pattern that, in part, has been part of this effort, I think, to push and pull that's between Washington and Kyiv about what kind of permissions can be given for U.S.-made weapons systems, where there has been a lot of concern about what you'd call escalation management, making sure that any sort of new weaponry that's given to the Ukrainians doesn't particularly cross a dangerous red line that would be perceived by Moscow, Rahel.",

I think it's about sanctions against Russia. There are many loopholes which can be closed, especially in oil and gas industry. Financial sanctions. There are special condition for gas and oil which still can be financed, Russian gas and oil, according to decision of U.S. government.

As world leaders start to look past Joe Biden and toward the incoming Trump administration, this has really been something of a quiet trip for the President.The longest stretch that we've heard him speak was only for seven minutes in the Amazon on Sunday. He hasn't taken questions from reporters, which is unlike every previous G20 trip that he has taken as President. It's really as if he is fading from public view, from his foreign policy stature as he tries to burnish his legacy. There is no sort of missing the impression that world leaders are just starting to move on. He has had a number of bilateral meetings, including in Peru, including yesterday, with the leaders of Canada and Mexico, the neighboring countries to the United States. But, you don't see him sort of sitting down for these rapid fire bilateral meetings that are sometimes a presence on these trips. Instead, it is a much quieter trip for the President.

He believes that whoever his secretary -- or excuse me, his attorney general is going to be, is the most important role. Now, one thing to keep in mind as well is that Donald Trump hand- selected Matt Gaetz. He wants someone who would disrupt the Department of Justice, and that's why he really went with him. And as of now, despite everything that is going on around Gaetz, the controversy, everyone holding their breath on whether or not they are going to release the House Ethics report that details some of these allegations, including from a number of women who have said that he paid them or paid -- who said that Matt Gaetz, excuse me, had paid them for sexual favors, or that he had sex with underage girls, all to say, all of that aside, Donald Trump is still digging in on Gaetz. He has been calling up senators privately over the last 24 hours or so and really pressuring them to fall in line behind him. Now, another thing that's interesting about this as well is that we're told that even though there is some other controversial picks that Donald Trump has appointed, that he wants to be his nominees for different cabinet positions, people like Pete Hegseth for the Department of Defense, or Tulsi Gabbard to lead the office of -- or be his Director of National Intelligence, Donald Trump says he would rather sacrifice other potential cabinet picks than to sacrifice Matt Gaetz.

The next year, in 2022, the administration believed that Putin might be getting ready to use nuclear weapon against Ukraine, a tactical weapon. And that set up a lot of concern. I think now Putin has sort of overused, overplayed this card.So, yeah, I can understand why it is that people kind of shrug and move on. But, remember, Rahel, this is not what this era was supposed to be about. It was 16 years ago -- 15 years ago, Barack Obama gave his first speeches about trying to eliminate nuclear arsenals. This was his first year as President, and certainly reducing their role in American strategy. And others seem to be going along with that now.

They're not going to have that luxury. But, the fact of the matter is, this issue is done for President Biden. At this point, it's going to be handed off to a Trump administration whose support for Ukraine is significantly in doubt.",

The good news is, few countries would rely too heavily on any one single link, and they can be repaired.

About this time last night, a huge fire broke out there as well.And the IDF continues its targeting inside of Lebanon. Just yesterday, as you mentioned, targeting right in the center of Beirut. That's the sixth time that they've targeted in the center of Beirut since 2006. Three of those incidences have come in the last couple of days. And the IDF also saying that today -- announcing today that another of their soldiers have been killed in southern Lebanon. So, the war is still going on. The fight is absolutely still continuing.

Listen, it's been said a lot that Trump is not going to have some of the same guardrails that he had during the first term, when you think about some of the anti-tariff voices like Gary Cohn, who are unlikely to be in this White House, when you think about some of the Never-Trump Republicans that were in Congress and are not anymore. But, we know that Donald Trump, during his first term, I mean, he was kind of obsessed with what the stock market was doing. He was often tweeting out even the most minor of market milestones, and at times he would react when there were market sell-offs.And so, I've talked to some analysts who said, look, this could be a factor again. Isaac Boltansky over at BTIG, he told me, I don't see Congress or the courts limiting the President's authority. Ultimately, the only entity that has real power over the President's thinking about his agenda is the stock market. And I don't think it's hard to imagine a scenario where early next year Trump is putting out messages on social media about big tariffs on China or Mexico or another country, and having the market go down, perhaps so much that it could cause him to sort of moderate some of those tariff proposals. Same thing with the Fed. I mean, he has talked a lot about influencing Federal Reserve decisions. Possibly, there was some speculation that he could try to demote a Fed official. We know Jerome Powell says that he wouldn't step down. But, I could see a scenario where any sort of influencing of the Fed could not sit well with investors, and I think it's something that the President would take notice of if you have the market down because of it.
