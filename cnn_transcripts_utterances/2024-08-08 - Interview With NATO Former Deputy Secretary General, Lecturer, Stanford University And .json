So, what is the strategy here for Ukraine and what is the United States, a key ally of Kyiv, make of this? Rose Gottemoeller is the former NATO deputy secretary general and she joins me now from Mountain View, California. Rose, welcome to the program. Thank you so much. So, this seemed to catch everybody by surprise, and that Russia claims that they have stopped this incursion. We don't have confirmation of that. And this now appears to be entering its third day. We've seen since August 6th that Russia has lost at least 350 square miles of its territory. Reports are that a few to 1,000 soldiers took part in this. That's coming from Russia. It appears that the evidence suggests that that's much larger, that Ukraine has committed units from at least four elite brigades. What do you make of this move? And is it daring or risky or too risky, as I should quote, some in the industry now in military officials say for Ukraine to be making.

Actually, the Kyiv governmenthas been keeping a strict silence on this operation, which is very interesting. It's what we know we've been hearing from TASS and from the Russians, but also, of course, from our independent satellite scrutiny of what's going on the ground. So, it's very interesting, though, that the Ukrainians are neither confirming nor denying just a little hint from Zelenskyy about how good his troops are. And I think that is important because to my mind, what the Ukrainians are trying to do is knock the Russians off balance at a time when the Russians have felt that they have had the initiative in their summer offensive. So, this is clearly trying to insert some uncertainty on the Russian side and force them to draw troops to the Kursk region.",

And in those attacks, again, in a schoolyard, a young man and his six-year- old brother were killed. So, you know, it's the case that the Ukrainians have been seeing these attacks every day of this war. And so, they are somewhat inured to them.

The U.K. has been rocked by far-right and racist riots in the past week, targeting Muslims and minority communities all turbocharged by misinformation about three young girls who were tragically stabbed to death in a dance class last month. The billionaire owner of X, Elon Musk, added fuel to the fire. Talking about a civil war. And now, this behavior isn't new for Musk. He's also been at it in the U.S., where he shared a deepfake of Kamala Harris. I spoke about it all earlier with Emily Glazer of The Wall Street Journal and Nicholas Thompson of The Atlantic. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) \\ GOLODRYGA:  Emily Glazer, Nicholas Thompson, thank you so much for joining us. So, this is a story that unfortunately didn't get enough attention, I think, here in the United States. These riots that unfolded in the U.K., quite alarming and a big test for a new prime minister and his new government. And obviously, we have the element of social media as well. And Nicholas, let me start with you. Because here you have Elon Musk weighing in to what's unfolding on the streets in the U.K. and saying, civil war is inevitable. That was met with a response from the U.K. prime minister's office saying there was no justification for these comments. What do you make of it?

I was thinking back to the 2020 election when Twitter and other platforms were rolling out even more measures to curb the spread of mis and disinformation. You know, up until -- right before the election, Twitter was putting labels on information that was spreading, anything that could incite violence and cite hateful speech, and they had found then, and it was, you know, a company under different ownership. I think they labeled roughly 300,000 posts and that it significantly decreased the spread of that type of information. That's obviously changed as Elon Musk has brought this company. You know, it's private. He's running it. He's shaping the activities. Britain does have, you know, a certain regulation that I believe is going into effect later this year that is meant to curb the spread of information that incites violence online.

      "sentences": "Yes. So, I think that's a complicated question. We investigated many different factors that might be causing this. Let me first say, youknow, just as a starting point, what is driving that shrinking of the race gap? Half of it is driven by black kids growing up in low-income families, doing better than they were before. They're more likely to rise out of poverty, less likely to be unemployed, less likely to be incarcerated. Positive progress for black kids growing up in low-income families, which I think we should celebrate. On the other side, we have white kids growing up in low-income families, unfortunately doing a bit worse than they were in the past. Less likely to be working, less likely to be in the middle class, and so on. And so, the shrinking of the race gap is coming from both of those forces, black kids doing better and low-income white kids not doing as well. Now, what is driving those trends? It turns out that a lot of the explanation originates in the communities in which these kids are growing up. Black kids are increasingly growing up in thriving communities where you have more parents who are working, higher levels of stability, more opportunities to rise up, more exposure to people who can connect you to an internship for a pathway to success. White kids, particularly white kids with less educated parents, unfortunately, are growing up in communities that are not thriving as much, and that's driving the decline in economic mobility for white children.",

      "sentences": "That's exactly right. And I think that's an extremely important point. We find that in the places where black kids are doing best, and wecan look at this data, but the audience can look it up in their own community. If you go to a website called The Opportunity Atlas, you can look up data for your own county. And what you'll see is there are some parts of America, like parts of the southeast, a city like Charlotte, North Carolina, for example, where black kids are doing much better than they were before. But those same places where we see black kids doing better, we also see white kids doing relatively better. So, it's absolutely not a zero-sum game, it's not that one group is benefiting at the expense of the other, both groups are doing better in some places and worse in other places. And so, you know, I think what this shows us is that economic mobility is really something we can all benefit from and make progress in together.",

We see that kids who grow up in higher income families do better on manydimensions, not just in how much money they make themselves, but their health, the education they get and numerous different life outcomes that we might all care about. But as you're stressing, and I think this is a key message from the data, what matters really above and beyond that is the strength of the community in which you're growing up, even holding fixed your parents income. So, we give you a concrete example, take Dubuque, Iowa, or much of rural Iowa, you wouldn't think of rural Iowa as sort of a powerhouse in terms of high paying jobs and so on. It turns out, if you want to pick a place to rise up and achieve the American dream, that's the sort of place where your odds are the best. You have the best chances of rising up in many places in the rural Midwest, not because you're going to get that high paying job or find success in that community itself, but we see that those communities, which often have a lot of social capital, meaning connections between low and high income, people who help you out, show you a path, have great educational systems and so on, they launch kids on careers that then, you know, lead them to high paying positions in a place like Chicago or New York, find success in various domains and so on. So, that community unit is really crucial we think for restoring the American dream.",

And, you know, if we just think about the history of the U.S. and a lot of what we hear in the public discourse,there have been many changes in terms of global competition, outsourcing, technological change, the decline in manufacturing, where lots of folks have lost jobs, right? The local steel plant closes. The auto industry declines in certain places. And many workers, and it's often been white workers who had those high paying jobs, they ended up losing employment. And we've seen an earlier work that they haven't necessarily come back to work and haven't found jobs. Now, what we're seeing in these new data is that has an impact, not just on that generation of workers who were displaced, but on the next generation of kids, in particular white kids who are growing up in these communities where now, you know, you knew many people who worked at the local steel plant or auto plan and kind of have that pathway planned out and kind of had a sense of how you might follow that track, that option is no longer available. You might have thought people will naturally go in some different direction, but that's not happening. Unfortunately, we're seeing a decline in those communities where there are health issues that emerge. People get more disconnected, not graduating from high school, a broader decline that is leading to this decline in economic mobility, unfortunately, for many white Americans.",

So, you know, I've been giving moving to opportunity as an example, bringing people to opportunity, that can be partof the solution, but obviously, it's not completely scalable. What we really need to do is bring opportunity to people where they currently live in places where it's lacking. And so, there are many different strategies one can take. Let me give you another concrete example. I think there's a new set of job training programs that can connect people to opportunities and have shown tremendous success in randomized trials that, again, combine traditional skills training, you know, teaching people I.T. or some other skill that's in demand. But now, combining that with support from a network. So, I'm thinking of programs like GEAR UP or Personal Us (ph), where what they do is bring in for something like a one-year internship, and they say, look, you know, Bank of America is looking to hire a thousand people. This actually happened coming back to Charlotte. When (INAUDIBLE) our study. Bank of America made a commitment to hire 1,000 kids from disadvantaged backgrounds who grew up in Charlotte itself. And so, the way they did that, is they teamed up with this group GEAR UP and a local community college to say, we want to hire people who can fill these specific jobs. Let's provide them the training they need to be able to get those jobs, but also tell them that there's an internship waiting for them, provide them the wraparound social support needed to be able to succeed in these careers and so on. And it turns out if you do a randomized trial, you know, flip of a coin, some people get access to this program, some people don't. Those who get access to it, we see a 40 percent earnings gain sustained over many, many years. And they are now, because of that social contact, on a trajectory where, you know, they're providing for themselves, providing for their families. That's again one concrete example of things we can do in communities where opportunity is currently lacking.",
