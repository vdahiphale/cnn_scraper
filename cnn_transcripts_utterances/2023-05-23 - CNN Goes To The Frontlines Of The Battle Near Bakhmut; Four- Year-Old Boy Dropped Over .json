Belgorod sits just across the Russian side of the border with Ukraine. And Ukraine is saying it has nothing to do with these attacks. In the meantime, in Bakhmut right now, Ukraine's national security advisor is telling CNN that his forces still control part of the city and he is refuting claims made by Russian mercenaries who say they have captured the city after months of brutal and bloody fighting. CNN's Nic Robertson is in Kiev for us. Nic, you were just on the frontlines near Bakhmut. Tell us the very latest.",

But when we went close to the frontlines there, I think what we saw was the net effect of a year of war and, in particular, the effect of the grinding, grinding battle over so many months for Bakhmut itself. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ROBERTSON (voice-over): Barely out of the armored troop carrier, incoming artillery. (on camera): We're just going to wait in this little basement until the shelling is over. Then they think it will be safe to move forward in the front positions. ROBERTSON (voice-over): A few minutes later, safe to come out of this army outpost a few miles from Bakhmut.

U.S. Customs and Border Protection sending out this video on social media today with a strict warning for migrantsThe Rio Grande Valley Border Patrol chief says they have deported 90 percent of those who have entered the country illegally in the last few days, men, women and children. Notably, it comes as Border Patrol released this shocking video. Take a look in your screen, at that spot that we circled. That's a 4-year- old child being dropped over the border wall in San Diego. Let's go live to Rosa Flores, who has been tracking the latest. Rosa, first and foremost, is the child OK? And what have officials said about the incident surrounding this surveillance video? ROSA FLORES, CNN CORRESPONDENT: According to the Border Patrol chief, the child is OK. We don't have a lot of details about the condition of the child or the location of the child, where that child is. But here's what's so interesting about this video. The video doesn't tell you the full story because it's only surveillance video. It doesn't have audio. What happens thereafter is Border Patrol agents responded and so did the San Diego Fire Department. Those first responders came under fire from the Mexican side. So U.S. Customs and Border Patrol had to provide a helicopter to provide cover while they were providing and rendering aid to this child. Now all of this is under investigation by the United States and Mexico. They're trying to figure out what exactly happened here, and if these were, indeed, smugglers. In the backdrop of all of this is, in a post-Title 42 world, where the number of migrant encounters continues to drop, the latest numbers, according to the Border Patrol chief, stand at about 3,000, just under 3,000 migrants per day. Now, that is a 70 percent drop from the days leading up to the end of Title 42 when the encounters were at about 10,000. Now, Boris, one thing that does not change and that is the recommendation from CBP regarding the use of smugglers. They always tell migrants not to put their lives or the lives of their children in the hands of smugglers -- Boris?",

Which means we don't see that bright white eye or yellow eye as we did a few hours ago. That's good news. That means that the storm may be losing one of its eye walls. Another one develops on the outside that's not quite as strong. The problem is we still have another 10 or so hours in the water and it could regain that strength and maybe even be stronger. But 155 is the forecast. That is super typhoon. Over there, those are the Philippines. So far missing to the north but this is five days away from that. We know how things can change. There's going to be a lot of rainfall as well. Some of the mountains here in Guam, about 1,000, 1,200 feet. When that rain gets on top of those mountains, that could cause flash flooding for sure.

According to CNN in Portugal, detectives removed some dirt to be analyzed. Remember in April of last year officials named a German man as a suspect in the case. He once lived in the region where McCann went missing. Also, three million people in Mexico have been warned to prepare for evacuation as the country's most dangerous volcano could be ready to blow. The volcano is known as El Piojo. Hundreds of tremors have already been documented. This video shows the massive amount of ash that's also been to fall in Puebla City, forcing officials to cancel outdoor sports and events.
