This is really the state where the former president's campaign expects to deliver the final blow to Nikki Haley's campaign.And we've heard them throughout the week really delivering the closing arguments to voters trying to argue why they are the person who should continue on into a general election. And I can tell you, Victor and Amara from my conversations with the former president's campaign, they are very confident about his chances in the state today, the latest polls show that he has roughly a 30-point lead over Nikki Haley, and it does appear that she's, you know, bracing for a shellacking here in the state. I think a key question that a lot of people are looking for is will the dynamics of the state's primary make a difference for her in South Carolina. It is an open primary Democrats and Republicans are able to vote. The only people who aren't able to vote are those who cast their values -- their votes in the Democratic primary earlier this month. And I know that Nikki Haley's campaign is hoping that some of those more democratic and moderate and independent voters could perhaps close the gap between her and Donald Trump. But look, in the -- these last final days before this primary today, the attacks have become nastier between the top two candidates. We heard from the former president, as you mentioned, arguing that Haley is relying on Democratic voters saying that she's very far left and Nikki Haley arguing that he isn't fit to be president.

There's now utterly transformed lives.And the news of this morning is sort of typical, really, of the state that war finds itself in. The Russian Ministry of Defense claiming that in the fall of Avdiivka, because they took 200 Ukrainian soldiers prisoner, the fall of that town, a reflection really of how western aid its absence, the $60 billion not coming through, is really impacting Ukraine, on the frontline now at the most vital time in this war. And then two, the drone attacks. The second night in a row claiming lives in Odesa, as you said, another way in which Russia is using Iranian supplied technology and drones to impact civilians on a nightly basis. That is the reason we just heard sirens here as well. That's transformed daily life here, too. And on top of that, procession, it seems of European leaders coming into Kyiv talking of the urgent need to persist with aid and to support Ukraine because of the recognition that as a resurgent Russia finds its feet and moves forward slightly. But it's possible this becomes increasingly Europe's war. Add to that as well, some of the thought of potential successes Ukraine has had data this morning, Defense Intelligence claimed a strike deep inside Russia. Another reflection really of how Ukraine has managed to do things to Moscow's forces that were unthinkable before this war began retake huge swathes of territory strike deep inside Russia, use drones to take out key ships hit the Kerch bridge between Crimea, so much that they appear to have found their feet for. But ultimately, it's a strategic success, attempt or a bid to kick Russia out of key parts of their territory that eludes them at the moment, at the same time, Putin showing utter resolve here his defense minister visiting troops, and I think a fear that the year ahead without renewed Western aid, and even with the sense that that Western resolve is crumbling or is not as unified as it's been over the past years. There's now an opening for Moscow to move forwards to potentially probe witnesses in Ukrainian front lines. And it's important to remember too, utterly, for those who say, you know, why is this war not ended? Why is a peaceful negotiated solution not being found? What I think many Ukrainians have seen over the past few years is how utterly untrustable and brutal and savage Russia and its forces have been in areas that they've occupied, and how that essentially makes so many Ukrainians here feel that they simply cannot stop the fight, because if they do, that is life under occupation here, potentially death or awful circumstances for their family. And then to remember, in the West, the more success Putin feels more emboldened. He feels the greater threat he poses to NATO's border themselves. And that's a U.S. problem, too. Back to you.

CNN was granted access inside one medical clinic still providing IVF.(on camera): This is where they keep frozen embryos stored here, preserved in liquid nitrogen. So, according to the Alabama Supreme Court, these embryos are human beings, and destroying an embryo could hold you liable for wrongful death. This has been a big concern for patients and providers. So, now patients are in a situation where they may be forced to pay hundreds of dollars every year to store embryos that they know are not going to make it. They know are not viable, and providers certainly worried about civil liability if an embryo is lost in the process.
