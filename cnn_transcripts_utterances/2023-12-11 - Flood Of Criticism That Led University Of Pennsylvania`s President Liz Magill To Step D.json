Fears over antisemitism have reached new heights over the past few months following the October 7 terror attacks by Hamas in Israel and the subsequent attacks on Gaza by the Israel Defense Forces, or IDF. Soon after Magill announced her resignation, Chairman of the Board of Trustees Scott Bok also resigned. Here`s CNN`s Polo Sandoval with more. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "In back-to-back resignations, the president of the University of Pennsylvania announcing that she would stepdown just moments before the university official who made her announcement announced that he too would be resigning. Liz Magill announced on Saturday that she would be stepping down from her position as UPenn President. Her university statement, she will remain tenured faculty at the university`s law school and also agreed to stay on board while they find an interim replacement. As we`ve reported before, students, faculty, even donors say that they`ve lost confidence in Magill after Tuesday`s pretty disastrous hearing in which she, along with the Presidents at Harvard and MIT, failed to explicitly say that calls for genocide of Jews would immediately violate the respective university`s codes of conduct. Now, moments after Magill`s Saturday evening announcement, Scott Bok said that he too would be stepping down as Chair of the Board of Trustees at the university. In his statement, Bok writing, quote, \"Former President Liz Magill last week made a very unfortunate misstep.\" Bok eventually writes, \"following that, it became clear that her position was no longer tenable and she and I concurrently decided that it was time for her to exit.\" Bok also defending Magill, calling her a good person, a talented leader, and in his words, not the slightest bit anti-Semitic. Bok also sharing some perspective about what may have been Magill`s state of mind the day of this disastrous hearing on the Hill, saying that Magill was not herself at the time, that she was over-lawyered, that she was over- prepared, and that she provided a legalistic answer to what was a moral question, and that, Bok says, was wrong.

If you answered Baroque, you are \"baright.\" Baroque paintings are known for their dynamic, realistic portrayals of people, everyday life and religious scenes. A painting valued at $15,000 just a couple of years ago has now been sold at auction in London for nearly $14 million. You ask how? Well, it`s because that artwork has been identified as the work of the Dutch master Rembrandt. Adoration of the Kings, which depicts the encounter between the three wise men and the baby Jesus, has been virtually unseen since the 1950s. Originally, this painting was believed to be the work by a student or an artist close to the famous Dutch painter. But after further examination, the auction house says it`s actually the work of Rembrandt painted around the year 1628. All right, I want you to think of all the food scraps you and your family may have tossed into the trash this week. What if you could take all that waste and turn it into something useful? While sisters Amna and Hesa from the United Arab Emirates are doing just that, creating accessories from leftovers you might find in your kitchen waste bin. The fashion industry creates roughly 92 million tons of waste annually. Amna and Hesa`s eco business is part of a growing trend of designers using creative materials like industrial waste and coffee to chip away at the industry`s impact on the planet. But is it cost effective? Are these products durable? Let`s find out. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",
