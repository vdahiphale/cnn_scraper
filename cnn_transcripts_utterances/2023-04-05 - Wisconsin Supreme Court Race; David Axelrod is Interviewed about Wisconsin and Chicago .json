CNN now projecting that the Democrat backed Janet Protasiewicz will win the state supreme court race. That means liberals will now hold the majority on that court for the first time in 15 years. This has massive implications when it comes to abortion, elections and redistricting.CNN's Jeff Zeleny has been following this race very closely. Jeff, I mean, these results -- everyone's watching Trump's speech last night, but everyone else was also keeping an eye on what was happening in Wisconsin because the implications of this aren't just from abortion, they could span for the next 10 years of what Wisconsin looks like when it comes to their politics.",

And the state supreme court had a case before it to look at those results, and only by one vote did they come close to overturning those results. That was at the center of this race as well.But it was abortion rights that really was driving voters, we were told. We were out there a couple weeks ago talking to so many voters and politicians on both sides. And the state reverted back to an 1849 law that effectively banned abortion in nearly all cases after that Dobbs decision last year. So, this is one more example as we saw in the midterm elections last fall. And here again, abortion rights is still driving voters to the polls. But as you said, gerrymandering as well. Wisconsin is a classic swing state, but it's been sort of heavily controlled by Republicans in the legislature because of how those lines are drawn. All of that now is out the window because this race last night, $40 million spent in the supreme court race, the most expensive judicial race ever in the country.",

You might say, why is Wisconsin electing supreme court judges anyway? Well, it's actually one of 14 states, according to the Brennan Center for Justice, that directly elects its supreme court justices. It's just how it is done there and in many other states. And it did become a very -- it's a technically non-partisan, but practically it was anything but that. The Wisconsin Democratic Party through millions and millions of dollars into this. Republicans did not do as much on their side. But there were all these outside groups spending so much money.But this is going to have an effect on 2024 simply because of how rules are voting. The drop boxes where people are dropping off early ballots and things, those have been outlawed as well . Look for cases to come before the supreme court on that. So, this is why this was viewed as the most important race in 2023. And I do not think that that is an overstatement at all, Kaitlan.",

So, it isn't just a matter of policing, it's a matter of violence prevention and what you can do to reduce poverty in some of the communities in the city. So, you know, he represented that. He had, in the past, had talked - he had talked about defunding police, and really what he meant was shifting resources to mental health and some other areas that were being short changed.The issue is going to be, Brandon Johnson's never run anything larger than a classroom when he was a teacher, and now he's running the third largest city -- third largest city in the country. And that's a big jump. And we'll see how he deals with that. And the second is, how will the city's police react?
