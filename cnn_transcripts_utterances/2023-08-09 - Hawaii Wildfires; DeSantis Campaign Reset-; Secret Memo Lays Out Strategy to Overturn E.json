This is CNN NEWS CENTRAL. This morning, we are seeing for the first time new evidence that may be used against former President Donald Trump in the special counsel's 2020 election case. \"The New York Times\" has obtained this memo that has previously been secret. It was written by lawyer Kenneth Chesebro. He was named by prosecutors, you will remember, as Co-Conspirator No. 5 in the indictment, not -- unindicted -- in the indictment against Donald Trump, all of the co-conspirators so far unindicted. The internal memo spells out in detail to plot to overturn the 2020 election with the help of so-called fake electors, and it also gives new insight into how the plot would unfold and what they really wanted to do it as it was unfolding. CNN's Jessica Schneider is here with much more on this. Jess, lay out what new is learned in this memo.",

      "sentences": "Yes, Kate, this memo dated December 6, it's known to prosecutors. It will likely be a key part of this case.And it really lays out that even the man outlining this fake electors plot, Kenneth Chesebro, he indicates in this memo he knew it was far- fetched, knew it likely wouldn't get through the courts, but he kept pushing this plan. And it's clear in the memo that Chesebro really wanted to create confusion, in the hopes that those fake electors could in fact be (AUDIO GAP) real electors for Joe Biden on January 6. This was a plot that he planned to execute through the vice president, Mike Pence, in his role as president of the Senate. We obviously know that didn't happen. (AUDIO GAP) It's a six-page memo. He lays out the court challenges that were happening in the states. And then he even talks about the Supreme Court getting involved. He puts it this way, saying: \"Even if, in the end, the Supreme Court would likely end up ruling that the power to count the votes does not lie with the president of the Senate, Mike Pence, but instead lies with Congress, letting matters play out this way would guarantee that public attention would be riveted on the evidence of electoral abuses by the Democrats and would also buy the Trump campaign more time to win litigation.\" So, that was what this was about. This was about creating that chaos and confusion and then buying time, maybe past January 6 for Trump to win the election here. And, Kate, and all of this, this memo coming out at the same time that we're seeing this case about the 2020 election fraud really moving fast in the courts. We got word last night that there will, in fact, be that hearing on Friday morning 10:00 a.m. about prosecutors plan to restrict which evidence Trump and his team can share once prosecutors have handed it over. So we're seeing a very active judge in this case, Tanya Chutkan. She's taking control of this case very early in the process. We've already got our first hearing on Friday. We weren't expecting the first hearing until August 28, so things moving very rapidly. And now we're getting a glimpse at this memo, a key part of the prosecution case.",

Any time you're in the Wild Wild West, and there is new information, and you do not have the factual predicate that we have had in the past with this new notion, it suggests that you will be able to say:  I'm just opining about things. I'm evaluating this. The biggest issue, though, is going to be how and to what degree it was followed. Is there corroborating evidence to try to suggest that there was more than that, that the language inserted in the memorandum was not about trying to give an objective analysis and evaluation, but, rather, a blueprint to criminal conspiracy and otherwise criminal activity? But the big thing in terms of Donald Trump will be, Kate, of course, does this suggest that he actually saw this memo? Memos written between counsel does not necessarily mean that it actually got to the underlying client. If he was able to rely on it, if he was aware of it, if he saw it, if he heeded it and followed it precisely, or was it something floating in the universe? That will be part of what the burden of proof will be from Jack Smith and his team. But, again, that advice of counsel notion is going to be a part of it. And it sets up a really interesting antagonistic dynamic between Donald Trump's attorneys and himself, because the last thing you want is to have your attorneys testifying against you about what they really said, did not say, or about what you knew, because then that whole privilege issue of the attorney-client privilege really can be pierced more readily.",

One would think they will make similar arguments at trial to try to remove that privilege.Now, Laura, I want to go back to one thing you said, and I want to paraphrase both you and what is in this memo here. Basically, Chesebro writes, even if this gets overturned to the Supreme Court, even if it is not deemed legal, it buys us time. Does this case come down to the \"even if it's illegal\" part there, him saying -- admitting that it might get overturned, but it's still worth doing because it will obstruct the hearing?",

And they must make arguments that are sound, that are legally sustainable, and that might have some nuance to it and things that you could actually discuss with the court about the parameters, but you ought not to ever be making things just to simply buy time.It is unethical behavior on the one hand. And on the second hand, of course, if you have advised your client that there is something legally unsound or that it will not be sustained, not because it's something that you're not sure how the Supreme Court will rule or a lower appellate court or even the court before you in that instance, if you are already signaling that this does not have legal merit, but it can nonetheless be used to buy time and also to pique the interest of the electorate, that might fall under the conspiracy as alleged.",

And, on the other hand, you have the total electorate, in which people are not. And that's been the problem for the Republican Party for some time and for Republican candidates. If you cater to the base, you make yourself less electable in a general election environment. And I think this is a huge problem. And I don't know what the way out is. I mean, on the one hand, you can't win a general election if you don't get nominated. On the other hand, the things you do to get nominated may make it very, very difficult to win a general election.

And we, when we were losing some altitude in national polls, made donors nervous, made some other politicians who were supporting us nervous, and there were calls for my head and others. But we had a plan. The candidate was comfortable with the plan, and he was comfortable with the team. The DeSantis campaign, I mean, it is a bad sign when the -- all the news you make has to do with reboots and staff shakeups. That's generally a sign that your campaign is not on the right track. And, obviously, the polling reflects that. But, at some point, at some point, a rational question would be, is it the staff or is it the candidate? And you can't replace the candidate, so you replace the staff. We will see if that actually makes a difference for DeSantis. But I think he's got deeper problems than staffing. I think he's got message problems. I think he's got performance problems. I think he's got failed expectations problems. And we will see if he can come back from that.",
