They include obstruction of an official proceeding, that's because of the efforts to impede the certification of the 2020 presidential results on January 6, 2021, in Congress. The House Select Committee also recommending that Donald Trump be charged with conspiracy to make false statements, as well as conspiracy to defraud the United States of America.

This is a very big executive summary. Normally, they're 20 pages. This is 160 pages. But there are other people mentioned. There is a criminal referral, John Eastman, the conservative lawyer who came up with the plan and they tried to convince Mike Pence to delay the count. He is mentioned specifically. There were others mentioned like Jeffrey Clark at the Justice Department -- Rudy Giuliani. But the committee did something else. The words and others are throughout this report. And that is because they don't want to limit the Justice Department. They were not going to put out a laundry list of long names. They don't know everything. They don't know what the Justice Department has. But the point is, other people in Trump world who participated in what led to January 6 are on notice.",

So, it is notable that they want to single out John Eastman here, the former right-wing attorney and Trump attorney during the election, in saying the -- you know, others for the other people that they're including in this because they don't have the means the DOJ has, so it is notable, they want to single him out.",

You're not going to get any explanations about intelligence leading up to January 6, you're not getting any kind of full explanations about some of the other things that happened on the way there. But it's very clear that they feel fundamental. And I think Liz Cheney said this best that President Trump believed then and continues to believe now he's above the law and not bound by our Constitution.This is important because over the next couple of months, as the former president tries to fight various investigations, he has often tried to talk about executive privilege. He's often tried to say, well, I am the presidency. This will have reverberations going forward. This is not just sort of her making a snide comment, the former president, and I think it's sort of a good moment to pause and think about how we're going to hear this echo over the next couple of months because these investigations are not over.",

One, on the plus side, it is a bit of a roadmap. It's a resounding exclamation point at the end of the committee's work, it comes with the results of over 1000 interviews, hundreds of people who -- people who were interviewed and who they have detailed transcripts of their long interviews. And so that's great.But it also presents huge problems because many of the witnesses who might be essential to proving criminal charges resulted to some of these referrals may have also said things for instance, under interview that were favorable to the president or exculpatory to the president, or have other problems that might challenge their ability to testify completely and effectively as witnesses. So, the Justice Department has to go so much further on every single one of these people who is touched and interviewed and seen by the committee in any way, there is still a ton of work for them to do.",

And let's just also remember, this is just the beginning.We're going to get the full report, which I think is six or 700 pages, plus appendices and footnotes, plus transcripts and testimony on Wednesday -- Thursday coming out. So, while we heard about the criminal referrals today, I think that we will be hearing much more to Audie's point about security, intelligence. They did cover all those things in the report.",

There's all kinds of grounds for him to say, for instance, with incitement of the -- of an insurrection, to say, hey, this was a political process, I was engaged in political speech, that is some of the most protected speech by the First Amendment, I actually thought that the election there were -- there were irregular -- you know irregularities in it, and that I was simply pursuing my -- you know, my right to pursue the result of the election that I thought was true.Now, we can all sit here and say there's tons of evidence to show that didn't actually believe that.

These lives have been affected. Hundreds of people has faced charges from the DOJ.I think, for us, it's like legal theories still.
