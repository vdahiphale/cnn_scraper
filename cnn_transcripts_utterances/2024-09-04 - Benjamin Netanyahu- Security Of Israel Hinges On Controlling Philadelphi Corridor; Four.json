We'll begin this hour in Jerusalem where PrimeMinister Benjamin Netanyahu has addressed the foreign press just in the last hour, so striking a pretty defiant tone and doubling down yet again on the Philadelphi Corridor. This of course, off the back of new reporting that Israeli Prime Minister derailed the draft hostage and ceasefire deal in late July. A document obtained by the Israeli newspaper shows the Israeli Prime Minister introduce new 11th hour demands. The document confirms what CNN has reported that those demands include Israeli control of that Philadelphi Corridor. It is as we have been telling you on the show, as you can see there on your map, right at the end of that screen, it is a sticking point in the negotiations with Hamas. Here's what the Prime Minister said just a short- while ago. Have a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

We heard from the family of one of the hostages on the show yesterday. I want to bring in our Jeremy Diamond, who is in Jerusalem for us. And Jeremy, you were inside that room, you pressed Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on two occasions, but he seemed to me at least watching, pretty defiant, doubling down and saying he won't make any concessions on the Philadelphi Corridor.

The Israeli Prime Minister was certainly defiant tonight and sticking tohis guns in particular on this issue of the Philadelphi Corridor as he sought to come up with one argument after the next to try and justify his position, which we need to be very clear what that position is. And that is to say that the Prime Minister is saying that the Philadelphi Corridor is all important. He painted it almost as existential to the state of Israel, even though Israel hadn't captured that corridor for the first seven months of the war, even though the hostage families and a majority of the Israeli population wants to see a deal now, rather than remaining along the Philadelphi Corridor. And he is making clear that ultimately his demand regarding the Philadelphi corridor is firm, and it will not move even if that means that the hostages cannot come out alive in a ceasefire deal. But he also painted this as international pressure, but the reality is that so much of that pressure is coming from inside Israel, including from the families of those hostages. One of those is Aviva Siegel, a former hostage who I spoke with this evening, and I conveyed her message to the Prime Minister tonight. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

I'm telling you that if we relieve the pressure, if weget out of the Philadelphi Corridor, we're not going to get the hostages back. Certainly, we're going to condemn a lot of them to stay there. We could get a few out, they'll give us that, but they'll leave a lot with them. We won't have the pressure point and something else will happen, we will not be able to come back. So, we want released all the hostages, and we want to achieve the defenses that we must have to prevent more October 7th again and again and again. That is my responsibility. I can understand the torment of families. They don't -- you know, none of them believe that we'll get the hostages in the first batch either, many -- none of them, few of them, quite a few of them didn't believe it. And they came and they said you have to get them out, you have to get them out. You're not going to give them out. You have to make this concession or that concession, I didn't make those concessions and we got them out. So, it's very hard, you know, I don't stand in judgment of these tormented souls, because they're undergoing an agony that is hard to -- hard to fathom. And I understand that. But the responsibility of leaders is not merely to share the sentiment, the emotion, but also to exercise judgment, the correct judgment, to make sure that these horrors do not happen again. I believe that our strategy is the best way to achieve both goals. Both releasing, freeing the hostages and ensuring that Gaza never poses a threat to Israel again. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Much smaller of course, in comparison to what we saw at the weekend.

And that is ultimately where we have seen in multiple surveys, a majority of Israelis were at least 50 percent, I believe, believe that the Prime Minister is acting more out of political interests in the conduct of the war rather than in the interests of the country. That is certainly the belief of many of the hostage families of many of these protesters that we have seen out there. The Prime Minister pushed back on that notion tonight, insisting that it is a real security threat. And look, there is a reality here that, there is an understanding within the Israeli military, within the security establishment that the Philadelphi Corridor was being used by Hamas to smuggle weapons in. And that it is a security issue that Israel needs to deal with. But many in his security establishment, most notably, the Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, they do not believe it is more important than a hostage deal, and they also believe that contrary to what the Prime Minister said, that Israel could go back and recapture that Philadelphi Corridor, should a first phase -- should a ceasefire deal fall apart after the first phase, for example. Which the Israeli Prime Minister has very clearly signaled in the past, that he intended to resume the war until all of the goals are achieved, even if they are in the middle of a ceasefire agreement. And so, this notion that it is somehow now an existential threat when Israel didn't capture that corridor for the first seven months of the war. And he even suggested tonight that the hostages would be at risk because they could potentially be smuggled out of Gaza. We have seen no evidence to suggest that any hostages have been smuggled out of Gaza into Egypt. That is not a notion that has been raised before until this very moment as the Prime Minister is looking for pieces of information to try and make his case. Isa.",

Venezuela has seen a wave of unrest in recent weeks. We have followed it here. We've reported on it, followed, of course, by the brutal government crackdowns. This after President Maduro claimed a third term in office, despite criticism over the legitimacy of the election. Human Rights Watch has issued a scattering port (ph) today on that post- election violence, saying the killings as well as detentions are the worst the country has seen in years.

Well, unfortunately, we don't really know much else from what we were able topierce together this morning around the case of these U.S. active-duty service member who has been detained in Caracas on August 30. We know that he traveled to Venezuela sometime in the previous days, and he was detained in Caracas. The first question, of course, that the U.S. officials from both the State Department and the Department of Defense are still trying to answer is how and why he was able to travel to Caracas. What was the reason for him to travel there? Given that, as we know, he was there on personal matter, but also, given that as a U.S. citizen, you would need a visa to travel to Venezuela. So, it could be that this service member has also another passport from another country that does not require a visa to travel to Venezuela. This is some of the hypothesis that we're trying to follow in trying to bring you more news about this case. But just like you said, yes, this is a development that will for sure complicate the negotiations between Washington and Caracas. Just as Maduro's crackdown is moving ahead with brutal efficiency. Yesterday, I was able to speak with investigators from Human Rights Watch who reviewed analysis and they found that at least in 11 cases of killings in post-election violence in Venezuela last month, there was a direct involvement from state actors from the security forces, in that case, was National Guard of the Venezuelan. And so, you could see how Maduro is moving ahead with cracking down on dissent. The news about the Christmas is just another strategy that he's employing to try to restore the country to some sort of stability, to some sort of quiet and security, because he understands that dissent is very dangerous for his government right now. And of course, with one U.S. active service member in his hands, he has yet another card to play in a future negotiation with the State Department, the White House, something that surely will come up in the upcoming weeks and months as both the U.S. State Department, but also other countries in the region, Colombia, Mexico, and Brazil, are trying to mediate a solution out of that terrible crisis they were seeing in Venezuela.",

Currently, there's a $5,000 limit. She is proposing to multiply that by 10, $50,000 and essentially allow new businesses a little bit more flexibility in when they take that tax deduction. The goal is presumably to increase the number of startup businesses, increase their longevity. We don't exactly know how likely this is to become law. It seems to have some bipartisan support. There was actually a Republican version of much the same idea a few years back, and that bill, I believe, was expected to cost something like $2.8 billion dollars over 10 years. But that number is a bit dated at this point. So, that's number one. Number two, we don't know if she's going to talk about this today, but it has been leaked by her campaign, including to The Wall Street Journal, that she may pare back the Biden capital gains tax proposal.",

Where -- what do you think she needs to say, she needs to do to turn it around, because currently she's lagging when it comes to trust on the economy? RICHARD QUEST, CNN BUSINESS EDITOR-AT-LARGE AND CNN ANCHOR, QUEST MEANS BUSINESS:  I think the core is -- it's really nothing to do with the detail on the individual tax policies per se. These are highly technical. Yes, certain people who are in certain categories, it will resonate with them, if you are the sort of person who has that sort of salary and large capital gains. But you're probably not going to be heading in that direction anyway. The reality is, she has to show that she's not just a tax and spend Democrat. Because so far, we have a raft of spending proposals. We have a limited number of tax proposals. But as, Catherine -- you know, if I was to say to Catherine, you know, bearing in mind what we are expecting her to say today, the one thing she hasn't said, nor indeed has Donald Trump, is how am I going to pay for it? When you add up the promises being made versus the revenues that are going to take, or the lack of revenues thereof -- there we see the vice president -- then it becomes very difficult to pay for it all.",

Before we went to break, I was joined here in the studio -- I was joined, I should say, with Richard Quest and Catherine Rampell, both down the line. Richard, you and I were talking about job reports. I'm just going to ask, Catherine, you know, we are excited about I'm expecting to see some movement from the Fed. I think it's mid-September, 18th of September. How was that, Catherine? How do you think this plays in to this election?
