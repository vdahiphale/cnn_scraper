      "sentences": "Hello and welcome, I'm Max Foster in London.Just ahead, a last meeting between two world leaders, Joe Biden and Xi Jinping stress the need to maintain stability between the two great powers as Donald Trump waits in the wings. A super typhoon battering the Philippines, half a million people have been evacuated. And the U.S. president-elect's pick for defense secretary is embroiled in scandal just days after being named. Candid, constructive and wide ranging, that's how one U.S. official described the final meeting between U.S. President Joe Biden and his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping. Meeting on the sidelines of the APEC summit in Lima, Peru, the leaders agreed that A.I. should never be allowed to control nuclear weapons. President Xi said he hoped for continued stability and cooperation in the U.S.-China relationship. And Mr. Biden raised issues, including Taiwan, trade, the presence of North Korean troops in Ukraine, which he called deeply dangerous. For more, let's go to CNN's Marc Stewart. He's joining us now from Beijing. I think a lot of people watching will be very thankful to hear that robots won't be allowed to fire nuclear weapons.",

      "sentences": "Well, Max, this was a concern that the Biden administration talked about just recently. The point is that there is an agreement in place, or will be in place, that will prevent as you mentioned, A.I., robots, whatever the phrase you want to use, to make sure that there is human control, if there is ever a situation where nuclear weapons would need to be used.But that is one of the few deliverables, I guess you could say, from this meeting, because the big point of this meeting, especially for China, was to send a signal to the incoming Trump administration that China, in particular, values communication and stability that we have seen in this latter part of the Biden administration. It is a theme that's been emphasized here in mainland China, looking at the government readout, looking at some of the reporting that we're seeing in state media. Let's take a quick listen to some remarks by Chinese Leader Xi Jinping. Okay, we are having some trouble getting that sound in. But let me just say to you that some of the phrasing that Xi Jinping used was talking about the importance of preventing miscalculations and that there should be a need for responsible conversation between these two countries no matter what the differences may be. And that may be important phrasing as China enters a very unknown period with the Trump administration. At one point, President-elect Trump and President Xi Jinping had a very amicable relationship. They got together in 2017. You may remember that chocolate cake together in Mar-a-Lago. But then some very difficult issues came up, including trade issues, including China's response to COVID. If we look at where things stand now, there is diplomatic dialogue between these two nations under the Biden administration. We are seeing regular diplomatic visits. But, Max, you may remember it was just a few years ago after that balloon was shot down over the United States, that communication was cut off, communication did not occur, and that's something that China really does not want to see happen again.",

      "sentences": "Well, China is concerned in the sense that they reflect back to the first Trump administration when diplomats were lying awake at night wondering what was next. But, in a way, China is also trying to leverage this uncertainty to tell other nations that China is a stable power, a stable power, perhaps even more so than the United States, and that it may be worth having conversations with China.A big example of that was just recently at this gathering in Lima, Peru. We saw China and Peru unveil this big underwater seaport. Beijing contributed $1.3 billion. It is a way for China to show its global presence to say if you have projects, if you have infrastructure, China could be your partner. So, that is something that China will likely try to leverage regardless of whom is in the White House, Max.",

      "sentences": "Yes, Max, you're absolutely right. The island of Luzon, the country's most populous and actually the biggest island in the country, could very well see a lot of devastation. The typhoon is currently making its way to that area right now.And of course, Max, we also know that Luzon has experienced a lot of typhoons in the past couple of weeks. That's partly what makes Man-Yi so destructive and devastating, the fact that the country has seen four typhoons in the past two weeks, as you described. Now, we know that, of course, this is a cause really by warmer oceans, in part, because we're burning more fossil fuels and now we're seeing a lot of devastating climate change occur in real time. We're seeing things that we've never seen before. This is very unprecedented. And like the other typhoons before it, Max, Typhoon Man-Yi is just as destructive and very, very powerful. We've seen entire homes getting ripped apart, roads and power lines destroyed, and also trees uprooted, especially along the eastern coast of the country, which is where the typhoon made landfall on Saturday. In fact, the governor of Catanduanes, one of the areas worst affected by the typhoon, said in a statement on Facebook, quote, most importantly, we pray you do not forget about Catanduanes. We appeal for your power restoration teams, free calls and text booths, in kind donations, help and attention, especially after the typhoon leaves the country. Now, Max, in response to this typhoon, the government has evacuated more than half a million people. It also preemptively evacuated thousands, those living in the direct path of the typhoon and also in areas susceptible to landslides. Of course, landslides are devastating no matter when or where they occur, but the government has warned that these landslides could be more devastating, more destructive because these consecutive typhoons has made the land just that much more saturated. And also interestingly, Max, these consecutive typhoons is causing something called typhoon fatigue, according to local media. Essentially, residents in these affected areas and emergency workers on the frontlines are experiencing a lot of exhaustion, a lot of really just fatigue for, you know, dealing with these typhoons week in and week out. Imagine if you're a resident in these in this area and you have to live out of these shelters, you have to evacuate every single week. And for frontline workers, they come face-to-face with this. destruction, this devastation, and health officials have worried that they could experience burnout and potentially depression. So, of course, Max, this typhoon is making its way across the island of Luzon. So, unfortunately, for the Philippines, it could still see a lot of devastation up ahead. Max?",

Pete Hegseth's attorney says Hegseth paid the woman who accused him of sexual assault, but he denies assaulting her. The payment was part of a settlement that included a confidentiality agreement. Hegseth's attorney says the incident was a consensual sexual encounter.Hegseth hasn't been charged in any criminal case or named as a defendant in any civil lawsuit in connection with the incident. Trump spent Saturday night in New York at an ultimate fighting event. He was with several of his cabinet picks as well as Elon Musk and Kid Rock. Now, earlier in the day, Trump selected the head of a fracking company to be his secretary of energy. He's a man who's expressed doubt that climate change is linked to extreme weather.

Wright is the CEO of Liberty Energy, a company that services oil and natural gas exploration and production companies along with his wife. He is also a major Republican fundraiser. And he's also someone who does not necessarily believe in manmade climate change. In fact, he has said, there is no climate crisis. Of course, that is a belief that Donald Trump also holds, though it is notable given the department that he will oversee.He will also be named to the newly formed Council of National Energy. That will be chaired as well by Doug Burgum, the North Dakota governor, who is also named by Trump as his secretary of the interior. Even as Trump builds out his incoming administration, he continues to face questions about some of his picks that he has already made, including Matt Gaetz as attorney general. Gaetz is a figure who has many enemies on Capitol Hill for starting intraparty fights over the years. He is also the subject of multiple investigations into alleged sexual misconduct. And Trump remains steadfast in his determination to get Gaetz across the finish line, despite concerns that he cannot get the 51 votes in the U.S. Senate to be confirmed. A source telling CNN on Saturday that Trump remains, quote, 100 percent committed to seeing Matt Gaetz through and believes that he is one of the most important, if not the most important appointments of his cabinet. This source telling CNN he is not going to back off. He's all-in on Matt Gaetz. Steve Contorno, CNN, West Palm Beach, Florida.",

They were part of the trio that killed Trump's attempt in his first term to repeal Obamacare, along with John McCain, who, of course, has passed away. Trump can afford to lose those two votes. He can afford to lose a third vote. If the vote is 50-50 in the Senate, then J. D. Vance, as the president of the Senate, casting the vote. I think there are other senators who are not died in the wall Trump supporters, but have, as I was sort of saying before they're going to be much more reticent and directly challenging Trump, at least publicly.But I think one thing that's interesting, if I may say, is that if we look at the leadership election for the Republican leader, the stated preferences of the senators are somewhat different from the revealed preferences. And what I mean by that is that John Thune, who is a more moderate figure than Rick Scott, won the election in a secret ballot. And, of course, these nominations, these confirmation votes are not a secret vote. And I do think that if it was a secret ballot, Trump would probably lose a lot more of these confirmation votes than he will when it's on the record ballot, because the Republican grassroots voters who voted the primaries will be able to follow along and put pressure on their senators.",

      "sentences": "Well, this is actually a much longer standing tactic of the sort of conservative political movement in the United States. So, you can go back to the Reagan administration, when President Reagan installed people as the head of the Housing and Urban Development or in the Justice Department or in the Economic Opportunity Office who weren't really believers in what we might call the kind of founding mission of many of these departments was certainly felt these departments were much more proactive than they ought to be.Trump in his first administration also installed people whose personal politics often went against the sort of historic mission of agencies like, say, the EPA, the Environmental Protection Agency. And so we're seeing a continuation and an intensification of that. In the last administration, there was some internal pushback from career civil servants. And there are accounts of the first Trump presidency where career civil servants did, in some cases, seem to soft pedal some of the moves that were coming out from Trump and his closest advisers. This time, the Trump administration is going to be, I think, much more determined to root out internal dissidents as they would see it. And what that probably means is removing some of the employment protections that some civil servants have, or at least threatening that as a way of ensuring compliance with the mission of the agency heads.",
