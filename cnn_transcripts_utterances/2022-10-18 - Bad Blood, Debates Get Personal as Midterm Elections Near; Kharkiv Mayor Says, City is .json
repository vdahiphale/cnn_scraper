MIKE LEE (R-UT):  Yes, Joe Biden is our president. He was chosen in the only election that matters, the election held by the Electoral College. Now, as to whether there were errors, as to whether some states might have conducted their elections better than others, there's always room for debate and questions about that. SENATE CANDIDATE EVAN MCMULLIN (I-UT):  For you to talk about the importance of the Electoral College I think is rich. I think you know exactly how important it is, and I think you knew how important it was when you sought to urge the White House that had lost an election to find fake electors to overturn will of the people. You were there to stand up for our Constitution, but when the barbarians were at the gate, you were happy to let them in. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

These were rocket attacks.We know, according to the mayor, that at least two critical infrastructure facilities have been damaged. And it appears that one was particularly seriously damaged. It's being described as an energy supply facility. But from what we understand, it's basically like an energy plant that creates power but also is an important factor in creating heat for people's homes, which obviously is not a crucial thing at the moment, but certainly will be as the winter sets in and as the months get colder. We're hearing that two people were killed as a result of this morning's attacks. Not using drones this morning, as we're used yesterday, but the overall focus for the Russians seems to be very similar to what we have seen in the last week, and a day, the last eight days, really, which is a real laser focus on Ukrainian civilian critical infrastructure. We heard from the president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, earlier today in a tweet saying that 30 percent or more than 30 percent of Ukraine's energy facilities or energy plants have been seriously damaged or destroyed, even since October 10th, as a result of this new tactic. So, this is a very serious challenge for Ukraine's armed forces. It is one that they are doing their best to mitigate, but that is why you are seeing this kind of renewed call, as we heard from Zelenskyy last night, for more sophisticated air defense systems to help Ukraine try to stop all the -- they're already intercepting a lot of them, but even if just a few guess through, John, as you can see, it can create real problems here in the capital and across the country.",

And it's part of the reason why Haynes and other officials believe that Russia has been leaning so heavily on these Iranian-provided drones that they've used so effectively to strike Ukrainian energy infrastructure and terrorize Ukrainian cities.Russia is using these drones as kind of a replacement for some of these precision-guided munitions. As one western intelligence analyst put it to me yesterday, this is kind of a poor man's precision munition. But the other thing that Haynes went on to say yesterday that I think was really interesting was she said that the U.S. now believes that sanctions and export controls placed on Russia by the west are contributing to Russia's supply chain woes here, right? They believe at this point that not only is Russia burning through its stocks itself, it is also having a hard time replenishing some of these weapons because it can't get the components. And I want to share with you what Haynes said to us specifically yesterday, which was that export controls have forced Russia to rely on contraband chips where it can and frankly jury rig microelectronic components when no alternatives exist, steps that are probably leading to weapons and systems that are less capable.",

And Ukraine still remains incredibly vulnerable from there, in particular from these Iranian drones that, as we know, have killed four in Kyiv just yesterday.So, it's important that we don't read too much into Haynes' remarks, that we don't interpret them as suggesting that Russia is running out of bullets, so to speak, anytime soon, but they do indicate a pretty profound weakness in Russia's war machine.",

Trump, who looks to make a profit any way he can and always has probably could have made a profit without going so exorbitantly high, but doing that is just going to draw attention from people who engage in government oversight, which is something that he was, you know, never considered himself subject to even when he was as a private businessman.I don't know what can be done about this now in hindsight, but I do think it's something people need to bear in mind as Donald Trump looks to potentially become a candidate again.
