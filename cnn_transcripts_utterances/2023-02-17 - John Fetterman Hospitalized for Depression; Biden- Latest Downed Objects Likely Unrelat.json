This morning he is being treated at Walter Reid Medical Center after checking himself in for clinical depression. Fetterman's chief of staff says that it became severe in recent weeks, that he suffered with depression on and off throughout his life. There has been a complete outpouring of support for Fetterman from his colleagues on the Hill, as they are praising him for getting help and speaking publicly.

And he has still been recovering from it, something that is clear and his office speaks candidly about it. Our CNN congressional correspondent, Lauren Fox, is on Capitol Hill.

The president now saying that the U.S. intelligence community's current assessment is that these are likely just objects that are being used for research or recreational reasons or even scientific reasons and that they had no obvious ties to any other country's surveillance program. So clearly, the president trying to tamp down here on any speculation that these objects, of course, could be extraterrestrial, which the White House has actually gone out of its way to shoot down. And also saying that this -- these objects were shot down out of an abundance of caution, because they were flying at an altitude that could have been dangerous to aircraft.
