It's the scientists who get to make that decision, looking at all the evidence, spending months, sometimes years. And it's not supposed to work that one judge says no, I don't trust all those scientists. I want things done my way.So, if that decision, if the Texas judge decision had been allowed to stand, there's -- or if it is allowed to stand in the future, there is real concern. The pharmaceutical companies are going to say wait a second, why should we be investing billions of dollars in trying to get FDA approval when a single judge can just flip that around. That would impact their desire to try to, you know, research and do get more lifesaving drugs on the market and that would affect all of us, Erica.",

But because of the way the order is structured here we don't know exactly how the other seven voted. Only that five definitely did side with the FDA.So, Justice Alito wrote that four-page dissent. He talked about really two things. He talked about how the Supreme Court has previously been criticized for these kinds of stays. And he also tried to argue that there would be no harm if the restrictions went into effect, saying that, \"At present, applicants are not entitled to a stay because they have not shown that they are likely to suffer irreparable harm in the interim.\" But what's really interesting here is that the FDA did argue that there would be major harm if these restrictions went into effect. They said women wouldn't be able to fully access the drug. There'd be chaos because that there'd be confusion about the way it was administered. Justice Alito though disputed that that would happen and then even said that the FDA could just choose not to enforce these restrictions. He put it this way and he said, \"The government, the Biden administration, the FDA, has not dispelled legitimate doubts that it would even obey an unfavorable order in these cases, much less that it would choose to take enforcement action to which it has strong objections.\" So, Erica, in this four-page dissent, it was very fiery from Justice Alito. He dissented very forcefully. Justice Thomas just dissented, but with no writing. So, very forceful, but of course, a majority of the court, giving the FDA and the Biden administration what it wanted here tonight.",

Most of that messaging led by Vice President Harris, who's really been put out there, you know, as a surrogate on this topic.FMR. REP. MAX ROSE (D-NY): Absolutely. Look, it's a winning issue for the Democratic Party. It is very clear that even amidst economic trends that are against the party and even with President Biden not always having the most ideal polling numbers so long as -- I'm glad you find that funny -- so long as this issue is at the forefront, Democrats believe that they have a fighting chance in elections. But what is shocking amidst all of this, because that's very clear fact what I just said, it's the fact that the Republican Party continues to talk about this issue and continues to push extremist policies, particularly at the state level. And I think that is because their base is actually massively different than the majority of voters.

The Supreme Court doesn't want to be viewed that way. And so, this ruling is pretty consistent with that, with the sort of depoliticizing of the court of saying, let's just let the process play out. Let's preserve the status quo for now and see how this goes.When it comes to the politics of this issue, the challenge that Republicans have been faced with is that prior to the overturning of Roe versus Wade, if you asked Americans, for instance, do you think that abortion is morally acceptable or unacceptable? An awful lot of Americans say they're not really comfortable with abortion. They don't like it. They don't celebrate it, but at the same time would say, but let's allow Row versus Wade to stand. The falling of Roe put that as the central question. So, when somebody is thinking about am I pro-life or pro-choice, that question of do I like abortion or not, do I think it's okay, is less central to how they're thinking about that question. Now they're thinking, what do I think about the overturning of Roe versus Wade and these limits that may be going further than they were comfortable with on abortion throughout their states. That's where the politics of this have changed so dramatically and against Republicans at the ballot box.",

These are day to day decisions that young people in states for abortion have has been banned or making about, you know, what they're doing with their bodies and what is -- what they're comfortable doing. And that's now a decision that isn't necessarily in their own hands because lawmakers have stepped in and said that, you know, should something -- should you have an unexpected pregnancy or unwanted pregnancy, like that decision is not going to be up to you.

And so, the volatility of this issue is not going to change. It's going to keep going back and forth at extreme levels and the Supreme Court just does not want to be involved with it. And really, if there's going to be a challenge to an action of a federal agency, the court cannot get involved unless it's shown to be arbitrary and capricious. And so, whether they interpret the Fifth Circuit's ruling in that regard, is really going to be the big question here because ultimately, they can defer back and say we defer to the federal agency and whatever administration is in power at that point might dictate what that federal agency's decisions truly are. So, it really is quite significant what the court has done here in my mind in putting the power really back into the political process and outside of the court's hands in many regards.",

And I think now we're seeing a consistent effort to try to make some attempt to move it back in that direction that you just said.

That is now gone. And now you can no longer say well, I'm just going to defer to Roe, I don't like it, but it's there. Now, everything is on the playing field. And so, you had, for instance, somebody like Ron DeSantis who could say hey, I ran in Florida on a 15-week abortion ban and I didn't get punished for it. Actually, you can pass a law like that and it's fine. But there's a very different conversation when you're talking about a six-week ban.
