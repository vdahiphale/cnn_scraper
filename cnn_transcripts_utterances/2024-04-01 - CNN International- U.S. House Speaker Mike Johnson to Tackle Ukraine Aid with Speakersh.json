If you're just joining us, here are our top stories today.The Israel Defense Forces says it's withdrawn from Gaza's largest hospital after a two-week raid. The IDF says their troops have completed precise operational activity in the area of al-Shifa Hospital. But a witness at the hospital says, quote, it feels like a horror movie. This cannot be real. A new Palestinian Authority government was sworn in on Sunday. That's according to the Palestinian News Agency, WAFA. The new cabinet is led by Prime Minister Mohammad Mustafa, an ally of President Mahmoud Abbas. A federal judge set to sentence Alex Murdaugh today for nearly two dozen financial crimes. Murdaugh pleaded guilty last September to 22 federal charges that include conspiracy, fraud and money laundering. The former lawyer already is serving two life sentences for the murders of his wife and son. U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson says he expects lawmakers to move quickly on a package that includes aid for Ukraine when the House returns from recess. Johnson told Fox News the measure will include some important innovations. Aid to Ukraine is a divisive issue, though, amongst House Republicans, and how Johnson handles it could help determine whether he remains in power. Manu Raju has more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

      "sentences": "Mike Johnson, the Speaker of the House, could be the second House Speaker ever to be ousted by his own colleagues. That's if Marjorie Taylor Greene, the conservative congresswoman from Georgia, does move ahead to call for a vote seeking his ouster. And if he doesn't have the votes, defend it off.This was announced just before the House left town for a two-week Easter recess. But behind the scenes, Mike Johnson has been strategizing, trying to figure out how to avoid this ultimate fate. He thinks -- his allies think he can't avoid it. But there are some big decisions that are looming. One of them is how to deal with aid to Ukraine. Some Democrats say if he moves forward with aid to Ukraine, that will be actually enough for them to help him save his job. But Mike Johnson is debating trying to move a narrower Ukraine package, and some hard- right members are pushing him to offset that Ukraine aid package with spending cuts, loaded up with immigration measures, things that could put off Democrats. How will that play out, and will that ultimately lead to his ouster? All those things have been discussed behind the scenes. New reporting from my colleagues Melanie Zanona, Annie Greer, and myself details all of that. And I put the question to some Republicans, including one, Matt Gaetz, who led the ouster of Kevin McCarthy. If he would do the same with Mike Johnson, he made clear he's on Johnson's side, as he indicated that they've talked about this issue. REP. MATT GAETZ (R-FL): I would not support a motion of aid, Kate. I gave the speaker some unsolicited advice that we've got to get into a fighting posture, and I was very pleased with how the speaker received that advice.",

(END VIDEOTAPE) FOSTER: The people of Turkey delivered President Erdogan and his political party their biggest ever electoral blow on Sunday. Nationwide municipal elections. Voters reinforced the power of Istanbul mayor, Ekrem Imamoglu, and his opposition party as strengthening -- a strengthening political force, with most of the votes counted. Imamoglu said he is leading the election by a million votes. His Republican People's Party gained mayoral seats in 15 other cities. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) EKREM IMAMOGLU, ISTANBUL MAYOR/OPPOSITION CANDIDATE (through translator): The nation itself gives the order and the instructions, not just one person. Officials receive instructions from the nation. Period of one-man rule is over as of today. It is done. The Republican democracy to go full speed ahead from now on. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Not only has Erdogan's AK Party failed to win back major cities in this country, but it appears that they are on track to also lose some areas that had been considered strongholds.And perhaps the biggest blow of the night is right here in Istanbul, where people have come to celebrate the win of the incumbent mayor, Ekrem Imamoglu, a man who is widely considered to be one of the very few, perhaps the only opposition figure with the popularity and the strength to take on Erdogan in a general election. And not only has Imamoglu won re-election, but it appears that he has won it with a very comfortable margin. His party has even taken the district in Istanbul where Erdogan himself was born and raised. And Erdogan personally injected himself into this race. His face is on banners and billboards, he's been here for rallies as well. But also hanging over the country at the time in the dire situation of the economy, where inflation is out of control, interest rates have hit 50 percent, and people are really feeling it in their wallets. Now, President Erdogan is constitutionally barred from running for another term in office, but there are some loopholes which could allow him to run one more time. And if he does, he will now surely have a very formidable opponent in the re-elected mayor of Istanbul, Ekrem Imamoglu. Scott McLean, CNN, Istanbul. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
