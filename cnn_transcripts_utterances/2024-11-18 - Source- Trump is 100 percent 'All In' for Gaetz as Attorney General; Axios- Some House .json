And then he won not just the Electoral College, but he won the popular vote. So, now it's not clear to me that everyone that voted for him was voting for this. They may have just also been voting for old Trump. The, you know, pre-COVID nostalgia. One thing, just on the Matt Gaetz point, that I think one person to really watch through all of this is Mitch McConnell, because the Republicans only have 53 votes. So, if you take Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski and Alaska, so those are two that are not probably going to go for these MAGA people. If Mitch McConnell does not vote for these, then they have only one. Then it's 50-50. They have no margin for error. And he's going to be a really critical vote.",

One of the other things that the spokesman for the Kremlin, Dmitry Peskov, also said is he believes that this will escalate and deepen the West's involvement in the conflict in Ukraine, in the war in Ukraine. And, you know, one of the things that the Russians keep talking about -- the spokesman for the Kremlin, but also the spokesman for the foreign ministry -- is that Vladimir Putin has already said what Russia's reaction will be. And that goes back to about three weeks ago. Because one of the things we have to keep in mind, Kasie, is that Vladimir Putin has been trying to dissuade, publicly, the Biden administration from making exactly the decision that it has now made. And essentially, what Vladimir Putin said is that he believes that these type of weapons, of course, specifically speaking about the ATACM's surface-to-surface missiles, cannot be used. The targeting cannot happen unless with the help of specialists from the country where these weapons come from obviously, in this case, meaning the United States. And I want to read from you -- to you one quick quote of what Vladimir Putin said back then, because I think it's quite telling. He said, this will mean that NATO countries, the United States and European countries are at war with Russia, is what Vladimir Putin said back then. Now, they haven't gone that far yet. But one of the things, of course, that's also concerning is that the Russians have actually changed the nuclear doctrine of their country to specifically include a scenario exactly like that, saying that, if Russia is attacked by a non-nuclear country, using long distance means, like, for instance, missiles supported by a nuclear country, obviously meaning countries like the United States, that this could cause a nuclear reaction from the Russians. So, certainly, right now, the Russians very much up in arms publicly and saying that right now, for them, all options are on the table -- Kasie.",
