The U.S. House passing a bill that forces TikTok's Chinese owners to sell the app or face a ban in the United States. But that's a long way off, we'll explain. Ukrainian drones strike Russian oil refineries in one of the largest attacks since the war began. Investigators say Boeing is unable to provide crucial records tied to January's door plug blowout on an Alaska Airlines flight. And an Oscar ovation. The CEO of IMAX joins to discuss Oppenheimer praise, \"June: Part Two\" success and Asian expansion. That conversation and plenty more coming up. But first, the biggest fight in Washington today, not between Donald Trump and Joe Biden, it's actually between lawmakers who want to force a sale of TikTok in the United States and others who just want to leave the social media platform alone. For perspective, around 170 million Americans currently use TikTok and contained within that, of course, a lot of votes. Now, President Biden saying just last week he'd support a bill that could ban the app if its Chinese parent, ByteDance, doesn't sell it. Meanwhile, Former President Donald Trump, who picked the fight first, just to be clear, now making a big U-turn criticizing any potential ban. Now, despite Trump's opposition, House Republicans passed the bill by a wide margin on a rare bipartisan vote, but it's going to get much more complicated in the Senate, as Lauren Fox reports. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) LAUREN FOX, CNN CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): After a major bipartisan support in the House for a bill that could potentially ban TikTok, its next stop in, the U.S. Senate and the fate of its tens of millions of users in the U S. is not as clear cut. REP. DAN KILDEE (D-MI): This is one of those arguments, you could push either argument. FOX (voice-over): The House overwhelmingly passed their plan that would require Chinese parent company ByteDance to sell its popular social media platform or face a ban in the U.S.",

It's a point I brought up and a question to a spokesperson from China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Let's take a listen. As you well know, lawmakers in the United States are voting to possibly ban TikTok. Regardless of what they may decide, what is your response to feelings of distrust from American lawmakers and the American public toward Chinese companies? WANG WENBIN, CHINESE FOREIGN MINISTRY SPOKESPERSON (through translator): Even though the U.S. has not found evidence on how TikTok endangers its national security, it has never stopped going after TikTok. Such practice of resorting to acts of bullying, when one could not succeed in fair competition, disrupts the normal operation of the market, it undermines the confidence of international investors and sabotages the global economic and trade order.

For now, let's move to Russia's war with Ukraine. And Ukraine is on the offensive. A defense source says Ukraine has launched one of its largest drone attacks since the war began, hitting multiple oil refineries. This comes as Russian President Vladimir Putin threatens once again to use nuclear weapons if necessary. His pledge was made during an interview with Russian state media. He also boasted that Russia has the most modern nuclear weapons of any nation. Vladimir Putin also warned western adverse against further aggression towards Russia. And as Fred Pleitgen, explains president Putin says his country is in a strong position on the battlefield. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Moscow's troops claiming they're on the offensive releasing this video purporting to show Russian cluster munitions destroying three Ukrainian combat choppers, even though CNN cannot independently verify the authenticity of the video. Russian President Vladimir Putin in an interview with Kremlin-controlled media directly warning the U.S., don't send troops to help Ukraine, even though the Biden administration has never even come close to saying they do that. We know what American combat troops on Russian territory are, they are interventionists, he said, that is how we will treat it, even if they appear on Ukrainian territory. And Putin even taking his threats nuclear, saying Russia would have the edge of the U.S. in the war using atomic weapons, on land, in the air using strategic bombers, and at sea, with Moscow's powerful fleet of nuclear- armed subs. From a technical point of view, of course, we're ready for nuclear war, he said. The missiles are constantly combat-ready. Secondly, and this is accepted by everybody, our nuclear triad is more modern than any other triad. Actually, only us and the Americans have a triad. Struggling on the battlefield, Ukraine says it has hit Russian oil refineries, including this one just over 100 miles outside Moscow with long-distance drones. Putin calling this attempted interference in the upcoming Russian presidential election, he's set to win by a landslide. The main goal is to, if not disrupt the presidential elections in Russia, he said, then at least to somehow interfere in the normal process of expressing the will of citizens. Ahead of that vote, and after the death and burial of opposition leader Alexei Navalny, Navalny's supporters say the Kremlin's crackdown is escalating. The former head of Navalny's anti-corruption foundation, Leonid Volkov, assaulted and beaten with a hammer outside his home in Lithuania. While the Kremlin hasn't commented so far, Volkov blaming Putin for the attack. It was another obvious typical classic gangster hello from Putin from the St. Petersburg gangster. Vladimir Vladimirovich, hello to you too. What else can I say? Continue working against Putin. That's what needs to be done. Let's go on. And Lithuania's intelligence services believe the attack on Volkov was likely \"Russian organized.\" All this as the war in Ukraine continues and civilians bear the brunt of Moscow's full-on invasion, several killed and dozens wounded by Russian drone and missile attacks in the past.

JenniferHomendy is the head of the National Transportation Safety Board, and she says Boeing's lack of a paper trail is now hampering this investigation. Remember, the NTSB's preliminary report of January 5th incident said this, Boeing did not reinstall the four critical door plug bolts before this 737 MAX 9 was delivered to Alaska Airlines. The bolts were removed at the Boeing factory in Renton, Washington for corrective work on another part of the plane. But now, the NTSB says Boeing has not been able to produce the paperwork that details that work. Here is what Homendy says in her new update to the senators on the committee overseeing aviation. He says, the absence of those records will complicate the NTSB's investigation going forward. She also underscored that Boeing has been unable to locate the security footage of that work. Boeing has responded, saying, it supported the investigation from the start and it will continue to do so.

Investigators in NewZealand have now recovered both of the black boxes from LATAM Airlines Flight 800. That's a Boeing 787, so another Boeing plane, experienced this mid-flight drop on Monday, powerful enough to injure 50 passengers. This This is really key, this account from one passenger who tells CNN that one of the pilots on his way out of plane told this passenger that the cockpit displays went dark leading the pilot to briefly lose control. The flight data recorder here will be key and it can show the air speed, the altitude, the position of controls, even the positions of switches. So, that will really give a lot of unvarnished insight into exactly what took place here because there are some pretty big questions about what precipitated this. The initial thought was that this could have been a severe turbulence issue. But now, investigators, of course, will want to know if this was a problem with the flight controls, if there was with a problem with autopilot. It does take some time to get to the bottom of that data. It is a lot of raw data. And so, in some cases, they ultimately need to send it here to the U.S. for it to be analyzed. We will see. They've only just gotten the Flight Data Recorder and Cockpit Voice Recorder just today. And so, now, they really need to go through this and figure out exactly what went wrong, but there will be some key clues in it.",

Now, this was an expensive breakup. At one stage, a Morgan Stanley analyst estimated the Yeezy line contributed up to 40 percent of the company's profits, and the strategy on how to deal with it was pretty foggy. First it suspended sales, then there was a plan to sell the sneakers without the logo before deciding it would sell the brand with the logo with a significant amount of the proceeds going to organizations combating discrimination. And it made Adidas some money too. Yeezy managed to contribute more than $300 million to the company's operating profit last year according to Wednesday's earnings report. Adidas also suffered from a huge tax bill last year and a sharp decline in sales in North America, which it expects to continue into this year. The Yeezy debacle didn't help those sales, but there is also a broader demand problem at play with Nike facing similar issues. In fact, Nike recently announced it would be paying off around 2 percent of its workforce. Some good news in China though, sales increased 8 percent last year and Adidas expects it to hit double digit growth this year.

Could there have been another type of an amendment that can come into this? Absolutely. But at the end of the day, I've got to listen to my constituency, who's ultimately who I respond to, and many of our constituents who we've spoken to when we talked about the banning of this Chinese platform was very much in favor of it. So, I can't speak to other districts or other states, or even for the president himself. I can only speak for my constituency, who elected me to represent them.",

But this has been apattern of abandonment, if you will, dating back to 2021 during the botched Afghanistan withdrawal, where Congressman Ronny Jackson had reached out to us from Texas 13 to rescue a mother and three children who were Amarillo, Texas, natives who had been trapped. And we eventually, after the State Department and others trying to thwart our efforts, conducted the very first successful rescue out of Afghanistan. Fast forward to October of 2023, many nations had sent planes in to rescue people from Ben-Gurion Airport in Israel. The only problem was America wasn't one of those. And so, again, I saw where there was a lot of Americans who were calling in panic, many who were sleeping in fallout and bomb shelters, and some who had lost their lives, unfortunately, are now even still hostages. And so, I went in October 11th, only days after the barbaric attacks on October 7th, and was able to successfully rescue over 255 Americans. Now. here we are again, the geopolitical failures, the failures in the failed State of Haiti, where people like Jimmy Barbecue Cherizier, he was able to grow the G9 and family gangs to be able to be this violent cohort who is now the de facto leadership, in many ways, with the prime minister resigning and most of the government being in Puerto Rico. And so, again, Americans were at risk. Americans were begging the State Department for help. Mitch Albom and his group with Have Faith Orphanage, had been asking the State Department, please come help us, help us do something. And they said, we're in the midst of planning. What they didn't say is they were in the midst of planning their own evacuation. The people they were in contact with have now evacuated themselves out of the country and have left them behind. And so, at that point, we do have to step up. And again, I do believe in my job and my duty to protect and secure Americans, I don't care who they vote for or what party affiliation, you know, what their job is, I care about the fact that there are Americans who are in help, and I always want to come to the need of those who are in help.",

Now, some of you might remember earlier this week \"First Move\" explored the plight of marginalized workers in Nepal. The Harawa-Chawara have been forced to work the land for landlords for generations Trapped by loans with extortionate interest rates, keeping them in debt. Now, the Nepali government officially freed them in 2022. But without financial relief. In a moment, we're going to talk to one of the organizations helping them. But first here's one little girl who's celebrating her freedom today. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator): When the Harawa-Chawara were liberated, I got the chance to attend school regularly. I study and I play at school. I also attend a tuition class. I feel very happy. Happy Freedom Day. (END VIDEO CLIP) Nick Grono is the CEO of the Freedom Fund, an international organization working to end modern slavery. Nick, great to have you on the show with us. What we saw and what I've read and we saw, I think, earlier this week, was that the government banned bonded labor, what, 20 years ago, and we saw the banning of the debts as well in 2022. But actually, to leap to something new and to get a new business or a new alternative livelihood requires support, it requires financial access, and it requires education, and that's where you come in.",

But there's a big, big difference between a declaration and real action.

So, you know, we're a channel to fund organizations.
