The storm is forecast to continue moving north and dissipate over central Nevada where there's already a state of emergency. And here you can see a roadway collapse near Los Angeles as flash floods inundated the area. San Diego's mayor says this amount of rainfall could be too much for his city to handle. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TODD GLORIA, SAN DIEGO MAYOR: We're not used to this level of precipitation generally, certainly not in the middle of summer in August. We're not built for this kind of rainfall. That's my main concern. Both the high winds that could pose challenges for our power lines and the ability to get energy to the homes of our residents, as well as the potential for flooding. We have positioned assets and personnel there to make sure that we can address it. But with what we're expecting, it may overwhelm us.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) KYUNG LAH, CNN U.S. NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: San Diego's mayor says the city is simply not built to handle a tropical storm Hilary. So what this city has been doing is trying to prepare the best that it can. What you're seeing throughout this area of Mission Valley is main thoroughfares like this one completely shut down. The reason for these barriers is because the street behind me. This is an area, if you are familiar with San Diego Mission Valley, that is a known flood zone. There is a San Diego River over there. And then all of the hills you see some of the desert area, all of that funnels down here into the water and the infrastructure needs to hold what the mayor has said is that there's approximately 3 to 4 inches that have already come down and expected over the next 24 hours, 3 to 4 times that much. That's why the San Diego Unified Public School District has delayed the start of school by a full 24 hours. It was scheduled to start on Monday. That will push by one day. The Navy, in fact, has moved 10 of his ships out of the bay further into the sea to try to protect those 10 vessels just in case the storm were to create any sort of damage. But what the city has seen so far is that it has been able to withstand tropical storm Hilary, the rain still coming down. It will be very much what happens in the overnight hours.

Governor Josh Green saying yesterday 1,050 people remain unaccounted for. He said that many of them will never be recovered.So as we stand overlooking the town, we were seeing clouds of dust coming up from some of the heavy machinery and it's so heartbreaking to realize that dust holds people's children and parents and neighbors and loved ones. And how do you get a sense of closure in this particular space? This will be a sacred space for so many, for so long, 3.5 square miles of area burned. The president is expected to fly over Lahaina. It's uncertain whether he'll actually touch down on the ground. He's expected to meet with first responders and victims of this disaster. He of course is known as an empathizer in chief given the tragedy in his personal life, but he uncharacteristically gave a no comment when asked about Hawaiians, a few days ago. The White House insists he's been on the phone hourly almost making sure that everybody gets the resources they need. But this is really an emotionally charged time, so many tender emotions right now. And so the president is sort of walking into that. As for the future, so much of that depends on sort of ancient fights over water rights in particular. So that's at the top of mind of people who say that the water that could have kept this place lush and fireproof, was diverted to resorts and rich homeowners at the expense of locals.

POLITICAL ANALYST: The mold is cut. I mean, we know that in the Republican primary context, Trump has been able to convince most GOP voters to see all of these indictments the way he wants them to see it as a deep state attack that is really aimed at them through silencing him. The, you know, the question of what this looks like if he becomes a Republican nominee and actually gets to the general election, I think is very different. You know, we have a lot of polls that show warning lights for him in terms of how the public is responding to that. The overall picture is somewhat muted now because voters are indeed reluctant at this point to say they want four more years of Joe Biden as well. But when you have a majority of independents consistently saying they believe he committed a crime or that his actions threaten democracy, that is a warning signal for Republicans if they go forward with him as the nominee and certainly he has an enormous lead right now.",

It's pretty clear from all of this polling that what they are doing is not working. By and large, with the exceptions of people like Chris Christie, and Asa Hutchinson, and Will Hurd on the periphery of the race, the Republicans are making the same fundamental choice as the other candidates did in 2016. They are not going after Trump in any real systematic way, and they are hoping somehow something happens to cause his support to melt away, and they will be there to pick up his voters if they are not, you know, tarred as someone who challenged him too hard.
