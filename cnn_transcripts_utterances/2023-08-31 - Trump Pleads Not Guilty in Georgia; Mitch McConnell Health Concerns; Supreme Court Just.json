We begin with breaking news from the Supreme Court, two of the High Court's justices disclosing new details about paid trips they took, just moments ago, Justice Samuel Alito acknowledging a trip to Rome back in 2022 paid for by a conservative group. We have also learned that Justice Clarence Thomas disclosed private jet trips and a vacation paid for by a Republican megadonor.

That's the case that reversed Roe v. Wade. That leak happened on May 2. I believe the trip to Dallas that's in question here was on May 12. And Justice Thomas said that he had been encouraged, advised to take private jets when possible or private travel, rather than commercial. Now, I don't know if the other justices are doing that. I do know that he had at many other times, though, taken this travel from Harlan Crow, but it does raise the question of the justification from Justice Thomas' lawyer.",

He talked about the Senate map and what's going on in the races in 2024. So it was really business as usual. I can also tell you that I was with him the day before yesterday at a lunch. And he spoke to a fairly large crowd, he took their questions for 15 or 20 minutes and opined on a wide range of topics. I have seen him a number of times throughout the month of August. He's had no impairment. He's made speeches, he's answered questions. He's met with reporters. He's met with constituents. And I have been there for a fair amount of this.

S.E., I want to bring you into the conversation, the video certainly reigniting these questions and the debate about whether there should be term limits. Let me read for you for a moment a tweet. Representative Dean Phillips posted this on X. He said: \"For goodness' sake, the family, friends and staff of Senators Feinstein and McConnell are doing them and our country a tremendous disservice. It is time for term limits for Congress and the Supreme Court and some basic human decency.\" Do you agree? How do you see this? S.E. CUPP, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR:  Yes, I think there are a lot of good reasons for term limits and age limits, most of which having to do with government accountability, most of which are because voters deserve the best, but also to protect the legacies of these lions of the Senate, in the case of Senator McConnell and Senator Feinstein. Whatever you think of them, they're really well-respected in their parties. And what we're talking about now, at the end of their very long, illustrative careers, are whether they are capable of doing their jobs. We're talking about their mental faculties. We're talking about their competence. That's not how I think either of these people should go out. And term limits, in a way, protect them from having to endure these really public, humiliating, degrading, embarrassing, and from a viewer's point of view, alarming public episodes.",

McConnell, by the way, was elected in '20. He's up again in 2026. I don't think he's made any announcements about 2026. I do agree, by the way that in the 2024 election, we're going to have some conversation about the age of our national leadership. It's obviously front and center for the Biden campaign.

Most notably, yesterday, his -- former Trump lawyer Sidney Powell also entered in a not guilty plea. But a significant moment here in this case, as Trump saying -- entering a plea in -- against these charges in Georgia, where he and these others are faced with a broad array of charges, this conspiracy, this RICO case in Georgia that essentially accuses him and 18 others are trying to overturn the 2020 election results in that state. So, we're going to have to just wait and see how this ultimately affects plans for a potential trial going forward. We know that there are some other co-defendants, like Trump's former White House chief of staff, Mark Meadows, who are trying to get the case moved to federal court, so a lot of moving parts still at play, but still a big moment in this case, as Trump formally entering a not guilty plea.",

And we're also seeing an effort by Donald Trump to distance himself from the other defendants in this case. His lawyers have already made clear that he doesn't, that the former president, in most cases, doesn't even know some of these defendants. Now, that doesn't really matter in the context of the legal -- the Georgia legal -- the context of Georgia's RICO law, but Trump really trying to make this both a political calculation and a legal calculation, as he stares down a very busy calendar here in the next few months. He's going to face a ramping up of his primary campaign in the Republican primary, at the same time facing four different legal cases, where he's going to have to appear in court both on the federal level and at the state level in Georgia.",
