The video that you see here shows rebel groups who've reportedly now reached the northern countryside of Hama amid escalating violence and of course, that rising civilian death toll. The U.N. says at least 44 civilians have now been killed in fighting between rebel and government forces after a lightning advance by rebel groups erupted in the north of the country last week. Syria's reignited civil war has displaced nearly 50,000 people. And just to give you a sense of where things stand, as you look at the map here, large parts of the -- of Aleppo and Idlib provinces, those areas in green are in rebel hands. Everything in pink is still controlled by the Assad regime. But we are of course following what may change, what could be happening at this point scene. CNN's Ben Wedeman tracking all of these developments for us. So I know it can be difficult to get some of the information at this point. What are you learning though from your sources, Ben, in terms of where things do stand right now?",

      "sentences": "Yeah, Erica, it's always hard to know what's going on when you're not actually there, where the things are happening. But what we're seeing is that the rebels led by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham that formerly affiliate of Al- Qaeda have, continued to consolidate their gains and are pushing down in the direction of the central city of Hama.Now since last Wednesday, they've basically more than doubled the amount of territory they control in Syria, grabbing most of it from the Assad regime. However, some of it from U.S. backed Kurdish militias as well. Now, yes, as we've been reporting, they are north of the city, the central Syrian city of Hama, perhaps as close as eight kilometers or five miles to the north of there. Now, this city is particularly important strategically and symbolically because back in 1982, the father of Bashar al-Assad, Hafez al-Assad surrounded the city, the forces led by his brother Rifaata and basically killed conservatively at least 10,000 people who were caught in an uprising by the Muslim brotherhood. So in Syria where people's memories are always fresh, there are clearly a lot of people in that city who are not loyal to the regime of Bashar al-Assad and would happily see the rebels come in. So certainly, if the regime in Damascus loses control of that city, it will be yet another massive symbolic blow. But it does appear that their real priority at this point for the regime is to control the area around the capital, Damascus and the Mediterranean Coast, which is the traditional heartland of the Alawite majority to which President Bashar al-Assad belongs.

And Europe is bracing for a Trump Administration that despite obviously some ambiguity around their Ukraine policy is clearly looking for a way out. So look, on the one hand, we do have this level of urgency when it comes to more weapons, that $725 million aid package from the U.S. as they try to sort of front load all of this aid while they still have time.Germany has also this week announced new air defense systems. The elephant in the room, of course, for Ukraine is their key demand, this key tenet of Zelenskyy's Victory Plan that they want, a formal invitation to NATO advancing beyond what they currently have, which is this language around irreversible path to NATO, their future being in NATO. The Secretary General of NATO side stepped that. But on the other hand, he is looking for Ukraine to be strengthened as much as possible. This is the refrain that we heard over and over again. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MARK RUTTE, NATO SECRETARY GENERAL:  What is necessary now is to make sure that military aid will go to Ukraine because that is now crucial for them. Two, if they decide to do so, enter into talks with the Russians one day, they will do this from a position of strength. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

They want to try to strengthen Ukraine as much as possible, just in case. Of course, when the Trump Administration takes office, they try to push things towards some kind of ceasefire and negotiated settlement.I think the other sort of part of this here is that Mark Rutte, the Secretary General of NATO, he met with Donald Trump less than two weeks ago at Mar-a-Lago and we got some insight a little bit from his comments today, on his views on the incoming Trump Administration. He offered some hints that he wants to just sort of leverage Trump's success in the past at getting NATO members to spend more. He said 2 percent is not enough, but he's also trying to persuade the U.S. to keep up its support for Ukraine by talking about Russia's burgeoning alliances with North Korea and China, and how that feeds into sort of the big picture of global security. He said any deal that we reach with Ukraine has to be a good one. He said we don't want any high-fiving Kim Jong-uns or Xi Jinpings thinking about what they could do. So this is an argument we've heard before, but clearly NATO and Ukraine's allies trying to pull all the levers they can with so little time left with the current administration.",

He's made it clear, by the way, this is a really important point, that in his view, that position of strength, that refrain that we constantly hear from Ukraine's Western allies, that does involve the invitation to NATO, which of course there's no sign that he's going to get as of yet. He also wants, of course, more long-range missiles and other types of weapons.And then obviously, the big evolution that we heard, he said it in an interview last week with Sky News and again in a press conference over the weekend, was that he sort of foresees a situation where a NATO umbrella could cover the non-occupied parts of Ukraine and then once that was in place, they could try to use diplomacy to win back the rest. So that is new, but of course, there is the sort of hard truth here that Ukraine isn't in a position of strength right now. Russia is moving forward on the frontlines. They've clearly shown an appetite to escalate with that medium-range ballistic missile launch several weeks ago. And the wildcard from the Russian perspective is that while Ukraine is on the back foot, they have no incentive to come to the table when it comes to negotiations. So that is something that Ukraine's NATO allies will also be grappling with.",

He met this morning with the country's President Lourenco and said that the U.S. is all in on Africa. It comes as the U.S. has really increased their investments in some ways in Africa.Since Biden has become president, there is a major railway corridor called the Lobito Corridor that the U.S. and other European allies have invested in to try to get critical minerals transported from interior Africa into the Western ports. But it comes at a time when China has made significant inroads in Africa with hundreds of billions of dollars in investments into infrastructure projects, really leaving the U.S. and others to catch up with the influence that they've had in this country, in this continent. But, for President Biden a bit later today, he will be speaking at the National Museum of Slavery, a moment his aides say will really highlight the ties between the U.S. and Angola, but also remarks that will focus on the horrific history regarding slavery. There were many enslaved Africans who were taken from Angola and shipped to the U.S. in the 1600s and then continued on after that. So that is something President Biden will try to address. But overshadowing this trip is that news about his decision to pardon his son, Hunter Biden. He, in two various instances today, was in front of reporters. He completely ignored questions relating to the pardons and so far has really maintained his silence amid Democratic criticism about this decision. Here is a sample of how Democratic lawmakers have been responding upon Capitol Hill. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN.

And now, we also are seeing the fruit of that bear out in his early movements as President-elect. Just think about everything he has done in the past three weeks, geared at foreign policy. He has threatened Mexico and Canada with tariffs. He has dined with the Prime Minister of Canada at Mar-a-Lago. He has spoken with the Mexican president and kind of got into a little bit of a dispute over what exactly the two sides could do going forward on immigration and trade. He has spoken with the Ukrainian President Zelenskyy. He recently, actually yesterday, threatened that there will be \"hell to pay\" if hostages in Gaza are not released by the time he takes office. He has hosted the Argentinean President at Mar-a-Lago. He has threatened China and Russia with a hundred percent tariffs if they create their own foreign currency to challenge the dollar.

Hegseth is on the Capitol Hill meeting with Senators, trying to get support from 54 of them to be confirmed. But look, Donald Trump has also put forward Robert F. Kennedy Jr. who makes some Republicans uncomfortable with his pro-choice stances. He has someone in -- that he has elevated to Director of National Intelligence in Tulsi Gabbard, who also makes quite a few Republicans nervous because she has been so critical of U.S. spy agencies. And obviously, the Matt Gaetz pick was one where he was forced to ultimately retreat. It will be interesting to see going forward, whether or not Hegseth facing a lot of -- and stacking allegations, ultimately continues to get the support of the President-elect. Right now, he seems to, but there's also these other picks out there who make Republicans uncomfortable. At the end of the day though, I will say we have seen Republicans time and time again, voice some concerns about Donald Trump and the people he surrounds himself with and the policy he pursues, but then ultimately get in line.

Just a few hot spots left.I was in Pakistan recently, which is one of those places, saw the polio workers firsthand trying to bring this to an end. There used to be a thousand kids a day who were disabled or died from polio around the world. And now, there's hardly any at all because we're making these polio vaccines available and people can participate in that. As you said, $22, a hundred polio vaccines. You can be part of history eradicating polio from the whole planet.",

The details just ahead.(COMMERCIAL BREAK) HILL:  We are following some breaking news just into CNN. South Korea's president declaring emergency marshal law, addressing the nation just moments ago to say the move is necessary to counter threats posed by North Korea's communist forces and to eliminate anti- state elements. Again, this is just breaking, coming into us here at CNN. We're going to continue to follow this. We're bringing more of those details as we have them. We're also following some developments out of Paris, just into CNN, where we are learning that Delta Airlines is now refusing to bring that Russian stowaway back to the U.S. The 57-year-old woman was taken into custody, of course, after a Delta flight from New York landed in Paris last Tuesday. French authorities then put her on a plane back to the U.S. She was kicked off that flight though for being unruly. So this time, the plan was six marshals set to bring her back on a New York bound flight earlier this hour. But now an airport source says Delta is refusing to fly her. CNN's Anna Stewart joining me with details. This is the story that frankly, Anna, I can't get enough of. (LAUGH)",

She did get on the flight, but Delta has refused to fly her and that means that this time there are seven free seats as I make out, six air marshals were meant to be with her and of course, the Russian stowaway herself, which means she is still in Paris' Charles de Gaulle Airport where she has been since Tuesday. She has had a full week there. She's obviously not allowed to enter the country because she didn't fly there legally, Erica.",
