And when that happens, you've displaced an awful lot of water. That displaced water makes its way onto the shore as that tsunami. So for now, with the tsunami warning being canceled, there are tsunami warnings, they are gone. They were here earlier all the way from Oregon, all the way down to San Francisco. It was still a big quake. There's still going to be some damage here on land, even though the good news is most of the shaking did happen offshore. Now, we're still going to see some significant shaking with this because there will be aftershocks as the afternoon goes by. We've already had a couple of fives, not as big as a seven. And there's typically about 15 sevens per year worldwide. They're typically just not so close to land that this one was. So tsunami warning is done. There was no indication that a wave was generated. Now, we saw the pictures earlier in Crescent City. The helicopter was there, and you could see the boats coming back into the harbor. And that's when I knew. I said, oh, this is going to get canceled any time now, because the boats already know. The boaters, the sailors, they already know it's time - it's okay for them to come back and that's what we finally have now. Just about three minutes ago, that tsunami warning was canceled officially.",

Most of the time, an aftershock will be a smaller earthquake. But what happens when you have an earthquake of this size is that it tends to redistribute stress on all the other faults that are in the area. And some of those faults on which the stress gets redistributed will have an increase in stress that will induce another earthquake.So some of the earthquake faults could get better in the region very close to where the rupture occurred, but also in some of the other faults that are in maybe even onshore could have earthquake activity, smaller earthquakes. But because they might occur on land, would be more damaging to the buildings that are above them.",

Right now he has determined that he is going to be by Hegseth's side. He called him this morning. He offered his support. Obviously, very different than what we saw when Matt Gaetz was in the running for attorney general. And he called him and told him he didn't have the votes in the Senate, and then Matt Gaetz withdrew his name.Now, part of that confidence, I'm told, is because none of these senators have been telling Donald Trump or the teams around him that they are a hard no, that, yes, they are hearing these concerns about Hegseth. But no one has said that they will adamantly not vote for Hegseth, meaning that Donald Trump and his team still see a pathway to confirmation. Now, just a few moments ago, we heard from Hegseth, who essentially is vowing to fight and continue to stay in this process. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) PETE HEGSETH, TRUMP'S PICK FOR DEFENSE SECRETARY: You fight, you go do tough things in tough places on behalf of your country, and sometimes that changes you a little bit. And by the grace of God and my Lord and Savior, I had an opportunity to come on up out of it and do great things with great veterans organizations that fought for vets, that fought for reform at the VA, and for war fighters, and at the Fox News Channel to advocate for those very same causes. And I'm proud of what I fought for. I'm not going to back down from them one bit. I will answer all of these senators' questions, but this will not be a process tried in the media. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Now, the other thing that I've heard from these sources is that while Donald Trump is standing by Hegseth, they acknowledge that that could change at any time.One of the things that could change his support for Hegseth would be another onslaught of media reports, including more allegations of potential sexual harassment or drinking. So far, they have seen this drip, drip, drip of information. Donald Trump has seen all of these media reports and has decided that he will continue to give his support to Hegseth. But there are a lot of people around Donald Trump who believe that he would likely pull that back if there are more allegations or even more serious allegations. Remember, one of the things that Donald Trump's team told Hegseth after that report that revealed that 2017 sexual assault allegation was that they didn't want any more surprises. Obviously, they have seen the media reports in recent days coming out that just have started to pile on when it comes to these various allegations against Hegseth.",
