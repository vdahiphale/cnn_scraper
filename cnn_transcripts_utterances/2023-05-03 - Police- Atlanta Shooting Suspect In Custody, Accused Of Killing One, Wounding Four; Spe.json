There are police cars behind the gates as we speak. We know that because we were following them as we arrived. We were about five minutes down the road and we saw a police car zooming by us. We then followed them. We came here. A police officer was sitting right outside here. I asked him what's going on inside. He told me, we have apprehended the suspect and he is alive. There was no shootout. It appears that he surrendered peacefully. About an hour ago, there were about a hundred police officers and SWAT vehicles about five minutes in this direction next to Truist Park where the Atlanta Braves play baseball. The Braves are playing on the road tonight. It was very quiet in an area. The area is called the Battery. There are shops, there are restaurants, there are theaters next to the baseball stadium. It was full of SWAT vehicles and police officers looking for the suspect. Earlier in the day, the car that is believed that this man hijacked was found in a parking lot in the Battery area. Police then asked employees in the office where the car was parked if they saw the man, they said they do not see the man. A woman I talked to who worked in the office tells us the officer told her we have video from a camera nearby that shows him leaving the car and walking through an apartment complex, which is right next to us. Apparently, he walked through the complex here, crossed this very busy street in Cobb County, Georgia, a county with a population of 670,000 northwest of Atlanta, as I said, and is now apprehended inside this fence. We're waiting for him to come out, but it appears that this chase for this man, looking for him is all over. He is under arrest -- Anderson.",

And at some point, he became agitated on the inside and started shooting inside this complex. There were nurses and patients who were running for their lives. They were locking doors. And they were immediately aware of the situation. Now, while you can see that APD was able to put out a great description photo of this man, they tried to shut down all the parking lots in the nearby area so he could not get out of here. And then we learned, he did carjack someone, and that carjacking took place while he was rushing toward Cobb County. All along, all day long, we've been talking to our sources just about what they did to try to minimize this shooting scene in terms of just the impact of it all. There were dozens of people who were calling 9-1-1 when this initially happened, and as we moved through the situation, we knew that they were actually arresting some people who they thought looked just like the suspect. Then we learned that the man at some point, was a member of the military, he served in the Coast Guard for quite some time and was agitated with some of the medical care that he was receiving, and they came to this facility to get some help and something went sideways on the inside, Anderson, and then that shooting started. From that point on, it has been an all-out effort all day long with the roads around here shut down and the massive manhunt using camera networks throughout the city to try to locate this man. But I can tell you, people have been shaken all day long. It is a very busy area. Hundreds of people were here on lockdown throughout the day, just trying to figure out exactly what happened. You've got to think about those patients who were rushed to the hospital. One woman was killed. And obviously you have two other people who were in surgery just hours ago who were in critical condition with the other people who were shot as well. So this has been a day that people have been talking about for quite some time in terms of not only the lockdown, but then the presence and knowing that the man then carjacked someone and went to Cobb County -- Anderson.",

But I have to tell you, there is no way to describe the intensity of what it's like to be involved in or overseeing a manhunt like this, having done it a few times in my own career, including the search for Dzhokhar Tsarnaev after the Boston bombing.

And then also reminiscent of the courthouse shooting that we had a few years ago, where Brian Nichols was on the run, shot several people in the courthouse, and then killed someone in the following days. And so you couldn't help but think about that today. I certainly thought about it, as I had to leave home to go pick up my kids today. COOPER: Andrew, you know, you talked about the hunt for the Tsarnaev brothers in the Boston bombing. I just watched a documentary about that. And it was remarkable to kind of relive that and realize and in a case like this, police must get so much conflicting information from the public about, well, I think I saw somebody here, and you don't know what you don't know.

And of course, every place that police, the boots on the ground have to go to actually search, they never know if they're going to come across somebody who has been killing people earlier in the day.

If you look at, you know, the hunt for the Tsarnaev brothers, think of the Chelsea bomber. We had his name, we had his picture and we had rush hour coming up and we had a guy who was targeting train stations. We blasted that out to the public on the same system you use when they say there is a storm coming on the idea that we could hit every phone within 50 miles. Think of last year, or just a little more than a year ago in New York City with the Frank James who shot up the subway, wounded 10 people. Thank God, didn't kill anybody. We were able to identify him by a piece of paper he left behind, and we did the same thing Atlanta did. The minute we had his picture, we pushed it out with his name and said, as Andy McCabe said, crowdsourced it. You've got 3,000 detectives looking for him, when I can have 8.4 million people looking for him. I'll take the 8.4 million people. Atlanta did a great job using the pictures from the video at the scene. He's wearing a hoodie and a mask, hard to identify.

This is still maybe the one or three, four, two top-Republican voices in the country, and this is how he thinks.And so, when you're sitting here and you are like, guys, I think there's something -- I think that racism and white supremacy is alive and well in the country.

Listen, Tucker Carlson thinks that White people fight in a more civilized way than Black people. Like, literally, that's what he thinks. And so, that's obviously not true. Again, the history of lynching, the history of white mob violence is a bigger source of terror in the history of this country than anything that's ever come out of the 9/11. The situation was horrible, but can you image, 300 years of that, every day, that's the terror that Black people lived under out of fear of White mob violence.

The Mayor spoke today of a capable, competent and brave response by the first responder network that served not only this city but this region.And I just want the men and women of the Atlanta Police Department to know those that are in our 911 Center, our first responding officers, our tactical teams, our investigators, how proud yet again I am of you of the work that you've done today on behalf of the city and in the most dire of circumstances, you've shown what do daily for the men and women that call this city home, and those who visit here. If you look closely, on the earliest views from the crime scene, you saw not only the Atlanta Police Department responding, you saw a network of officers, representing multiple agencies, who have trained for this various outcome. Mr. Mayor, over and over again, a day that this tragedy should befall this city that we would be ready and I stand here today to tell you that the first responder network was there today for their city. The Sheriff of Fulton County, Sheriff Labat, Georgia State Patrol, the MARTA Police Department, Georgia Tech Police Department, Georgia State University, Marshals, they were all on scene quickly, executing their active shooter protocol to stop the situation. And then very shortly, we were joined by the GBI, the FBI, the Secret Service, as well as the United States Marshals Service as we sought to bring this person into custody. And that investigation soon showed us that this perpetrator had left the city and remained a threat elsewhere. And Sheriff (inaudible), I just want you to know that we're a grateful city tonight for your partnership and the efforts of your law enforcement agency to take this individual into custody. And then, this morning, we celebrated the bravery of Atlanta Fire Rescue. Not far from here, is their annual International Firefighters Day. And to see the paramedics and firefighters, when we didn't know where the shooter was, that could easily have still been in the building, around the corner, to see our firefighters dismount their trucks and Chief Smith go into that situation. But it wasn't the first time I've that, Chief, because we had seen that in training over and over again. And today, when it was necessary to save lives, we were very proud to see you, a strong partnership as we moved into that dangerous situation, and thank you. At this time, I'm going to ask our Deputy Chief of Criminal Investigations, Charles Hampton, to come forward to recap what has transpired today, what we have learned from the investigation, and then Chief VanHoozer will come forward to outline how his department let to the capture of this perpetrator today.
