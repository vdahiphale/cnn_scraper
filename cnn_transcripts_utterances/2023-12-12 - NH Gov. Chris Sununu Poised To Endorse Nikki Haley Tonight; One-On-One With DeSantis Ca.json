Thank you so much for being here. I appreciate it. Let's actually begin in New Hampshire where Governor Chris Sununu is poised to endorse Nikki Haley. You remember when the Iowa Governor Kim Reynolds endorsed your candidate last month, the governor touted it as very meaningful. Is this meaningful for Nikki Haley in New Hampshire?",

I think on January 15th when people go out and cast their vote and everybody sees Ron DeSantis as the true Trump alternative, when they see him below projections and expectations out of the water, that momentum will go into New Hampshire.And that momentum will certainly be more important than any one endorsement. But let's not forget, Ron DeSantis has endorsements from over 60 state legislators. I think Nikki Haley has fewer than five. So he's the grassroots candidate. He's building this campaign from the bottom up and we expect there to be a lot of momentum because his themes of freedom, you know, making Florida the free state focusing on freedom from government overreach, eliminating state agencies, COVID freedom, medical freedom, that theme ties in nicely in New Hampshire and people love it.",

So they are moving teams into the state. They're spending tens of millions of dollars jointly together attacking DeSantis not attacking one another. And that actually, you know, causes reason to believe that maybe Nikki Haley's running for something other than president, maybe a VP pick or Cabinet pick, maybe it just a spoiler. But the reality is they are moving teams in but it is far too late. The teams that are there to support Ron DeSantis, they've been there for over six months, building out robust networks across the state. That's what it takes to get out the vote on caucus night.

Because if you just look at where the money is, and where the money is being spent, the DeSantis campaign which you run, the Super PAC, multiple Super PACs that are supporting him, they've spent nearly $5 million in recent months on ads attacking Nikki Haley.Only 120,000 has been spent explicitly attacking the clear front runner, Donald Trump. That's according to our -- my colleague, David Wright, who has crunched these numbers. So if you are trying to get the guy out in front, why not actually aggressively go after him? Isn't that the same thing you're saying Nikki Haley is doing? UTHMEIER: Well, I think Ron DeSantis has pointed out the areas where he's certainly disagrees with the former president, namely, I mean, the former president coming out of COVID added over, you know, almost 8 trillion to the national deficit. That is not the type of spending that Ron DeSantis believes in. He vetoed appropriation after appropriation after appropriation in the Florida legislature, and ultimately sent back a record setting 300 million plus in tax reliefs to Floridians through toll relief and permanent tax relief on family goods, baby products, diapers, clothing, things of that nature. So he's pointed out the contrasts. Obviously, we can't control what all the outside groups are doing. But I have seen some of the ads and I think they're rightly pointing out some of the contradictions that Nikki Haley has had in recent past, namely China. She gave away almost half of her state, it seemed to China through corporate welfare and subsidies, and then now turns around and pretends to be tough on China. Her stances on immigration have also seemed to change. She says she's tough on the border, but then ultimately says, you know, we should let people in if it's necessary for corporations to have adequate employment.",

And it comes after last night, he was -- he had a reception at the White House for Hanukkah. And he gave an anecdote about having a picture taken with Bibi Netanyahu decades ago when they first met each other. And he said, on the back of that picture, I wrote a description saying, I love you, but I don't agree with anything you say.
