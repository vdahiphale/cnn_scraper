President Joe Biden's son also struck a deal with federal prosecutors to resolve a felony gun charge.Now, the plea agreement is a major step toward the conclusion of the Justice Department's investigation into Hunter Biden's finances, a probe that began in 2018. Now, over the course of the probe, investigators examined allegations of money laundering, foreign lobbying and other potential charges. Let's bring in CNN's Kara Scannell. She is outside the courthouse. Kara, good morning. So what can we expect to happen today?",

      "sentences": "Hey, good morning, Rahel. So we expect Hunter Biden to arrive this hour. We just saw one of his attorneys, Abbe Lowell enter the courthouse. So once this hearing gets under the way at around 10 a.m. We expect Hunter Biden will plead guilty to those two tax misdemeanor charges. That's for failing to pay, taxes on more than $1.5 million in income in 2017 and 2018. He will also resolve a charge related to gun possession that is a felony for possessing a gun well addicted to a controlled substance and Biden has been very public about his addiction problems. So as this -- and as this hearing gets underway, we expect the judgeand the prosecutors to -- to lay out what this case is about. What the alleged crime is that Hunter Biden is pleading guilty to. And then the judge will have the opportunity to ask Hunter Biden questions. That's a pretty formulaic part of this process. But we don't know exactly what Hunter Biden will say in response to those questions. But she will want to make sure that he knows that he is pleading guilty to these charges and what he is pleading guilty to. Now, we also expect to learn more about this plea agreement. Our sources tell us that as part of the tax misdemeanor charges, prosecutors have agreed to recommend probation, that is a no prison sentence. Each of those misdemeanors carry as much as 12 months in prison and on the diversion of this gun possession charge. That's a felony that could have as much as 10 years in prison, but because of this program, where Hunter Biden agrees to the terms of it, he will not have any prison time. So we will learn more details about just what this plea agreement is. Now, this is a first -- in a year of first is the first time in American President son is pleading guilty to any crime while he's in office. And there's been a twist overnight the judge talking about possibly sanctioning Hunter Biden's lawyers. We expect that to be addressed this morning as well. That has come up because the House Ways and Means Committee wanted to file an amicus brief in this case, and they say that one of Biden's attorneys reached out to the clerk of the court and had them remove a document from the docket. Now, Hunter Biden's team saying that this was a misunderstanding that there was no misrepresentation that their lawyer was not saying that she was part of the House team. But this is something that the judge has said she's questioned whether there should be sanctions against Biden's team and that will also be addressed at the hearing that gets underway in just about an hour.

And new this morning, former Trump Attorney Rudy Giuliani conceding in a court filing that he made defamatory statements about two Georgia election workers after the 2020 presidential election. That concession is connected to a lawsuit that was filed against Giuliani by Ruby Freeman and Shaye Moss, and they say that Giuliani made false allegations against them in an effort to undermine how votes were counted in Georgia.While in a late-night filing, Giuliani says that he does not deny Moss and Freeman's accusations that he smear them after the election. But we should note that Giuliani is also refusing to concede that his statements caused damage to the mother and daughter. The filing also goes on to say that Giuliani wants the ability to argue that his statements about voter fraud were protected speech. Now, the timing of all of this is extremely important because right now, Giuliani's actions are under scrutiny and a separate federal investigation. And it's all tied to Special Counsel Jack Smith's grand jury investigation into former President Trump's efforts to overturn the 2020 election results clearly a lot in this filing. So let's get to CNN Senior Climate Justice Reporter Katelyn Polantz. It was a short filing about two pages but Katelyn, what else did Giuliani say?",

Giuliani has been accused of not giving them all of the records that he hasn't had in his possession about this. And so he's trying to shut down some of the legal risk he has there by now making these concessions that these were false statements. But he doesn't want to admit to everything that would cause him to have legal liability here, because he wants to say that what he was saying after the 2020 election about them is still constitutionally protected speech. And perhaps he may want to argue that he wasn't the one who was damaging them in a way where he should have to pay them a lot of money, as they would very likely asked for if he's found liable in this lawsuit.So really complicated legal situation. But the big question here now, Rahel, is what is the ripple effect of this? What does the judge say in response to this in this lawsuit? What do Ruby Freeman and Shaye Moss say? What do other people who are suing Giuliani for defamation say? And then what happens in the situation where Giuliani is facing disbarment in New York State and Washington D.C., as well as what happens with the Special Counsel investigators. What do they say, his -- one of his political advisors is putting out a statement as well saying that he's not acknowledging that the statements were false, but he's not contesting them that this is a legal issue, not a factual issue.

And that's carrying the weight of -- of concrete. And -- and -- and that weight of 16 tons, is attached via cable. And as the fire hits the cable, the cable weekend's to a point where it loses his strength. And that's where the collapse occurred.",

Because in addition to the boom, you had something that was holding a substantial number of concrete that it was moving around, it was made up of these stones. So why we're so lucky is not only the boom loader to the street, but all of that concrete could have struck civilians. And this has spread out throughout the area here. So we were -- we were extremely, extremely lucky this morning. But getting this right, as the Commissioner state is not about luck. It's about making sure that people who are above our skyline are doing it correctly and all the places like this time all the documentation were in order. OK.",

A few things we have learned after this crane collapse this morning from this press conference, we heard from Mayor Eric Adams there, of course. A few things we learned that more than 200 firefighters and EMS personnel on scene. This is a quite large scene. We know that five people were hurt. Officials, they're saying that those were minor injuries. The crane that apparently set all of this off was apparently holding and carrying 16 tons of concrete. So I want to now bring in CNN National Correspondent Brynn Gingras, she is there for us. And she was there listening to the press conference. Brynn, a lot of information here. What more did you learn? What more else should we take away from this?",
