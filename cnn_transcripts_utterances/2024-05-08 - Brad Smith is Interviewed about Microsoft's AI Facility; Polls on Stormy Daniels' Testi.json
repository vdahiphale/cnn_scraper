The company says it's building out a data hub focused on artificial intelligence, an AI center that they say well train about 100,000 workers, and, before that, will create thousands of union construction jobs and more.There's also this. Biden's appearance there today is also a not-so- subtle snub at Donald Trump. Six years ago, on this very same land, the Trump administration celebrated and multi-billion-dollar investment that another company, Foxconn, was going to break ground on. Donald Trump even declaring this about that project.

But, obviously, something changed to overnight with MPD saying over the past couple of days they have gotten information and incidents that led them to believe things had become more volatile and that this camp needed to be cleared.
