Here are the NFL players currently with ACL injuries according to the USA sports dataset. This is not the official NFL data that will not be produced until the end of the year. But right now, according to \"USA Today,\" at least 40 players - 40 players are out with ACL injuries with four regular season games to go for each team. Now, let's look back at past seasons at the official NFL data and it will show that, in fact, what we see is that 2021 had more ACL tears than any other recent season. Seventy-one. That far eclipses the previous record in 2018 with 57. So, it does seem that at least in 2021 the ACL injuries were, in fact, on the rise. We'll see when the official data is produced in 2022 what it actually shows, but at least in 2021 it did show that the ACL injuries were rising. Now, why would more ACL injuries make sense? Because we have quicker players and bigger players. And in those non-contact injuries, that, in fact, can lead to more ACL injuries.",
