We democracies distinguish ourselves from terrorists by striving for a different standard, even when it's difficult. ROBERTSON (voice-over): And it will be difficult. Israel is still reeling from the deadliest, most barbaric attack on its citizens since the state was founded. Anger at Hamas is high. So, too, pressure on the prime minister to act decisively.

This is very much tied to what Nic Robertson was saying there, John, about the inevitability of this ground invasion.Israel telling the United Nations to essentially evacuate the Gaza Strip, the Northern part of the Gaza Strip from Wadi Gaza Northwards. Now, the U.N. says that accounts for about 1.1 million Palestinians. That's about half of the entire population of the Gaza Strip. There's specific distances around about ten kilometers South, although the Wadi kind of varies. It's not ten kilometers South of the North throughout. But that is what Israel is saying. The U.N. saying that it's impossible to do so without, in its words, you know, devastating humanitarian consequences. The response from Israel to the U.N.'s warning, from Israel's envoy to the U.N., is saying that that -- that response by the U.N. is itself shameful. But clearly, what Israel is trying to do is to get the civilian population of the Gaza Strip to basically make way for the Israelis, for this expected ground incursion, to minimize civilian casualties. But of course, moving that many people is no easy task. At the same time, the Biden administration has been talking about trying to get safe passage for the civilian population of Gaza through the Southern crossing into Egypt. But of course, Egypt is not likely to want hundreds of thousands, potentially, of Palestinian refugees to come into the country. That Southern border has been sealed, of course, as well. So it's a very difficult situation for the civilian population of the Gaza Strip, where we've seen as you say, the death toll now, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health, now rising above 1,500. Of course, we know that more than 1,200 people inside of Israel have been killed since Hamas launched this attack against Israel in the early hours of Saturday morning. And that's a death toll that's also expected to rise -- John.",

Around 40 percent of them are children. So far at least 340,000 people have been displaced within Gaza. Many are now forced to take shelter in U.N.-run schools like this one. But civilians here are also now facing what the Israeli government has described as a complete siege on Gaza. \"There's no water for us to drink, no water for us to wash ourselves with so that we can pray,\" Maram (ph) says. \"They've bombed our schools.

But Hamas says it will not negotiate as long as it remains under attack from Israel. And Israel says it has cut off water, electricity, and fuel as long as those hostages are held in Gaza.

Biden was both measured and empathetic while offering Israel fullsupport. He went on to slam Hamas and telling foreign actors to stay out of the conflict. This all feeds into his reelection narrative as a confident, steady leader when it comes to world affairs. Donald Trump, though, the likely Republican presidential nominee, gave the kind of speech that his critics say makes him unreliable in a crisis. On Wednesday, he complimented Hezbollah, the Iranian-backed terror group to the North in Lebanon, and attacked Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for not taking part in the U.S. strike on a top Iranian general back in 2020.

And he repeatedly spoke before Congress at the invitation of Republicans to oppose Obama's efforts to -- to make a nuclear deal with Iran.

Despite all that, you know, I think what you're seeing over these last few days is a view in Israel that Biden is still the more reliable partner, because he is the more reliable person.

But there is going -- there are going to be difficult diplomatic and military trade-offs as this moves forward that are going to require a lot of dexterity. To support Israel, but perhaps to restrain Netanyahu, to avoid a wider war, to keep on track the broader project that Biden has continued, admittedly, from where Trump started, of normalizing relations between Israel and some of its Sunni neighbors, largely around the idea of countering Iran. It's going to take a lot of skill and dexterity. And, you know, that is really the issue for Trump, who -- who is so volatile, so unpredictable, he argues that that is an asset, that it makes, you know, adversaries uncertain, the mad men theory, updated version of that that Richard Nixon talked about.
