So they found that people who had insomnia did have a greater risk of different things, including cardiovascular disease. But it could be people who have insomnia have other issues as well. Just keep that in mind.They also defined insomnia, first of all, very specifically, as people who had difficulty initiating sleep, people who had difficulty maintaining sleep and people who they would wake up and then have difficulty going back to sleep. So, just keep that in the mind of your mind in terms of what insomnia specifically is. This was a significant study in terms of size. And I think that's why it's getting attention. More than a million people, several countries around the world, looked at insomniacs, looked at people who did not have insomnia, and said, what is the likelihood of having a heart attack. It's low in both cases here. To be clear, 1.6 percent versus 1.2 percent. But that is a significantly higher number in the insomniacs, of having these trouble with heart problems. So, I think that's what got the researchers' attention and that's what's going to probe them to sort of figure out what they can do about this, what they can advise.",

We've known this for some time. We've down it's probably a problem. But now the studies are coming out to sort of show that, you know, how significant a problem it is. And, by the way, less than five hours of sleep, problematic, but also greater than nine hours could be problematic. So, there is a sweet spot here. It's not necessarily that more is better.",

GUPTAyou know, there's all sorts of different sleep recommendations that people have heard certainly over the years. Make sure you have good sleep hygiene. You know, not using devices before you go to bed. Keep the room cool and dark. Having that sleep schedule. I think the middle point here, getting enough natural light during the day, Kaitlan, I think is a really important one. We spend so much of our lives indoors now and surrounded by artificial light. And I think what we are seeing, as I mentioned earlier, is how -- just how disruptive that is to our circadian rhythms overall. If you get outside and you get outside at the time of day when it's light, so you're actually exposing your eyes first thing in the morning to natural light and making sure you get as much natural light throughout the day as possible, as the light changes throughout the day, the impact of that light on your body and brain should change throughout the day as well, that's what probably is the most important in terms of getting your clock, your circadian clock, on rhythm and, you know, best beating your chance of having insomnia.",

The all-alcohol category, down 1 percent. The low and non-alcoholic, this is what I'm interested in, look at this growth level, it's up 25 percent, Don.

Alcohol has a negative effect on society at large and most people who drink. This is among alcohol drinkers. This is among alcohol drinkers. This is not people like me who don't really drink a lot of alcohol. Look at - look at this, 71 percent of society at large say alcohol has a negative effect.
