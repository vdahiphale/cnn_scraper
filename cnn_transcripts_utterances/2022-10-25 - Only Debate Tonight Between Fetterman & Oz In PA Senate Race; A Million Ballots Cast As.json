      "sentences": "Well, Victor, I think that people can expect, of course, to see fireworks as we've seen in debates across the country. But I think more interestingly, this has a unique element to it and that is because of John Fetterman. Of course, he's the Lieutenant Governor of Pennsylvania, but he's been recovering from a stroke for the last several months.So this debate tonight is going to be slightly different. It's going to have a closed captioning system. John Fetterman is still having auditory processing issues. That's what his doctor uses to explain he can't always hear and see things in real time. So he's going to be using closed captions, as many Americans do when they watch their television programs. But those words are going to be on a screen. The TV viewer at home is going to be able to see all of this, so there are going to be two pretty large monitors on the stage with the two candidates. So all that, of course, sets the backdrop effort to answer this question: Is John Fetterman healthy enough to be a U.S. senator? His doctors say he is. He said he's just recovering from the stroke. And we've seen progress, of course, in his speech month by month, but Mehmet Oz, of course, has made his fame as a television doctor. That also adds another unique element to this. But I'm told by his advisors that he wants to focus on the difference in issues. Hitting crime has been one of the central themes of his campaign as well as the economy, inflation, other issues we've seen across the country. But this hour long debate here in Harrisburg, the first time these two candidates have ever come face-to-face with one another certainly is going to shape this race, which as we've seen, is very close. Our new poll, just out yesterday, showed Fetterman with about a six-point edge, but don't necessarily believe the numbers specifically. Both sides believe this race is very, very close going into the final two weeks, I believe.",

Many Democrats simply do not necessarily want to stand with him. His approval rating is in the 40s or so, so not dissimilar from other presidents in power in midterm election races. But he will be coming back to Pennsylvania. Of course, he was born here in Scranton. He's from neighboring Delaware now, so that's why he keeps coming back here again and again. It's sort of his home base, if you will. But at the end of the day, it is John Fetterman versus Oz. It has more to do with them than the presidents of either party, Victor and Bianna?",

Herschel Walker, the Republican running for Senate on this bus tour across Georgia, again, hitting those two rural communities here in North Georgia today, friendly communities to him. But Victor, to be honest, something I noticed from the Walker campaign today that I personally had not heard thus far was him asking the voters who attended his rally today, whether or not they had voted early and encouraging them to get out and vote early. That is something we have heard consistently from Sen. Raphael Warnock encouraging people to vote when they can, vote before Election Day just in case something happens, you've got it out of the way, you can get it done now.

Well, unlike traditional extremist threats, this is not the sort of situation where you can flood the zone with protective measures and law enforcement officers because, of course, that sort of response can have a chilling impact or intimidating impact on voters as they try to approach polling places.

And I have said that any decision in negotiation should be the Ukrainian decision. But I think my job is to make sure I'm looking out for America's national interest and for our values.And let me tell you, it's in our interest to make sure there's not nuclear war. It's in our interest to make sure this war doesn't escalate. And it is in Ukraine's interest and the world's interest to make sure there - that we do everything possible to lessen civilian casualties. Now, if someone wasn't voting for arms or someone was saying we're not going to vote for new aid packages, that's what Leader McCarthy is saying that he may not vote for new aid. That's a problem. But when someone is voting for aid, when someone's voting for arms, I get attacked all the time from the left, why are you supporting arms and you're saying, well, we should also make sure we're having diplomacy, that we can't have that conversation in this country. Something is wrong when we have lost the ability to have nuance in America. I mean, President Reagan, who won the Cold War was willing to have negotiations with the Soviet counterparts. Let's have common sense. Let's stand with the Ukrainians but do everything we can to avoid escalation.",
