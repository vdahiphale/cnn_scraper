Whether it had to do with stability in the European region, whether it had to do with the values that each of these countries and leaders have embraced. And I think that this is something, actually, that you and I spoke about extensively during the coverage of the French presidential election, is that Emmanuel Macron's commitment to engagement, to speaking to political leaders, to keeping the channels of communication open, whether or not they lead to productive deals. We saw him, for example, try to engage with President Biden's predecessor but was unable to get him to move on -- on Iran, on the Paris climate accord and so on. But, in this particular, case you saw him trying to lead President Biden towards being more open to a possibility of speaking to the Russian leader, rather than each of them in their respective corners, ultimately waiting for the situation to play out.

And President Macron in return made openings in that particular regard, where he ultimately mentioned, I think, the most interesting term in these discussions was the word \"resynchronization.\" It's this reaffirmation of the multilateral order that was weakened and undermined by President Trump and from which they all have the benefit and under a time when, as you mentioned, the U.K. is unpredictable, unreliable as an Atlantic partner. The center of gravity has shifted in Europe, and it shifted away, as well, from the German leadership since the end of the Merkel era towards Emmanuel Macron. And, to that extent, his ability to speak English is also crucial. And his ability to position himself and take the sort of inspired conference about the European leaders. It's important.
