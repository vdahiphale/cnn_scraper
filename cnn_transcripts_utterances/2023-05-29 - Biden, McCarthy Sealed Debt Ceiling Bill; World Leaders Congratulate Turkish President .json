And he also spelled out the consequences should there be a default of the catastrophic consequences that would impose on the economy. But President Biden also acknowledging that in an attempt to avert that and send this over to Congress, not everyone got what they want. So this will be important in the coming days as both members of Congress and both parties review the legislative text. But President Biden was also having to answer to questions about whether he should have negotiated sooner. The position from the White House since early this year has been that they would not negotiate on the debt ceiling. But President Biden saying that he was not doing that, but rather negotiating on spending cuts. And so, that is part of the spin that both the White House and Republicans will be giving in the coming days as they try to get both parties on board with this in a very short amount of time. It wasn't only reaching the agreement but also now looking at the legislative text getting a floor a house vote on the floor as well as the Senate. Now, President Biden when he spoke to reporters earlier on Sunday said that he was confident that this was going to reach his desk and at the time said that there no sticking points after a long 48 hours, but still a long road ahead of that June 5th date where the U.S. Treasury will run out of funds.

The debt ceiling gets increased for a couple of years, the world keeps spinning, the average voter won't notice much of a difference.And a lot of this fiscal policy is gonna get litigated in the next presidential election. So, I really think Kevin McCarthy did a nice job of bringing Joe Biden to the negotiating table, and Joe Biden is telling this to his Democrats as, you know, not much really changed here, and we didn't go over the edge of a default.

This is the closest the President Erdogan came to losing an election, losing the presidency in two decades. It's also the first time in Turkish history that this actually went down to a runoff election. And there were plenty of real divisive issues that were front and center in this campaign, Syrian refugees and what to do about them.The issue of the government's response to the earthquake back in February was a big issue as well, on top of the fact that the Turkish economy has really been sputtering and faltering under the weight of inflation, which in the past year hit 85 percent, some say even higher. And the government's response to it has been quite bizarre to actually lower interest rates rather than hike them, which is what conventional wisdom tells the government they ought to be doing. So given that, it's actually quite surprising that Erdogan did as well as he did in the first round of voting, but being the incumbent comes with a lot of built-in advantages, especially in Erdogan's Turkey. State TV in the month of April, for instance, gave him 32 hours of coverage compared to just 32 minutes of coverage for his opponent, Kemal Kilicdaroglu, who said in this vote that it was one of the most unfair political eras that his country was in, filled with all kinds of black propaganda and slander. He also said that the result, despite the loss, shows the will of the people to change the authoritarian government. He also pledged to continue on the fight. Listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KEMAL KILICDAROGLU, TURKISH OPPOSITION LEADER (through translator): We will continue to fight until we have established a real democracy in our country. And we will continue to be the vanguard of the struggle. My greatest sorrow is about the difficulties awaiting our country.

Erdogan may have had a much stronger candidate in Ekrem Imamolu. That's the mayor of Istanbul who won election back in 2019, but then the vote, there was accusations of fraud. He won again, but then he was actually accused of insulting public officials and sentenced to a jail term of almost three years.

Of course, Turkey is an important member of NATO.The Turks have been seeking a reset in the relationship, but what they mean by a reset is essentially the United States accepting Turkey's view of issues and adjusting accordingly. And I don't think that the Biden administration or, importantly, Congress, which has become an important actor in the U.S.-Turkey relationship, is ready to accede to what are essentially Turkish demands. So, Erdogan will likely respond to his victory by, once again, perhaps in a more aggressive tone, seeking a change in relations with the United States.

Tinubu is set to be sworn in as Nigeria's president in the coming hours. He ran for office promising a broom revolution to sweep away corruption. But Africa's most populous nation faces many other issues, among them deep mistrust of the government, including his own election.CNN's senior editor for Africa Stephanie Busari is in Lagos for you Nigeria and she joins us now, so good to see you Steph. The list of challenges for the new president is daunting. What is going to be his first priority and what can Nigerians expect to see?",

(voice-over): Now, U.S. total debt stands at more than $103 billion. And some analysts say the incoming president must get to grips with this urgently. ROLAKE AKINKUGBE-FILANI, CHIEF COMMERCIAL OFFICER, MIXTA AFRICA: It is now really a focus on the structural aspects of building sustainable economic development. How are we going to plug some of the inefficiencies and end the wastages in the system? BUSARI (voice-over): But that's not all. The country is grappled with violence, insurgency and crime, leaving some wondering which way forward? AKINKUGBE-FILANI: One of the challenges of Nigerian society here is there's still huge polarization between the ultra-rich and the super- poor. And in some ways, successive governments have lost the social contract with the majority of the population. BUSARI (voice-over): Nigeria also faces a multitude of social problems, including inadequate access to education and health care, widespread poverty and gender inequality. And expectations are high that Tinubu will hit the ground running.",

And only time will tell if he can live up to the aspirations of the Nigerian people. (END VIDEOTAPE) BUSARI (on camera): Now, Laila, not everybody is celebrating this presidency. Currently, there's a hashtag on social media saying, Tinubu, not my president. So the president-elect and the president when he's sworn in will have to work very, very hard to bring these factions, bring these parts of the country who do not believe in his mandate, who reject his mandate, he will have to work very hard to bring them together. Already, the streets are deserted. It's a public holiday here in Nigeria, tight security, the armies weren't warning people not to come around the site of the inauguration. So for some Nigerians it's feeling very much like a private party between the APC ruling party and its supporters, Laila.",

Thank you so much Stephanie.Now to Spain, where conservatives made big gains in local elections this weekend, and even a losing candidate is calling the results a tsunami by the opposition. Conservatives swept away ruling Socialist Party candidates in nine of the 12 provinces where voters went to the polls. The People's Party is now set to control key provinces, including Valencia, Aragon, the Balearic Islands, and Extremadura, among others. It's also won mayors races in big cities including Valencia and Seville and an absolute majority in Madrid. It's a stark wake-up call for the nation's ruling socialists who face national elections in December. And after lashing Guam, Typhoon Mawar is heading towards the Philippines and eastern Taiwan. It's now with equivalent to a category 3 Atlantic hurricane with sustained winds of 193 kilometers an hour. It's not expected to make direct landfall in either of those two places, but it could unleash heavy rain, strong winds and a storm surge. [03:50:06] Well, the storm will eventually weaken.

We've seen attacks all across the country on a number of very important cultural heritage sites. And all of them said, no, it wasn't us. It wasn't us.
