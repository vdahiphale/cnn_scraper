Just ahead, all eyes on Iowa as the state's Republicans prepare to vote in the first key contest of the 2024 race for the White House. But could record cold temperatures hamper voter turnout?On high alert in the Red Sea, the White House warning of likely retaliation after U.S. and U.K. strikes on Houthi targets in Yemen. And Beijing lashes out at Taipei after voters in Taiwan defied China to elect a new president. Good to have you with us. Well, just in a matter of hours, Republican voters in the U.S. state of Iowa will begin making their choice for the party's next presidential nominee as the 2024 race for the White House gets underway. Iowans will have to brave some brutal weather to make their voices heard, with wind chills as low as 45 degrees below zero and continued heavy snow expected across the state. Presidential hopefuls spent Sunday crisscrossing the state looking to drum up last minute support ahead of the first in the nation caucuses. With the latest polling showing Donald Trump well ahead of his two closest competitors, Nikki Haley and Ron DeSantis are hoping to win over those voters unwilling to commit to Trump. While Iowa kicks off the voting, each candidate is also looking ahead to the next contest and hoping to head into the New Hampshire primary with as much support as possible. Jeff Zeleny looks at what's at stake on Monday in Iowa. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) DONALD TRUMP, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA:  Brave the weather and go out and save America because that's what you're doing. JEFF ZELENY, CNN CHIEF NATIONAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Donald Trump is eyeing a knockout victory in Iowa, hoping the first contest sets him on a rocket ride to the Republican nomination.",

We'll see if she can maintain that lead in practice tomorrow night because two reasons. One, DeSantis does have a stronger organization. And second, Haley is relying on the parts of the Republican coalition that feels the least attached to the modern Republican party and whether they will feel sufficiently motivated to come out on a night when it's going to be below zero, black ice and, you know, horrific windchills remains to be seen.

He's attracted tremendous support from the state political leadership from the governor to the Republican leaders in the House of state House and Senate, to most of the key evangelical leaders in the state. It's kind of reverse New York, New York. If he can't make it here, can he make it anywhere? He is, you know, polling very poorly in New Hampshire.

So, obviously you saw with the images that you showed from the rally, that 24-hour rally on Sunday to mark 100 days of this conflict. The pressure is stepping up. It has been stepping up for a number of weeks on the Israeli government to do more. That is something that they are certainly feeling.We will not leave them behind were the words of the defense minister, Yoav Gallant in comments to mark that 100 day mark. But meanwhile, of course, we have Prime Minister Netanyahu saying that the war could last many more months. In terms of the negotiations themselves, obviously there were concerns which were voiced by Qatar, which is one of the key brokers in these talks, that the assassination not claimed by Israel, of course, of a senior Hamas official in Lebanon on January 2nd would complicate those talks. But Secretary Blinken, the U.S. Secretary of State, was in the region again last week and said that he believed Hamas would engage. Now, we are not, it seems, close to another round of hostage releases or a temporary ceasefire. But a smaller track appears to have opened up. It was announced on Friday that the Mossad chief, David Barnea, had reached a deal with Qatar to get medicines into Gaza for some of those hostages that we know have been sorely in need of those very -- a number of elderly people still remain among those hostages. Now, that was set to happen in the next few days.
