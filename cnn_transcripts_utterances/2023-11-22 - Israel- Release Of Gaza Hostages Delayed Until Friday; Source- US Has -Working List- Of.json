John Berman here, in for Anderson.First, the when, which we thought was just a few hours away, a temporary pause in fighting between Israeli forces and Hamas followed by the release of the first 50 hostages from Gaza and 150 Palestinians being held in Israel. Late today, however, Israel's National Security Council announced that the process will not start until Friday. An Israeli official added that this includes the pause in fighting, also, delayed until Friday. As to the question of who, a source familiar with the matter tells us that the US officials have a working list of 10 hostages they believe are likely to be released on day one of the process. And though no one is publicly naming the 10, administration officials today did talk specifically about three Americans being held. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

One reason we are told, in part, that this delay is happening is that Israel still has not gotten the actual list of the names. You know, the White House has been saying that they have a working list of who they believe to be expected among the first hostages to be released.But Israel itself does not have a concrete list of the names yet. And that just is one factor of what's happening behind the scenes right now, as they're also just trying to figure out operationally what this is going to look like, how these hostages are actually going to be released in what was slated to be about a six-hour period starting tomorrow. Now, we are told it's going to start Friday at the earliest. Though officials have been saying, behind the scenes, they're confident this deal is still moving forward. They don't think things are falling apart or anything of that nature, but there is certainly a delay. And one that, you know, for the families of these hostages who are waiting to see if it was their loved ones who are going to be released tomorrow, obviously, this is not welcome news for them.",

There is a 10-month-old baby currently being held hostage. There's the 3- year-old American girl, Abigail Idan, who you mentioned. And also, the emphasis is on their mothers, potentially.According to the Israeli government, some 40 children under the age of 18 are currently being held in Gaza. We don't know which ones would be released on which day. And certainly, the families who are anxiously waiting for more news also don't know. But it is important to underscore, I think, as Kaitlan was saying, the Qataris were saying -- and, obviously, they're big players in this whole negotiation -- up until the last minute that they did think that list would come out tonight. And so, it does not appear, at least on the surface, that there's any real breakdown going on here, but there are a huge amount of moving parts. And this is a very complex operation. You're going to be talking about people being released in Egypt potentially, returned to Israel through three different check points.

But there's been a lot of confusion from the get-go. I mean, take the example of Thomas Hand. This is an Irishman, who lived in the Kibbutz Be'eri, for more than 30 years. His daughter, Emily, who was eight years old on October 7th, went over for a sleepover to a friend's house in another house in the kibbutz. Obviously, the carnage that ensued. And afterwards, he was told that his daughter was dead. And he went through that process of mourning, only to then be told a couple of weeks later that actually they believed she was alive. And when I spoke to him today, he said, listen, I'm not getting my hopes up. I can't go on that emotional roller coaster, and I'm not going to believe anything until I actually see her with my own eyes -- John.",

Gad Haggai and Judih Weinstein -- that's their names -- both were shot and wounded just moments later. The ambulance that might have responded could not reach them because Hamas gunmen had shot out the tires. Iris Haggai Liniado joins us now. Iris, thank you so much for being with us. Your reaction when you heard that there will be no hostages released until at least Friday now? IRIS HAGGAI LINIADO, PARENTS MISSING AFTER OCTOBER 7TH ATTACK: To be honest, you know, same as many, many families. I'll believe it when I see it. That's how I'm reacting right now. Even when the whole deal, you know, was popping in the media and stuff, I was -- I always told everybody, listen, this is not the first deal I've heard about. I'll believe it when I see it. Of course, my heart is pumping. I'm waiting. You know, I heard these rumors about three American citizens being released, but I didn't get anything official. The FBI didn't tell me anything like that. So, to me, I'm just, you know -- I did actually -- I was supposed to go to Israel Saturday and going to fly in today just because I feel like I should be there right now. But, you know, I'm hopeful.

Any proof of life. We don't even know who's there honestly. And we just found out that Hamas doesn't even know where all the children are, where all the mothers are. That's the reason that elderly women are being released because they don't know where all the women and children are -- sorry, where all the mothers and children are. So, you know, I heard you talking about things not being consistent and that the Israeli government won't tell us until the day when they actually have the hostages. But it's such a huge, huge situation. You can't really trust the organization, the terrorists that you're dealing with. So I believe the Israeli government is trying to be cautious because, you know, they just want to see that the first day things are actually happening the way that they are supposed to.

So you bring 10 children or 10 old people to the border, and you do it. It shouldn't be that complicated. There's (inaudible) true that Hamas doesn't have all the hostages. Some of them are in the hands of Palestinian Islamic Jihad. It's an organization totally owned and operated by Iran, but many are in the hands of families. Hundreds, perhaps thousands of Palestinians broke through the fence on October 7th with the terrorists. They took hostages. This is well-known. They will then sell those hostages. They can sell them to Hamas or they sell them directly to Israel or to another -- a third party. But maybe Hamas doesn't know where they all are. That is definitely an issue.

And we know that when we send our children out to battle, if they -- you know, God forbid -- fall prisoner, the state will do everything, everything to get it back. It's part of our covenant with the state. So we're up against that -- this terrible situation of security for our soldiers, but also living up to that covenant of bringing our hostages home. Again, historically, I don't know any government ever made decisions like that. Not much choice. But let's be clear about this, at the end of the day, Hamas will not release all the hostages for the very simple reason, they know -- Hamas knows once it released the last 10 hostages, then Israel can then go into those tunnels, flood them with water, flood them with whatever flammable substance that we can find, and that will be the end of Hamas.

Does this hostage deal give you hope that there may be a way to bring your son home?

You know, it's all rumors until it happens. Even though this rumor seems to be seemingly very accurate, until I see the loved ones cross over into safe hands, I'm not counting my chickens before they hatch. But certainly, if these children that have been living in darkness, and fear, and trauma for 47 days are returned tomorrow, I will be thrilled and extremely hopeful that more and more will be released. And obviously, we won't rest until Hersh and all 238 are home. So, you know, we're holding onto our hope. BERMAN (on camera): You know, the prime minister said today that, as part of the deal, the Red Cross will be able to visit and offer medical support to the hostages who do remain in Gaza. Do you think these visits may be the best chance to find out something, anything about Hersh?",
