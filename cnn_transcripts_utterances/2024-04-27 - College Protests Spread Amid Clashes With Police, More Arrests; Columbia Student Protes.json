I'm Fredricka Whitfield.And we begin this hour with new developments in the unrest sweeping across American college campuses. At Arizona State police say they've arrested 69 people for trespassing after a large group formed an authorized encampment to protest the war in Gaza. According to the school, most of the people were not ASU students, faculty, or staff. And at Northeastern University in Boston, the campus is all clear and has resumed normal operations. Police there detaining about 100 people this morning. In a statement, Northeastern officials say they believe professional organizers joined the ranks of student protesters. And police in Washington, D.C. are also keeping a close eye on demonstrators at George Washington University. Earlier today they blocked a street but remained peaceful. Let's go now to other campuses across the country. CNN's Camila Bernal and Polo Sandoval are with us right now. Camila, you're at UCLA. What's happening there?",

The university actually saying that they also have staff members for people who do not feel comfortable walking through this area or letting them know that this is what's going on here.And I do want to say that no one is allowed inside unless they let you. They were not allowing us to go inside, but what they're saying is that some of the students are staying there the entire time, others are coming and going, and what they're telling me is that they want this university to divest from Israeli linked companies that are profiting from the war in Gaza. And they say they want to see that accountability from the university. And then they maybe will leave this encampment. They say they're not giving up. You're seeing many, many tents and what they're telling me is happening inside is that they're having lessons about the political conflict in the Middle East. They're having religious ceremonies because they believe that this is the space where they can do that. I spoke to a Jewish student that is part of these efforts and take a listen to what he told me.

We're not allowed to go there after the protests this week. Their commencement ceremony also not happening this year.

But they are all packing up their things right now as you can see because there is concern about another weather front moving through here.In fact, you remember it was sunny when we spoke earlier. You can see the clouds moving in so people definitely want to get to safety here. But before that storm does move in, I just want to give you a little bit of a look of what we're looking at here. This home, half of that roof collapsed. We saw a child and a parent here trying to collect and salvage whatever items they had. The house next to it largely standing, although the back of it is destroyed. You can see again the homeowners have these trucks here. They're trying to salvage what they can of the items inside. Most of the families here were sheltering in their basements. That's what prevented so much loss of life, and also their early warning system. And I just want to get around this vehicle here to show you there is some point we'll see it there's a dumpster over there. There's actually two dumpsters that have been completely full of debris. And these are not folks from the state or the local, you know, these are not officials who are helping with cleanup. These are volunteers from the community. This is not official. People are really coming in to help. And I believe we also have a shot of a drone that's giving us the overlook What that drone should be showing you, Fred, is that street that we were speaking at earlier where so many homes were flattened, where people again are trying to salvage what they can from their possessions, there is so much shock all of this happened so quickly. There's not really a lot of time to process the emotional impact of all of this. But yes, people for now pausing some of the construction efforts. And what I'd actually love to end on a little bit of a positive note. This property destroyed, the flowers are still standing. A little bit of optimism in this time of tragedy -- Fred.",

And that's not just from our city partners, in government, but are non-profit sectors and they're all continuing to work with us to provide support and resources. So on my web page for the city of Omaha, we are reporting all of these things that we think people need to know what services are available. You know, we've set up one of our community centers out in Elkhorn last night, very quickly for shelter. There was about 100 people that needed shelter immediately. We provided that, working with the Salvation Army, Red Cross. All of those entities are a great help. But we just want to tell people to be very, very careful also. We still have some -- last night at the peak we had about 10,200 homes that were without power. We're down to about 4300 now. Some of our distribution network was heavily damaged, but there are some areas that we are not re- energizing yet because we have lines down, power lines down. And if we would re-energize them then those would be live lines laying on the ground. So we really want to make people very, very cautious.

Prosecutor Susan Hoffinger asked Graff if she had seen Daniels at Trump Tower. Graff responded that she vaguely recalled once seeing Daniels in reception on the 26th floor. Then it was Trump's attorney's turn to cross-examine Graff.

Trump's team made clear Graff was testifying under subpoena, with Necheles asking, you don't want to be here, do you? Correct, Graff replied. Earlier, Trump's attorneys worked hard to undermine a foundational witness for the prosecution, ex-tabloid executive David Pecker, who is back on the stand for his fourth day of testimony. During Trump's attorney Emil Bove's questioning of the former \"National Enquirer\" publisher, he attempted to discredit one of the prosecution's key witnesses, Trump's ex-personal attorney Michael Cohen. He asked Pecker if he felt Cohen was prone to exaggeration. Pecker agreed he was. After court, Trump weighed in on the trial. TRUMP: This is eight days that we've all been sitting in this courthouse.

And while it's usually a fun affair, it also comes as he faces low approval ratings. So it is still high stakes for him especially during a presidential election year.Now up until this point, there has been a lot of prep behind the scenes for this that includes huddling with his advisers, as well as some submitting within his own orbit jokes for the evening because, again, this is also an opportunity for the president to have some fun, to needle the media and his Republican rival, Donald Trump. But in remarks before the president has also gone between being funny and being serious. And that is certainly going to be the case tonight, especially with the backdrop of the conflicts that are unfolding abroad, but also with journalists who are detained abroad.

We've never had a debate between two people who had been president as far as I know in any circumstance.

As you know, the Republican National Committee pulled out of a cooperation with the Commission on Presidential Debates. They had been demanding all sorts of changes that would have been more favorable to Trump. I thought Biden would not be that anxious to get on a stage with Trump, again, after kind of the hectoring performance that, you know, he saw in 2020.
