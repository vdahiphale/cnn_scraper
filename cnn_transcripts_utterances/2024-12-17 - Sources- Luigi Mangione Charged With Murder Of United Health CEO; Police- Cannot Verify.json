Luigi Mangione has officially been indicted in New York for the murder of Brian Thompson. That's according to multiple law enforcement sources. Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg is set to give an update on the charges against the 26-year-old in roughly 20 to 30 minutes. The suspect accused of gunning down the UnitedHealthcare CEO nearly two weeks ago.Now, Mangione has been fighting extradition to New York after his arrest in Pennsylvania. We should note, this means that a New York grand jury has voted to charge Mangione with multiple charges, including murder in the first degree and murder in the second degree.",

But if murder in the first degree is one of those charges, and that is what we are told by multiple sources, it will be unusual because murder in the first degree in New York State requires a number of special elements. Either it was the premeditated murder of a police officer, a court official, a judge or it relates to New York State's terrorism law, which is to coerce or influence or intimidate a civilian population. And given this case and the fact that prosecutors allege that Mangione was arrested with a three-page document on his person saying that he was targeting the healthcare industry because of his perception of their greed and corruption, this could well fit into Section 490 of that state terrorism law. So it will be not unique, but very interesting in terms of charging.",

In fact, if you look at the manifesto, there are specific language in there where Luigi Mangione talks about targeting CEOs in the industry in total and where to target them, go to where their conventions are, that specific language in the manifesto.So that's probably what was brought forth before the grand jury.

COLWINSo it was such a head scratcher for those of us who are in the defense bar, not fully understanding why the attorney in Pennsylvania would then stand and say that he's going to object to it, because it is such a routine type of hearing. We're just talking about probable cause to link the individual that's being accused of charges in another state. But frankly, we're sort of quarterbacking here. I'm sure the attorney just did not want to make representations on behalf of the client until he secured counsel in New York. And Karen Friedman Agnifilo is a tremendous lawyer. I'm sure that she was instrumental in making sure that he changed his strategy, which frankly would have just been a waste of time to try to object to extradition, given all the evidence that was found on his person. It would have been established and then he would have been sent to New York within a few weeks anyway, if he had fought it in a hearing.",

We'll have the police commissioner here, along with the Manhattan District Attorney's Office, who are going to lay out the charges and the elements for why they brought the charges.Certainly hearing that this is a murder one indictment is very significant. Many people are asking if that would even happen in this case, because everyone was certainly expecting a murder two indictment. But a murder one is certainly something that is usually used in cases involving when officers are killed in the line of duty. There are all kinds of elements that need to be met during that kind of a charge, during that kind of an investigation and indictment. So here what's happened is it appears that they have used elements, evidence that they have collected with allegations behind why Luigi Mangione did this, his reasoning in his own writing in the notes that they were able to get from him when he was arrested that really gave them the elements to indict him on murder in the first degree. We're going to wait to see what specific language they use. But certainly in terrorism cases, anytime someone does something as an act of terrorism that they can meet under the New York state law, they can then bring a murder one charge, specifically the terrorism charge. We were looking this up just as we were heading up here that it needs to - there's an intent to intimidate or coerce a civilian population, influence policy or affect the conduct of a unit of government by murder or assassination. And so perhaps that is the element here that investigators and that the district attorney's office, when they presented the case to the grand jury, that is perhaps the element here and the law that they use to bring this charge. If in fact this is a terrorism charge, it is going to be, though not unusual, it is, you know, for New York City, certainly it tends to be unprecedented. So this is going to be a very significant announcement, certainly having the murder in the first degree charge. And if there is this element of terrorism attached to it, that is going to be very significant here.",

In the manifesto, there's a specific passage that states as followsAnd that certainly is taking to exactly your point earlier on, is that he is literally inciting individuals to take on an entire industry and to go and attack the top senior leadership of those particular companies. And that's where that could have been. Very likely parts of this manifesto, including that statement from his manifesto must - could have been read to the grand jury. We know the grand jury are confidential. We're not going to know what was presented before the grand jury. It is strictly confidential.
