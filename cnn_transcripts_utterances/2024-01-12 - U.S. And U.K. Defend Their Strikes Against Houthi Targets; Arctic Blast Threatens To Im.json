U.S. ships in the Red Sea,along with ships from a number of other nations, but U.S. forces in Iraq and Syria, they've been attacked, and the U.S. has responded to those attacks with limited strikes, but they've already been shot at. And to date, they have not fired back, at least against the attacks on shipping in large form. U.S. forces in the Red Sea have taken down a lot of drones, a lot of ballistic missiles, fired toward ships. Some of them fired towards Israel. But now they're going at the launch sites, ballistic missiles, drones, and radar installations to both degrade those capabilities and, as Oren was saying, to send a message to the Houthis and to Iran, for that matter, that this is enough. And what really propelled this particular strike was strikes on Tuesday when Houthi rebels fired some 20 drones directly at U.S. ships in the Red Sea including a ship carrying jet fuel senior administration officials told me and there was concern that had one of those drones gotten through. It would have sunk those ships. So, the fact is the US is already involved in one direction and now it's getting more involved in terms of firing back with the hope that it stays as a low-grade conflict and doesn't grow bigger, because, of course, the concern is it becomes a conflict not between the U.S. and Houthi rebels in this case, but the U.S. and Iran, who backs the Houthi rebels. And I should note that the U.S. does not view that Iranian support as encouragement, et cetera. They view it as direct operational support, providing intelligence, information and weapons to the Houthi rebels to help them carry out these attacks.",

You have the partners who express support for those strikes and then you have others who may not express support publicly but privately give the go- ahead. Because listen, Saudi Arabia suffers from these strikes on the Red Sea as much as any other nation. And, you know, they want to keep these trade routes open through the Red Sea and into the Suez Canal. But at the same time, and I imagine the U.S. respects this Saudi interest, it does not want to become involved directly again with the Houthis or with Iran, for that matter. So, they did not sign on in public for these strikes.

If there had been civilian deaths, said the Israeli lawyers, this was on Hamas, not on the conscience of Israeli leaders or, indeed, the IDF. And when it came to the IDF, there were robust judicial systems inside. Israel to ensure that any individual soldiers could be brought to account. There was a sense of indignation as well at the idea that this genocide act could be used. It was explained by the Israeli lawyers in a way that might turn it into a charter for the attackers, essentially protecting Hamas. Also, of course, the key question of intent in order for genocide to be proven, the question of intent has to be shown. That was something that South African lawyers had tried to show through a series of documents, both written and oral, showing, they said, Israeli leaders systematically and repeatedly showing their genocidal intent.
