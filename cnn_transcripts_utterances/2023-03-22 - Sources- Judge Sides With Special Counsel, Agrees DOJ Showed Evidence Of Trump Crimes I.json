In New York, a grand jury weighs charging the former president for steering money to silence Stormy Daniels. And here in Washington, a consequential secret ruling from a federal judge agreeing with the special counsel prosecutors that there is evidence. Trump used his attorneys to commit crimes.And today, a Fed decision on inflation. Plus, a demand from Democratic senators for more Fed action. They want to corral regional banks they blame for pushing the economy to the brink. And Ron DeSantis hits back. The Florida governor is not a declared 2024 candidate yet, but he's a frequent target of Donald Trump and other Republican hopefuls. In a new interview, DeSantis labeled himself a no drama winner and he laughs off a Trump nickname. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Manhattan prosecutors may soon ask grand jurors to return an indictment against Donald Trump that in the Stormy Daniels hush money investigation, but the New York case is far, very far from Mr. Trump's only legal dilemma. A dramatic and until now a secret finding from a federal judge here in Washington that there is evidence. The judge says, the former president used his attorney to commit a crime. Because of that finding judge Beryl Howell gave the green light to special counsel prosecutors ruling. They can pierce attorney client privilege and they can question Trump lawyer Evan Corcoran before a federal grand jury.Team Trump is challenging that ruling and the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals has put the case on the fast track. Trump lawyers had a midnight, last night - midnight deadline to file their written arguments. Special Counsel Jack Smith's team then worked overnight to meet their 6am response deadline. The stakes here are enormous for the special counsel in his investigation of the handling of reams of classified documents the former president took from the White House to Mar-a-Lago when he left office. In asking Judge Howell to order Corcoran to testify, the special counsel put in writing his view that Trump use his lawyers as part of a scheme to hide from the government the truth about documents still in his possession. And Judge Howell agreed in her ruling that prosecutors had shown her evidence, Trump perhaps committed a crime. CNN's Katelyn Polantz and the former federal prosecutor Elliot Williams are here to help us understand the moment. Katelyn, starting with you. Very significant that one in writing the special counsel said, I have evidence, Donald Trump committed a crime. And then the now retired, but the chief judge, a senior veteran judge on the D.C. court said I agree.",

This could be the ballgame in the classified documents investigation. I mean, this is the Justice Department making clear that they believe they need Donald Trump's lawyer to testify against him to make the case of either mishandling of classified records or obstruction of justice potentially a case against the former president.This is so serious. And the reason we know that this is so serious is because there are all kinds of signs of that. The amount of steps the Justice Department had to take and the choices that they had to make to try and get Evan Corcoran to this point, to get this ruling from Judge Howell, that is not a small thing for the department to do. And then on top of that, we see Trump scrambling to the appeals court yesterday, trying to put on hold whether Corcoran has to go in to testify to the grand jury. And the appeals court set, what's basically an unheard heard of deadline, courts never move this fast. And they were looking at like a 12-hour period where they wanted the Justice Department to respond. And so now, this is all in the circuit. Before these three judges at the D.C Circuit and they are the ones right now who get to decide, does this Donald Trump defense lawyer testify against Donald Trump?",

So, it is critical information, it is profound, because of how important the attorney client privilege is to pierce that relationship. So, we'll see where it goes, but this is a big step. Now look, and to be clear, it's a lower bar then accusing someone of a crime in court or convicting somebody or, you know, you just have to establish - this is not even probable cause that a crime is committed, but it is a finding by a court that it has and that's significant.",

And they have reason to think that whatever Trump said there is very significant for this investigation.So that is, I mean, those are big things that they're going after illegally to build this case. We don't know if the crime fraud arguments are about the mishandling or about the obstruction - but they all kind of - they all come together, right? Because that's what makes this situation different. As far as we know, from the other documents situations with Joe Biden, Mike Pence, were there finding documents or turning them back over to the federal government.

And according to Brewster there was. The reason why this is the big issue is whether or not they would use - that they could use that information Tacopina in this case, and potentially use it against Stormy Daniels if this were to go to trial and there was some sort of cross examination. So, right now what is in the hands of the judge to determine whether or not the communications rise to the level of a conflict of interest that would require some sort of disqualification for Joe Tacopina, as well as even some sort of limitation, which I've talked to a number of people.

How much and if the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates again. It's the first time we will hear from the Federal Reserve chairman since the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank earlier this month. That happened a bit earlier this month. Joining us now to break all this down, CNN's Matt Egan and Mark Zandi, is the chief economist for Moody's Analytics. Mark - Matt to you first. Let's just put up on the screen. The line of the inflation rate over the past year or so. The Fed has consistently raised rates. The expectation, if you took the banking crisis aside would be that they would raise rates again to try to corral inflation. But a lot of people say enough volatility timeout. What do we expect?",

But if he raises rates, he's kind of amounting to, you know, doubling down on the same conditions that actually helped spawn this banking crisis. Now, some economists want the Fed to pause just last hour, economist Diane Swonk told Kate Bolduan, that's what the Fed should do, do nothing here. Goldman Sachs is predicting that's what will happen. But investors are coalescing around the idea that there will be a rate hike. The last check 85 percent chance. It's being priced into the market of a 25-basis point rate hike. And if that happens, I think it means two things. One, the Fed really means business. They really are trying to get inflation down. But two, it means higher borrowing costs for everyone at home, right, mortgages, credit cards, car loans, and I think the risk is still the same that they end up doing too much and causing recession.",

You know, it goes to capital, the amount of capital that they hold, which is the cash cushion that banks have to digest the losses on their loans and on their securities, it goes to liquidity.
