The White House says it's cautiously optimistic about what that might mean for 2023.CNN's Vanessa Yurkevich joining us now. Vanessa, this inflation measurement is said to be the Fed's favorite. What exactly did it show? VANESSA YURKEVICH, CNN BUSINESS &amp; POLITICS CORRESPONDENT: Yes, this is the personal consumption expenditure price index, also known as PCE. It showed that inflation cooled in November, about 5.5 percent year over year. That is a significant drop from where it was in October when it was 6.1 percent. And that is the lowest annual increase since October 2021, when we started seeing really high inflation. Then month over month, you see there .1 percent. That's great compared to what it was in October when it was .8 percent. And the Federal Reserve likes to see these numbers. This is the last big economic inflation report that they are getting before 2023. And it's a good indication of where they need to go next year. Of course, 5.5 percent still a bit high. They want to see that number at 2 percent. But this is also encouraging for the White House, who is saying that they are cautiously optimistic. They like to see these cooler inflation reports. We've seen a couple over the last month. They're also seeing a strong labor market. They're seeing low unemployment. And they're seeing consumer sentiment rise. For them, they're feeling pretty good about 2023. The only thing they're keeping an eye on is what is happening with the war in Ukraine. That does impact U.S. food and energy prices. It's uncertain what's going to happen in the next year or so there. They're keeping an eye on that. But so far, cautiously optimistic.",

And then you have FedEx saying that they've had major impacts at their hubs in Memphis and Indianapolis. Amazon having to close some locations presumably in the Midwest. And what these shippers are asking us to do, you to do, is to be patient because they are truly trying to get everyone their Christmas gifts on time. But they are fighting against Mother Nature.
