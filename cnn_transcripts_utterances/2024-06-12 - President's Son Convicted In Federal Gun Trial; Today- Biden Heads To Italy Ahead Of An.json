The president's standing by his son, while some Republicans tried to politicize the verdict, and start peddling conspiracy theories. Republicans reportedly having second thoughts about voting to hold Attorney General Merrick Garland in contempt.

For the first time in American history, the child of a sitting president has been convicted of a crime. A jury in Delaware finding Hunter Biden guilty on all three felony charges, two, for lying about his drug use on a federal background check, a third, possessing -- for possessing a gun while addicted to or using illegal drugs. The verdict ended a very stressful week and a half for the Biden family. The trial exposing painful details about the extent of Hunters drug use. The president embracing his just convicted son on a tarmac in Wilmington shortly after the verdict was handed down, the president releasing the statement, quote, as I said last week, I am the president, but I am also a dad, Jill and I love our son and we are so proud of the man he is today. He added: As I also said, last week, I will accept the outcome of this case and will continue to respect the judicial process as Hunter considers an appeal. Reaction came in quickly from across Capitol Hill. Here's a little bit from both sides of the aisle. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

They're just saying we need to trust the justice system.Now, on the other side, I think it's been interesting to see how Republicans are responding to this because, of course, we've heard from some that they are opposed to certain gun laws and they've been using that as one reason to kind of push back on the Hunter conviction here. And we've also seen Republicans say, yeah, maybe they found him guilty in this situation, but this isn't enough. We've heard from example -- for example, James Comer calling for more investigation into Biden family members. So we're seeing them take this and demand more, certainly not, you know, cheering this very loudly from Republicans.",

I mean, the reality is this does undermine some of their arguments that they've been making for the past several years, that the Justice Department, that justice system is biased against conservatives and that Trump is a victim of this. And now, we have Hunter Biden, the son of the sitting president, a Democrat and a very Democratic state who is still being found guilty of federal charges. And so, that doesn't quite neatly fit into this narrative that Republicans have been spinning four, again since 2015, 2016.And so, we're seeing them trying to get around on that, of course. And one of the ways they're trying to get around this is by saying, oh, see, this was just to make people forget about how bad the case was against Trump. They're pointing to this as, you know, politically motivated, still even now, because again, they need to explain this away. How can if the justice system is so rigged, how can Hunter Biden still be found guilty in a Democratic state.",

It's a very close-knit family and there's no question that that Hunters ongoing issues with addiction and then these criminal cases have impacted him. He is invested.The fact that we did see him immediately helicopter to Delaware to see Hunter after this decision came through shows that he is invested in this. The fact that the first lady was there and you know, every -- every day at this trial, this is going to impact the family emotionally and its going to impact Joe Biden as he is trying to run for reelection in a very closely contested race. Whether we see this actually impact 2024 is still an open question. There's no polling that indicates that voters are necessarily going to change their minds around this. But I do think the biggest impact this could have is on Joe Biden's focus and how he's willing to campaign and whether he's willing to set this aside and really focus on what needs to be done. HUNT:  I mean, look, like presidential campaign is a crucible and anything that distracts you has the potential to really kind of effect things from a very -- and he's got this trial coming up in September on tax issues, Hunter does, which is, of course, very squarely in the political calendar.

Do we focus our own internal issues? So, it all plays into the same thing. So, certainly, in terms of Putin's and Xi's wider strategy to assert themselves and fill the vacuum on the global stage, the right-wing helps because it brings all the Western allies into a more national frame of mind if you like, and less involved in international affairs are.",
