I'm Abby Phillip in Washington.More misery and the death toll is still climbing as the aftermath of a brutal winter storm is now sinking in. Historic cold ice and blizzard emergencies, killing at least 47 people across nine states this weekend. And that number is, sadly, expected to rise. Buffalo, New York, has been happens the hardest hit. This is an area that is used to storms, but not like this. This was like a hurricane whipping up heavy, blinding snow, and many roads are still impassable. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MICHAEL SCHWARZ, REPORTER, WKBW-TV:  People were trapped in their car. People are still being pulled out of their car. People are being found dead in their car. That's how crippling this storm was. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

So, they are still dealing with snow in the hours ahead. They are dealing with trying to dig people out the major throughways, all the way from the Pennsylvania border to Rochester are essentially closed because there were so many cars on the road that were just left abandoned, buses, trucks, everything. So, snowplows can barely get through the snow, it is so thick. The mayor of Buffalo pleading, begging people just stay home. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

They are still going through either homes and cars and other place that may not have power. They are concerned about more people who may have perished in this storm.They're also concerned about looting. There are scattered reports of looting. The sheriff of Erie County earlier said that about 12 service stations, convenience stores have been looted. That knocks out the gas pumps which emergency crews will eventually need to gas up vehicles once they can get in. The temperatures are meant to go up at the end of this week.

A lot of these folks have been in this line for hours now. And just a few minutes ago, we counted about four agents or so that are trying to get all these folks onto a new flight. Now, when we're talking about the overall number of canceled flights across the U.S., as of this hour, we are approaching well over 2,200 flights that have been canceled and nearly 5,000 other flights that have been delayed. We have seen this type of numbers the entire weekend. I've been here since Saturday, and today really was one of the busiest days of this airport. We caught up with one woman over on the southwest airline's terminal, just on the other side of where we are, she only traveled because she had to take some medical exams. She was hoping to get back home in time to be with her mother, because she's sick, and now she's stranded, unsure of what she's going to do next. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Now, groups have now gone into the habit of being in touch with NGOs and being ready on scene when these buses arrive to give them blankets, to get them to rest pit (ph) centers.

And President Biden and his team have been trying to prepare for this for months, because of course, the predicate for Title 42 was a public health emergency, otherwise known as COVID.And so, as COVID has come until control, unless this administration and the courts somehow determine that you could keep this rational in place beyond COVID, they're going to need to do something about it. The question is, can there be comprehensive or even remotely comprehensive immigration reform? Something where you could get buy-in from the right flank of the Republican Party and the left flank of the Democratic party and the middle. And we all know what the contours of this would look like if it could happen. My colleague, Hans Nichols, has been writing about this a lot recently. Look, there's an inflationary problem. A lot of that is driven by the type labor market. If you could bring in additional workers, low skilled and high skilled, that could actually offset inflation. And you could get a handle on who's coming in and out of the country. If you could put more money toward border security, that could theoretically bring more Republicans on board. And if you could have a fix for the dreamers, people who -- maybe who are made adults now but were brought here as babies or young children. If you could fix the, kind of, citizenship or residency situation there, that could be a big solution for members of Congress to vote for something like this across the board. The problem is, is that going to happen? Is there any proposition, really, for a compromise? And because this has been such a potent issue for Republicans in, sort of, battering Democrats because, already, the incoming House Republican majority is talking about impeachment proceedings against the Department of Homeland Security Secretary Mayorkas. Whether or not there's any predicate for that. It's just very hard to see the political rational for keeping this conflict subsiding in order for everyone to come together for a deal. So, Biden is trying to figure out how to get a handle on it. But the politics are very, very complicated.",
