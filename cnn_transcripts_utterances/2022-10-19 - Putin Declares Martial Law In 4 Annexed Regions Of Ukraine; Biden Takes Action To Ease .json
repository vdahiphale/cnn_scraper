You know, anecdotally, he can say that, I am seeing far less, far fewer people in the streets than I would normally expect to see, specifically men. And that I think talks to the fact that a lot of men of military age are either, have left the country. Tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands we have seen evacuate the country to avoid military draft. Others are simply staying a low profile because there have been countless incidents of people being picked up on the streets by the authorities and drafted straight into the military, so military age men are avoiding that. I would also say that, you know prices have really shot up here. And that is really important for ordinary Russians. I, mean it is difficult to give you a gauge of how expensive things are here but it is like 70 bucks for a cup of coffee. That kind of thing. And so that has a massive impact. It shows that the sanctions that Russia is currently suffering under, that have been imposed upon it by much of the international community including United States, are having an impact on the cost of living here which has become very, very high indeed. Also, John, I'd say that in the past when I have come here, people didn't even think about the conflict in Ukraine, the special military operation.

What is happening is the judge is mandating the release of these emails from John Eastman to the January 6 committee where Eastman reveals that back in December of 2020, Trump submitted court filings that Trump knew or false. The judge put it this way, he says these emails show that President Trump knew that the specific numbers of voter fraud were wrong but continued to tout those numbers, both in court and to the public.And the judge went on to say here that these emails must now be released to the January 6 committee in particular because they do show criminal activity, meaning they wouldn't be shielded by attorney client privilege. And namely, the criminal activity that this judge says is conspiracy to defraud the United States here. So, again, this is reference of likely criminal activity between the former president and John Eastman. The judge previously, John, did mandate the release of other emails, precisely because of this, because of possible evidence of a crime. So, these latest emails, hated all, they will not be handed over to the committee. Perhaps more crucially here, John, this could add more evidence to the already ongoing probes that are happening in Georgia from the district attorney's office, Fanny Willis there, as well as the department of justice which has this ongoing probe of all things January 6th as well.

The changes are pretty subtle.But, today, inflation is so high that they have to make the sweeping changes. Let's start with the standard deduction which is what most people claim. That is going up by 7 percent. In context, that is the most since the cost of living adjustments were introduced in 1985 under Ronald Reagan. For individuals, that means the standard deduction is going up to almost $14,000. That is a 900-dollar increase. At the same time, we are seeing the rates, the income threshold, that is also gone up by 7 percent. For example, if you are single filer, you made $90,000 in 2022, that is up 24 percent. If you still make $90,000 in 2023, you actually go down to the 22 percent rate. So, you are getting taxed at a smaller amount. Same story for joint fillers. A reminder, these changes do not take effect until 2023. This won't help you on the tax returns that you filed this coming April. Still, John, this is a bit of a silver lining for inflation because it does mean less money going to Uncle Sam, more money staying in our pockets.",

Yes, some anecdotal evidence of some companies laying off workers, but it's not really showing up in a big way that would signal an ongoing or an imminent recession.On the other hand, mortgage rates have gone up very sharply. The most recent report, we saw that the average 30-year fixed rate is now at 6.9 percent. Some context, that is the highest since April of 2002. Now, thankfully, most borrowers, they have a fixed rate, they are not impacted by this. But, if you are in the market for a new home, you want to trade up to a different home, this is going to make it that much harder because the higher mortgage rates go, the last home you can afford. And, John, again, this all goes back to inflation. Mortgage rates are up because the Fed is fighting inflation by raising rates. We are seeing that play out big time in the housing market.",
