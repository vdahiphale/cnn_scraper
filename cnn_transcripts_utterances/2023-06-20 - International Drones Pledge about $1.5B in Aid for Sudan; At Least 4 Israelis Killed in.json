You're watching \"Connect the World\" and you have been watchingCNN's coverage of the federal charges against Hunter Biden the U.S. President's son. More on that as we move through this next hour. The day's other news for you now Israel's Military says it is looking for suspects after a fatal mass shooting in the occupied West Bank. The IDF confirms at least four Israelis have been killed and several others have been wounded in a shooting in the settlement of Eli. This happening a day after six Palestinians were killed when Israeli forces raided Jenin. Elliott Gotkine is back with us this hour from Jerusalem. What further details do we have at this point, Elliott?",

Elliott Gotkine is on the story for you. Well, sirens sounded across key for hours overnight, as Russia launched a massive drone attack on the Ukrainian capital. Ukraine says Iranian Shahed drones coming from all directions. Kyiv says it shut down 32 of the 35 drones that were fired this first drone attack on Kyiv since early this month. Meantime Ukraine says it will continue its offensives on multiple fronts in the South. Yesterday, President Vladimir Zelenskyy said Ukraine has not lost any positions it has just made gains. Police in France French financial police have raided the offices of the Paris 2024 Olympic Games. Prosecutors said searches are tied to investigations involving illegal conflicts of interest relating to contracts, embezzlement and other issues. A spokesman for the Organizing Committee says they are cooperating fully with investigators. The Summer Games of course, start next July. Well, it is World Refugee Day today. And with so many crises around the world, it couldn't be more urgent, the recent migrant boat tragedy in Greece shining a spotlight on the broken migration system in Europe. And in Sudan, the brutal internal conflict there has forced hundreds of thousands of people to flee to neighboring countries. World Refugee Day was originally designed to honor refugees around the world. And this year, the theme is hope, away from home but with the plight of so many refugees only getting worse. We have to ask tonight has World Refugee Day lost its meaning. Well, my next guest is the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi. And he says in a tweet and I quote here on World Refugee Day, we have reached a very sad target. More than 500,000 people have now fled the fighting in Sudan to neighboring countries. Guns must fall silent, if we want to stop this exodus. Filippo Grandi joins me now via Skype from Mombasa, in Kenya. Let me start there with Sudan. And Filippo, it's good to have you on today. As we just mentioned, more than half a million refugees have now fled to neighboring countries out of Sudan, what kind of strain does this place? What is already very tough situation broken ceasefire time and time again the people of Sudan are basically living for a nightmare. Aren't they? FILIPPO GRANDI, U.N. HIGH COMMISSIONER FOR REFUGEES: Absolutely, Becky. I was myself at the border between Egypt and Sudan a little while ago spoke to, many of those arriving from Khartoum telling us of the terrible trauma they had gone through. This was a peaceful city all of a sudden turned into a nightmare. No wonder that we have already 2 million people between those displaced inside and the 500,000. We reach that figure today that has gone to neighboring countries. Many of them like Chad, South Sudan, very fragile countries already so that this crisis has really the potential to have a very bad regional impact if it is not stopped soon.",

Because by the way, Becky, you understand very well that the fighting which starts between the army and this armed group is now translating itself in places like that for into ethnic fighting. And we know the history of that region. And we know the tragedies that went on 20 years ago. That's the risk. That's the very high risk.

Most of this 110 million are fleeing conflict, in fact, violence, discrimination,persecution, but conflict is very, very central. So it's political action that is needed. The original sin of all this, is a much divided world. This is a Security Council that cannot agree on anything. And under those circumstances, wars will not end in those figures will continue. You spoke about our good work. I thank you for that. We do this with many other humanitarian organizations, I would say that the two most needed things are political mediation to stop conflicts, find the right solutions, and but continue to give humanitarians the resources they need to help save lives. You know, let me add one quick point that I think more positive one, if I may, Becky. I'm in Kenya, because here, the country hosting a lot of refugees from Somalia, from South Sudan. The government is adopting new and more open policies to refugees. I wanted to come here to mark this point that there are solutions there are better directions that they need support.",

One did that, of course, the smugglers as you define them I dare say the criminals that are exploiting the misery of people. Really, this needs to be addressed collectively with more muscle and more determination, because we don't see any decrease in their action. But then it also shows, for example, that Europe does not have an efficient rescue at sea system. There's a lot of criticism to NGOs that do rescue at sea. But actually NGOs are filling a gap or doing vital work to rescue people that otherwise would suffer from the same fate. So that is a big gap. The European Commission on the broader scale has now put on the table, this European pact on migration and asylum. Is it perfect? No. And I think I've said it even in programs with you, it's not perfect, but that's what we have. So it is very important that States agree on sharing the responsibility for these arrivals and addressing the routes through which people come not just stopping at their borders, but going upstream, all the way to where these movements begin. This is the only way to address these are not easy. These are solutions that are not easy to translate into political slogans. These are complex solutions. But that's the only way forward that Europe and other States must embark upon.",

Your headlines are up watching for more news from the coast ofNewfoundland in Canada ships and planes searching the area for a missing submersible with five people on board. It has their air supply, which will be dwindling. The Titan sub had set out on Sunday to view the wreck of the Titanic when it lost contact with its support ship. Israel's Military confirms four Israelis have been killed and several others wounded in a mass shooting in the West Bank settlement of Eli. The IDF says one terrorist was neutralized by a civilian and the search is on for others. The shooting happened the day after six Palestinians were killed when Israeli forces raided Jenin. Well, U.S. President Joe Biden is maintaining support for his son Hunter. U.S. Justice Department court filings show that Hunter Biden will plead guilty to two misdemeanor federal tax charges and has also reached a deal on a gun charge. Sources say the Justice Department will recommend probation for the tax cases. His lawyer says this resolves a five year investigation. We want to take a closer look at the story of the missing submersible. Let's have a look at the size of this vessel. Five people on board it lost communication with its mother ship on Sunday while exploring the wreckage of the Titanic. Last year, a CBS News Correspondent follows report highlighting just how tight the quarters are inside that OceanGate Expeditions sub. Have a look at this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And in 2018, I dida story about Titan, the submersible that's now missing and I was really struck by one thing, how simple almost rudimentary. Some of the technology on board seem to this is a tiny vessel, as you mentioned, it's quite cramped, can only fit five people sitting inside. And it's operated by a gaming controller what effectively looks like a Play Station controller and yet the company OceanGate told me they were extremely confident at that point that they could safely make this remarkable journey to the Titanic dive 13,000 feet down into the ocean. And that the Titan could handle 150 million pounds of pressure at the ocean floor and the company CEO Stockton Rush told me that the pressure vessel with its carbon fiber structure, the actual structure of Titan would have no problem handling that they said they worked with NASA and Boeing to design that vessel. And that they did not cut any corners or costs when it came to safety. Now that said Becky, we have learned that Titan had some communication issues in the past. They lost communication with their support crew during an expedition last year, according to a CBS News story, and the vessel was lost for about two hours. During that incident, they were unable to get messages from their support crew on the surface which they really rely on. When they're underwater to figure out where they're going. There's no GPS onboard. So a lot of questions here, Becky, as to what went wrong.",

Secondly, we need swiftly mechanisms of disembarkation of the people that are rescued and need desperately support and assistance. And last but not least, we need that there is solidarity among the European Union member States, which means in very concrete terms. That those who are rescued will be reallocated to other countries because the burden cannot stay only on the most exposed geographically countries. But we also need to return those who cannot stay to their countries of origin. And these three building blocks are urgent because the figures show that as you said, there are people dying.",
