Officials say they have downed 13 drones out of two waves of attacks on the capital Kyiv. This part of a -- really just a worsening Russian air and missile war over Ukraine.",

Is this a major upgrade in terms of technology?",

      "speaker": "LEIGHTON",
      "sentences": "Yes, it is. Well, one of the things, Jim, is that it uses a - what's called a phased array radar. So what that means is the patriot system can actually hone in on a target using multiple beams without changing the antenna configuration, that they don't have to move the antennas, they don't have to do anything like that. A lot of the systems that the Ukrainians have right now, whether they're the old Soviet era systems or newer systems from NATO countries, they are basically designed in some cases at least to be less reliant on technology and more physically reliant. So, what that would mean is that those systems would require the physical movement of antennas. They could then determine where the missiles are. So, it's a much more complex undertaking than the Ukrainians have right now. The patriot system will overcome that if it's deployed to Ukraine.",

There are countries in the Middle East, for instance, U.S. partners against - as a defense against Iranian missiles.I wonder, this is a massive and expanding Russian air and missile assault on Ukraine, and particularly the targets in recent weeks have been on infrastructure that impact the lives of civilians. That's deliberate here. How many of these systems, given that this is the largest country in Europe, does Ukraine need to make a dent in Russia's air war?",

      "sentences": "That's a really interesting question. Generally, what you want to do, Jim, is if you deploy the patriot system, you want to deploy it to the areas that you want to defend most. So, it would be logical for the Ukrainians to deploy it around Kyiv, for example, and around cities like Dnipro and the newly - perhaps the newly liberated Kherson, certainly around Kharkiv, any of the areas where they want to protect their infrastructure, which, you know, generally speaking could mean the entire country in the ideal way.A lot of people compare the patriot system to the iron dome system that the Israelis have. The Iron Dome is based in - or on patriot technology but Israel has a -- much less of a surface area to worry about than Ukraine does. Ukraine's about the size of Texas. And it's really impossible to defend the whole country. So, you want to pick the targets that you want to protect and you want to make sure that you protect air bases, that you protect government installations and population centers. So that would be where they would deploy them. How many? You know, you're probably looking at somewhere between - you know, if I were doing this, around five to ten batteries of that type. That would be a pretty big order. And that would be, you know, somewhere around a $10 billion commitment if it - if we went to, you know, maximize with the patriot deployment (INAUDIBLE).",

Of course it depends on the specific type of patriot system that would -- there are different models, but the system is capable of downing drones. It has been used by the Israelis to down Hamas based drones. It has been used in other conflicts like the conflicts with the Houthis in Yemen, between Saudi Arabia and the Houthis. So, it can be used for that purpose.And, of course, the Houthis have used Ukrainian drones as well. So, there is some operational significance here and some operational history with these types of weapons. And it can be used in that way.",

Preparing temporary facilities to process people. Shoring up ground and air transportation to move bodies, either to lateral points along the border or back to their origin country or increase referrals of prosecution. So, all of those things are in motion.And we should note here, Jim, that the reason this is ending is because of a lower court order that said the administration could no longer use this authority. Now, of course, the White House is under increasing pressure about what is going to happen in the next few days and weeks. And we have been told that lawmakers have been calling administration officials on a more frequent basis. Sources also told us about a call between Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and President Biden's chief of staff, Ron Kline, where those concerns were also shared.

I think a couple of images here and, you know, this is obviously hard to talk about in the context of this person who everyone knew and loved who has just died, but if you look at - this is an image of the heart. Sort of in the middle of - on the left, the bright red area, that's the aorta, the major blood vessel that comes off the heart and supplies blood to the whole body. Sometimes that blood vessel there can become weakened and sort of become more balloon-like as the walls become weakened, and you can see that sort of in the image on the right.And, again, what I'm describing here is rare. I just want to emphasize that again. But if it does become a balloon-like sort of structure as you see on the right, the wall is weakened and it can rupturing, meaning blood, well, just coming out of the heart can now, you know, bleed into the chest cavity and cause the symptoms and then subsequently the death of someone like Grant Wahl. Sometimes the blood might dissect into the walls of the blood vessel. But whatever the reason, it's a catastrophic problem. Very hard to treat.
