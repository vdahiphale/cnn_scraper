On behalf of the FBI, I would like to say that we are with you we're with Baltimore and we, with the partners, every step of the way. The FBI, on very first, looking at and assessing this matter from an investigative standpoint, I want to be clear that there is no specific or credible information to suggest that there are ties to terrorism in this incident. The FBI has been part of this response from the beginning. We came within one hour to the command post and quickly latched up with our very strong partners all along the way. We will bring whatever resources that the FBI has to bear. We've already brought our crisis response, our victim services and just recently our underwater search evidence recovery teams are on site, and we will continue to provide all those resources as long as it takes. And as the investigation goes on we will take it to its logical conclusion along with our partners. To the people of Baltimore, to the public, I ask you to be patient as we go through this and as information becomes available to us. And, lastly, I want to say thank you. Thank you to our partners. Thank you to everyone who -- in the FBI and counts on the FBI, we will always bring what we need to the people of Baltimore and we are with you. Next, I'd like to introduce the Coast Guard.",

So, it was very important to get infrared technology not only on the water but also in the air above the scene.As far as where we are now, we have, as of about an hour ago, and I suspect this number has probably increased a little bit, we had eight dive teams that were deploying out onto the incident scene itself, which encompasses about 50 divers.

It was it was obviously very dark.So, when we deployed people onto the water, we were lucky that we had clear skies overhead and we were able to give them aircraft reconnaissance above us and that over-watch factor when we put people out, we didn't dive in darkness.

      "sentences": "Right now, reproductive rights are back on the Supreme Court docket nearly two years after the landmark ruling Roe versus Wade was overturned. The high court is hearing critically important oral arguments in a case that could restrict access to the widely used abortion drug, Mifeprostone, even in states where the procedure is still allowed.The pill is one of two drugs used in reproductive health care, including for medication abortions and treatments for miscarriage. Just last year, research shows it was used in 63 percent of all abortions nationwide. The Supreme Court, which has a conservative supermajority, now has to decide if the FDA overstepped its authority by making it easier to access this drug. We're going to listen into oral arguments right now. Let's go to that now. JUSTICE SAMUEL ALITO, U.S. SUPREME COURT:  -- more frequent emergency room care visits related to the use of Mifepristone when dispensed by mail from the clinic. There are no apparent increases in other serious adverse events related to Mifepristone use. Does that really count as a reasoned explanation to the suggestion that the data shows there are going to be more emergency room visits? The increase in emergency room visits is just of no consequence. It doesn't even merit some comment.",

      "sentences": "That is a reasoned explanation. What FDA was observing in that passage is that, although it acknowledged the fact that some of the studies reported additional emergency room visits that didn't equate to additional serious adverse events. And, in fact, one of the studies, half of the women who went to the emergency room didn't get any treatment at all.Many women might go because they're experiencing heavy bleeding, which mimics a miscarriage, and they might just need to know whether or not they're having a complication. But in that kind of circumstance, the woman is not having a serious adverse event from Mifepristone, and so it doesn't call into question the safety determinations regarding the drug. And, you know, at the end of the day, FDA carefully parsed those studies. It made specific determinations about the results to be gleaned with respect to safety and efficacy. It fully explained its decision-making, and I think it falls well within the zone of reasonableness under arbitrary and capricious review.",
