Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes and his favorite target, Travis Kelce taking on the Splash Brothers, Steph Curry and Klay Thompson of the Warriors, in Vegas. And with Steph's reputation as a scratch golfer, the Super Bowl champs went in as heavy underdogs here, but every dog has its day. And after finishing the first hole tied, Mahomes and Kelce won the next three to go three up and cruise to the victory. But it wasn't just about the golf, of course. The goal of The Match is to raise money for the No Kid Hungry campaign which works to end childhood hunger here in the U.S. It's a great cause.

I've been at this -- been at this for -- been at this for 34 years at the same place and over 40 years in broadcasting, and I'm stunned. So, thank you so much. I appreciate that very much. (END VIDEO CLIP) MANNO:  Big congrats to Ernie there, one of the best in the business. He's going to join Sir Charles in the Hall of Fame now because Barkley was inducted two years ago. But a really nice moment there and a fun event. Just down the road in Vegas, the two best teams in WNBA squaring off. The Aces and the New York Liberty both loaded up this off-season, finally facing each other Thursday night. The Aces did what they've been doing all season long, though. The defending champs pulling away in the second half with all five of their starters scoring in double figures in the 98-81 win. Vegas improves to 14-1, becoming the third team in WNBA history to start a season with one loss in their first 15 games. The other two went on to win the championship. Lingering smoke from the wildfires in Canada delayed yesterday's game between the Padres and Pirates in Pittsburgh for 45 minutes. The air quality was so bad that Pirates star Andrew McCutchen put on a mask after hitting a single in the first inning. He and other players questioning whether that game really should have been played at all. Look how bad it was. Pittsburgh ended up winning 5-4 despite those hazy conditions. And another wild weather story. The calendar says it's summer, Christine, but this looked more like a winter wonderland before the Dodgers-Rockies game in Denver. The area hit with severe storms covering Coors Field with this pea-sized hail. But the players were loving it. They embraced it. Rookies catcher Elias Diaz playing around like a kid on a snow day. Once the game got going you've got to give a heads-up to the grounds crew as well. The Rockies didn't fare too well. The Dodgers ended up getting the win. But still, how funny is that -- just slipping and sliding? A different kind of sliding than we're used to.",

It's FAA hiring.I think the big thing from the consumer perspective is that there is low trust in airlines right now. Only 16 percent of Americans said that they trust airlines a lot. That's low already. Airlines have been starting to kind of rebuild that trust since the issues that happened over the winter and now, this stands to be a bit of a test again. And I think where potential high points come in is when airlines are able to help customers when their flight is delayed. Sometimes you can't help if a flight needs to be delayed or canceled because of weather or staffing issues. But where consumers really start to lose that trust is when they don't feel like they're getting the customer service from the airlines to right the wrong. So whether that's accommodations being covered or being rebooked -- and the problem is with so many people disrupted, it's really hard to get that service right now. So it looks like that's where the dots need to be connected to kind of rebuild that trust.",

I think it's going to need to be a bit seamless for consumers to adopt it. And the reason for that is as you said, search engines are still the most popular way that people search for travel and book travel, and that's because they like to have some control over the process. There's not a lot of trust in generative AI to this point. So the moreit gets integrated into the tools and feels seamless the more customers are going to actually adopt it. But for now, they're kind of in favor of taking the reins themselves to make sure that they're getting the best value for their money and the best options in travel because it is a huge investment and people want to make sure that they're spending --",
