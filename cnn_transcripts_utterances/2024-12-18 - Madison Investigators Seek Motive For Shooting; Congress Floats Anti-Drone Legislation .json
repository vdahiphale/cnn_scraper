A teacher and student were shot and killed at a private Christian school. Six other people were injured. Madison's police chief says the biggest priority right now is determining the shooter's motive.As of now, it's still not clear how 15-year-old Natalie Rupnow got the handgun used in the attack. But this photo from her dad's Facebook page shows her at a gun range in August. Court documents show that her parents were divorced and remarried multiple times and that she moved between their homes every two or three days. The turbulent home life causing her to enroll in therapy, according to reports. All these details coming out in the Washington Post. Meantime, hundreds of people gathered outside the Wisconsin State Capitol last night to honor the victims. Here's part of the mayor's message. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MAYOR SATYA RHODES-CONWAY, MADISON, WISCONSIN: We will never be the same, but we will get through this, and we will get through this together by relying on each other and by taking care of each other.

Joining us now is Democratic Congressman Seth Magaziner of Rhode Island. He's on the Homeland Security Committee. Congressman, will you get a briefing -- will your committee get a briefing on this? What can you tell us and what's your sense of what you're hearing so far?REP. SETH MAGAZINER (D-RI), HOMELAND SECURITY COMMITTEE: Yes, on the Homeland Security Committee, we've had a number of briefings on drones over the last couple weeks in both classified and unclassified settings. And the bottom line is this, you know, there's two types of politicians in Washington. There's the type of politician that just always wants attention and will say provocative things in order to attract attention and then there's people who tell the truth. And, in this case, the real truth is that most of these drone sightings across the northeast in recent weeks have very boring explanations. They are either civilian small aircraft, civilian drones, and most of them, if not all of them have very boring run of the mill explanations. That being said, I'm glad that we're having this conversation about drones, nonetheless, because it does call attention to the fact that our laws are very outdated in this country when it comes to drones. State and local law enforcement have very limited authorities to track drones, to bring them down if they're over sensitive areas. I'm on a bill that would change that and would give more authority to state and local law enforcement to engage in counter drone technology because it is important and we don't want drones flying over sensitive areas, whether that be operated by a bad actor or just by a hobbyist who is inadvertently sending drones someplace where they shouldn't.",

You know, this is one of the most concerning things about the incoming Trump administration is that Donald Trump feels emboldened to go after his political opponents, to use the FBI and the Department of Justice to do it. You know, in this case, he's talking about Liz Cheney and the January 6th Committee. They were just doing their job in putting information out to the public about what happened during the attack on the Capitol. And now, he's trying to punish them for it. I mean, this is something that should concern all of us. It should concern, you know, members of law enforcement, the FBI, the Capitol Police who risk their lives to maintain public safety. And you know, we have to call it out for what it is.This would be an absolute abuse of power by Donald Trump. We cannot allow this to become normalized. And you know, he's doing this, I think, not just to go after people like Liz Cheney who he wants to exact revenge against, but also to create a chilling effect so that others won't have the confidence to speak out against him when he does something wrong. But we have to find the courage to keep speaking out when need be. This is absolutely one of those times. And look, we'll work with the Trump administration when it's good for the country and productive, but if he starts abusing his power in this way, we are absolutely going to call him out, and we're not going to let him get away with it.",

The Dow is up over 235 at the moment. When the market closed yesterday, it was the nineth straight day down. The longest losing streak since 1978 when Jimmy Carter was president.Another factor influencing today's markets is an expected interest rate cut. The Federal Reserve could do that just hours from now. That's expected. In other words, borrowing money may be about to get a little cheaper. Let's discuss with CNN's Matt Egan, who joins us in Washington. You should be in New York following the markets, but there's big news happening in Washington today.

I think this is one of those things that sounds a little bit worse than it really is. But look, I haven't seen a losing streak like this in my lifetime. Like you mentioned 1978 the last time. And if the Dow closed down today, this would actually be the longest losing streak in half a century.But it's important to remember that this is just the Dow. The Dow is only 30 stocks. The smart money doesn't really look at what the Dow does. They look at the broader market. The S&amp;P 500, not down nearly as much. The NASDAQ is still near record highs. But listen, there has been a mood shift in the market. There was all that euphoria after the election, and I think some of that has started to fade. Now, investors are starting to have to pay attention to not just the pro-business parts of the Trump agenda, like tax cuts and deregulation, but also the risks around tariffs and mass deportation. And you could see the ride in the market get bumpier from here as investors start to think about some of the negatives too.",

So, the Fed almost has to cut rates because if they don't, they're going to freak out investors and they don't want to do that.And this is good news for borrowers, right? If you're trying to get a mortgage or a car loan trying to pay off credit card debt, it's nice that borrowing costs have finally started to come down. But yes, we are expecting fed officials to signal that they're going to tap the brakes on interest rate cuts for 2025. And it is kind of an awkward time to cut rates when you think about it. I mean, there's no recession in sight. The progress on inflation has started to stall, and there are risks that the Trump agenda could be inflationary. So, that's what we have heard from a few Fed officials, former Fed officials, in the last few days who said, listen, maybe the Fed shouldn't be cutting right now, and perhaps they should pause.",
