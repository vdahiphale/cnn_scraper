      "sentences": "The mercenary boss for the group behind a coup attempt in Russia earlier this summer now believe to be dead. Yevgeny Prigozhin was reportedly on this plane. Look at these pictures, it plummeted out of the sky on Wednesday and it was captured on camera. You see it there going right past what looks like some sort of tower as it goes down and it smashes into the ground at a very high rate of speed. It then bursts into flames.According to the flight manifest, seven passengers and three crew members were on board that plane. In addition to Prigozhin according to Russian authorities, two of his top lieutenants were also passengers. None of the remains have been identified, but they have been taken off to a forensic lab for testing. In the 24 hours following the crash, the Kremlin has remained silent about the incident. Vladimir Putin was at an event on Wednesday when the news broke, but neither he nor his team have said a word about it. I'm joined now by the Founding Partner and Washington correspondent of Puck, Julie Ioffe. Julie Ioffe, thank you so much for coming on. I want to talk to you first about this. I want to show this picture of the 22 or so people who have either died or been poisoned or been jailed during this Putin regime. Many of them political dissidents who have spoken, only spoken against Putin. What are the chances that Prigozhin died in an accident not in something else that is that is backed by Putin?",

      "sentences": "Well, two things. First of all, I think it's very unlikely that he died in an accident. And the reason is, the people you showed up on the screen are actually two different categories of people. Some are actual dissidents, or competition for power pretenders to power. And then there are other people like Alexander Litvinenko, the FSB agent who defected and was poisoned with polonium, like Prigozhin who were seen, not as dissidents or critics, but as traitors. And that Putin has said repeatedly is something that is completely unforgivable. And it's what he said on the morning of January 24th, when he addressed the nation. And he said, those who have taken the path of betrayal of treachery, will be met with punishment. It is something he has constantly said is unforgivable.And so, the fact that on the second -- two-month anniversary to the day, that if Yevgeny Prigozhin launched his so-called March of Fairness on Moscow, that his plane explodes out of the sky, the idea that he is anything but a traitor being punished for his treachery is, I think, slim to none.",

And afterwards he started going into the restaurant business, he did, in fact, become a caterer but the catering business, you know that the fact that he became known as \"Putin Chef\" was, in some ways, a tongue and cheek title, because the catering business was actually a front. He was supposed to be providing meals to schoolchildren in Moscow and St. Petersburg, to the police, to the army. But in fact, all that money hundreds of millions of dollars, were going right out the back door to fund Wagner, this private military company that was active in eastern Ukraine in 2014, and Syria in 2015. All over the African continent, places where the Russian government wanted to have influence but wanted to also have plausible deniability.And the food was often so bad that Putin's caterer provided that in 2018, hundreds of children in Moscow got dysentery, because none of the money was actually going to food. But he was also let's recall involved in trying to influence the 2016 presidential election here, and he was indicted by Robert Mueller in 2018. And he has always -- he had always denied it -- he had denied any connection to Wagner. But in the last year, he started bragging about it, including bragging about interfering, meddling in the U.S. presidential election.",

And that's the case you're making. And I think that's the essence at least part of the essence of Nikki Haley's candidacy. She did well to give an answer that will appeal to general election audiences. And I think that was the answer you heard her give last night.I think overall, her performance last night was quite good in the sense that she actually presented a case for why she ought to be the Republican nominee. She presented herself as someone who could be electable and she was different. She was a breath of fresh air on that stage. And it can be hard to stand out. As Terry and I know, when you prepare candidates for debates like this, it is really about how do you get separation? How do you show yourself to be different? And I think she did that last night.",

And right now, Ron DeSantis, is in that number two spot, he is in the number two spot in a lot of state polling, in the national polling. So, he would be the natural target. And if I were giving advice, I would say you probably got to do something to go at DeSantis.He came out last night untouched, which basically means it was a win for him, he was able to essentially continue cruising where he is. He was able, I think, to address some questions about his campaign. And so, I'm just -- I am a little confused about why the candidates, why the other candidates didn't come after him.",

And that has brought more of those populists into the party, that that I'm looking at his slogan is \"America First.\"So, I think there is a divide between more of the hawks were more aggressive on foreign policy, and more isolationist, and that's just traditionally within the party over the last decade or more.",
