People are lined up anxious to take a picture in front of the different plastic figurines. This is the year of the rabbit. There are families here. There are tourists here, all anxious to take pictures and in many cases just a few selfies. This is a big shift from last year at this time when much of Asia had a lot of restrictions, even lockdowns. In mainland China, things have opened up and as such, we have seen busy airports, busy train stations. During this roughly month-long period, it`s estimated there may be as many as 2 billion individual trips out of this broader population of 1.4 billion people. While some health officials are expressing concern, the Chinese government feels that COVID has peaked in many places. As far as the year of the rabbit, it`s a symbol of peace and prosperity, a wish that many people here in Hong Kong hope to share with the rest of the world. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Dating back to the 15th century, Machu Picchu is the youngest of these oldies but goodies. Right now, the world heritage site Machu Picchu is closed. It`s among the greatest artistic and architectural sites in the world built as a legacy of the Inca civilization in Peru in the 15th century and then later abandoned. Built 2,400 meters above the sea level, the landmark site is made of approximately structures. And did you know what exactly it was used for is still a mystery to this day. This week, the government shut down Machu Picchu indefinitely as anti- government protests across the country grow. We`ll hear more now from Rafael Romo, senior Latin American affairs editor of CNN worldwide, who has the story. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

Anti-government protests have choked transportation to and from the ancient citadel rail operators say they`ve had to suspend services because several tracks have been blocked or damaged by protests that have spread throughout the country. In the past month, dozens of people have been killed in violent clashes. The fiery protest erupting after the ousting of former President Pedro Castillo in December. Demonstrators are demanding new elections and calling for the resignation of current Peruvian President Dina Boluarte. The civil unrest has stranded tourists before. Last month, authorities evacuated hundreds of people after similar transit issues at Machu Picchu. Officials say this time around, some tourists have left by foot, but the trick is at least six to seven hours long. Machu Picchu usually draws more than a million tourists a year but it`s now off limits. Peru`s national treasure overshadowed by its spiraling political crisis. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
