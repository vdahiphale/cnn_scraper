This Tuesday and another jam packed news hour coming up for you too, including MiamiFormer U.S. President Donald Trump in Florida and just hours away from his arraignment on 37 federal charges tied to the mishandling of classified documents. Trump says he'll plead not guilty. We take you live to Miami ahead of his appearance later today. Plus hometown horror at least 11 people have lost their lives after a massive Russian airstrike in the Ukrainian City where President Zelenskyy was born. Well, this as Kyiv claims battlefield victories against Russia in both the East and South of the nation. And inflation watch the latest U.S. consumer price data showing pressure easing for an 11th straight month. Prices up and expected 4 percent annualized. That's a sizable drop though from the net 5 percent level seen in April. The most important data for decision making at the Federal Reserve this week, though, is the core inflation number. And that came in at 5.3 percent. That's still way too high for comfort. Just a reminder call strips out what are volatile food and energy prices to get a real sense of underlying inflation. Well, we'll discuss what the Fed could should and will do not always the same things with Allianz and Gramsci Advisor, Mohamed El Erian later in the show. In the meantime, I'll let you look at the market reaction U.S. stocks still pointing to a higher open the S&amp;P 500 beginning today's session at a one year high that's up 13 percent so far on the year. Tech still the outperformance with Apple closing at fresh all-time highs on Monday. And gains in Asia too as the Chinese Central Bank cuts borrowing costs reports say the Chinese government is now considering larger fiscal stimulus to help support its slowing economy also and Japan's NIKKEI closing above 33,000 for the first time in 33 years for some reason that sounds auspicious. Toyota is the big NIKKEI winner jumping 5 percent on plans to build electric vehicles with longer range batteries. As you can see, lots to get to this hour as always, and we begin with the latest on Donald's latest day in court. The Former President facing federal criminal charges here you can see the Former President at his hotel in Miami on the eve of that arraignment his calls on his supporters to come out and protest. Carlos Suarez joins us now. Carlos what are we expecting whether that's from the Former President himself perhaps the security arrangements at the court today and also potential for people to come in and show support for the Former President too?",

Two dozen reported at the beginning of the day injured as a result of a hit against a residential block in that central industrial city of Ukraine. This is part of an ongoing campaign that we're all too familiar with, with the deliberately targeting of civilian infrastructure and civilians themselves by the Russians. But on the battlefield, it is the Ukrainians of the moment that have most of the initiative. They are continuing to advance south of the embattled city of Bakhmut with some significant advances now being made in a salient of territory there several settlements being claimed by the Ukrainians has ever been liberated. And I think more significantly, perhaps a very substantial increase in the level of Ukrainian attacks on the Zaporizhzhia front line that is an East West line running from Zaporizhzhia controlled by the Ukrainians through to Russian controlled Donetsk where the Ukrainians have been throwing more and more troops and material at the fight there in a hope to try and break- through I think. I think we're probably moving beyond the probing attacks that we've been seeing about a week ago or so or even a few days ago to something more substantial coming from the Ukrainians as part of the early stages, I think of their much vaunted offensive, Julia.",

In the last hour, we learned that U.S. consumer prices rose by 0.1 percent last month, and what up 4 percentfrom a year ago that's actually sharply lower than April's 4.9 percent level. An ongoing drop in energy prices helping cool things down but we did see food prices rising and a pickup in that once again. So what does this mean for Federal Reserve policymakers who insist it's all about the data. They raise rates by a quarter point last month a 10th straight rate hike since March of 2022. Joining us now is Mohamed El-Erian, his Chief Economic Adviser at Allianz and Gramercy. He's also the President of Queens College, Cambridge University. Mohamad, fantastic to have you on the show as always! You wrote a fantastic article in the FT this week, looking ahead at what the Federal Reserve could, should, and probably will do? And your framing of it was great. It was sort of a battle of the -- over the decisions that they have to make, and perhaps what they will end up doing is not the right one. Let's start very simply, what should a data dependent Federal Reserve be doing this week? MOHAMED EL-ERIAN, CHIEF ECONOMIC ADVISOR, ALLIANZ AND GRAMERCY: A data dependent central bank should be hiking interest rates this week, by a quarter of a percentage points. While inflation is coming down, it is not coming down fast enough. And core inflation, what measures the underlying facing the pressure is starting to stabilize at around 5 percent, which is way too high. So a data dependent fed that simply responds to data and doesn't look forward strategically, should be hiking.",

You know, what a lot of people don't realize is that the tools that central bank have don't act immediately. They tend to act with a lag, the so called long and variable lag. So when you are just responding to data, and not looking forward 12 to 18 months, the big risks you'll have is that you'll be doing something that may make sense in the short term, but will be policy mistake over time.",

And it also undermines the point that you're making at the beginning about their reiterating the fact that they're data dependent, it just further chips away credibility. How important is that really, Mohamed? EL-ERIAN: It is very important, because central banks need that credibility for two things, one for policy effectiveness, and the other for political independence. They are the one politically independent policy maker in the ecosystem. And as such, they have enormous power but with that comes responsibility and accountability. So that's why it's really important that they don't make a yet another policy mistake.",

Could you also make the argument that while perhaps the inflation target doesn't apply in this world, the labor markets change, there's a stickiness about people letting workers go, particularly in the post pandemic era that sort of gives them some leeway, and some flexibility perhaps, to do as they've done? EL-ERIAN: Oh, absolutely. That's the argument I've been making. I've been pushing back consistently, as you know, against this notion that the U.S. all fall into recession, there is no need for the U.S. to fall into recession. As you point out, the labor market is very solid. Job vacancies are 1.8 times the unemployment level. So there is still scope in the labor market, to carry us through in more difficult environment. So the Fed itself has been consistently wrong on unemployment, it has been predicting unemployment much higher than what has actually transpired. So it has been too optimistic on inflation, and too pessimistic on unemployment.

What do you make of the message? I think that sort of bond markets are sending now that stock markets are sending tied too. What is likely to be in your mind is reframing of the Federal Reserve's message on what they see?

There's clearly and we talk about it almost every day, I think on the show the debate in education in how best to handle this tool or weapon, how do you feel? Can I ask you at Queens College about how this should be perhaps utilized, handled for those perhaps that could utilize it to take exams or support their education? EL-ERIAN: So we are thinking through it, like every innovation, you get two reactions. The first reaction is you get a balance of excitement and anxiety, excitement at what this technology allows. And generative AI allows a lot of customization in education, but also fear as to what it enables. You know, I'm old enough to remember when the programmable calculator came in; people didn't want us to stop using the slide rule. It sounds absurd now, but there was somehow a fear that by using calculators, we would lose all ability to do arithmetic in our head. The other reaction is that by reducing a barrier to entry, which AI does in a very powerful manner, people over produce it and over consume it. So those two things are playing out today. It will take us time everybody in society to find the right equilibrium, but I'm generally excited. I'm excited because AI is an equalizer more than it is a un-equalizer, it can provide a lot more opportunity for people, both the lower income groups within the western economies, but especially those in developing countries, so I'm excited.

Over 300 million people use dating apps worldwide, according to report by business of apps and in a crowded market led by the likes of Tinder, Badoo and Bumble, one startups aiming for a tech driven edge over the competition. Teaser AI is using artificial intelligence to overcome a major shortcoming in the dating game. The amount of time wasted in small talk that perhaps goes nowhere in the early stages. Teaser as it learns about your habits and interests and potential matches can chat to your avatar, before moving on to person to person conversations. Prices start at $19.99 a week, we're going to discuss that Daniel Liss is the Co-founder and CEO of Teaser AI, and he joins us now. I love this, when I read about it, so we're going to have some fun, in your own words, what's the problem really, that you're trying to fix? DANIEL LISS, CO-FOUNDER &amp; CEO OF TEASER AI: The problem we're trying to fix, I mean, on a macro scale is what the Surgeon General in the U.S. has called the epidemic of loneliness, right? One in two Americans is reporting feeling lonely. And that rate actually doubles for young adults compared to seniors. So a decade into dating apps, which the technology industry thought would solve a lot of issues that we found in dating. We have the average singles on three of these apps and are not seeing results. So we're really starting from the big problem of trying to right the wrongs of what the dating industry has created over the last, you know, 20 years or 10 years of mobile dating.",

And so our users kept on saying to us, I spend and we could see when they would show us their phone, you know, they're spending seven hours a day on their phone, at least an hour a day on their constellation of dating apps. And maybe they got particularly the young women a lot of matches, but it would be what we call this graveyard of ghosting. You would spend this hour a day getting all the matches together. And then no one would ever say anything. And so you're left in this incredibly frustrated experience where you're investing all this time and hope and energy to meet someone and that wasn't happening. And so that was the problem really, that we decided to tackle. And of course, we're using generative AI this new technology as one of our efforts to tackle that problem.",

So ifyou ghost people just like an Uber rating or a Karma score on Reddit, if you're a bad writer, or you're a bad participant in the Reddit community, your ghosting score will go down on teaser AI. And on top of that, in the actual architecture of the app, we reduce the number of matches that you can make or likes that you can have we call them picks. So there are only 16 people that you can be engaging with, at any one time. Now to some of your viewers that may seem like a lot. But for the average person on a dating app today, really their messages panel is probably hundreds of matches where a lot of nothing is going on. And on top of that, I think the feature we're most excited about introducing next is what we're calling auto match. So we have all this data on your swiping preferences, who likes you what your interests are keywords that you keep on bringing up in your conversations, and we're going to auto match people all in the efforts of reducing the amount of time they're spending on the app, and getting them on better dates faster.",
