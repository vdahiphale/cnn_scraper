That's according to a statement from the Palestine Red Crescent.A seven-hour corridor opened about three hours ago for people to evacuate to the south, especially from around another health care institution, the embattled Al-Shifa Hospital. The IDF says the route will stay open until 4 p.m. local time, about four hours from now. Gaza's largest hospital has been caught for days in the middle of fierce fighting between Israeli troops and Hamas. And with some 20,000 people sheltered in and around the hospital, the situation is desperate. The Hamas-controlled health ministry in Gaza said three newborn babies have died since Friday night at Al-Shifa Hospital after nearby shelling knocked out a generator supplying oxygen to the neonatal unit. Gaza Health official tells CNN the other infants were hand carried to operating rooms which still had oxygen. Now, like other hospitals across Gaza, Al-Shifa is nearly out of food, water, medicine, fuel, and electricity with staff often working by flashlight. The IDF denies the hospital is under siege or that it's been hit by Israeli forces. Here's what the Prime Minister had to say on Saturday. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

We only have seven ambulances left out of 18 ambulances who are running now in Gaza City, and basically five. Yes, I just notified they are now only five. So five ambulances out of 18 ambulances are still running in Gaza City and the North, those that are run by the Palestine Red Crescent. Our teams are reporting they have seen many people who are killed, many people who are injured in certain areas inside Gaza.But because of Israeli tanks, they are existed inside the cities and they are denying access of our emergency medical staff and ambulances. Any ambulance, any pharmacist try to reach those wounded people or killed people, they will be a target. That's why the situation is catastrophic. There is tens of people, dozens of people who are now just on the ground, no emergency, no ambulances can reach out to them. We call in the inter community to continue advocating to ensure delivery aid to Gaza City and the North.

I think what's frankly the most crucial aspect is that as long as there is continued bombardment of Gaza by Israeli forces, then it becomes very difficult to imagine the ability of there to be constructive negotiations and mediation of this nature. Again, this has been something that has been brought up many timeswithin the context of Israeli press and elsewhere. But Netanyahu and his government have made it very clear that their focus is really to pummel Gaza into submission, particularly the north. Then of course there are other associated factors here in terms of forcing a displacement of most, you know, Palestinians from the north, if not all of them down to the south. Israeli television yesterday just indicated that 1.7 out of 2.2 million Palestinians cannot go to their homes because they're either displaced or their homes have been destroyed or damaged. 1.7 million of 2.2 so that's the vast majority of the Palestinian population in Gaza, most of whom by the way are young people or children. It's against that backdrop that we then have this conversation around hostages. And one of the deals that was suggested about hostages was \"all for all,\" where Palestinian prisoners that are in Israeli jails, many of whom again are minors or imprisoned for nonviolent offenses, that they would be released in exchange for the hostages. So far this has not been accepted and I think that this is another reason why you have these growing protests within Israel against the government because they recognize that there are options that are simply not being taken.",
