Tonight, we are following a major story out ofthe United States where Hurricane Idalia gave strength as it heads towards Florida. The governor warns the region hasn't seen a storm like this in over 100 years. We'll bring you all the latest. Then, the backlash grows. Spain's regional football leaders join calls for disgraced football chief Rubiales to resign. We are live for you in Madrid. Plus, detained American Paul Whelan seen on camera for the first time in two years. I'll ask his sister what that moment meant to her. But first, disgraced Spanish football chief Luis Rubiales has been stripped of his salary and benefits by Spain's football federation. According to a federation spokesperson, Rubiales has been asked to hand back his official car, corporate phone as well as a laptop, and told, he cannot use the organization's funds for his legal defense. On Monday, the federation's regional president publicly called for Rubiales to resign after he gave an unwanted kiss to star player, Jennifer Hermoso. The incident has sparked a tidal wave of anger and controversy, but amid this backlash, Hermoso's teammates say they are sticking together. Have a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) NALLEA VIDRIO, TEAMMATE OF JENNIFER HERMOSO, CF PACHUCA (through translator): Obviously, we are with my teammate Jennifer, we are in a macho country, women are minimized. But notice that we know what we're capable of. We have discussed it many times among ourselves, and we are just as capable as men. We want to stand out and that motivates us to put an end to it.

And now, there's this -- prosecutors opened up criminal investigations into allegations of sexual assault over his behavior at the World Cup, and we've tried to reach him through the federation and other methods, but we have not had any response to those allegations so far, and we don't know when he's going to be forced to resign. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SHUBERT (voice-over): Winning the World Cup wasn't just a victory for Spain, but a celebration of how far women's rights had come, all undermined by the boorish behavior of Spain's football chief, Luis Rubiales, grabbing his crotch in victory next to the Spanish queen and her 16-year-old daughter. And the forceful unwanted kiss he planted afterwards on player Jenni Hermoso. Rubiales said he made a mistake, but called the kiss consensual. Hermoso said it was not, and felt violated. In places of power, protesters and officials say Spain still has deep pockets of chauvinism. In Madrid, hundreds heated the Me Too rallying cry of Spain, SeAcabo, meaning, it's over. Enough with the crotch grubs, the unwanted kisses and the chauvinism as Spain's deputy Prime Minister Yolanda Diaz told CNN, the country has moved on. YOLANDA DIAZ, DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER, SPAIN (through translator): The structural sexism and the violence that they have had with a player like Jenni Hermoso is intolerable in a democracy, she said. We are dealing with a person who is a victim of sexual assault and afar from having protected her. What they have done is to continue to violate her rights. And yet, Rubiales refuses to resign.",

Ithink the question is whether or not they can get more people within the federation, within places of power in the football world to put the pressure on him and see that it's going to cost much more to have him hang on like this, than just to have him resign. There has been talk for example, about what could happen at the international level, UEFA, whether or not FIFA for example could weigh in with a much more harsher suspension. So, there are still -- there are still other ways to force him, but they don't want it to reach that level. They want him to go on his own. But he doesn't seem willing to do that. Isa.",

And you know, certainly, up until the storm came, it seemed like it was going to be more of a glancing blow to the far west, didn't even seem like it was going to really come ashore. And all this saying that, oh, it's done quite a bit of damage here, trees down throughout Havana, power out in many places, the cellphone service coming in and out. And the further west you go, just the worse it gets. We've seen images of hundreds, if not more homes have had serious flooding, roofs damaged, power is out, and most of the western part of the island, we're talking about hundreds of thousands of people. And so, that's going to take some time to recover from, because of course, this is the same region that was devastated by Hurricane Ian last year. So, the Cuban government says they're trying to get resources, resources, frankly, they don't have out to the impacted regions. We haven't heard of any injuries or any deaths at this point, but of course, those can of course, occur in the days following the hurricane as people begin to carry out the pickup. And this is going to last for some time, even though this hurricane came by -- you know, last time, it was a tropical storm, this morning as a category one hurricane. It has done a significant amount of damage, of course, as it goes towards Florida, it's expected to strengthen and likely do much more damage there.",

And those evacuation orders are well underway at this hour. As you noted, we are in Tampa Bay. So, we're significantly south of where this hurricane is expected to make landfall, although, the concern here in the Tampa Bay area is the flooding associated with the storm surge with this hurricane. We're talking about anywhere between 4 to 7 feet of a storm surge. And so when you take a look at the Tampa Bay area out here, one of the rivers, you can see exactly where the water level is right now. This time tomorrow, we've got to take into account those 4 to 7 feet of a storm surge, the rainfall which is anywhere between 4 to 8 inches as well as high tide. And so, for some of the low-lying parts of the Tampa Bay area, the concern right now is some of the flooding that we are going to see. Just across the river here is Tampa General Hospital, it's one of the larger hospitals in this part of southwest  Florida. They have their floodgates up already at this hour, we're told that, that can handle a storm surge of up to 15 feet.

That's how the funeral of Russian mercenaryleader, Yevgeny Prigozhin is being described today. A company owned by the Wagner chief first reported his burial at a cemetery in St. Petersburg, saying it took place today in a closed format. An independent Washington news says about 30 relatives attended and no military figures were spotted. Russia says Prigozhin died in a plane crash with nine others last week, exactly 2 months after he staged a mutiny of course, against top military brass. Well, the secrecy around today's burial prevented big crowds from showing up and turning it into a public show of support for Prigozhin. Our Matthew Chance visited the summary(ph) -- cemetery, I should say, and filed this report. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MATTHEW CHANCE, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (on camera): The authorities have gone to huge lengths to try and cover up where the funeral was going to actually take place. They put security barricades and metal detectors outside other cemeteries in St. Petersburg. Meanwhile, the actual funeral took place here about an hour drive outside of St. Petersburg, the Russian city. You can see, we've come here now, we were not allowed into the cemetery, but there's all these security guards, actually members of the National Guard, and this armed sort of snipers outside the various perimeter points as well. And so, they're imposing really tight security on this entire area. So make sure that people don't go in, presumably, so people don't go in and pay their respects. It isn't quite a while, but obviously, they're very insecure indeed about that. I just want to show you the closest we can get though, to the grave site, because if you come over here, you can look through the branches over there into the middle of this quite small cemetery, and you can see a Russian flag, you can see some flowers there that have been arranged, and there's a very simple wooden cross which you may not be able to see that. But that's Yevgeny Prigozhin's grave site. It's actually right next door to where his father was buried as well, and that's obviously one of the reasons why this was -- this cemetery was picked. But I think the other reason is that it's just so out of the way, and that the authorities could, you know, kind of pretend it was someone else, but actually, hold it here without much publicity, and that's what they've managed to do. As I say though, a lot of security, we're not permitted to go in for the moment. This is as close as we're going to get. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

      "sentences": "Welcome back.Researchers have found CTE, a brain disease often associated with NFL players and concussions, in younger amateur athletes. That is according to a striking new study from Boston University. The researchers evaluated 152 donated brains. They found evidence of the disease in more than 60 of them, including in athletes, get this, who never played professionally. Chief medical correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta has been covering this for years and visited the very brain bank where this is happening. Great to see you. Put context for all of our viewers. How concerning is this because it sounds alarming? DR. SANJAY GUPTA, CNN CHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: I think one of things to keep in mind, just when you look at a study like this, very important, is that the people who donated to their brains for the study, these were people who had significant symptoms and were very suspicious they might have CTE. So it was a highly select group of people. When you see that 40 percent that should in no way suggest everyone who plays sports and takes blows to the head will develop CTE. What is concerning as you mentioned is the age, I think you typically think of CTE, which is chronic traumatic encephalopathy, almost this Alzheimer's like disease, we think of it occurring later in life. I think what was clear is that people as young as 17 years old could develop these symptoms. That was concerning. And sometimes they would have the symptoms that we saw in much older patients of memory loss, confusion, depression and even suicidal thoughts. In fact, the most common cause of death in 150 or so patients, you just talked about, the number one cause of death in that young group of people was suicide. So that I think obviously does raise some concerns.",

When we made the original documentary, \"Big Hits, Broken Dreams,\" we happened to be at thelab the day Nathan Styles' brain arrived. His family donated his brain to science. They were worried about him and 17 years old. And I saw his brain with Dr. Ann McKee (ph). We were looking at it for the first time. And again, think of Alzheimer's, for example, you think of plaques and tangles in the brain and you imagine someone 70 or 80 years old. When were looking at these images, we essentially were seeing those same types of findings in a 17-year-old brain that you'd see in someone much older. So it is concerning obviously when you see that. What it means, it's a little hard to say. But now we know it can happen quite young.",

But a couple of things, there is likely some sort of genetic predisposition. There are people who take lots of blows to the head, never have a problem. Other people who take few blows to the head and they develop CTE. One thing to keep in mind is that I think a lot of people sort of envision these blows to the brain causing the problem. Typically, the brain is accelerating and then decelerates all of a sudden because it's stopped in a sport or something. And the brain itself keeps moving and stretching and twisting. And it is that mechanism I just described that is probably more sort of the genesis of CTE. The more blows like that you take, the bigger problem.",
