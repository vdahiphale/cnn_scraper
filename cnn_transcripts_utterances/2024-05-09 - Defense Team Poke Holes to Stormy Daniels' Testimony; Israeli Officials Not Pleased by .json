Some of the most heated and contentious exchanges yet at Donald Trump's hush money trial coming in just the last couple of hours on cross- examination of Stormy Daniels, who testified of course earlier this week about a sexual encounter she says she had with Trump back in 2006. Defense lawyers hammering Daniels over just how much money she's made from her story over the years. Also trying to poke holes in her account of what happened on that night in Trump's hotel suite. Daniels for her part, pushing back at several points this morning, including against defense claims that her story has shifted over the years. That cross-examination from the defense ending just moments ago, the prosecution now set to redirect some questions to Daniels. And just a reminder there, you're going to see on the left side of your screen, some of those key updates coming to us in real time from inside the courtroom from our colleagues there. So, we'll continue to touch on those as well. Let's bring it up to speed on what we did hear so far throughout the morning.

There is a sense of betrayal even from some Israeli officials. We've heard from Itamar Ben-Gvir, the right-wing member of Netanyahu's governing coalition, who posted a tweet that simply said Hamas loves Biden. Other members of the far right are accusing Biden of betrayal, but also saying that this should simply harden Israel's plans and desire to carry out this military operation in Rafah, where the Israeli prime minister says that Hamas still has four battalions, calling it Hamas's last bastion. The Israeli war cabinet, I'm told, is set to meet as we speak, actually the war cabinet, followed by a meeting of the security cabinet. And they are expected to be discussing this latest threat by President Biden. And also, there will be an analysis carried out of the munitions that Israel still has in its stocks, how to manage those munitions going forward and how this U.S. policy decision could potentially impact Israeli military plans going forward. But I'm certainly getting a sense of hardening resolve rather than any kind of course correction from the Israeli government. This all happening as we're learning that multiple delegations that were in Cairo for ceasefire talks this week have now left. The CIA director, Bill Burns, has returned to Washington. And so far, there are no signs of a breakthrough. Rather, Israeli officials are focusing on the military operations happening in Rafah. Those, they say, will intensify. Zain.",

Remember all the buildup to last year's counteroffensive that didn't quite deliver. Really, it's a hold the line mentality this year. Listen, still consequential because the thinking was without this additional U.S. aid that Ukraine might very well have lost the war this year. In addition to that, there is expectation that Russia will launch another big offensive push in the coming weeks, attempting to gain more territory, possibly a partial mobilization in Russia to add manpower to the front lines.

How is the administration, how is the administration at this point still assuring Israel that it's not walking away from its security? SEN. CHRIS COONS (D-DE): Well, Zain, yesterday in a hearing of the Senate Appropriations Committee dealing with defense, Secretary of Defense Austin was asked this question directly by several senators, and he repeated what has been President Biden's position as well, that our commitment to Israel's security and defense is ironclad. President Biden has recently signed into law, and the DOD has delivered significant amounts of defensive weaponry, the Iron Dome system. For example, billions of dollars in support. And just a few weeks ago, when Iran launched 300 missiles and drones at Israel, the United States organized a joint defensive effort by Saudi Arabia, by Jordan, by the United Kingdom, France, and the United States to ensure that, along with Israel, all of those missiles and drones were shot down before they caused any significant harm. So, I think it is clear that what President Biden's position is, is that, of course, Israel has not just the right but the obligation to go after Hamas after the horrific attacks of October 7th, and we will support them in doing so. But in Rafah, before they go in at scale, where there are a million civilian refugees who've moved to Rafah from the rest of Gaza at the direction of the IDF, they have to provide for them to leave Rafah and then go ahead to carry out the last stages of this campaign against Hamas.",

      "sentences": "This will have significant negative consequences for Israel globally, not just in the immediate region or in the relations with theUnited States. If they were to go into Rafah, there's no way to carry out a campaign to kill another 10,000 Hamas fighters without killing another 20,000 or more innocent civilians, women, and children. So I've had this discussion directly with Bibi Netanyahu, with the Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, on my last visit to Israel. And they said they understood that, of course, they intend to allow for civilians to relocate out of the way of the last stages of their campaign against Hamas. I think it's important that they do so, that they respect international law around civilian protection. But I also think it's important that they continue their campaign against Hamas. My hope, of course, Zain, is that there will be a deal to allow for the release of hostages now held well over 200 days by Hamas and for a ceasefire. But in the absence of that, Israel has the right and obligation to continue their campaign against Hamas as long as they provide for civilians to relocate out of the way of that campaign and as long as they continue to facilitate humanitarian assistance getting into Gaza.",

But as you say, Zain, Kenya has genuinely suffered through drought, through locusts, through massive flooding.

When he went to meet with the IRS, he said, here's a front-page story from the Washington Post. I was in prison unjustly. The same thing would happen to Evan Gershkovich, the Wall Street Journal reporter, if we were to secure his release from a Russian prison where he's currently unjustly detained. This bill that I co-sponsored with Republican Senator Mike Rounds will end that practice and if someone is wrongfully detained or imprisoned overseas, it will allow the IRS to forgive any tax-related penalties, fines or fees.",
