The January 6th Committee meets to discuss criminal referrals in its investigation. And new reporting tonight on that meeting and also on the special counsel's own probes into former president Donald Trump. Plus, after more than three decades, the alleged bomb maker in the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 is now in custody and families may be a step closer to justice. Also, what's next for NASA and its goal of sending astronauts back to the moon after its first Artemis mission ends successfully? You're in the CNN NEWSROOM. Well, we have some new reporting coming into the CNN NEWSROOM tonight about Jack Smith, the special counsel investigating former President Donald Trump and a pair of criminal probes. I want to bring in Katelyn Polantz. She is CNN's senior crime and justice reporter. She joins us with the latest. So, Katelyn, based on your reporting, Smith's team is moving quickly. And we saw a glimpse of that with these subpoenas that we know were issued to officials in Wisconsin and Arizona and Michigan, but you have reporting on how quickly his team is moving and when could we see actual charges?",

But one of the things that we were trying to understand is, what does this actually look like now that there is a special counsel over these two ongoing investigations, January 6th and Mar-a-Lago.And a team of us tried to dig into that to get a better understanding of the shape of these investigations and this office. So Kristen Holmes, Paula Reid, Jeremy Herb, and I, few others around our justice team, we all really dug into it and we learned a few things. One, it doesn't -- this seems like it could almost be obvious, but one of the things that the team of people who are prosecuting especially January 6th cases are asking about is intent of Donald Trump. The knowledge Donald Trump had around and leading up to January 6th. So I say that seems obvious. We've seen people from the White House Counsel's Office, from the Office of the Vice Presidency going in and being forced to give more answers to a federal grand jury, but that's not always an obvious thing that they would be asking about. We know that they're looking at a lot of different things, not just Trump. But that is one thing that we heard and found. Another thing that we learned is that there's always been a hint of the question of finances. People who have expertise in public corruption, fraud, money laundering, who have started working in this special counsel's office, but we do understand there is a pretty sizable financial investigation, that continues on as well.",

That's not the case here. Now, our understanding was, even when, before the special counsel came in to investigate around January 6th, some of those prosecutors were given the ability to take an investigation up to Trump, if they needed to.So this special counsel is starting a little bit at a different place than Mueller was. And also, with that, our understanding of this special counsel, Jack Smith, is that he's going to function more like a career manager, a U.S. attorney, not setting up a shadow Justice Department that could be at odds with the Justice Department, as happened a little bit during the Mueller investigation. But the other thing, Pam, that's really fascinating about this is that this is already a bigger group of investigators, almost twice the size or even more when you combine both of these investigations than what Mueller had to work with.",

But what's important to understand about a criminal referral, from Congress or anybody else, is that legally it has no specific impact. It's not binding on DOJ.They don't have to investigate because Congress or anybody else asks them to, and they don't need to be asked in order to investigate. They can do it on their own. We know DOJ is already investigating Donald Trump.

The Libyan man accused of making the bomb that brought down Pan Am Flight 103 is now in U.S. custody. That 747 exploded over the tiny village of Lockerbie, Scotland on December 21st, 1988. The death toll was staggering. 259 people were on board, 11 people died on the ground. And most of those killed were Americans headed home for Christmas. It remains the deadliest terror strike in British history. And for Americans, it's second only to 9/11. CNN's Nic Robertson has covered this attack for years and has more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) NIC ROBERTSON, CNN INTERNATIONAL DIPLOMATIC EDITOR (voice-over): Almost 34 years since the deadliest terror attack in British history, and the man accused of building the bomb that killed 270 people, mostly Americans, is finally going to face justice in a U.S. court. Libyan Abu Agila Mohammad Mas'ud Kheir Al-Marimi was arrested for his alleged role in blowing up Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland 38 minutes after it took off for the U.S. from London, killing everyone on board and 11 people on the ground. The U.S. first charged Al-Marimi for his involvement in the attack two years ago while he was already in custody in Libya for unrelated crimes. MICHAEL SHERWIN, FORMER ACTING U.S. ATTORNEY: It is alleged in the criminal complaint, in the indictment, that at that time, all co- conspirators worked together to arm the explosive device in the suitcase.",

How do you explain that to the layperson who might be thinking, well, we've already sent astronauts to the moon before, why can't we go back sooner, why is all this necessary? CHIAOmoon. If we're going to go to mars, the moon is a perfect place to develop your hardware and make sure everything is going to work before we send it on to mars. It's also a great place to train your astronauts, you know. And so the reason the moon is a great place to do that is because it's a similarly harsh environment with reduced atmosphere, reduced gravity, a lot of dust. But it's only three days away. If you have an issue with your crew, you can get them back in three or four days. Mars, even when the planets are aligned, you're about to test six months, we talk about six-month trips one way. And so if you're on your way to mars and you need to come back like Apollo 13 had to do on the way to the moon, you're talking about a year or so before you can get your crew back. There are also a lot of scientific reasons to go back to the moon, even with humans to go ahead and gather more samples if you will of the lunar surface and maybe do some cord drilling. There are elements out there that are of interest, things like Helium 3 which could be used as a fusion reactor fuel in the future. So lots of exciting things to do.",

And so NASA has contracts out to some of the contractors including SpaceX to help develop these landers, but it's going to take a little while for us to do that. In the meantime, we need to shake the vehicle out with humans on board, yes, even if this flight test out was very successful and it looks it was really the rubber meets the road, when you actually put a human crew on board and then see how the vehicle performs with actual astronauts operating the vehicle and, you know, actually loading up the systems with, you know, all of the things that humans do.And so it's very important to go ahead and do that and maintain flight cadence as well. You don't just want to take a flight test and say, OK, we're good, and then, you know, wait X or Y number of years before we try again. And then the first time we try again, we're going to send humans to the moon on an untested vehicle we haven't flown for a number of years and a lander that we've never flown before.",

Our reporting on the conditions in which migrant workers were working to build the infrastructure related to the World Cup, whether it was stadiums or roads, reveal certain disturbing aspects. Of course, one aspect is what were the working conditions and how are the living conditions were for them, why they built this, and of course the second, which you just played was related to the deaths. Now there has been no effort from FIFA or Qatar to investigate these deaths, so they actually don't know how many workers have died and what led to these deaths. Was it work pressure? Was it negligence at worksite? How do these seemingly fit people who underwent medical tests before they were, you know, sent to work on these projects start dying suddenly? It's very hard to really come up with a number and the figures range from hundreds into thousands. And until this is really -- a concerted effort is made, it's very hard to say. Now what happens thousands of miles away to these families, where the primary breadwinners have died means the children are falling out of school, they have unpaid debts, they're encouraged to actually get these jobs via a middleman, to get to Qatar.

Now, there is also a pressure growing on international criminologists if you like that this is a shine that the Russians are in breach of international humanitarian law by deliberately targeting civilian structures, and by extension, therefore, if Iran is supplying weapons that are used to commit war crimes, potentially there could be some kind of liability there. But this comes at a time when the Ukrainians themselves are also appeared to be getting more on to the front foot in terms of the use of their own missile capability, with strikes against Donetsk, the Russian-held territory in Donetsk, against the Crimean Peninsula, again, Russian-held territory, illegally annexed after Russia's invasion in 2014, and most importantly, in Melitopol, which is on the southern front or close to the southern frontline which has largely been frozen for the last six months but there is an expectation that perhaps the Ukrainians would want to try to launch a counterattack there to try to retake territory that they lost to Russia in the early stages of this war. Particularly, if they can hold out in Bakhmut, in the east, which has absorbed a huge amount of troops on both sides, with very heavy losses. Quite why the Russians would be so heavily committed to Bakhmut is baffling Ukrainian commanders, but they say that perhaps it's the need for Russians to show some kind of local victory in the face of losses in the north and the south -- Pam.",

You know, a hundred years ago, when people were deemed to be mentally disturbed, they were sent to psychiatric institutions that at one time were places of refuge that housed hundreds of patients, they were fully staffed, they were safe, and sometimes even bucolic environments.But decades later, they had just become like asylums. And doctors were experimenting with questionable practices and the quality of care went way down. So, President Kennedy, he pledged to de-institutionalize people. And he promised federal funds to build community health care centers. But after he was assassinated, all that progress stopped. So years later, when President Ronald Reagan or when Ronald Reagan became governor of California, California became the first state to de- institutionalize people, but it did not fund any mental health centers. So all of those who were released had nowhere to go. And this was repeated across the country. So, decades later, like so many things, as you just saw on that clip, it's now often up to law enforcement to deal with this problem that just is continuing to explode all over the country.",

And you were actually able to find and talk to that man. What did he tell you? LINGmy husband, but particularly for my then 7-year-old daughter. And he, when he accosted them, you know, he was, he was obviously not in his right mind. And one of the things that we really try to do on our show, \"THIS IS LIFE,\" is humanize the issue. You know, it's so easy for us to just drive by or walk by and really not take the time to understand what's really going on, and that's what we try to do, or that's what I try to do in finding this man, to try to understand where his mind was that night when he accosted my family.
