Some of our politicians today saying there's nothing we can do about gun violence. Doctors disagree. Plus, the overdose drug Narcan will soon be on the shelves of grocery stores, gas stations, even vending machines. Do they have it at your child's school? Should parents keep it at home? We'll explain what you need to know. And tonight, we bring you our next Pulse of the People, this one on how technology, like artificial intelligence is changing all of our lives.

JAY WELLONS, CHIEF, DIVISION OF PEDEIATRIC, NEUROLOGICAL SURGERY, VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER:  Well, Alisyn, there was a whole host of people down in the emergency room. The text went out. You know, I looked down. I had about six or seven different texts come in, saying that there was a mass casualty event. We got a phone call from the chief of staff, saying, Jay, this isn't a drill. You need to get downstairs. And, basically, you know, we like many hospitals, you know, we do simulations for this kind of work. You know, trauma is a big deal in our world of pediatric healthcare. And it was you know, 35, 40 people all in kind of in orderly positions, you know, waiting for the ambulances to arrive. And you know, everybody kind of has their position. There's anesthesia there. The head of the trauma services is there running the situation. The head of the E.R. is there, the ear, nose and throat doctors, neurosurgery were there, there's just a whole bunch of people there ready to kind of lean in and do what it is that you know that we want to do, you know, which is to help these kids and save these kids lives.",

Does anybody -- can anybody write something? Can somebody know, you know, somebody in the media to contact, and that's really how that that paper came out. And it really was borne out of this sense of frustration. And, you know, one of my closest friends is the chief of pediatric neurosurgery at Connecticut Children's Hospital.

For example, red flag laws pull in the 90 percent. This notion I reject wholeheartedly that there isn't more that elected officials can do to keep children from being massacred. And I was -- I mean, I'm heartened by the fact that Thom Tillis, Chris Murphy were able to come together and do -- you know, take some steps on gun reform earlier this year, but it clearly isn't going far enough. And I think what happens, unfortunately, is too often the right retreats into the partisan corner of we've got to just address mental health and harden our schools and then the left says it's only about the guns. You give Joe Biden credit. He has addressed the mental health aspect. It's both. It requires a gun to commit the crime but it requires somebody who is in a mental state that they're willing to mow down children. You have to be able to address both.
