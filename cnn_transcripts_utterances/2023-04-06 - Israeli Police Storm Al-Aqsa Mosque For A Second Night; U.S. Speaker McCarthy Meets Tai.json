Israel does not want to learn from history, that the al-Aqsa is for the Palestinians and for all Arabs and Muslims. And that storming it sparked a revolution against the occupation.I guess the point here is that there have been clashes before between Palestinians and Israeli police in this area known as the temple mount or Haram al-Sharif, but sending police into the mosque, firing stone grenades and using batons to beat worshipers inside the mosque. We've seen this to a whole new level, a whole new dangerous level. KELLER-LYNN: This is absolutely a very disturbing scene, I would say. Both in terms of what the police alleged could have happened had the raid not occurred. The police said that the worshipers were fortifying themselves within the sacred holy place along with stones, with fireworks, which were ultimately launched against the police in order to perhaps attack Jewish worshippers the following day. Remind me of course that Jewish worshippers were planning to come consecrate the upcoming Passover holiday on Wednesday before it started this evening. What we saw in terms of the police forces reacting as strongly as they did very, very harsh videos to watch. But really, I think speaking to the fact of how scarred people are about this time, this critical time being Ramadan, Passover and the convergence of Easter coming that only two years ago, conflicts on the Temple Mount, ultimately, were the catalyst for an 11 day conflict between Hamas in the Gaza Strip and Israel. So this is definitely top of mind people. And a very strong response kind of put that at the forefront of Israeli consciousness.",

And we have a finance minister, who is also a second minister in our defense ministry, who said that he supports wiping off Palestinian community off the map as well as says that there's no such thing as Palestinian people. So, we have this very difficult security situation, as well as the security cabinet within Israel, which hasn't met since February. And like I said, the defense minister, it's unclear whether it's not in the position. So we do have a very, I think, very problematic security situation within the Israeli government itself moving into the situation, and difficult to say how to deal with external challenges when balancing so many within the coalition itself that's supposed to be governing against them.",

How does this all play into the tensions between the Palestinians and the Israelis with the internal divisions and the mass protests, which have taken place for weeks now across Israel, over here, the reform of the judiciary there?KELLER-LYNN: I'd say in three main ways. The first way is that, really the government's critical mass, weight of attention has been placed on judicial reform its plan to dramatically neuter judiciary power, and instead increased political power with almost unchecked and unfettered. That has been the government's sole focus, and as such, has really deescalated its emphasis on security, even leading to this critical time. Again, we talked about what you said to extremists in the Israeli government, this would be far right parties that have come to power through Netanyahu since the election in November, they are part of this government, because this is the coalition that was possible for Netanyahu. So these politics obviously play a role with these figures in power in such secure sensitive security settings. And then, obviously, you have all the international pressure as well, that's been playing on the Israeli government and also interfering with its own ability to orchestrate scenarios such that it could defend against this this kind of outcome.",

None of that has happened. So far, it seems that there was a Chinese aircraft carrier passing through this channel between Taiwan and the Philippines. But that was previously planned and announced there is also the civilian maritime authorities plan to conduct so called patrol and inspection, operations targeting ostensibly targeting illegal dredging activities. So that really was a very stark contrast. And part of that was, according to many analysts, that visit by Tsai Ing-wen in the U.S. relatively low key by design, according to U.S. and Taiwanese officials, but the other is timing. Her visit actually coincided with two very important visits here in China, by some very prominent figures, one by former Taiwan President Ma Ying-jeou, whose party had has long favored of closer ties with Beijing, and Ma, of course, met Xi Jinping himself in 2015. And then Taiwan naturally is going to have its next presidential election in just a few months in January 2024. And historically, whenever Beijing launched very warmongering rhetoric and intense some military drills that had backfired. And then, of course, you have this highly anticipated visit by French president Macron, who is now here, and he's about to meet Xi Jinping in a few hours. And he of course, has been accompanied by European Commission president von der Leyen. And their visit comes at a very critical juncture between the relationship between E.U. and China and Taiwan has also become an increasingly thorny issue given the Russian invasion of Ukraine and increasing tensions between Washington and Beijing. So all of that may explain why the Beijing reaction so far has been relatively muted. But that of course, doesn't mean they're not going to change tactics once all these guests leave and as we have seen historically, when there is some sort of crisis happening in the Taiwan Strait, sometimes it can last for months.

It's threatening to fight back, calling the meeting a violation of its sovereignty. When then U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi visited Taiwan last summer, China responded with unprecedented military drills that simulated a blockade around the island. So far, Beijing has held routine military drills around Taiwan and launched a three-day patrol operation through the Taiwan Strait. But the military reaction maybe more muted this time since they're meeting on American soil. But that's not stopping fury from China's heavily-censored social media, with comments like \"let's fight\" and \"shoot her plane down or force it to land\".

This is going to be an ongoing situation through the next 24 hours. So areas highlighted in green where we have that threat for a few stronger storms over the upcoming hours from Buffalo to Pittsburgh, Nashville, Jackson, Mississippi back down into Houston hail one of the bigger concerns. I mean, we had hail reports covering roadways all across the-- all across the ground for that matter, but damaging winds also a big concern. We're talking 65 mph, if not stronger at times for wind gusts. And then flooding. Flooding one of the bigger concerns. You'll see areas highlighted in yellow from south Texas, Houston included back in Alexandria, Louisiana, even into parts of Mississippi, where we will likely pick up an additional 2 to 4 inches of rain isolated higher amounts are possible until Thursday morning, really tapping into that heavy rain across south Texas around 11:00 central time. Houston getting your heaviest rain through the early morning hours on Friday. Then finally, it starts to taper back again late Friday.

The government raised the volcano's alert level to orange last week after a surge of seismic activity, suggesting it could erupt in the coming days or weeks. Authorities say children must be evacuated even if adult family members decide to stay. Plans are also being made for the transport of livestock and pets. A suspect is in custody after a horrific ax attack at a daycare center in southern Brazil. Police say four children were killed, four others were injured on Wednesday. The children who died were between five and seven years old. A police officer told CNN the 25 year old suspect likely jumped a wall before attacking the children on a playground. He fled when teachers came to the children's defense, but later surrendered to police. Brazil's president has expressed condolences over this tragedy, saying that children were innocent and defenseless. No date has been set, but it now appears former U.S. Vice President Mike Pence of Hang Mike Pence fame will testify before a federal grand jury in Washington. That's because Pence has chosen not to appeal a federal court order that he testify about his interactions with former president Donald Trump leading up to the January six attacks on the U.S. Capitol.

Donald Trump wouldn't be able to draw a line of secrecy around the presidency, and even though Pence was able to successfully argue that some things he did on January 6th may be protected because he was then operating as a member of congress or a quasi member of congress as he was presiding over the Senate on January 6th as they certified the presidency. He is not going to be able to hold off talking about conversations where Donald Trump may have been acting corruptly and talking to him about what could happen on January 6th. We know that Donald Trump wanted to block the election's result, and he wanted Mike Pence to be the person that stood up and said to congress No, Donald Trump should be president, Joe Biden should not be president, even though that is the result of the election, and we know that the special counsel's office has been looking very closely into that wanting testimony directly from Mike Pence, the vice president at the time.

So the big question is will British people accept Camilla, with the title that was destined for Diana. We'll have to wait and see. But so far the response has been pretty positive. And it's clear that Charles is insistent on his wife becoming known now as Queen Camilla really living up to that full title. Elsewhere in the card, all sorts of symbolism a green man from ancient mythology representing rebirth and a new reign of King Charles. Also the groups of flowers there, flowers that are very fondly held in the king's heart in groups of three to represent Charles III, which is his title. Also a unicorn and a boar and a lion which are representatives from the king and queen's coats of arms. So a huge amount of work has gone in to that invitation. We also got a bit more information about the coronation itself. We understand that Prince George will walk behind Charles and Camilla as a page at the coronation so big moment for him.
