      "sentences": "His normal theory would immunize former presidents for criminal liability, for bribery, treason, sedition, murder, and here, conspiring to use fraud to overturn the results of an election and perpetuate himself in power. Such presidential immunity has no foundation in the Constitution. The framers knew too well the dangers of a king who could do no wrong. They therefore devised a system to check abuses of power, especially the use of official power for private gain.Here, the executive branch is enforcing congressional statutes and seeking accountability for petitioner's alleged misuse of official power to subvert democracy. That has a compelling public interest. In response, petitioner raises concerns about potential abuses, but established legal safeguards provide layers of protections with the Article Three courts providing the ultimate check. The existing system is a carefully balanced framework. It protects the President, but not at the high constitutional cost of blanket criminal immunity. That has been the understanding of every President from the framing through Watergate and up to today. This court should preserve it. I welcome the court's questions.",

The President, as the head of the Article Two branch, can assert, as applied, Article Two objections to criminal laws that interfere with an exclusive power possessed by the President, or that prevent the President from accomplishing his constitutionally assigned functions. That is the constitutional doctrine that currently governs the separation of powers.What petitioner is asking for is a broad blanket immunity that would protect the President, a former President, from any criminal exposure, absent impeachment and conviction, which has never happened in our history. And we submit that is not necessary in order to assure that the President can perform all of the important tasks that the Constitution reposes in him.

Now, you know how easy it is, in many cases, for a prosecutor to get a grand jury to bring an indictment and reliance on the good faith of the prosecutor may not be enough in the -- some cases. I'm not suggesting here.So, if it's tautological, and those are the only protections that the Court of Appeals below gave, and that is no longer your position, you're not defending that position, why shouldn't we either send it back to the Court of Appeals or issue an opinion making clear that that's not the law?",

So, this is more, I think, than just a quarrel about terminology, whether what the former President gets is some form of immunity, or some form of special protection, because it involves this difference, which I'm sure you're very well aware of, if it's just a form of special protection.In other words, statutes will be interpreted differently as applied to a former President. Then that is something that has to be litigated at trial. The former President can make a motion to dismiss and may site OLC opinions, and the district court may say, well, that's fine. I'm not bound by OLC, and I interpreted differently. So, let's go to trial. And then, there has to be a trial, and that may involve great expense, and it may take up a lot of time. And during the trial, the former President may be unable to engage in other activities that the former President would want to engage in. And then the outcome is dependent on the jury, the instructions to the jury, and how the jury returns a verdict, and then it has to be taken up on appeal. So, the protection is greatly diluted if you take the form -- if it takes the form that you have proposed. And why is that better?",

The blanket immunity that petitioner is arguing for just means that criminal prosecution is off the table, unless he says that impeachment and conviction have occurred. Those are political remedies that are extremely difficult to achieve in a case where the conduct, misconduct occurs close to the end of a President's term. Congress is unlikely to crank up the machinery to do it. And if the impeachment trial has to occur after the President has left office, there is an open question about whether that can happen at all.

It was not raised in the District Court and it was not raised in the Court of Appeals. And the analysis that I would use to get there is a fusion of a couple of principles. One is the court has often resolved threshold questions that are a prerequisite to an intelligent resolution of the question presented. So, in a case like United States v. Grubbs, for example, the court reached out to decide what -- whether anticipatory warrants are valid under the Fourth Amendment, before turning to the question whether the triggering condition for an anticipatory warrant had to be in the warrant. So, that's one principle.And then a precedent that bears some analogy to this is \"Vermont Agency of Natural Resources v. United States ex rel. Stevens\", was a key tam case. And the first question was whether a state agency was a person within the meaning of the False Claims Act. And the second question was whether if the state agency was 11th Amendment immunity kicked in. And the court wrote an analysis of why it could reach both questions. The reaching the person question didn't expand the court's jurisdiction. And it made sense as a matter of constitutional avoidance to do that. There are some considerations that cut against this, and I want to be clear that for overall government equities, we are not wild about parties who raise a immunity case that can be presented to a court on an interlocutory appeal, and then smuggling in other issues. So, we would want to guide the court not to have an expansive approach to that issue. But, the final thing that I would say about this is part of our submission to this court is that the Article One branch and the Article Two branches are aligned in believing that this prosecution is an appropriate way to enforce the law, Congress, by making the law, the current executive by deciding to bring it. And since a building block of that submission is that Congress actually did apply these criminal laws to official conduct. The court may wish to exercise its discretion to resolve that issue.",

Fitzgerald can be very deleterious to the President's conduct of business.So, if we were putting this under a Fitzgerald lens, we would then have to answer the question, was he acting in the capacity as office seeker, or was he acting in the capacity as office holder?
