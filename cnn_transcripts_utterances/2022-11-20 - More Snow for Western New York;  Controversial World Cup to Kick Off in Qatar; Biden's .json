Nearly 9 million people are under winter alert through Sunday for New York and other states along the Great Lakes, including Wisconsin, Michigan, Indiana, Ohio and Pennsylvania. The snowstorm stranded drivers who didn't follow warnings to stay off the roads. About 240 people had to be rescued, prompting officials to ask residents to just stay home. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

This comes after a poll showed a majority favored reinstatement. Mr. Trump doesn't plan to return but will continue to use his Truth Social platform. On Saturday, Mr. Trump made his first major appearance before Republicans since announcing his third presidential candidacy, appearing virtually before the Republican Jewish coalition in Las Vegas. The former president received a standing ovation. But Mr. Trump's quest for the nomination faces serious headwinds, not least of which is the special counsel, who has taken over two key investigations.

And I think both the attorney general and Jack Smith, newly appointed special counsel, have shown they understand that.

One is that there wasn't a specific mention of transitioning away from fossil fuels, including, of course, oil and gas. That will be seen politically possibly as a win for oil-rich nations.And the other is certainly that there is no direct, aggressive improvement in terms of cutting emissions to avoid the worst ravages of climate change. Right now as it stands, with the way that countries have pledged to reduce their emissions, we are looking at more than 2 degree warming in the coming years and decades. There has to be a 45 percent increase in those measures to get anywhere close to that 1.5 degree warming agreement from the Paris meetings. So that means we are very much falling short, as the head of the E.U. climate's negotiating team said there. And where those come from is unclear at this point. It's sort of kicking the can down the record toward next COP meetings, which will be held in the UAE.",

And this visit was probably a sigh of relief for the Ukrainians, frankly as well, given the political turmoil in the U.K. and given the fact that, look, Ukraine has become accustomed to the U.K. being one of its biggest supporters, second financially only to the United States. And really the architect of all of this was Boris Johnson. And just to give you an idea of just how beloved Boris Johnson was in Ukraine, I remember when I was there in July, I walked past an art gallery in the central part of Kyiv. And there in the front window were two painted portraits of Boris Johnson, adorned with the blue and yellow of the Ukrainian flag. It wasn't Joe Biden, it wasn't President Zelenskyy, it was Boris Johnson. And so the Ukrainians likely relieved that Rishi Sunak seems to be indicating that he is there to support Ukraine as well, especially given the fact that, just a few days ago, his government announced a series of tax hikes, a series of spending cuts to try to fill a hole of some $65 billion in the U.K.'s public finances.
