Also, millions of people are at serious risks from floods in California as record rainfall there hits the states. More than 100 are killed as deadly fire fires wildfires sweep through Chile. And I'll speak to tennis star Emma Raducanu as top players in the women's game clash in the Mubadala Abu Dhabi Open. Right this hour, the U.S. Secretary of State is in Saudi Arabia. This is his fifth Middle East trip since the start of the Israel-Hamas war, Antony Blinken back in the region, trying to jumpstart diplomatic efforts for a new temporary truce. He has just arrived for his meeting with the Saudi Crown Prince. Blinken also set to push for urgently needed help for Gaza. We'll have much more on the ground situation in Gaza in a moment. Well, Blinken's visit coming just after the U.S. targeted Iranian backed militia in Iraq and Syria, in retaliation for the deaths of three American soldiers in Jordan, The U.S. vowing to take further action against those militia. These attacks drawing the ire of Iran. The U.S. and U.K. also hitting Houthi targets in Yemen again to respond to continued attacks against commercial shipping in the Red Sea. Ben Wedeman back with us this hour from Amman and Nic Robertson joining us from Tel Aviv. Nic, let's start with you. Get the situation from the ground if we can from you as Blinken begins his tour, it does seem as if he is pushing once again for a temporary truce, still no real substantive talk of a permanent truce or ceasefire at this point. So, what is the backdrop to this trip with regard what's going on on the ground?",

And the strikes -- the American strikes that happened, that there's a real risk that ripples of the Gaza war throughout the region could get out of control. And I think even the Iranians would welcome a lessening of tensions in the region, they've succeeded at showing the United States and Israel, that they can make life very difficult through the their allies, the Houthis, for instance, they've been able to make it so far out of the world's five biggest commercial shipping lines, as well as British petroleum are now diverting around to Africa to avoid the Red Sea. The Iranians have shown that U.S. forces in Iraq, in Syria, even we can say in Jordan, are vulnerable to forces that are friendly -- militias that are friendly allied affiliates with Iran. And so, I think that they've shown what they can do. You know, the Iranians as -- remember, historians say, the Iranians invented chess. And I think the Americans are playing checkers. They're reeling from one crisis to another, reacting. You have Secretary Blinken now on his fifth, sixth or seventh, whatever it is, trip to the Middle East, trying to patch up some sort of resolution to the war in Gaza and everything else that's gone with it. But they're scrambling to do it. I think the Iranians have shown that they can disrupt things, that they can make life difficult for the Americans. And now they're going to sit back and watch as Secretary Blinken tries to accomplish something. If he does, probably better for all. If he doesn't, I'm sure the Iranians have a plan for that as well, Becky.",

And UNRWA has made that very clear to all of its donors.Let's talk about Gaza first of all, 1.2 million people are on -- on UNRWA's food file, the people that were being fed by UNRWA. That was before the seventh of October, so that number will go up. So, with this shameful decision, we are increasing the chances that people who are already facing hunger will slip into starvation. And that certainly as a result of this decision, the shame that it's poor donorship, I should say. Across the region, UNRWA educates 550 odd a thousand children each day. UNRWA has seven million patient visits in its primary health facilities. UNRWA distributes double that amount of food that it sees in Gaza almost in the rest of the region. Its Relief and Social Services program assists some of the most vulnerable disabled children, women, the most marginalized in these communities. It's not just in Gaza. It's also across the region, a region which Mr. Blinken, Mr. Sunak and others say they want to try and stabilize. Well, what better way to destabilize the region than to cut off UNRWA's lifesaving and stabilizing programs across this region, which frankly, today is a tinderbox. It's a disastrous decision. And if I might just finish, not just poor donorship, it's a violation of humanitarian principles, impartiality and neutrality. It's a violation of international humanitarian law, the instrumentalizing of aid in this way, it's a violation of the ICJ's interring measures, and it's a violation of the Genocide Convention. I could go on. Its poor donorship, and it needs to be reversed. And by the way, it's based on a very dodgy dossier.",

Now, UNRWA's totalbudget is about 1.5 billion that is 0.02 percent of OPEC's revenue, its profit in 2022. In a heartbeat, these Arab countries could fix UNRWA's problems. And by the way, that would break this western stranglehold over UNRWA that's allowed it to weaponize the agency, and frankly, to Israel's bidding, because we all know that the underlying of this is the desire by the far right government in Israel to destroy UNRWA. They said it on the record, it's on the mistaken belief that if you get rid of UNRWA, you get rid of the refugees they serve. And of course, that's just a sort of far right fantasy. These would remain people within aidable rights, whoever's looking after them. So, you know, let's make that clear. But what has to happen now, this shameful decision must be reversed. And also, I would like to see part of the investigation, maybe not the secretary general's investigation, which by the way, OIOS (PH), I think will do an independent investigation. They've investigated UNRWA before. And that led to the resignation by the way of a Commissioner General in part. So, let's be clear, I would like to see the spotlight turned on the donor, if they are accusing UNRWA of lacking neutrality, I would say they've lacked neutrality in instrumentalizing UNRWA, using it for political and punitive purposes. Are they really fencing their humanitarian decision making from political influence? I think not. They need to be investigated justice. They're calling for UNRWA to be investigated, because they are politicizing aid in exactly the same way that they are accusing UNRWA of politicizing aid.",

There are cars that have been absolutely devastated by the wildfires and there's also some small that's - - some little wildfires that are still kind of trying to light up, so it's a complicated situation especially because of the heat wave.

In a couple minutes later or five minutes later, there's another wildfire starting right away in another zone. So, it's a complicated situation. Hundreds of families at this point have lost everything they have, they lost their homes, they have lost their parents, some children even and it's a very complicated situation. They're asking for help for the government. They're asking for a special machines so they can start cleaning more efficiently all of this zone. If you can see at this point, Jose, if you can show to the people, the people is just trying to clean off the ruble, trying to remove all the ashes but this is not enough. They're still asking for more help from the government. They need a special machines. They need food, they need water and more security.

And then, the Friday night when we saw the U.S. take action against these Iran-backed groups in Syria and Iraq. And there was some criticism of that delay. As you said, people were wondering why so much time lapse, potentially giving these militants time to basically scatter and leave the facilities where the U.S. knew that they were hiding. But the explanation that we got on that from U.S. military officials was essentially that the weather was not ideal for the strikes until that Friday, until the weather cleared up. And they had a better idea of exactly what they were targeting, and therefore, less of a chance that they were going to kill, for example, civilians or endure unwanted casualties. And so, that was our explanation for the delay there. But there is a sense in the administration that they don't want to escalate things beyond where they already stand. And therefore, the strikes were kind of proportional in the sense that they degraded these facilities, including those used by Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, but didn't necessarily result in the kind of escalation with Iran directly that the U.S. has been trying to avoid. And to that point, we have been told by defense officials that the current assessment of that strike is that no Iranians, including those affiliated with Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps were actually killed in those attacks. So, we'll have to wait and see how the administration continues its response. However, we are told that even though the administration is not telegraphing that strikes are off the table for inside Iran, we are told that it is very unlikely that they will actually hit Iran directly.
