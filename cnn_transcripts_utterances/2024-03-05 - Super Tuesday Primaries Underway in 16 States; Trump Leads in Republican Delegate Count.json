But, you know, the Republican Party in Texas also finds itself in the midst of a civil war.And this election day will really kind of be, an interesting test of the influence that Donald Trump has on Texas Republicans. He's been very involved in actually some lower level races here in Texas. He's been endorsing candidates for statehouse races and that sort of thing. So, it is really interesting to see this tension that is going on between the Donald Trump wing of the Republican Party and what would kind of would have been the old Bush wing of the Republican Party. And both of those are really colliding. And they're, they're many races down ballot from the presidential election that we're really going to see that here in the coming hours. And that is what many people here in Texas will be paying close attention to. And the other thing to pay close attention to, Boris, and as you mentioned, this immigration issue, especially down in the Rio Grande Valley and the Eagle Pass area, where that has been such an intense issue, just how many Latino voters begin switching from Democrat to Republican. That is something that many political operatives paying very close attention to.

Congresswoman, thank you so much for being with us this afternoon. There is no deal yet for a pause in hostilities, and we're watching closely to see if one is finalized before Ramadan in just five days. That has been the target. If there is a deal, and it does hold, do you think that's enough to assuage concerns among Democrats who feel the White House isn't doing enough on this issue? REP.

But I don't want to take the premise that people that are voting uncommitted are all about this. There was a campaign in Michigan called Listen to Michigan. There are Democrats that are concerned about that, but there are a lot of other issues that are uncommitted on both sides. Nobody ever talks about those that are voting uncommitted for a Donald Trump or will never vote for Donald Trump either. But I am going to tell you that people are hurting in Michigan, and I don't think we should be talking about it from a political who you're voting for right now. This is a humanitarian issue. You just saw those pictures. I have family members who have lost 40 members, 20 members in their families, but now they have nieces, nephews, cousins who are in desperate shape. We have got to get humanitarian aid to Gaza. And I think many people believe what Hamas did was a terrorist act, what it was an act of evil. But what we are watching now is destroying the hearts and souls of people around the world.",

She called the situation in the enclave inhumane, a humanitarian catastrophe. She went further than President Biden has up until this point. Do you think that message would carry more weight with your constituents if it came directly from President Biden?",

The president is the one that's talking directly to the prime minister. I know he is trying to get this temporary cease-fire, which I pray goes to a permanent cease-fire. I do not believe the vice president would have made such a strong statement if they were not together.I hope the president is announcing a cease-fire very soon. I know he is putting pressure. And he's been very public about the humanitarian crisis. Nobody with a heart or soul can watch what is happening there and not be worried and know that we have to do something. More than 30,000 people have died, maybe up to 14,000 children. We have to do something. It's just not acceptable.",

And I hope he's able to talk about this and address it. I would be very surprised if he did not directly, and I have no inside information, address the humanitarian situation in Gaza.
