Bruce Springsteen will also be there as superstar Beyonce hits the trail with the vice president tomorrow.Also breaking, with just 12 days to go, Donald Trump is rallying voters in Arizona and Nevada. This as a former swimsuit model is now talking to CNN about her claim of being groped by Trump back in the 90s in an alleged attempt to show off for Jeffrey Epstein, who was later convicted of sex crimes. Plus, breaking news in a sensational murder case, the Los Angeles District attorney is now recommending that the Menendez brothers be re-sentenced, opening the door to their possible, possible parole nearly 30 years after they were convicted and imprisoned for killing their parents. Welcome to our viewers here in the United States and around the world. I'm Wolf Blitzer. You're in The Situation Room. We're awaiting a major Kamala Harris event -- campaign event, I should say, in the pivotal swing state of Georgia. The vice president is set to appear with some of her most famous supporters, including Barack Obama and Bruce Springsteen, with only a dozen days left to win over voters. CNN's Priscilla Alvarez is at the Harris event. CNN's Kristen Holmes is also standing by with the latest on the Trump campaign. First to you, Priscilla. This is the first time in this campaign that we'll see Harris and Obama together.",

But, look, I've spoken with senior campaign officials who say the events from here on out are about mobilization. As one senior campaign official put it, they want to keep their foot on the gas when it comes to early voting. Here in Georgia, early voting is well underway. And in DeKalb County, where this rally is taking place, almost one-third of active voters have already cast their ballot. So, the intention behind rallies like this is going to be to mobilize and energize those voters. But it also gives us a glimpse into what the closing arguments are going to be for the vice president, with that senior campaign official also telling me that the vice president is expected to talk about former President Donald Trump's, quote, enemies list versus her to-do list. She deputed this last night at CNN's town hall. She repeated it today and it's going to continue to feature prominently on the campaign trail combined with the issues that they think will galvanize voters to the polls. And that includes reproductive freedom, you mentioned there, that vice president will be joined by Beyonce in Houston, Texas, tomorrow to, again, amplify the message on reproductive freedoms. Sources telling me that they chose that location because they see it as the epicenter of what the vice president calls the Trump abortion bans. So, certainly, a combination of those issues, as well as the drawing that stark contrast from former President Donald Trump and, again, what the vice president has called his focus on his, quote, enemies list.

If there are lists and numbers of women that continue to come out and talk about how they have been assaulted by this man, how are you going to actually justify voting for someone like that? You know, she mentioned being part of this coalition of Survivors for Harris. It's a coalition of over 200 women that signed an ad that went into The New York Times with organizations like the National Women's Law Center and Care in Action, and these are women who have said enough is enough. And I think this also gives permission to independent and Republican women that are actually tired of this dangerous culture that Donald Trump has ushered in to our American (INAUDIBLE). LANZA:  Let's talk about the dangerous culture. The dangerous culture is anytime we get close to the election, the Democratic Party is going to find an activist, the super activist we found out to come out with an allegation.",

SAMSAnd I think it's emblematic, though, of something bigger, which is that right now Donald Trump is struggling with women voters across this country by historic margins. I think it really goes back to the root cause, which was his appointment of three Supreme Court justices who overturned Roe v. Wade. And we're going to be in Texas tomorrow. The vice president is going to Texas tomorrow, which is really ground zero of the consequences of some of the extreme abortion bans that we've seen across this country thanks to former President Trump and thanks to conservatives like him who are really wreaking havoc on women and families across this country with people unable to get healthcare they need when they're going through a severe medical emergency at what is the worst time of their life, unable to get care. People are getting sepsis and bad infections. And some women unfortunately have even passed away because they're unable to get the care that they need. This is one of the most important issues in this election. It's something that we see over and over again voters across the board, not just women, but men who were concerned about the ramifications that this would have on their loved ones, friends and family. And so she's going right down to Texas tomorrow to speak about this, to talk about her plans to pass legislation that codifies Roe v. Wade, and for us to really fight to protect reproductive freedom and not go back to Trump and allow him to appoint more Supreme Court justices who would continue to do damage on this important issue. So, when it comes to women in this election, I think that the choice is very clear. It's why you're seeing her beating him by historic margins in some of the polls. And we think that the election is going to turn out such that women make their voices heard and reject Donald Trump.",
