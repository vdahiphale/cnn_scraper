They happened during a Sunday parade about 45 minutes apart from each other. No arrests have been made. U.S. health officials are investigating an E. coli outbreak linked to organic carrots. Dozens of cases have been reported across 18 states since September. One person has died. The carrots were sold at stores including Sprouts, Trader Joe's, Whole Foods and Target. They have been recalled. And officials in Asheville, North Carolina, say a boil water advisory could be lifted this week. Residents there have been living under the advisory since Tropical Storm Helene struck in late September. It caused devastating floods to the area and massive damage to the state's water system.",

But Jake, I think the whole point with these nominees, several of them, is their un-qualification, is their affirmative disqualification.

The second, because dust from construction sites, from roads and also vehicle emissions, contribute to pollution. And third, as winter settles into India, the cold air actually acts as a blanket and it traps some of those air pollutants.

CNN's Kristie Lu Stout has more.(COMMERCIAL BREAK) KRISTIE LU STOUT, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): This wheelchair can move like no others can. Engineers in South Korea have developed a shape-shifting morphing wheel, calling it the world's first. The wheel can shift between rigid and soft areas, providing stability on both flat ground and rocky paths. And it may even allow users to climb stairs. All this without complex machinery or fancy sensors. SONG SUNG-HYUK, PRINCIPAL RESEARCHER, KORIA INSTITUTE OF MACHINERY AND MATERIALS (through translator): Traditional wheels are designed to retain a rigid circular shape for stability on flat surfaces, which limits their ability to overcome obstacles. However, our wheel maintains its round form on flat ground and softens only when navigating obstacles. STOUT (voice-over): The wheels can reach speeds of 30 kilometers or 18 miles per hour. The innovation behind these wheels is simple yet groundbreaking. The wheel's flexibility is inspired by the surface tensions found in liquid droplets, says the researcher. SUNG-HYUK (through translator): When the force that pulls the outermost molecules of a liquid droplet inward increases, the droplet can maintain a stable circular shape. Similarly, our wheel is designed with a smart chain block on the outer edge. The greater the inward pull on this block, the more stably it maintains a round shape. STOUT (voice-over): The wheel turns firm for stability when the wire spokes pull the block inward. When it's loosened, it softens, allowing the wheel to adapt to uneven surfaces. Researchers see big potential for the wheel, from personal mobility to robots. SUNG-HYUK (through translator): This modularized wheel can be attached to any mobile platform simply by replacing existing wheels. Once installed, the wheel provides variable stiffness, adapting to each application. STOUT (voice-over): Kristie Lu Stout, CNN, Hong Kong. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
