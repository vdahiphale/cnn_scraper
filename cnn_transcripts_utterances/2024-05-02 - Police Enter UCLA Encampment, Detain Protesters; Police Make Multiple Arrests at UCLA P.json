I'll also have your other topinternational news this hour including the very latest on the crucial talks on a new deal between Israel and Hamas. As I say though, let's begin with UCLA and these pictures, which came to us overnight. You can see officers moving in as protesters formed a line to keep them out. This is the police started pulling down barricades, thrown up around the camp, arresting people and knocking down tents. The LAPD has declared the camp unlawful. Well, earlier the protests were peaceful. This was the scene as police tried unsuccessfully to convince protesters to leave. Well, so far, we're not seeing the sort of reports, we saw overnight violence. Certainly not this morning, it comes a day after pro-Palestinian protesters faced off with pro-Israel protesters. This is new video, from Royce Hall, a historic building on that campus now bearing the scars of occupation by protesters. CNN's Camila Bernal has been on the scene of the campus.

What's happening here? Well, hundreds of pro-Palestinian protesters have been arrested after a week-long or a week's long movement now across U.S. campuses. As students demonstrate over the Gaza conflict, that has put the students involved at odds with university leadership. These were mostly peaceful protests. But on a number of sites and UCLA included the police have been brought in for what the university and the police have described as unlawful encampments -- for our commentators to try and get their heads around what it is, that is unlawful about these encampments. And we will pursue that reporting as we move through these couple of hours. But suffice to say, we are seeing images of the use of force against what are the mostly peaceful protesters, inspiring students, it has to be said in other countries to demonstrate their feelings about Gaza. And similar demands for divestment from institutions who are invested in Israel will the UCLA protest, as I say, is one of many around the country. CNN's Gabe Cohen joins us live from New York's Fordham University. We are just showing our viewers pictures of what is now early morning of course in LA as police move demonstrators out detaining many of them gay and dismantling the encampment there.

And we'vebeen looking, Areva, at the images throughout the night at UCLA as police there detain student protesters who have been part of this week's long demonstration against Gaza. These are pro-Palestinian protesters demanding divestment of these institutions from Israel and the police. Now there and in Colombia 24 hours ago in New York, coming in some pretty violent scenes that we've seen, and calling a halt to these protests, how do you assess what is going on here? AREVA MARTIN, ATTORNEY &amp; LEGAL AFFAIRS COMMENTATOR: You know, Becky, one of the things that I'm looking at is the news that broke yesterday with respect to Brown University and Northwestern University. Both of those universities were able to enter into negotiations with student protesters and to reach agreements. Agreements that didn't require or result in the calling of law enforcement agreements that didn't result in the suspension or expulsion of students, but resulted in the students working together with the schools administrations, and coming up with a plan that would honor and respect the role that student protests play in our foundation is a democratic country. So it's kind of hard to watch what's happening at UCLA and Columbia, and juxtapose that with Northwestern and Brown without asking yourself, what's the difference? Is it a difference in leadership that caused us to see the peaceful resolution of those two universities while watching these very horrifying scenes at UCLA and Columbia?",

It is those arrested, of those arrested some 70 percent are students. So that this narrative of sort of, you know, agitators behind the scenes, co- opting these protests, not allowing the narrative to be one of simple sort of grassroots movement against Gaza is worrying, isn't it? The other sort of narrative that is doing the rounds is that the recent rise in the protests has inflamed tensions, forcing university leaders to decide when free speech on campus crosses a line and becomes threatening? Again you know there's a lot more to that than perhaps some of the sort of, you know, the statements being made, which are somewhat lacking in nuance.

Just want to bring you on and our viewers what Bernie Sanders has posted on X today. The U.S. Senator saying some of us have been out of school for many a while and may have forgotten what it is to be a student on American history. Protesting injustice and expressing our opinions is part of our American tradition. And what makes this in fact a free country. That's what the Constitution is all about. He did go on to suggest that the focus on these campuses to his mind. And Elizabeth Warren has said the same thing, heard nothing from Joe Biden himself only from his spokesman. But these two sorts of veteran lawmakers in the U.S., both saying that the concentrating sort of coverage on the campus protests takes away from what is going on in Gaza at present moment. We have no ceasefire deal, and hostages are still being held an imminent Israeli military offensive on Rafah. Do you agree with where these two U.S. lawmakers stand on this?",

I also agree that there needs to definitely be more focus on how do we end the mass of killings of children. We've seen that just a predominant number of people who've been killed in Gaza are overwhelmingly children. And so what is the administration doing and what are the world leaders doing to bring about it into the war? Definitely needs to continue to be the priority of the student protests showing these horrific images of students being you know, attacked in some ways by police officers in riot gear is very distressing. I'm a parent of two students on the Columbia University campus.
