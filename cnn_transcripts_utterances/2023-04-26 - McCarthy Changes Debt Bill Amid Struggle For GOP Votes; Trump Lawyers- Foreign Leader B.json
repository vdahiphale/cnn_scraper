The first one is that they agreed to a faster timeline to implement some of these new work requirements for Medicaid.Now, instead of starting in 2025, they are going to start in 2024 under this proposal. That was a change that was designed to win over conservatives like Matt Gaetz, who had made that as one of his conditions in order to support this bill. And then the second change that was made was that they agreed to nix a provision that would have repealed a trio of biofuel's tax credits. That was something that Midwestern Republicans who represent ethanol- producing states had expressed concern over. But leadership in a closed door meeting earlier today really tried to downplay these concessions. They framed them as just technical changes, because leadership had been insisting up until the very last minute that they weren't going to change this bill. But clearly, they realized that they needed to make some changes in order to win over the votes. And really, the central pitch during that conference meeting today from Kevin McCarthy was this bill is not going to become law, but he needs it in order to get to the negotiating table with President Biden. And indeed, if this bill is going to pass, it is going to be dead on arrival in the Senate. Just take a listen to how Chuck Schumer, the Democratic Senate Leader talked about the bill. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY): If anything, this revised bill is even more extreme, more radical, a more radical version of the Default on America Act. Let me be clear, Democrats cannot and will not allow the Republicans' DOA Act to ever become law. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Obviously, we talk about this often. There's been several of these fights. This is most closely reminiscent to 2011, I think where it was so clear that the possibility of going over the edge was so real and vivid that not only was the United States downgraded, but President Obama at the time was preparing his treasury secretary or telling his treasury secretary he needed to prepare for that reality.Now, that ended in a way that might be instructive to some degree. Then, Vice President Joe Biden working with then-Senate Minority - Majority Leader Mitch McConnell or Minority Leader Mitch McConnell and crafting together a proposal that they could get across the finish line by scraping together enough Democrats in the minority in the House along with the Senate Democrats and some Republicans as well and getting it over the finish line. Nobody was particularly happy with it. Republicans in the new majority in the House certainly didn't like everything that they got and I would note, most of the Budget Control Act, the caps that were put in place ended up getting blown through repeatedly year after year after year. However, there's kind of a model there that would, though, require the White House to start negotiating, which they have made clear they don't want to do, not because they don't feel like it's necessary, but they - because they want to take this threat off the table that we've had so many times since we were young, happy and stupid in 2011, Brianna.",

And this letter comes from Trump's top defense attorneys and it is addressed to congressional leaders with responsibility for oversight of the intelligence community. And they say they want those lawmakers to tell DOJ to stand down on their ongoing investigation into the possible mishandling of classified documents at Mar-A-Lago.Now, Boris, of course, Congress doesn't have the power to do that. But here, the Trump lawyers, they use this letter to make their case for why they believe these classified documents were mishandled. They believe this is a systemic problem that extends to other former presidents and vice presidents, including President Biden and former Vice President Mike Pence. And they say they believe the Justice Department has mishandled this probe and this should not be handled as a criminal investigation, but should be something for the intelligence community. But in their letter, they also reveal new details about the classified document investigation, including this. They now believe that classified briefings of phone calls with foreign leaders were among \"all manner of documents that were handed over in that initial batch of 14 boxes that was returned to the National Archives about a year after Trump left office.\" And they described what they believed happened, which is just that people swept all of these documents off of a desk and into boxes where they remained. Now, of course, Boris, we know that several months later, the FBI searched Mar-A-Lago after they allegedly received information that the former president may have directed the moving of some of these boxes. They found over 100 additional classified materials. Here the Trump lawyers say that the Justice Department has not told them anything about this classified materials and whether they are still classified or not. Now, this is a pretty big broadside against the Justice Department, Boris, here. They describe the ongoing criminal probe as \"misguided, ineffective and botched.\" Those are pretty strong words when you have a client currently facing multiple investigations by those same prosecutors.",

That's generally a surprise to a lot of American people who think that like the lower courts, they adhere to perhaps some sort of code of ethics, but they don't.And so this legislation would push to put in place some ethics measures that would apply to the Supreme Court. It would allow the court to do investigations, if they think that a justice or a staff member has violated any sort of conflict of interest or law or anything like that. It would also provide for them to put all of those rules on a website so people could access them, understand what they are. It would have an official that it kind of oversees all of the complaints, and then it would require that official to then publish a report. Again, these are all things that don't exist. This is from Angus King, a senator from Maine, who's an Independent that caucuses with Democrats and Sen. Lisa Murkowski, who's a Republican from Alaska. And Jim, you noted there have been a couple of instances that have come to light and really garnered a lot of attention in the last several weeks surrounding Justice Thomas and Justice Gorsuch. Justice Thomas with these trips, vacations, real estate deals with a GOP super donor and Justice Gorsuch with a real estate deal that, again, has all come under scrutiny. And it's worth noting as well, Jim, that Sen. Dick Durbin who heads up the Judiciary Committee had invited the Chief Justice John Roberts to come testify and Justice Roberts declining that invitation yesterday.",

And she described it, as you said, in chilling detail, the graphic rape that she said occurred in the dressing room at Bergdorf Goodman's - the department store here in New York City.She said it began as a flirty encounter. She ran into the former President Donald Trump. This is in 1996 when he was just a real estate tycoon. They were looking for a possible gift, he said, for a woman. They looked at hats, they looked at pan bags, and then they went up to the sixth floor, the department store she said. That is where she claims things turned violent. She said the former president pushed her up against the wall in the dressing room. She slammed her head against the wall. She said that he pulled down her tights and he raped her. And then she said that since then she's reported to friends. One friend told her she needed to go public, go to the police for this. Another friend cautioned her against that, saying that she believed that the former president would be - would bury her, would just destroy her reputation. And that is where Carroll said that this impact has really played a part. She said that she has not been able to form any romantic relationships since the alleged assault. She claims that she's not been able to look any man in the eye in order to engage in a relationship going forward. That she says is some of the damage. But right out of the gate, she really underscored why she was here today. And here's what she testified to: \"I'm here because Donald Trump raped me. And when I wrote about it, he said it didn't happen. He lied and shattered my reputation. And I'm here to try to get my life back.\" Now, she's been on the stand for most of the day. Her attorneys had just begun to get into some questions about her political views. She said she's a registered Democrat, but she said she's not motivated by politics in bringing this case. They have not yet gotten to the part of how this has harmed her professionally. That ties into some of this defamation claim. A lot of the testimony today so far been focused on battery. She's still on the stand right now and there's little less than two hours of court left in the day. Her attorney thought that he might be able to wrap up her testimony. Then, once that does occur, whether it's later today or tomorrow, that will be Donald Trump's lawyer's chance to cross-examine E. Jean Carroll. They've already signaled they're going to go hard at this. They say this attack never happened and she is motivated by money and politics. Boris?",
