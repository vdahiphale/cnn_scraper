      "sentences": "Yes. In fact, it seems that they've gone backwards. I don't think there's any question about that in terms of where things were when the President left for this trip, for this very high stakes summit, appointing his negotiating team to meet with the House Republican negotiating team. The first couple of meetings seemingly productive.The President throughout the course of the G7 summit, whenever he was asked about the debt limit or the debt ceiling negotiation seemed to strike a relatively positive tone, or at least a tone that seemed to understand that this was kind of a negotiation that was eventually going to get there. That was a very different tone than we heard from earlier -- sorry. It was a very different tone than we heard today. And I think what that underscores is the fact that things are just very far apart right now. You mentioned that call with Speaker McCarthy, the President saying perhaps that the Speaker wanted to wait to actually negotiate directly with the President. I can tell you, the Speaker would very much like to negotiate directly with the President. We'll see how that kind of construct plays out after that phone call. But I think the reality here, and I think foreign leaders were aware of it throughout the course of this summit, a very high stakes and a very substantive and consequential summit in terms of what came away from it, that this was hanging over everything. And there was not a lot of time to figure this out. And at this point, there are no new meetings scheduled outside of the call between the President and the Speaker. And I think perhaps most interestingly, the President was asked about the 14th Amendment, this idea of using unilateral action to address this if no deal is made. And he made clear what he's made clear in the past, that they have looked into this deeply. They have considered it. They think it might even work, but they know it would face legal challenges and probably would end up having the same effect given the short time frame. So I asked at the very end, does that mean that there are no unilateral options, there are no fallback plans, there is no executive action you can take? The President said yes, essentially. Said, this is up to lawmakers. He said, it's up to lawmakers. So that's the reality. Eleven days until a potential default, there is no fallback plan. Lawmakers have to reach a deal, and they are very far from one right now, guys.",

But from India's position, post-pandemic, they need cheap fuel. Their economy got shattered by COVID, and they also have always felt the need to keep Moscow onside to offset the threat of China.

From the Ukrainian perspective, they took Russia's stubborn persistence in Bakhmut, they took advantage of it because estimates are that it's cost Moscow five to one soldiers, many, many casualties to take that ground. So -- because it's always harder to take ground than to hold it.So now they've gotten what is essentially a shattered city, the majority of it, but the Ukrainians have been trying to sort of draw them in. It'll be interesting to see what the Ukrainian next step is. There's been talk even of encircling the Russian troops and then attacking them.

I don't think anybody should say any store whatsoever by statements coming from Wagner leader Prigozhin, because he likes to make these dramatic statements on an almost daily basis, garnering a huge amount of unwarranted media attention, quite frankly. And the battle for Bakhmut is going to ebb and flow. They may or may not be dominant in the urbanized area. They are certainly under pressure on the flanks. The Ukrainians are insisting that they still have people in the urban area and claiming short-term victories simply illustrates a failure to understand that battles are dynamic rather than static occasions. They don't end like a soccer match. They continue indefinitely until there is an absolute result. Arguably, indeed, the Ukrainians could be in the process of encircling what remains of the Wagner mercenary group in the urban area, which is a free fire zone.

Also, the push among European nations to, despite the threat of nuclear war by Russia, give the Ukrainians F-16s means that they are seeing this in terms of we need to help Ukraine win as soon as possible and we also need to help Ukraine supplant or prevent any future Russian invasion that could threaten Kyiv again. And sophisticated technology like those jets does that, even though it's going to take a minimum of roughly four to five months to train the Ukrainian pilots.

While the black community makes up 13 percent of the U.S. population, only about five percent of U.S. physicians are black.So, to address this issue, Senator Bernie Sanders met with leaders of historically black medical schools with the goal of finding ways to increase diversity in the healthcare sector. Dr. Hugh Mighty was one of those leaders at Senator Sanders' roundtable. He is a senior vice president for health affairs at Howard University. Dr. Mighty, thank you so much for your time this morning. So, tell me more about this conversation you had with Senator Sanders. What did you tell him? DR. HUGH MIGHTY, SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT FOR HEALTH AFFAIRS, HOWARD UNIVERSITY: So, I did -- what we told him was that, you know, when you look at the rate of physicians in the country where we have a shortage of physicians, that is deemed exacerbated though when you look at minority and underserved communities. We have fewer black doctors available to serve those communities. So, we need to have more physicians, more black physicians, and the historically black medical colleges that are here can get more, but there are some bottlenecks to doing so.",

So, an average graduate today is going to graduate with between $200,000 and $300,000 worth of debt. That's exacerbated among our black medical students because many of them enter medical school with a lot of premedical school college debt to follow them. So, there's a very high cost to go into a medical school. So, that's one. The second one, and just as importantly, as we try to increase the number of doctors that we can produce, their second step is to go through residency training. That's when you really become a doctor, all right. That's when people talk about internists or surgeons or OB- GYNs. The number of slots available in country are not enough to accommodate the increase in graduates. So, each year several, several -- actually, over 1,000 graduates will go without slots.

The mayor of New York, Eric Adams, has talked about this over and over, over the past several weeks as migrants continue to arrive here in the city. Now, we saw about three buses arrive throughout the day and we are expecting that number to increase throughout the weekend and we are averaging, here in the City of New York, about 600 migrant arrivals per day. So, shelter, as I mentioned, continues to be one of the key issues. Now, I wanted to speak to one of the advocates that has been working with the migrant community over the past several months about the issues and the challenges that they are having when it comes to sheltering people. And the conversation around this community, some places outside of New York City have filed lawsuits to stop New York from busing migrants to their suburbs. Listen to what he had to say.

And we filmed in 4k, incredible images of the Titanic and it was deteriorating which worried us.So, two things worried us. One, it was deteriorating. Two, to really tell the Titanic story, we had to develop new technology to actually be able to capture this on a one-to-one resolution. And I found a company, who -- Magellan, who were specialists in this in the development technology to do it. No one else in the world could do it, and that's how the expedition happened. And it's hard to describe, but you can literally -- you are probably seeing some of the images, you can literally look at a single bolt on the side of this massive boat and move around it. And we're finding the most extraordinary human stories already. It took us seven months to consolidate all those images and data together but we now have an exact replica that we can walk around in, virtual reality or in any other way, and we're finding really extraordinary human stories.",

People say, well, what can you tell from a digital twin of a wreck? Well, some of the experts have found already that one of the questions when the Titanic sank is, how could the lights have remained on? I mean, who was keeping the lights on?And what -- in the debris field, which is around the Titanic, the experts have found what's called boiler room one. And boiler room one, we now realize, was a light because it's fractured when it went in the water. So, we now know the very people, exact people who were in boiler room one who are keeping it going. That's on story. Let me give you another story. The other side of the boat. There's a guy called Officer Murdoch, there's always been a villain in the story and indeed so was in the Cameron film was a villain, because he wouldn't launch the last lifeboat. We went to the area where that lifeboat is, and it's extraordinary, there is a pin or davit still there. And the reason he couldn't launch the lifeboat is because the lifeboat couldn't launch because there was a pin in the way of launching. So, we're -- that completely rewrites it. Go to the debris field, which is a three-mile by three-mile radius, is where when the boat was sinking, it put out all the belongings of the people on the ship. And there you have hats and you have necklaces and watches. The most incredible things on the bottom of the ocean. But we realized, how could you humanize that? So, we got every photograph that existed of everybody on the Titanic and we're use A.I. to link those particular belongings to individuals. So, certainly, the bottom of the ocean is coming alive with the passengers and people who were on that boat. This is just the beginning, however. Many things are going to be found out. And we are now working on putting the model as it were back together. And for the first time, we'll really understand how this ship sank.",

Because you imagine, the experts are actually walking into the Titanic every day and finding clues to what happened in this extraordinary thing. But I like the fact that the digital twin is allowing us to go back and really look at one of the great events in history.",
