      "sentences": "Overnight the Ukrainian air force says it intercepted 23 of the 25 Russian cruise missiles launched their way. Fifteen targeted the capital of Kyiv. This video you're seeing right here shows the smoke trails from the explosions over the city at dawn. It is the fifth heavy assault on Kyiv this month. And there was a CNN team just 700 yards from where one missile landed in southeast Ukraine.Watch this. (VIDEO CLIP) BOLDUAN: That was CNN's Nick Paton Walsh's team. He joins us now from Zaporizhzhia. Nick, thanks for being here. I want to show folks also -- show what - what you - what you did -- showed us later was you actually stood in the crater of that blast of what was created and what was left over from that explosion. That's enormous, the kind of destruction. Just a reminder yet again of the destruction that these missiles leave behind. What are you hearing and learning about the strike, the target and what people there are preparing for now?",

      "sentences": "Yes, look, I mean, what you're referring to there is a town called Orahiv (ph), which has been mauled, frankly, by Russian air strikes and artillery for I think it's fair to say the last month or so. It is on the front line on the southern front where many expect Ukraine's counteroffensive to put most of its energy.But what startled us over a number of days there was the sort of indiscriminate nature. I mean, yes, you could possibly think there might be military targets around they could hit. We can't discuss them in detail (INAUDIBLE) reporting restrictions. But often these strikes miss wildly. And the missile that flew over our heads cost half a million dollars according to some western estimates. So, these are not things to necessarily be trifled with or used liberally. But they are used in great indiscriminate frequency along that particular front line. So, this is a sign, I think, of Russia beginning to express its rage, its bids to hold Ukraine back. It's unclear how effective that is necessarily going to be. We did see ourselves, black smoke further on the horizon that suggested a key objective for Ukraine, a town called Talkmik (ph), might be being hit quite hard. So, this is all part of the general sense that we may be seeing the opening stages of the counteroffensive getting underway. Russia continues to launch barrages of drones and missiles nightly, frankly, for the past week across all of Ukraine, startling the volume they're sending. What's more startling, frankly, is the effectiveness so far of Ukrainian air defenses. You mentioned how all 15 cruise missiles targeting the capital were intercepted according to Ukrainian officials and only two got through across the country. We've seen intermittent awful moments where some of these missiles have got through in Oman, in Kherson, some shelling got through last week as well. But the broader story is that Russia's barrages are not really that effective because of Ukraine's improved air defenses. A secondary story to all of this now is we begin to see the tension around this counteroffensive building is the extraordinary disunity of Russia's messaging at the moment. We've talked about the victory day parades in Moscow, shrunken smaller. But, at the same time, the mercenary team, Yevgeny Prigozhin, has bene going back and forth as to whether or not he's going to leave the symbolic city of Bakhmut. And, today, saying, in fact, well, he's not getting the shells he needs and so he's not clear what he's necessarily going to do there. So, real Moscow disunity on display on a day - victory day, they're trying to project unity and strength. A lot wrong in the house of Russia. Kate.",

And this has just been political intrigue inside of the Kremlin that's burst out into the open. The Russians are seeing this.The world is seeing this. There's this individual who has no military background, that's Prigozhin. He is not a soldier. He knows very little about soldering, just throwing meat at the Ukrainians and killing a lot of Russians and then proclaiming that he's not getting support. It's just amazing to me a lack of professionalism and the fact that Russian generals, who aren't very good by my assessment based on personal conversations and also what I'm watching, are allowing this to happen and that Mr. Putin is using this as a strategy to stoke things inside the Kremlin.",

You've got a new essay out on cnn.com about the end of this pandemic officially. But what does this really mean and are doctors who were in hospitals, do they feel like the emergency is over?DR. SANJAY GUPTA, CNN CHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, I think - I think it depends. You know, there are certainly people who are still very venerable. I think for a lot of people, this is going to feel a bit arbitrary and abrupt, and for others it's going to feel like, hey, I didn't even realize we were still calling this a pandemic. They sort of had turned out months if not a year ago. Let me just show you quickly, Sara, you know, if you look at the number of cases overall, you - this is sort of -- sort of look at the history of the pandemic, if the country were my patient, I would sort of say, here is the chart. And you can see, there have been times when the patient was really quite sick in the ICU, needing critical care, but there's still about 77,000 cases per week of Covid. When it comes to hospitalizations, again, there have been some ups and downs. About 1,200 people in the hospital right now. And then when it comes to deaths, still about 1,100 people per week. What I would say is this, Sara, to your question. If you do the math and you say, look, the numbers are going to stay sort of plateaued now, we're calling it the end and they're going to plateau here, that would equating to about 54,000 to 55,000 people dying a year. That's similar to a bad flu season. And we could do a lot better in terms of bringing those numbers further down before declaring the end, but I think the collective will seems to have, you know, sort of dissipated here in terms of manning this. We're treating this like a bad flu season, essentially. And I think that's how doctors think about it as well. Some say, hey, look, if you're healthy, you're not likely to get very sick from this and die. But if you are someone who is elderly or has pre-existing conditions, there's still a concern. Let me just show you quickly. I mean, you know, we talked about the elderly being at high risk, but people who have these pre-existing conditions put you at high risk as well. Everything from kidney disease to obesity can significantly increase the risk. If you have immunity, if you have access to antivirals, like Paxlovid, there's no reason at this point to get very sick or die. And I think that that is sort of he bottom line from the medical community.",
