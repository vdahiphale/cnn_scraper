We're getting new details into CNN this hour. We have the very latest as this story is breaking.Plus, new video into CNN of Russian brutality against their own soldiers. We have this video out Russians running over their own dead and injured. And new questions tonight about Congressman George Santos. We've got a new report saying he was charged with theft after a series of bad checks were written to dog breeders. A lawyer who has known him since middle school said he asked her for help fight the charges and then she'll tell you what happened next. Let's go OUTFRONT. Good evening. I'm Erin Burnett. OUTFRONT tonight, the breaking news, subpoenaed. Former Vice President Mike Pence has now been subpoenaed by the special counsel investigating Donald Trump's efforts to overturn the 2020 election. A source is telling CNN that the special counsel wants documents and testimony, both related to Trump's actions leading up to the election and the January 6 insurrection. Pence, of course, was at the center of Trump's efforts to cling to power. Trump repeatedly pressured his then vice president who, of course, was the one who was going to go in right to Congress and oversee the certification of the Electoral College to block or deny Biden's win. Here's what happened. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

We reported back in November that the Justice Department had approached the vice president's team about trying to get his testimony. And we know that he has certainly a lawyer, Emmett Flood, who is a hawk when it comes to issues related to executive privilege. So, we knew this was going to be a difficult conversation certainly for the Justice Department to try to get to some of the things that Mike Pence knows.As you just played some of those clips, you can see that he knows a lot. He is an important witness to this investigation. And the Justice Department and Jack Smith, the new special counsel, absolutely want to get some of those answers. What we know is that this is obviously related to January 6th. That's what Kaitlan Collins is told by a source. We know that Mike Pence and his team when they published a memoir back in November, they knew that things that were being put in that book were going to be open -- essentially open the door for prosecutors to come and ask him questions. So, you can bet that -- you know, knowing his lawyer, he is going to go o comply with the subpoena. There are some questions that I'm sure he's not going to be prepared to answer because he still believes that it is shielded by executive privilege. And then the Justice Department will have the option of going to a judge to try to force his compliance to answer additional questions. That's something that's probably going to be down the line. But, just to give you a sense, Erin, back in his book, in his memoir, he talks a lot about some of his conversations with Donald Trump, including going back to December, right? Talking about -- beginning to talk about challenging the vote and those key meetings in January involving John Eastman and some of the people who were putting together this plan to try to overturn the election.

And I warn you that what we're about to share with you is graphic and is disturbing. I'm going to walk you through it. It's footage from a Ukrainian drone of a Russian tank.The operator of the tank is trying to avoid being struck in doing that runs over his own men. You see him dragging their man, running over another. Like rag dolls, dead, injured they don't care. We're showing this because this horrible image is so powerful. Imagine that just running over your own men, the people fighting and dying beside you like rag dolls. According to our Tim Lister on the ground in Ukraine, this is consistent with Russia's actions on the battlefield. This isn't some sort of an anomaly. And that tank operator is one of thousands that are like sitting ducks in Ukraine's wide open east. We have another video. You see a column of Russian tanks believed to be in eastern Ukraine. These roads are straight roads right the middle of nowhere, driving along, spotted by Ukrainian drones. Series of strikes taking out those tanks one by one another all that's left is a charred graveyard tanks still burning. According to Ukraine, Russia lost about 10,000 tanks and armored vehicles in the loss of human life continues to mount, which is why something that happened today stands out as odd. The leader of the brutal Wagner Group, Yevgeny Prigozhin, announcing today that he will no longer be recruiting prisoners to fight in the invasion. Now this is significant if he's telling the truth. Because Prigozhin has sent more than 50,000 convicts to the front lines in Ukraine. So why would he no longer be recruiting convicts? Well, the answer is unclear. But the shift in strategy could be blamed on the mass Russian casualties, could be blamed on tank operators driving over their own dead and injured like rag dolls. Maybe the interest from Russian convicts even to join this war is quite simply no longer there. But now, Russia is stooping to a whole new level to shame its young men into fighting. The face of Russian state television, you see her all the time, we show her to you, is now telling young men it's no big deal if you die 30 years early.

He might simply be running out of people willing to go even in Russian jails. Of course, word is spreading that the attrition rates for Wagner are extremely high.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK) [19:56:44] BURNETT:  Tonight, intelligence from top secret U.S. spy planes is providing startling details about China's spy operations. We are learning that images taken of the spy balloons by high altitude U2 planes show in detail five antennas and huge solar panels, the kind of technology that gave the Chinese not just the ability to listen to U.S. communications and to pinpoint exactly where they were coming from, who they were coming from. All of this especially alarming as the balloon passed over sensitive military sites before the U.S. Air Force shot it down off the South Carolina coast. And, of course, we know there have been other balloons where that one came from. These new details come as China is forcefully pushing back against President Biden's very public criticism of President Xi Jinping at the State of the Union.

Now China is attacking the U.S. for shooting down its balloon and sending the pieces to an FBI lab. The spokesman says the U.S. insists on using force to attack Chinese unmanned civilian air ships which seriously violates international practice and sets a horrible precedent.
