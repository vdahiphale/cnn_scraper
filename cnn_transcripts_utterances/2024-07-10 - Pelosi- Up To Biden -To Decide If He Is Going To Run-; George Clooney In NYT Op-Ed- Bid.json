Democrats fear and desperation about Joe Biden's candidacy is palpable, but only a few are willing to say it publicly. And the White House says there is, quote, zero chance Biden will drop out.Plus, a political bombshell from Hollywood. George Clooney, a major Biden donor who was with the president three weeks ago says, he's not the man he wants was and the party will lose unless Biden drops out. And an Obama White House reunion. Jon Favreau and his former boss David Axelrod will join me with their blunt advice for the White House and the president that they love. But they say feels is quote, dangerously out of touch. I'm Dana Bash. Let's go behind the headlines at Inside Politics. First up, a lot of anxiety, very little action. Many Democrats we talked to are panicking. They think that their candidate is going to lose and is going to lose big. And while just a handful are actually calling for Joe Biden to drop out publicly. They're not answers in many cases are incredibly telling. Here's former Speaker Nancy Pelosi earlier today on MSNBC, when she was asked if she supports Joe Biden at the top of the ticket still.

Also, the donor class as well as Hollywood celebrities, who've given a lot of money and help to Biden raise money like George Clooney, just this morning calling for the president to step aside in this race. Now the president has behind the scenes work to the phones, trying to the shore up support that he can, as he's looking to stay in this race.

And even since she said that a few hours ago, a lot has changed.The George Clooney op-ed is not just a celebrity, writing something from the cheap seats. He loves Joe Biden. He was with him recently. He's been a longtime supporter and admirer of him. So, this is more than someone from afar. This is almost from within. But Pelosi clearly making the calculation that it's his decision to make, leaving it still in his court, but raising the specter of, can he win. And urging people to not talk publicly, as Senator Michael Bennet did and others. But really reopening the conversation again, almost as if to say President Biden, you have one more chance.

He's not going anywhere. He's in this race. So, from their view, this is said and done. She's saying no, it's not said and done. And well, former Speaker Pelosi doesn't say anything by accident. Having covered her also a pretty long time. And this is her essentially saying, even though this week as we're seeing -- a lot of Democrats told me they saw this week as the week they hoped that things would wrap up that they hoped that one way or the other, they would be able to solve this issue. That's not going to happen. And she even said, let's hold off. And we can have this conversation after NATO, after our allies leave. And she's also essentially giving room.

And that is, at this moment in time where most of the Democrats are, most of them are not saying, step aside. Mr. President, it's time.Most of them are saying, don't tell us to back down. Don't tell us that we're bed wetters. This is so critical. We have to have these public conversations. Actually, let me just reframe that.

They've done a good job in terms of showing progress, winning this war that he can stay in.The question is, what kind of a race is he staying in for? As this has all been going on in Washington, as the president has been winning the CBC support and the Congressional Hispanic Caucus support. The battleground has gotten wider. It has gotten more complicated. And that is why the concern is rising up from the ranks of Democrats. So, you know, we look at our map. It is changed already. And before the debate, quite frankly, the former president was a significantly -- he had some advantages in the states. Now the Biden map, should he be in a week from now, two weeks from now.

I mean, before the debate, the down ballot Democrats were already pulling ahead of President Joe Biden. In the end, they were running on his record, and they liked running it on his record. Since the debate now, they're very concerned that it's not just the presidency, that they could lose their concern, that they could lose the House and the Senate. Senate was always going to be tough. Now it's tougher. And they thought that they could maybe very well win the House back. Now, they're concerned, they're not going to. And so that's what I'm hearing from a lot of the campaign staffers on those, like vulnerable -- in those vulnerable districts. They're worried about what this means for them, especially as Democrats are also still trying to make the argument that they're deadly concerned about democracy being at stake.

We'll keep our jobs. I forget the member of Congress who wrote an op-ed saying, like, I'll be fine if Trump is president, as long as he can keep his job.Laura is exactly right. Like we live in an era of historic partisanship. The idea of -- maybe there'll be a Trump (inaudible) voter or a few in Arizona. But the ticket is going to shift one direction or the other. The idea that there's going to be ticket splitters and these down ballot members are going to be safe. If Joe Biden is at the top of the ticket, I think that's lunacy.",

What he said, but that doesn't mean that they don't think what he thought.And Dana, as you first reported from that luncheon yesterday, that was a worry that ran through the course of lunch. And Senator Bennet, they're not a flame thrower at all. His words carry significant weight inside his caucus. HAMBY I was going to say that Mikie Sherrill in House, flip that seat in 2018. She knows how to read a poll. She is a national security, moderate, the kind of person who normally is all in on Joe Biden in New Jersey. She's coming out and saying -- and again, maybe not reading the poll. And Sherrod Brown also jumped out at me too, not just because he's in a comatose state.

That was my takeaway March when I met up with her in Arizona for my Snapchat show, Good Luck America. We talked for good 20 minutes. I saw her, talked about the record, et cetera. She has improved. She's met with 150 world leaders. She's in the media glare. When you're vice president, you're going to get batting practice and you're naturally going to improve.The argument from the Democrats, Democrats in the never Trump people who want to dump Biden is that Kamala Harris would at least be a reset button and could carry forward a coherent message about abortion, about anything. She can talk very cleanly. And she has been good in recent days. The question is, Joe Biden, despite thinking right now, has a pretty impressive coalition that no other potential Democratic nominee has. Sure, maybe Kamala Harris choices your support among young people, among people of color. Does she lose Biden's relative support among older voters in the upper Midwest? Does she lose support among white voters? And I think the Trump campaign, if Kamala somehow becomes the nominee would certainly try to spook the electorate. That's for sure. BARRON-LOPEZ: I think he was talking to some Republican voters in Arizona recently, I checked in with him after the debate. These are voters that switched to -- they basically vote Democratic now because of the fact that they feel like they don't have a home in their party. They can't vote for Trump. I asked them, I said, whether or not they thought President Biden should step aside. They said, yes. They think President Biden should step aside. These are older white male voters. And then I said, but would you vote for Vice President Harris if she were the nominee? And they said, well, at the end of the day, yes. And I was surprised because, you know, months prior, when I had spoken to these voters, they had said that Harris scared them as the potential for a nominee. They wouldn't have necessarily supported Harris. But when voters are confronted with the choice of Trump or a Democrat, they appear even very conservative.

No tax on tips highlighted for Nevada, talking about EVs, Michigan. It's a little more nuanced than that.But look, the reality here is there's not been much focus on the Trump second term agenda, because Democrats, at least of late have been busy talking about themselves. And this is something that President Biden did not prosecute in the debate at all. He didn't talk about Project 2025, which is not the Trump campaigns, but to people who are supportive of him, their vision. He didn't talk about that. So, the question is, I think this campaign will get back to an agenda discussion. But back to Kamala Harris for one second, the vice president. The people I have been speaking with all week-long since all this has been talking. And I wrote last week, she's in a historic holding pattern. She -- her hands are tied. Here her decision is not her own. She does have to wait to see what President Biden does. But the biggest question about her, should she become the backup plan, if that's even necessary, is what is the handoff look like? Does President Biden fully endorse her, which most people think yes, he would. How fast would people fall into line? So, she is starting this if it happens, it's still a big if at this hour. This is still President Biden's decision to make. And he is at NATO as we saw, he may not be aware of the George Clooney thing, the Rob Reiner thing, or any of us.
