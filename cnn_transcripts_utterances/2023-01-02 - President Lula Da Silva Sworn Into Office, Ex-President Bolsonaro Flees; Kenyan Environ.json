On Friday, the sitting president -- the then- sitting President Jair Bolsonaro leaves town, with no explanation, for Florida. On Saturday, New Year's Eve, a huge celebration in Brazil. And then on Sunday, a new president is sworn in.This, after Brazil holding its breath for basically two months since the election. That's because President Jair Bolsonaro had said that he would accept the results of the elections if he had lost. His supporters blocked highways and marched to military headquarters asking for military intervention. But eventually, the president decided instead of resisting he would leave the country, opening the way for Lula to focus on the future. Like you said, he's already enacted a series of executive orders making it tougher to own and carry guns in this country. But that had been a very important point of the Bolsonaro campaign and of his government -- this idea of self-reliance, of self-protection. He's also made it already easier for Brazil's environmental agency to charge and prosecute environmental crimes, signaling to that really important issue of Lula's campaign of saving the Amazon. And another issue -- something that is very dear to Lula's heart -- is bringing financial aid to families in need. This has been a tent pole of his political career -- something that he's been campaigning over since 1989, the first time he ran for office -- hunger, food insecurity. He got quite emotional, Kristin, talking to crowds in Brasilia yesterday about this issue. He cried several times throughout the day. And he even mentioned a story from his first presidential campaign of a man who was holding up a sign that said \"Help me, please. I'm hungry.\" Now, Lula has already said that he's going to be meeting with several leaders of Latin America and Africa today -- a series of bilateral meetings in Brasilia. And Brazilian media is reporting that he is expected to be here in Santos later today to pay his respects to Pele. You can see behind me here people have been lining up since this morning. It's going to be a full house. And how significant for the first day of a new president on a third term, after 12 years not being in power, to come and say goodbye to a man that has meant so much to so many Brazilians, Kristin.",

So what we want to do instead of culture fit -- ignore culture fit. That's not a thing. That's a thing of the past. We want to think about purpose fit. When you look for people who you want to promote in the organization, or when you're a worker and you're looking for a job that you want to have, what company should you join -- think about companies that have a purpose that align with your purpose.
