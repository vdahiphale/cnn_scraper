That is never a good sign.I would note though, that Deutsche Bank has been in turmoil for years. This is not entirely new. But the bank failures in the United States really forced investors around the world to take a tougher look at banks. And as you can see of regional banks in the U.S., they're kind of mixed right now. First Republic is the one that's getting the most attention, down another 2 percent. It's lost something like 90 percent of its value over the past month. It's been incredible. Now, on the Deutsche Bank front, European officials were quick to come out today and sort of say, look, there's nothing to see here. The chairman of -- the Chancellor of Germany said there's \"no reason to be concerned about Deutsche Bank.\" U.S. officials, they're obviously watching this whole situation closely. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, she is scheduled to convene a closed- door meeting of America's top financial regulators today. And that meeting includes the head of the FDIC, the SEC, and the Chairman of the Federal Reserve, and you got to believe that this is going to be one of the things they talk about.",

A lot of experts wanted the Fed to pause because of this banking crisis after the Fed unanimously decided to raise interest rates. Moody's chief economist Mark Zandi, he said he's you know \"disappointed in the Fed\" and kind of warned that it could backfire.So, I asked the Richmond Fed President, Tom Barkin about why they ended up going ahead in raising interest rates. And he said, \"the case for raising was pretty clear. The labor market is tight. Historically tight. Inflation, unfortunately, has stayed too high. And you know, I asked Barkin about this criticism from politicians, including Senator Elizabeth Warren, who were saying, you know, the Fed is basically trying to get people laid off from their job. And he said that -- you know when he goes out and talks to people in his district, that the one thing he hears again and again, is that people \"hate inflation.\" And he said, you know, people want us to get inflation back under control. And he said that we're the guys who were charged with doing that. So, Kate, clearly, the Fed is still thinking that inflation is public enemy number one. But there are some risks to that. And one of the risks here is the situation that we're seeing in the banking system.",

The governor just signed first-of-its-kind legislation that bans anyone under 18 from using social media without their parent's permission.Now, the law which goes into effect next March also bans all advertising to minors, imposes a nighttime curfew, making the sites off limits from 10:30 p.m. to 6:30 a.m. And the new law will give parents access to their teen's accounts. Social media companies are expected to challenge these bold moves in court, but Utah's governor says that he's confident the state will prevail. Meanwhile, China is calling efforts to ban TikTok in the United States part of a \"xenophobic witch hunt.\" China also denies asking Chinese companies to share foreign users' data. The remarks come after the hours-long grilling that TikTok CEO received yesterday on Capitol Hill. Appearing before lawmakers, he tried to assure that the platform protects Americans' data.

It's actually quite different from the old Cold War.And then we have a variety of surveillance concerns by China. The balloon was the one that got the most headlines and most attention and probably is the least important because they can pick a lot of that data up from satellite. TikTok and apps like it, that's a bigger issue, less for surveillance in my mind, then the question of what kind of data manipulation can take place once it's in your phone, what kind of movement of disinformation can happen once it's in your phone, so, these are the issues that we're going to have to work our way through.
