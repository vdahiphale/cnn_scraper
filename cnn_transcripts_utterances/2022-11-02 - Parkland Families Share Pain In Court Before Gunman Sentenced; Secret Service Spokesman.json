After the judge is expected to hand down a sentence for the gunman, that sentence life in prison without parole, some of the parents did address the court yesterday. Among them Patricia Oliver, whose son Joaquin was killed in the 2018 massacre. She spent much of that time admonishing the legal team for arguing to spare the shooter, the death penalty.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) PATRICIA OLIVER, MOTHER OF PARKLAND SHOOTING VICTIM JOAQUIN \"GUAC\" OLIVER: I have emptiness. I have sadness and I have grief. I am broken. I am broken. All of us. Now, we are broken. Me, our family and friends are shattered for ever. Victimizing and pleading mercy for this defender, it's on you. On you, on you. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Well, to me directly, no, they were complaining after I left the court. And they were trying just to minimize the comments from the families.

Difficult was to be listening every single detail that we ignore at all. So it was relieved to be there and finally can see them in front, because that was one of my concerns -- in the position that I will be the stand that I can be able to see them because I need to see their faces. So when I came to court, and I saw the stand in the place that he was, I said, OK. Now is my time and that's how I began my talk. Because he wasn't speech, I will call that a speech. It was my thought to them. And I could see face to face each of them, including the defendant. And that's why we are paying a lot of attention to him. And I hope that, you know, from today and on, we forget about him. He doesn't even exist. And that's what I treated him in that way.",

What I said was inside of every single heart and head from every single parent, and families and related families that were there yesterday. So I was their voice. When I turned back, I went to my -- to the bench, they were just looking at me and say, thank you. They were about to applaud me. Because I was, you know, it's a feeling that you have inside that you have to carry it, carry it, carry it every day. You have no idea, the comments, the discussions that they were there and we were just able to be looking at each other and say, really? They are saying these kinds of stuff about this guy. So there were so many situations that you going to take it off you because the only one who's going to be suffering and damaging your body and your state of mind is you. So you are very already damaged. You're already in pain because I lost Joaquin. And that's the pain I have to reserve. I don't have to carry extra one. I don't have to carry an extra burden.

So there are negotiations going on. But I don't think either side ever expects this to happen.I mean, even once you get past the fact that time is going to run out, he has a legitimate Fifth Amendment problem here.

You see here before Dobbs, it was about 28 minutes on average. Now it's more than an 1.5 at 100 minutes. And another interesting finding in this report, Erica, the researchers also looked at how many women lived more than an hour away from an abortion facility. And here's what that finding was. Before Dobbs, 14.6 percent of women of reproductive age lived more than an hour from abortion facilities. After a Dobbs decision, it jumped to 33.3 percent.
