An extraordinary exchange, Russia and the West trading 24 prisoners, including Evan Gershkovich and Paul Whelan, in the largest release deal since the Cold War. Inevitable response. Hezbollah's leader says Israel crossed red lines with a strike that killed a top commander, but stopped short of declaring war. And Biles bonanza. The U.S. Olympian earning a sixth career gold medal at the Paris Games. All that and plenty more coming up. But first, the biggest prisoner swap between Russia and the West since the Cold War. U.S. Marine veteran Paul Whelan and Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich are on their way home, with the newspaper calling it one of the most complicated swaps in history, at least seven countries and 24 detainees were involved, with the exchanged Russian prisoners receiving hugs from President Vladimir Putin on their arrival in Moscow. The deal hailed by the White House as a major diplomatic achievement after years of negotiations. President Joe Biden pictured here on a call with the prisoners' families in the Oval Office. And Matthew Chance joins us now. Matthew, a year in the making at least, and the end of, I think, a living nightmare for these political prisoners and their families, and hopefully, they'll be reunited in a few hours' time.",

Kara-Murza is a major Putin critic, and he was sentenced to 25 years in prison after denouncing the war on Ukraine. Bill, fantastic to have you on the show. How does this moment feel?

And, you know, the whole world has changed overnight. I and Vladimir's mother and his wife, all thought that there is a reasonably high probability that he would die in custody. He had been poisoned twice before using Novichok. He was suffering from the after effects of those poisonings. He was put in solitary confinement. He was -- he had all sorts of terrible health problems, they refused him medical treatment. And a lot of doctors told us that he wouldn't survive two years, let alone 25 years. And so, to watch him get off that airplane in Ankara today was just the most unbelievably uplifting image.

And a release of hostages is a big diplomatic win for Joe Biden. But the fact that Joe Biden has dropped out of the U.S. presidential election means that that problem disappears, that's it's not really a huge political win for Kamala Harris. She wasn't involved. It was Joe Biden who did this. And so, Putin can effectively give that gift to Joe Biden without giving -- without harming his support of Trump. And I think that that's a crucial development that happened in the last month that changed the whole chemistry of the situation. And having watched this very closely, because I've been involved in the case of Vladimir Kara- Murza, I could see how the stance shifted very quickly after Biden dropped out of the race.",

President Biden talks often about his work tostrengthen alliances that, in his view, had frayed under his predecessor and chalking up those relationships to the ability to get this deal across the finish line. I also asked Jake Sullivan, the national security adviser, to what extent Russia was involved in this. He said that there was no contact with Vladimir Putin personally and the United States, but that there were multiple of his officials down the chain who were involved through a specific communication channel devoted just to this topic. So, officials don't expect there to be any sort of denouement or detente between the U.S and Russia or any sort of new goodwill to reach a deal, say on the war in Ukraine or on other topics. But certainly, it is a win. It is a momentous occasion and a cause for celebration to have these individuals returning to American soil this evening for the very first time, in some cases in years. It resulted -- it was the result of years of diplomacy, painstaking negotiations, much of it behind the scenes, including a call between President Biden and the prime minister of Slovenia, that was the final leader level call that happened before this deal was able to be clinched. After President Biden spoke to the Slovenian leader, which happened just one hour before he made this stunning announcement that he was going to be exiting the 2024 campaign, the discussions after that turned more toward the logistics and the coordination of all of those planes arriving at the airport in Ankara. And so, certainly, President Biden in tandem was negotiating this deal as well as negotiating his own exit from the race, which is in and of itself quite a consequential moment for him as a leader, but Sullivan when he was asked whether the decision to reach this deal and agree to some of the components of it was a factor of the fact that he's leaving office in a few months, and he wants to cement his legacy and he wants to bring these Americans home before he leaves office, Sullivan said this was just the way that the deal came together after many weeks and many months of negotiations, and he's certainly going to keep working for the release of others.

But the Iranians did that because they felt like deterrence had broken down. The Israelis were acting with impunity against Iranian interests. They hit, remember, an Iranian embassy building inside Damascus and Iran had to react. Well, what we saw in the last 24 hours is that Iranian deterrence yet again has no impact on Israel. Has no impact in terms of Israel blowing up a Hezbollah leader in Beirut and more importantly, no impact on blowing up the political leader of Hamas in Tehran, in a military complex while the Iranians are hosting the Islamic world, a decent piece of it, for the inauguration of their president. That is an enormous embarrassment for the Iranian supreme leader and for the new president and the Iranian Defense Forces. And they are almost certainty -- with almost certainty going to respond at least with the degree of force against Israel that we saw following the Damascus attacks. Now, that doesn't mean there's going to be 500 missiles as opposed to 300, but last time around they gave a fair amount of warning. They gave warning through Turkey, through Iraq, that these strikes were coming. They allowed the Americans to get in position. They made it clear that this was all they were going to do.

The fans had to be cleared because of the lightning here just a couple of hours ago. So, yes, tomorrow does look better. And because it's cooling down, you don't have that heat of the day, humidity of the day, all going up in the sky and then making thunderstorms in the afternoon. We get back down closer to normal and on Saturday, only 26, a little bit warmer by the end of the week. But they would take the rainfall here in Colorado and all of the American west, forest fires still burning out of control and all they're going to get is just more heat. More heat and dry weather. For Fahrenheit here now, we're back. The normal in Spokane should be 87 tomorrow. It will be 104. So, yes, above average out there where the firefighters -- it doesn't make the fires worse. It just makes the conditions for the firefighters themselves worse. Yes, the wind and the heat does dry out the ground and also the burning things, but it's that really tough when you're in a big fire suit at 104 degrees with a hose and trying to put things out. So, yes, 93 active wildfires in the U.S. More, of course, on up into Canada. More heat in the Mississippi River Valley, although not like out west. We're not going to see temperatures 10 degrees Celsius, 18 degrees Fahrenheit above normal here, more like five- or six-degrees Fahrenheit. But it's going to be as warm in Philadelphia for tomorrow as it will be in Atlanta. Some thunderstorms even right now happening through parts of Kentucky. Some of these have contained some wind gusts, knocking some trees and power lines down. And one more thing we're watching, a 70 percent chance of development now in the Caribbean. Could spend an awful lot of time over Cuba, which would slow down development, but then it gets into a very warm Gulf of Mexico at the end of the weekend. We'll have to see where this goes, Julia.",

An incredible evening for Simone Biles in Paris as she won the Olympic all-around gymnastics title for the second time. It's Biles ninth Olympic medal, bringing her career total to 39, and continuing her streak as the most decorated gymnast in history. She gave a nod to that by wearing this necklace of a GOAT GOAT, of course, standing for Greatest of All Time. Patrick Snell is here with more. It looks like it is diamond encrusted, I believe, as well, which feels perfectly appropriate.",

America's superstar gymnast at it again, stealing the show in the French capital in Paris, Julia. What a story she continues to be at the Jeux Olympique. Biles, the most decorated American gymnast at Ever at the Summer Games, earning a dramatic goal for Team USA in the women's all-around final. That's six Olympic gold medals now and counting for the American. Biles holding off a really spirited challenge, though, from, I will say, the Brazilian Rebeca Andrade, who once again wins silver. Biles' teammates Suni Lee taking the bronze, but it would be Biles' day in the end. She has yet another gold medal to her career. Amazing achievements and completing also her epic comeback. Remember, shared to bravely and courageously battle through the twisties, her withdrawal from the Tokyo Games three years ago. Biles later also withdrawing from the individual all-around competition in Japan that year, again, saying she wanted to focus on her mental health. So, who's the best Simone or should we say the greatest, the GOAT? (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Ledecky becoming the most decorated female U.S. Olympian of all time with total medals. Australia winning the race with a new Olympic record time of 738.08. China securing bronze.
