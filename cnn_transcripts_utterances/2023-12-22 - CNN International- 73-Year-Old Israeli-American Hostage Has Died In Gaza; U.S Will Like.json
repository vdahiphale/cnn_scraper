      "sentences": "73-years-old, a musician, American-Israeli named Gadi Haggai who was taking a walk on October 7, the early morning hours, when they saw the barrage of rocket interceptions, and shortly thereafter came under fire. Friends say that Gadi Haggai's wife was able to get in touch with them to say that he had been hit. He was hurt. But, that's when they lost contact. Presumably, that's when they were kidnapped and taken into Gaza.Now, we know based on testimony from other released hostages that they were likely separated. Family members, like brothers and sisters, husband and wives, they were put in different groups, kept in a total information blackout, sometimes sitting in these underground tunnels in the darkness, starving, in many cases, hungry all the time, hearing every single airstrike, but having a feeling that could probably linger in their minds that they might have been forgotten about, because they were told nothing, nothing about the status of the loved ones they were taken with, nothing about the situation back home. Hostages who were released usually said they got a few minutes notice, maybe an hour that they were going to be released. What is particularly sad about this instance is that Gadi and his wife, Judi, both in their 70s, would have fit the category of the hostages that Israel is trying to negotiate a release for as soon as possible. Israel has been asking for a few dozen hostages in exchange for a one-week pause in fighting, an offer, by the way, that Hamas has rejected. So, those talks aren't going anywhere anytime quickly. But, it would have been for women, people who are elderly, and people like Gadi, who if he had been shot back in October 7 was probably very much in need of urgent medical care. Judi is still being held. And of course, her family, you would imagine, and presumably is holding out great hope that she will come back as part of any hostage deal. But, again, Max, that deal seems to be a long way off, given the status of the talks right now.",

They also released body cam footage, giving a chilling insight into what happened during the attack. You can see officers searching through corridors and evaluating people from the university buildings. The government says three foreign nationals were amongst 25 people injured on Thursday.

It's being described as the worst atrocity in peace -- the peacetime history of the Czech Republic. It is also the first school or college shooting in the country's history. So, a great deal of shock out there that this could have happened at all. What we've been hearing from the Police this morning, as the country reels from the events of yesterday, is more about exactly what happened.The fact that this young man, whose name they haven't released, by the way yet, Max, a 24-year-old philosophy student left his home and they found his father's body shortly afterwards there. They believed he killed him, made his way to the university, killed the people, he did, before killing himself. There had been some doubt yesterday as to whether his death had been a suicide or whether it had been -- that he'd been killed by the police. It turns out they say that he did commit suicide. What we've been hearing from the police are some pretty harrowing details about exactly the arsenal with which he'd come to the university, with the police spokesman saying, look, when you look at the amount of weaponry he had, the ammunitions he brought, you realize just how important that swift Police response was. There might have been many more dead had they not intervened as effectively as he didn't, as you say, in that press conference, showing some of that body cam footage which shows not only the scenes of panic and of chaos inside the university, as the shooting went on, as the police moved in to try and bring it to an end, but also in some of the scenes and we've done what we could to blur them, the bodies of the students on the ground, some of the triage happening on the part of the police in those initial first moments when they discovered the victims of the massacre. In all, 14 of those dead. We have had 11 of them identified, according to the Police. Most of them, of course, were students who were there studying the -- who were just about to head off their end of year exams and then Christmas. A few of them are university staff as well. A makeshift memorial has been set up at the university, and tomorrow, Max, will be a day of national mourning in their memory.",

There are various parts to this as well beyond what actually happened there at the university. BELLSo, a slightly more complex picture is emerging. But, again, in a country that simply isn't used to these kinds of killings, plenty of questions about what needs to happen next. We hear from the Police that they're beefing up their security at what they describe as schools and other soft targets, the country trying to protect itself from something that it's only just coming to terms with, Max.",

AAA is predicting record levels of air travel through New Year's, and American Airlines and the nation's largest carrier expects today to be the busiest day of the travel season. Not everyone will be flying, though. Look out for the roads to be extra busy as well. You can see it is building up. Overall, 115 million Americans expected to travel 50 miles or more from home this holiday season. CNN's Pete Muntean joins us live from Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport, and it's a holiday that people don't want to miss. So, they're determined to battle through the traffic.",

The big interesting thing here, Max, is that a lot of people don't have the full next week off. Christmas falls on a Monday. So, there could be a bit of a confluence of traffic between holiday travelers and normal traffic when it comes Wednesday time. The good news here in the U.S. is that people are a bit encouraged by the price of gas. $3.12 is the national average. That is down from where we were a month ago, a few cents higher from where we were a year ago, though.",

      "sentences": "Yeah. Max, I think I heard Pete mention that Los Angeles to Phoenix were the travel trouble spots for today. And here is the reason why. I mean, look at what commuters are having to deal with in Santa Barbara. This is in Southern California. You can see some of the flooded roadways and flooded intersections. This is incredible. Oxnard, California, this is in Ventura County in Southern California, received more rainfall in just one hour yesterday than it does on average for the entire month of December. That is why we have seen these flooding scenes. Here is some more imagery coming out of water in the backyard of people's homes. So, yeah, big trouble spots for this area.There has been a brief lull in and around LAX, Los Angeles International Airport, but there still remains are flood watches that extend from LA through Palm Springs all the way to Phoenix. So, all in all, about 26 million Americans under this flood threat today. It's a level two of four where you see that highlighted area of yellow, just east of San Diego into Phoenix, and just west of Albuquerque. So, considerable amount of precipitation still to come. The bulk of the rain moving east of Los Angeles. But, again, Southern Arizona, that's the concern taking you through the holiday weekend. You can see that storm and its energy will bring some snow to the Rockies and Denver. But then, it's just simply too warm for this to be a snow maker along the East Coast. So, expect rainfall, as we head into Tuesday and Wednesday for some of the major hubs from Detroit, D.C., all the way to Boston and New York City as well. Here is your forecast for Christmas Eve. And a quick look at the warm Christmas day forecast for the rest of the country. Max.",

The university says Claudine Gay has now asked that corrections be made to her 1997 dissertation because of what it called inadequate citations. She had already requested corrections to two scholarly articles she wrote years ago. Harvard's board called the instances regrettable, and said they do not amount to research misconduct that will be punishable. It comes as a House panel announced it would widen its probe of Harvard to include the plagiarism allegations.Danny Freeman is tracking this story for us. He is in Cambridge, Massachusetts. So, just take us through, Danny, the specific accusations here. Were they mistakes or were they plagiarism, as many people understand it?",

      "sentences": "Well, listen, Max, I'll get into it in a moment. But, I think that the key thing that we're hearing from experts is that it's really a range of what we've seen in terms of the accusations of plagiarism against Harvard's President Claudine Gay. But, listen, despite these accusations and allegations at the moment, Harvard is standing by its president. That's despite, as you noted, a very challenging week for President Gay, not only because of these new allegations of plagiarism that have come up in the past few days, but also because that U.S. House Committee now promising not only to investigate antisemitism, but also plagiarism allegations as well.But, let's back up for a second, Max, and remember how we got here. Really a lot of the public scrutiny of Harvard's president really kicked into high gear back when there was that congressional testimony at the beginning of the month. That was over antisemitism on college campuses. But, the university largely supported President Gay after the -- in the aftermath of that particular testimony. But then, that's when conservative activists really started the first round of pitching these allegations of plagiarism, and some were citation problems, Max. That's what some experts that we spoke with said when they kind of assessed what the accusations were. But, these newer claims, specifically about that 1997 dissertation, really were more troubling to some, as it appeared in some -- in one case, at least, that a whole paragraph was apparently copied. So, Harvard, as you said, called this duplicative language, and said they were inadequate citations, while regrettable, they did not constitute research misconduct. These newest allegations, these newest citations, they will be fixed. But, nevertheless, Max, that House Committee said they're going to investigate to see if Harvard's standards are the same for their faculty and academic leaders as they are for their students. Max.",

At this point, the House said that they have given a deadline. They wrote a letter basically outlining their demands, and this House Committee gave the university a deadline of December 29 to respond.
