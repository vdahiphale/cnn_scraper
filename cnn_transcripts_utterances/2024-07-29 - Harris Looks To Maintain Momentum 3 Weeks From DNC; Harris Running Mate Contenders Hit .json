But let's talk about where we are right now. We're in the all important suburbs of Philadelphia. We're in Montgomery County right now, and in just a little bit, about an hour and a half, we're going to hear from Michigan governor, Gretchen Whitmer, and Gov. Josh Shapiro.And a campaign aide tells me that really the focus of this particular event is going to be pretty generic. They're going to highlight the stakes of this election. They're going to really try to draw the contrast between former President Donald Trump and Vice President Harris and really continue to vouch for this politician, vouch for this new top of the ticket and introduce Vice President Harris to another swath of voters here just outside of Philadelphia. But let's make a mistake here, Brianna. The idea and the conversation about who is going to join Vice President Harris on her ticket is still very much front and center here. We heard from Michigan governor, Gretchen Whitmer, on another network earlier today, saying that she has not been a part of a vetting process. However, Gov. Josh Shapiro, he's not saying that at all. He is not commenting on a potential vetting process at this point, Brianna. But when I asked him last week if he considered joining that ticket, he said that this is a personal decision for the Vice President and that it should be free from political pressure. But meanwhile, let's talk about this attempt to continue this momentum from last week. This all comes as the Harris campaign is really celebrating a number of things from that first week of this new campaign, $200 million dollar raised - dollars raised, 170,000 new volunteers. And this event that we are at, Brianna, right here outside of Philadelphia, just part of that continuation to introduce this new top of the ticket to critical voters in a critical battleground state.

I'm sure he'll get around to the women eventually. But, you know, this is a very important lesson for the Vice President - current vice president - vetting really matters for these positions because there is no vetting like the vetting a candidate gets running for national office. People think vetting is intense running for governor or senator, and it is to a certain degree. But the national it's not just the press corps, it's the opposition, they will spend hundreds of thousands of dollars looking into every word you've ever uttered, what your grades were in kindergarten. So I would assume they're doing intense vetting. But, of course, they don't have much time, that's the difference.",

And we can get used to hearing a lot about them. But it's also true that Vice President Harris brings in Georgia and Arizona and Nevada into the toss up category.

I think it's all about the Electoral College, because in the end, it's all about the Electoral College. So obviously, Gov. Shapiro potentially brings in 19 electoral votes; and Gov. Cooper in North Carolina potentially brings in 16 electoral votes; and Sen. Kelly in Arizona potentially brings in 11 electoral votes. And there are others that at least bring in potentially, and you can make a good argument that they will bring in those electoral votes in the end. And, you know, this is going to be a game of inches, just like it was in 2020 and 2016. And every inch matters, so a handful of electoral votes could be the key to the election.",

I know you've been following along closely with all of these new details, and there were a lot today. We found out that Secret Service no face-to-face meeting with local law enforcement and no direct communications between local law enforcement and the Secret Service the day of and during the event. You are a former NYPD officer. Is that normal to you? REP. ANTHONY D'ESPOSITO (R-NY): Definitely not. I think there were catastrophic failures, not only the day of the attempted assassination, but the days leading up to it. I don't think we're there yet where we can point the fingers as to exactly who failed and how many law enforcement professionals or agencies failed. I think that's why, moving forward, this investigation is critically important. You know, last week on Capitol Hill, we had two hearings, one in the Homeland Security Committee and one in the Oversight Committee, where Democrats and Republicans were asking the hard, tough questions as to what happened and how did it happen, and most importantly, what can we do to make sure it never happens again.",

And I think that over the next couple of weeks and now that this new task force is formed, I really hope that we get to the bottom of this. This isn't a partisan issue.

But what else does accountability look like when you may have a systemic problem on your hands?D'ESPOSITO: Yes, and I think what we need to find out is the systemic problem within what agency is it within. Is it the fact that the Secret Service is not communicating locally with agencies? Is it the communication breakdown that we discussed that, you know, in an incident like this where, you know, those rallies are put together or these large-scale incidents very often are put together in a short time frame? Is there a problem with the amount of time, with the amount of resources, with the amount of communication? Is it the fact that these larger agencies frown upon the local agencies and feel that they're only there to assist? I mean, nobody knows these local communities better than the locals who serve them each and every day.
