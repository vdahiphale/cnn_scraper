Heated and passionate protests seen across the country earlier tonight. There in Tel Aviv organizers estimating 550,000 people taking to the streets. And these protesters are demanding Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reach a ceasefire and hostage deal with Hamas. The country's largest labor union is joining that fight, vowing a nationwide general strike tomorrow. And the mounting anger coming after the tragic news the IDF recovered the bodies of six hostages including an American from a tunnel in southern Gaza. The Israeli Health Ministry saying all six of these hostages were killed by short range shots likely sometime between Thursday and Friday of this week as the IDF was closing in. CNN's Nic Robertson is joining us live from Tel Aviv. And Nic, you were there tonight at the height of these protests. You've been covering this for months now. Did this feel different?",

President Biden speaking with Hersh's parents this morning, offering his condolences, as did Vice President Harris and First Gentleman Doug Emhoff. CNN's Kevin Liptack is joining us now, and Kevin, Hersh's story and the incredible bravery and tenacity of his parents in the face of this unimaginable nightmare has been well-known to a lot of Americans. They've gotten to know a lot of the politicians here and people within the Biden administration, including the president and the vice president. What more are you hearing from the White House tonight?",

      "sentences": "Well, certainly I think there's just a deep level of sadness that this is how that story ended. And I think for President Biden and for Vice President Harris, it lends a certain degree of urgency to try and get these ceasefire talks over the finish line.Of course American officials have been trying to do that for the last several months. It had intensified just in the last few weeks. When you talk to U.S. officials today, they do say that this does raise some questions about how serious Hamas actually is towards reaching a deal. And they acknowledged that this will also apply pressure on Prime Minister Netanyahu, which is exactly what you're seeing on the streets of Israel tonight. Now, President Biden, who, as you mentioned, spoke to the family of Hersh Goldberg-Polin earlier today, did release a statement saying that he was devastated and outraged. He goes on to say, I have worked tirelessly to bring their beloved Hersh safely to them. And I'm heartbroken by the news of his death. It is as tragic as it is reprehensible. And the president goes on to say, make no mistake, Hamas leaders will pay for these crimes, and we will keep working around the clock for a deal to secure the release of the remaining hostages. And we did hear from President Biden last night after the bodies of these hostages were found, saying that he thinks that they are still on the verge of an agreement and he thinks that they can close the deal. So at least in President Biden's own mind, the deal is not done and certainly they will keep working towards that end. I think it was interesting thing we also learned today that Jake Sullivan, President Biden's National Security adviser, convened a phone call, a virtual meeting, if you will, with the families of the remaining American hostages who are being held in Gaza. In that phone call, he also detailed for them the ongoing efforts to try and strike some kind of agreement. So certainly American can officials very mindful of the tragedy of this moment, but also very eager to get these hostages and ceasefire talks back on track.",

Be honest with us. I'll accept any answer. Mmany of the families of hostages will accept any answer. But they have not been honest with us, our elected officials, and we need that answer.

But I also blame our prime minister and what I said in that tweet for normalizing the reality. And by that I mean normalizing to us, this very society, the fact that we can break the social contract, the social contract that philosophers, that Janja Crusoe spoke about, that as soon as any mentions of their fell to the state, what does it matter to me, the state may be given up for lost. And I disagree with that. We cannot give up our state for lost. We have to fight for our rights, fight for our enshrined democratic rights, and show what we think and the majority of Israelis, according to all polls, want a deal, want the current deal that is on the table. A difficult deal, a deal that is not good, but it will save the hostages in the short term, and allow us to prepare for greater threats in the long run.",

I don't know what is right and what is wrong. I'm a mere citizen. And I'm a concerned family of a hostage. But what I want for my prime minister is, as I said earlier, to look in our eyes and be honest with us. Our family met with him in the past, met with the entire security operations and political establishment. And we have not gotten that sense. Essentially we have gotten there we know that the play Julius Caesar from Shakespeare play, talks about the abuse of greatness is when it disjoins remorse from power. And that's what I feel when I read about Prime Minister Netanyahu, and members of his coalition. I hope I'm wrong. And I hope this will bring a change to the discourse in Israel and will get answers we deserve. I don't want a pyrrhic victory where all the hostages who remain in captivity are going to be found dead.

So say there's no housekeeping,it's really loud, your kids can't sleep and you want to change rooms, technically you aren't owed anything beyond your current cancellation policy. But I highly recommend talk to the GM of the hotel, tell them if you want to go and change to a different hotel, they should allow you to change free of charge. If you've been inconvenienced, I saw on Instagram or on Twitter today, there were people go into the hotel lounges, you know, in Hawaii on vacation, and the lounges are closed because they don't have the employees to staff them. So if you're experiencing less definitely go to the hotel itself. Also e-mail the hotel chain and ask for compensation, especially points. They do have the ability to give you a lot of points if you've been inconvenienced. And if you really feel like you've been done dirty and you didn't get what you wanted or thought you were, always go to your credit card company.

JAKE AUCHINCLOSS (D-MA): Every day is critical, Jessica, and every day I know that American negotiators are using the utmost leverage to secure a deal that will bring the hostages home and I understand that there's frustration with Prime Minister Netanyahu. I have been frustrated with Prime Minister Netanyahu and I've been outspoken about that. Well, let's be very clear that it is Hamas that executed six hostages. It is Hamas that executed an American 23-year-old, a young man whose parents I was able to meet a young man who had strong connections to Massachusetts and I was able to learn something about the warm and wonderful person he is and how he made everyone around him better. This young man had his whole life ahead of him, and he was killed simply because Hamas did not want him to see his family again. And Americans throughout this country should be united in seeking justice for his executers. The same justice that Osama Bin Laden received.

But we also must remain committed that Hamas can have no place in governance for Gaza going forward. Because Hamas is an organization that has, as part of its charter, the genocide of Jews worldwide and has broken every single ceasefire its ever inked. It will break another ceasefire.
