We know from the Israeli prime minister's office that they have received a list of potential hostages to be freed overnight. They are evaluating that. We are hearing from a diplomatic source briefed on the negotiations that there might be a slight issue with the list of hostages and Palestinian prisoners to be freed. We don't know what the issue is but it could delay the hostage release. We're hearing from that source that it is likely that it could delay the hostage release on Monday. That issue is now being -- attempted to be ironed out by Qatar, which has been the main broker in these talks. We have also heard from the Palestinian prisoners' authorities that they have yet to receive a list of the prisoners to be freed. So, as the president said, it's hour-by-hour every day with this and it's fragile and an extremely hard one. On the issue of whether the truce could be extended -- look, it seems like there is will on both sides. Hamas has said that it is keen for this. That it wants to see more Palestinian prisoners released. The prime minister of Israel, Benjamin Netanyahu, has said to President Biden that he would welcome it if more hostages could be freed. Look, this is not a major breakthrough in itself. This was baked into the original agreement that they could potentially extend 24 hours of truce for each additional 10 Israeli hostages that were released. So we'll watch and wait to see if that happens. Of course, the major complicating factor for that is that Israel says that it intends to continue with the military operation once this truce is over. That it has not finished the job of dismantling Hamas. We saw Prime Minister Netanyahu apparently in Gaza on Sunday saying that they continue -- that they aim to continue pursuing this until victory. He was wearing a flak jacket. He was wearing a helmet. I think the optics of that speak to that intention -- Kasie.",

President Biden's been talking about a two-state solution. He's been talking about the need for a diplomatic endgame. And they haven't yet had that defined by the parties but this is the opportunity -- this is the window to do that. I think this can really help to engage, as well, Congress who is calling for this and get that discussion going and embed it within the discussion about the supplemental funding for Israel and the Palestinians as well.

Our ally, Israel, is trying to defend itself. They're a territory and protect its people. The Palestinians are trying to have a better quality of life and deal with the humanitarian issues as a result of this war.And to try to seek some kind of long-term policy change on the border that would mean that Republicans would need to actually win elections to get that enacted. And instead, they want to extort the Palestinian and Israeli suffering for that goal. That's really not going to fly. And I think there's a bit of a window here for everybody to step back and look at the reality, which is that the United States is a global leader. We have been bringing the parties together to get this truce for this period. We have allies in the region appreciating that. And now, the Congress is going to what -- undercut the president in his diplomacy, both in engaging on a truce and potentially long-term stability in the region? How does that advance the American goals? It doesn't.

We saw President Biden yesterday mark the release of a 4-year-old Israeli-American girl. That reflected the political pressure that he's been under and the administration was very focused on getting her out. U.S. pressure on the Israelis will continue if there are American hostages. That seems pretty clear. And that's one part of this equation. What we're seeing right now, I think, is that Hamas -- because it's using hostages as leverage and has been able to engineer this pause, has grabbed back a little bit of the initiative of the situation and it's controlling the tempo of the conflict.
