Apparent victims of high temperatures and that brutal heat could actually grow worse in coming years.We're following these major developing stories and many more all coming in right here to CNN NEWS CENTRAL. Right now, attorneys for former President Trump are in a federal courtroom in Florida arguing that the charges in Trump's classified documents case should be dismissed, claiming that Special Counsel Jack Smith was unlawfully appointed. At the heart of their argument is that Jack Smith was never confirmed by the U.S. Senate and because of that, all of his office's work should be nullified and the charges against their client dropped. Trump appointed Judge Aileen Cannon has faced criticism for her handling of the case, especially for how long she is taking to settle Trump's legal challenges. Our team inside Court tells us that today, Judge Cannon pushed Trump's team to defend one of their most outlandish claims against Jack Smith, that he is somehow part of a \"shadow government.\" We have CNN's Katelyn Polantz joining us now. Katelyn, how does it appear things are going for the Trump team as they make this push?",

In fact, we know she's not going to rule on this because she wants to do part two of these arguments Monday morning. So, this is going to be a lot of time devoted to this question of the power of the special counsel, is it constitutional for this type of prosecutor to bring a case in federal court against anyone? Let it be Donald Trump or someone else. And in this case, what the arguments often were about this morning from these pieces of information we're getting out of that courthouse where there's no electronics allowed inside. This morning, the team from Donald Trump's team, they were arguing about the closeness or how distant there might be, distance between the Attorney General Merrick Garland and Special Counsel Jack Smith, if that's legal, and the one thing that they keep asking for in this is more hearings, they're asking for it with this before Judge Cannon, they want more evidence to be able to talk to people from the Justice Department in court or have some sort of testimony about Jack Smith and Merrick Garland. And then we're going to hear that again Monday and Tuesday as these arguments go on. They just want more hearings from Judge Cannon and this is a judge who it has become quite clear wants to look at so many things here, the sort of things that more experienced judges might not actually devote that much time to.",

REID: Absolutely. Usually, they save their biggest cases until the very end, next week, possibly it could go into the following week. But we're still waiting, like you said, there's some really big outstanding cases. The biggest one that a lot of folks are talking about is former President Trump's claim of immunity. This is something that has put the federal prosecution of the former president related to January 6th, and elections diversion on hold. So, we're watching and waiting to see what the High Court does there. There's also a related case about January 6th, and being able to charge people who participated in the insurrection with obstruction. There's also a big abortion ruling that we are waiting for. There was a question on chemical abortion and use of mifepristone. The justices sort of swerved around that, didn't answer that question. But there is a really important question out of Idaho. What do you do when it comes to emergency room care when you have a more permissive federal law and a more restrictive state law when it comes to when abortions can be performed? Waiting for that decision. Also, huge decision are related to the power of federal agencies, and then a few cases related to the government's ability to pressure or control social media. So, next week could be a jam packed week full of big headlines out of the Supreme Court, but again, they have no bosses.

New statistics also showed daily encounters along the border dropping nine percent in May. Biden's new plan allows the administration to ban asylum seekers who crossed the southern border illegally once a daily threshold is met. And the measure would be lifted once daily encounters fall to 1,500. Let's talk more about this now with former acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement under President Obama, John Sandweg. So, thanks for being with us. I wonder why you see this drop that we're seeing or what you think about what we're seeing with this drop right now and how the numbers compared to what Border Patrol typically sees around this time of the year in past years?

But at the same time, it's definitely too early to tell, right?We've seen in the past when we've implemented new measures at the border, whether it was President Trump's with his Remain in Mexico rule, or even President Biden remember when Title 42 expired, and the border was reopened. He implemented a new asylum rule. We saw a real drop in migration immediately thereafter, sustained for a month or two and then it kind of picked back up. And I think the smugglers and the migrant groups at the border are kind of taking a wait and see approach, to see how the new rule is implemented. Look, the rule is really important. But of course it wasn't paired with the resources that the Border Patrol agents really need or the immigration courts need. So, the effectiveness of the rule, you know, he's going to -- we're going to find out over the next couple of months. So, I'd say, very encouraged by this initial tranche of data. But let's see where we are, you know, as we get into August, September, October.",

      "sentences": "Yes, they're going to -- listen, we're going to -- there's going to be a reaction to this rule, right? So, the first thing I think that happens is the smugglers who really drive all the migration are and are telling the migrants what to do, they're waiting to see how this kind of works, there's test groups going over. And they'll see if it's effective in terms of getting people back to their country, and whether they want to shift tactics. So, what we've seen historically is this kind of drop and then a pick back up.I think it's also just early because remember, we were kind of seeing a decline at the border, not a -- not a major decline, but leading into May, April's numbers were down. And a lot of that was attributed to stepped up enforcement efforts in Mexico. So, as Mexico continues to do a better job of blocking these migrants from getting to Mexico in the first place, right, that's going to drive down our numbers. So, I guess, look, I'd be very encouraged. I'd be very worried if we didn't see a drop at all. And I'd be very encouraged if I was the administration. But again, I wouldn't declare victory yet. I want to wait and see till we get a little more data. KEILAR: So, John, I wonder because earlier this month, there were four migrants who died along the U.S. border because of extreme heat in the region. How much does heat deter crossings?",

Now, the only reason that I hesitate in saying that is since this mass migration began, some of that seasonality has dissipated a bit. We've seen elevated numbers into May and into June.But you are absolutely right. Historically, spring, you know, is the big influx at the border. And then the numbers dissipate pretty extensively when it gets hot in the summer, and then pick back up again. But I'll say one other thing, Brianna, about deaths at the border. And one thing that concerns me is, you know, there's always an unintended consequence to everything we do at the border, right? And the one thing I think we need to be on guard for here is the changing tactics of the smuggling groups, right? Prior to 2016, what we almost exclusively saw at the border were groups who would sneak into the United States and try to evade the Border Patrol agents and work their way into the cities without getting caught. What we -- as you know, very well, we've seen lately is where they surrender, get apprehended and make an asylum claim. If asylum is viewed no longer as a viable path, I worry that we're going to start seeing those incursions in the desert, and now you're talking extreme heat. Unfortunately, that means that leads to migrant deaths.",

I mean, that's a separate topic, really. But these promises of mass deportations that given the legal framework, the challenges in the immigration courts even not discussed is just not possible. But look, this is a stunning turn for him. Obviously, this is what's called the Staple Act. It's an idea that's bounced around Congress and been part of all the immigration reform packages for a long time. The idea that we take people here, we educate them, we get some incredibly bright people and then there's no functional path to allow them to stay in this country. So, look, obviously the policy makes good sense. I'm not sure about the politics, but it's surprising to hear Trump say that for sure.",

This is about nine miles away from the airport in the town of Yukon, Oklahoma. The plane was lined up to land on the runway at Oak City that points to the southeast and the data from flight radar 24 says the flight got down to 525 feet above ground level, let's put it into context. It's only four lengths of the 737 itself or the height of the Washington Monument, half the height of the Empire State Building. Point is, it's very low for that distance from the airport and the FAA says a minimum safe altitude warning or MSAW alarm sounded in the control tower prompting the air traffic controller in the tower to issue Southwest 4069 a low altitude alert, listen to this.

Did the pilots improperly configured their instruments like the crash of a Korean Air Flight in Guam in 1997 were they simply fatigued after a long day? Remember, this flight was coming in well after midnight. Pilots I talked to say they've been worked especially hard lately. Really big questions for investigators here.

Of course, the air traffic control gave the warning as Pete mentioned, vitally lifesaving.But in that cockpit where there would have been other warnings going off. On my modern aircraft, the controls tell you when you're on the glide slope, the path to the runway that you've selected, it tells you if you're the right altitude, and at this point, have they gone below 500 feet, they literally would have gotten the ground proximity warning, the plane would have yelled at them pull up, pull up. So, how they could have missed -- two pilots could have missed so many clues coming from their instruments and you know, the instruments are great, and they're two of them for the critical instruments is really a mystery. I did listen to the air traffic control tapes. And when the air traffic controller asked them, you know, gave them the low altitude warning and said, is everything OK? They were a little slow to respond. So, I suppose it is possible there was already something going wrong. They had heard the alerts, they were trying to address the problem. Or maybe they were engaged in something else. There have been accidents because pilots were busy attending to some other problem and didn't watch their speed and didn't watch their altitude and a perfectly good plane can be lost that way.",

And when you've flown for a while, you get pretty good at judging your altitude without even looking at the altimeter, which of course you look at all the time. So, they would have seen this. So, again, with this going on with this flight, the flight in Hawaii that Pete mentioned, that got down to in the 400 feet range. This is something that is very troubling. And this is something that Southwest has to address, there could be a mechanical cause or maybe their instruments are failing, these were 737 aircraft, they've had other problems with the aircraft. They had an aircraft just a couple of weeks ago that had damaged from a maneuver that was un-commanded called a Dutch roll. That's where the plane kind of whoops back and forth, side to side. And then there have been reports that they were smoking the cabin from a couple of 737 aircraft that they were flying in December of last year was one and then another one, a couple months later. So, pilot error or problems with the aircraft, someone's really got to get a handle on this and that someone is of course Southwest Airlines and the Federal Aviation Administration, which has already looked into many of these incidents and is investigating.",
