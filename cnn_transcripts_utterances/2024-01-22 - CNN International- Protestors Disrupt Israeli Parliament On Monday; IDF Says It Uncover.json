      "sentences": "Yeah. No doubt about it. I mean, there is bubbling frustration and anger among the families of these hostages as the weeks stretch on since the last time that we saw a deal to release hostages. And now, as there are reports of ongoing discussions, ongoing negotiations, the families are trying to ratchet up the pressure. And today, you can see in this video, more than a dozen family members of hostages storming the Finance Committee meeting inside the Knesset, Israel's parliament, demanding action. One of the relatives saying, you will not sit here while they die there, saying it go on like this. You better know it can't go on like this, talking about their concerns, their fears that their children will die as hostages inside the Gaza Strip. You can also see that there were security officers trying to removethem from the scene. This actually wasn't the only protest at the Knesset today. There was also one outside the Knesset with people calling for elections. And that is kind of the compounding picture that we are seeing here in Israel is that there is increasing pressure on the Israeli government not only from the families of hostages, but also from people who have, frankly, just lost trust in this government of the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Growing calls for elections to be called soon. Polling indicating that Netanyahu is deeply, deeply unpopular here in Israel. And so, the question is, how much pressure will it take for something to change for elections to be called? That much is unclear yet. But, what is clear is that we are going to continue to see more scenes like the ones you're seeing on your screen right now.",

They have said now that in northern and central Gaza they have ramped down their military operations, withdrawing thousands of troops from those areas, focusing there on pockets of resistance, is what they call it. But, in Khan Younis, we are very much still seeing an all-out Israeli military ground offensive, heavy fighting reported there late last week, and over the weekend. The Israeli military, according to Palestinian officials, actually storming the Al Nasser hospital on Friday in southern Gaza in the city of Khan Younis. And we know that the Israeli military has been engaged in heavy fighting there.They also say that they have discovered tunnels as well as weapons facilities in the area of Khan Younis. One tunnel that they showed is about a half-mile long. It stretches about 60-plus feet underground, and there the Israeli military says that they found a tunnel system, including five cells within there, where they say that about 20 hostages were held at different points. They verified this, they say, by checking DNA evidence that was found on the scene, as well as the testimony of former hostages, just showing some of the conditions in which many of these hostages, including some have been released but some who are still held in Gaza, have been held.",

      "sentences": "Yeah. That's right, Max. And President Biden has made clear that he is going to work to try to convince Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to support a two- state solution, even as so far Netanyahu has shown no signs of budging. Over the weekend, Netanyahu posted on social media that he would not compromise on full Israeli security control in Gaza. And this episode really highlights the latest tension point between Biden and Netanyahu, as many of their public disagreements have started to spill into public view. In this instance, it's around what to do in Gaza once this conflict ends.Now, President Biden and Netanyahu spent about 40 minutes on the phone together on Friday, just one day after Netanyahu appeared to pour cold water on the idea of creating a Palestinian state. Officials say that in this call that Netanyahu said that his comments weren't necessarily meant to rule out a form of a Palestinian state in any form. And that is something that the two leaders discussed in this call. Sources said that they discussed the possible attributes of what a Palestinian state would look like. That would need to be negotiated going forward. One thing that administration officials here in the White House have been talking about is the possibility of a future demilitarized Palestinian state. That is an idea that is intriguing to President Biden. And after his meeting, his phone call with Netanyahu, Biden told reporters that he believed that they would be able to reach some type of agreement when it comes to the creation of a two-state solution. But, it's entirely unclear how that will come about, especially as we have heard Netanyahu repeatedly shoot down these ideas of creating a Palestinian state. Now, it also comes while the U.S. has been publicly supporting Israel. There is some frustration bubbling up behind the scenes with the fact that Netanyahu has so publicly disagreed with some of the American ideas and proposals. It all comes at a time when Netanyahu has been facing political pressure back in Israel. And this whole episode really speaks to the challenges President Biden faces when it comes to try to apply pressure on Netanyahu, not just with the possibility of a two-state solution, but also the way that Israel is waging its campaign in Gaza.",

State media reports that search and rescue operations are underway, and it's snowy and freezing conditions. The cause of the landslide isn't yet clear. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi inaugurated a controversial Hindu temple in the northern city of Ayodhya on -- well, that was today. It is the fulfillment of an election year promise and a move aimed at establishing Hindu supremacy throughout the country. Some say the temple is dedicated to Hinduism's lord Ram, and it sits atop the ruins of an ancient mosque that was destroyed by Hindu mobs more than 30 years ago. For the country's minority Muslim population, the temple is a painful reminder of religious divisions that have grown more pronounced under Mr. Modi's rule. CNN's Vedika Sud joins us from there right now. What was the reaction, because this really does cut to the heart of many of the tensions throughout this huge country?",

      "sentences": "And you know, her campaign has begun to temper expectations. They've even said a strong second place finish they would view as a victory, because for them that would mean they have momentum heading into the next states.We will see if that actually holds true, because DeSantis' campaign, Ron DeSantis' campaign prior to this week had told us that they were in it for the long haul, that they were looking to further states down the line as they scaled back some of their operations. And here, less than 24 hours after he announced he was suspending his campaign, behind me, the super PAC, the political action committee supporting Ron DeSantis, they've still got their bus here in New Hampshire, a reminder, a remnant of the campaign that was. The bus is running. So, it may too make its way out of the state here. Now, the bottom line is it is a two-person race. This is something that Nikki Haley said she wanted, and said was a reality after the Iowa contests about a week and a half ago at this point. But, for her, really, it is actually a reality. Everybody can agree on it, because at that time it almost seemed like an aspiration. The road does not get much easier for her, though, after DeSantis drops out, because many of his supporters have flocked to the former President or are expected to at this point. And Donald Trump, while he is campaigning today, in some ways in the courtroom, because he is expected to appear in court in New York and then make his way here to New Hampshire later in the day, he just said in an interview this morning that it is highly unlikely DeSantis has picked for any Vice President position, which of course becomes the stakes as you look ahead down in this race. And I also want to point out how unusual it is that we are a day -- have primary day here in New Hampshire, and we are down to just two candidates. Typically, when you have presidential elections like this, there are a number of candidates. In 2020, for example, when Joe Biden was running to this state, we were up to six candidates at this point. So, the fact that it is down to two shows, in some cases, the dominance that Trump has had in the polls prior to this point, but of course, the mountain of a task it is to actually try to cut into the support he has had and a mountain of a task that now faces Nikki Haley.",

His relationship with Vladimir Putin would no doubt take on an entirely different hue today than it did before Russia's invasion of Ukraine.One of the things that we heard these last few days from the EU's Internal Market Commissioner Thierry Breton, who was trying to make the case of the European Parliament that Europe needed to make more of its own ammunition. He recounted a private conversation between, he said, Ursula von der Leyen, the European Commission, and President Donald Trump during his first mandate in which the American President had told her that if Europe were attacked, in no way would the United States choose to get involved. Now, it's astonishing is that remark is in the context of the NATO alliance and its obligations, it was a sobering reminder, I think, that he wanted to give European lawmakers that, in the end, Europe cannot rely on the United States even in the terms of the NATO agreement. That has implications for NATO. And of course, it has implications he suggests, Max, for the war in Ukraine. What will happen to the many billions that have been spent should Donald Trump return to the White House and make very different decisions with regard to Ukraine's future than the Western allies have so far?",
