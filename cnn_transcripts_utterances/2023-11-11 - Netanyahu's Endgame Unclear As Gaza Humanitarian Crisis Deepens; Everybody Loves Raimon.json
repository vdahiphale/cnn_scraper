You know, like then on a smaller scale, we also saw a horrific terrorist attack, with three Israeli teenagers were kidnapped and murdered which led to the ground invasion then. Before we went in, we were told that, you know, the areas had been cleaned out of terrorists, of civilians and the only people who remained were terrorists, and that ended up not being entirely true. The entire neighborhood was bombarded before we went in. And you know, we lost soldiers from my unit, and you know, after I came out, I just hoped and prayed that we had decisively eliminated the threat. And that was the only thing that gave me a little bit of consolation for the death and destruction that I saw. And what I discovered in the years after that was, not only did we not decisively eliminate the threat, but my own government actually was party to the bolstering of Hamas and the strengthening of Hamas. And I started becoming a peace activist and calling against these policies, which actually weren't as interested as much in defeating Hamas as they were interested in expanding the settlement project and preventing a Palestinian state. But when I think about the leadership of my country, my government, and the statements that they're making, basically, you know, saying that the entire civilian population is accountable, they should have rose up and overthrown Hamas, or you know, the minister of finance who said he doesn't differentiate between Hamas and the Palestinian Authority, I think that this is a leadership that I don't really trust. AMANPOUR: Benzi you, after 2014, became a peacemaker, and you're also a reservist. What is it like for you at this moment, when so much of the Israeli people, people around the world, in fact, believe that this war should happen, that Hamas should be wiped out, and that this kind of situation cannot continue.
