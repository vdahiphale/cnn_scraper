And that is where he was apprehended according to his attorney. And at that time, both his father and Bryan were cooperative with police, his attorney says.

And then of course they have about $360 billion in clean energy investments through the Inflation Reduction Act. And I think the biggest priority of the Biden administration is going to be to try to have the rubber meet the road on all of those bills and show and demonstrate an impact in communities around the country. You know, he may be cutting ribbons at new plants or new factories literally every week between now and 2024. We know that he's going down this week and appearing, apparently with Mitch McConnell to talk about infrastructure. I think that's going to be the number one priority. And then the second, I think priority is going to be unilateral executive action, particularly regulatory action where he can act without needing Congress. It's hard to imagine many deals being made with this Republican Congress, but on environmental issues, on immigration issues, there's a number of fronts where I think they're going to be trying to move forward in their priorities through executive action.",

Pope Emeritus, of course, was retired.So, I would say the mood still very somber, Rosemary. People remembering him, remembering what he meant to them personally, wanting to pay their respects. But nothing like, of course, the crowds that we saw in 2005, Rosemary, here when they opened the barricades for people to come through, there was a stampede, there was a rush. It was a bit less organized, but there were also hundreds of thousands of people here. In fact, you couldn't move in this place. But as I say, that was a very different time. John Paul II was sick for about two months before he died, and he was a different sort of figure compared to Benedict.

Last week, there was a minute of silence at the inauguration of the incoming Brazil president as well. Now, we will have the opportunity for pans to pay their respects at a wake. It will be a 24-hour wake at the Stadium of Santos, where he became a star sporter with 600 goals for that club before he made that successful transition to the national stage where he went on to win three world cups for Brazil, the first of which was as a boy at just the age of 17. I think as far as today's concern, fans will get the chance to go into the 16,000 capacity stadium from around about 10 o'clock local time. His coffin will be in the center of the pitch. They will get the chance to pay their respect. Then after than, Rosemary, they will be a procession through the streets of Santos.

Now, some people, construct by the fact that his mother outlives him, but there is still a lot of love for her as they remains for him.
