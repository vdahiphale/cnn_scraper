EDWARD-ISAAC DOVERE, CNN SENIOR REPORTER: Well, what she's been doing, Audie, so far is a lot of meetings that have been behind the scenes. Some have been on Air Force Two or on the sidelines of the White House Congressional Christmas Party, at her residence in the Naval Observatory. A lot of Saturday sessions there. Even at Eva Longoria's house in Los Angeles at one point in December. She's been trying to get information, she says, from on the ground, from talking to people who are out there in the battleground states dealing with communities and constituencies that the Biden-Harris campaign needs. Look, she is meeting with people who say that they feel like they are not being heard by the White House and the Biden campaign. One person who attended one of the meetings said to me, the bedwetting complaints are running thin with people. That is from --reflecting this idea that people feel like when they say that things aren't going great for the Biden campaign, the campaign and the inner circle of Biden advisers tends to brush them off. But Harris has been talking with them, meeting with them, listening to what they think that's being done differently, and then trying to put herself in a position to bring some suggestions back to the campaign about different things that she needs to be doing and that the campaign needs to be doing overall.",

The success of the record from the Biden-Harris years is not translating, is not connecting with them. How do they make that feel more present for people?

Imagine you're a parent and you get a video of your child asking for you to wire a random, you know, phone number $50,000 because you've been kidnapped, right? That's the type of scam that some of these artificial intelligence video generation technologies could create if we're not regulating them properly.There's also a lot of concerns, obviously, around misinformation and deep fakes. You know, up until this point, deep fake video technology hasn't been sophisticated enough and it hasn't been sort of widespreadly - wide -- widely available enough that it would be a problem. But heading into the 2024 election, if this were to become available to consumers, the folks at OpenAI have to make sure that they have enough measures in place so that people can't make tons of deepfake videos of politicians are candidates running for office that could widely shift the nature of the election.",

So, if they're not going to be responsible at the gate, then they invite more scrutiny, more potential regulation that can slow them down. So, yes, they definitely are motivated to make sure this is safe.The problem with this type of technology is there's so many unforeseen use cases and consequences that even if you think you have tested and sort of guardrailed for everything possible, there's always something that's going to blindside you. Now, the obvious things that you know that they're going to put in place, right? When it gets rolled out widely to consumers, you're probably not going to be able to make doctored video of very well-known, famous people. Right now if you were to go into Meta's products, like Facebook and Instagram, you can't necessarily make a video of, you know, Donald Trump or an image of Donald Trump, but my friends and I have tried to spell his name incorrectly and say, you know, Fonald Frump and you're able to actually make some things there. So, there's ways to get around it. The other issue is things like you just mentioned, Taylor Swift, like nudity, things like revenge porn. Those are things that technology is pretty good at weeding out. You know, if you can see too much of skin exposed, they'll block the video. But the thing about it that's really going to be dangerous is misinformation. It's somebody saying something - like, they look like they're endorsing somebody or they look like they're endorsing a policy and they're not really doing it.

But at the same time, there's a lot of opportunity. You know, for things that we were doing highly manually, think about it, especially in terms of animation, AI is going to be able to expedite that process tenfold and then you're going to be able to use the time and money that you spent on manual labor to be doing more sophisticated things.So, I think that there's a lot of opportunity for the studios.

I've raised the steaks (ph), he used to say. We have those right there. There's Trump cologne. He had his own bottled water line, \"Trump Ice\" water. Trump actually was also in the mattress arena.
