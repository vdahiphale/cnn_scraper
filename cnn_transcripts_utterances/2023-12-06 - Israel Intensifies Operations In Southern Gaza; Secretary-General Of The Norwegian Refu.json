Tonight, Israel intensifies its ground operationsin southern Gaza with the IDF claiming it's surrounding the Hamas leaders house somewhere in the Strip. This as a Secretary-General of the Norwegian Refugee Council calls the situation in Gaza one of the worst assaults on any civilian population in our time. Jan Egeland joins me live this very hour. And this oil rich territory in South America is now at the center of an escalating dispute between Venezuela and Guyana. Nicolas Maduro orders oil drilling in the territory he hopes to exert control over. The president of Guyana will join me live with his response. But first this hour, Israel's prime minister says troops are now surrounding the house of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar in Gaza. It is unclear if he's still there, if he's there at all. But Benjamin Netanyahu says quote, \"it's only a matter of time before we get him.\" Mr. Netanyahu didn't say where the house is located, but Sinwar is originally from Khan Yunis where fierce street battles are underway as Israeli troops backed by warplanes intensify a ground assault on Hamas. Intense fighting is also reported in the Jabalia Refugee Camp. The Palestinian news agency in Rafah says an airstrike hit an entire presidential square killing dozens of people including women and children. \"Al Jazeera\" says among those killed today were 21 relatives of one of its correspondence. Eighty five percent of Gaza's population, so we've been telling you here on the show is now displaced. Many people crammed into makeshift shelters there, even sleeping on the streets. The U.N. Secretary-General says public order could soon completely breakdown, his words, warning the war could have potentially irreversible implications for Palestinians as well as the region. The U.N. Human Rights chief also speaking out. Have a listen to this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) VOLKER TURK, U.N. HIGH COMMISSIONER FOR HUMAN RIGHTS: Palestinians in Gaza are living in utter, deepening horror. Military operations including bombardments by Israeli forces continue in north, middle and south Gaza, affecting people who have already been displaced multiple times, forced to flee in search of safety. But no place is safe. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

We've seen a variety of videos that show that there's been massive destruction in Khan Yunis, but not just Khan Yunis. The Israelis continue to bomb areas of the north as well, the Jabalia Refugee Camp, for instance, Deir Al-Balah, and of course, all the while, the humanitarian situation is getting worse. The amount of destruction has gotten to the point where our colleagues who tried to geolocate pictures can't do it because all of the landmarks have been obliterated. And today, of course, it's another cold and windy day. It's also cold and windy down in Gaza. And as you mentioned, people are living in the streets. They're living in what we call tense, but these are basically structures with thin, plastic sheeting that provide very little protection from the elements, and therefore listening to Secretary-General Guterres, definitely has a pretty good take on what's going on in Gaza at the moment.

It says Israel's war in no way can be described as self-defense, slamming what it calls the siege of an entire civilian population. The Secretary-General of the Norwegian Refugee Council Jan Egeland said in a statement, I'm going to read it out. \"Our colleagues in Gaza ask themselves a simple question. How is it that these atrocities are beamed across the world for all to witness, and yet so little is done to stop them?\" And Jan Egeland joins us now live from Oslo. Jan, great to see you. So what is your answer then? What do you tell your colleagues? How do you answer that question? JAN EGELAND, SECRETARY-GENERAL, NORWEGIAN REFUGEE COUNCIL: I don't have a good answer at all, because this is clearly no way to fight terror, this is not self-defense. Six thousand, 7,000 children, 5,000 women clearly innocent of the atrocities that happened in Israel on the 7th of October, have been killed. More children have been killed than in all other wars in the last year combined. This has to end. This bombardment from air, from warships, from tanks on a densely-populated area is madness, really. We cannot reach the civilian population because our own aid workers are fleeing for their lives. One of my colleagues -- I get emotional about this now. One of my colleagues, a young lady has just given birth. She is with her baby, two months on the street in the cold, in the Winter. Her house is destroyed. This is no way to wage a war.",

I also spoke today with the son of one of those elderly hostages being held captive in Gaza who did attend this meeting as well with Netanyahu. He said that he is worried that his father is indeed losing hope as he watches the Israeli government return not to the negotiating table, but return instead to this offensive in the south. He said despite how moving the testimony was from some of these newly-freed hostages, he felt like it didn't move the Israeli prime minister or his war cabinet's position at all, as they continue to reassert that they are focused on both the war effort, but also returning the hostages, a goal that the son of that elderly hostage told me are simply incompatible.",
