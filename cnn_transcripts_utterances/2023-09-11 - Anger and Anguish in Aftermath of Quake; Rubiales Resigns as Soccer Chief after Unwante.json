Nearly 2500 peopleare now confirmed dead and there is a race against time to save those still trapped. Kim Jong-Un appears to be on his way to Russia to meet with Vladimir Putin. The North Korean Leader is heading there by train. America remembers the nearly 3000 lives lost 22 years ago in the 9/11 terror attacks. Families of the victims gathered in New York to read their names an observed several moments of silence. And Luis Rubiales resigned as President of the Spanish Football Federation following weeks of criticism over an unwanted kiss he gave star player Jennifer Hermoso after Spain won the women's world cup. Welcome back. This is our second hour of \"Connect the World\". And wherever you are watching you are more than welcome. Work underway in Morocco to clear roads blocked by Friday's powerful earthquake and to reach remote areas of the Atlas Mountains. Right now nearly 2500 people are confirmed dead with as many injured and that number is certain to climb. CNN's Sam Kiley reports from a village that has been decimated by the quake. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SAM KILEY, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Another victim buried returned to the earth that killed when it shook. More than 2000 people who perished in the worst Moroccan earthquake in over 100 years. Most of the deaths were in villages in the Atlas Mountains, where homes cracked and crumbled late on Friday night.",

United Nations is ready to assist the government of Morocco and its efforts to assist the impacted population. So what could that assistance look like? We want to note that the UN has not yet received a formal request for assistance from the Moroccan government. For more I'm joined by Farhan Haq Deputy Spokesperson for the UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres. And just explain if you will how you assess the needs at this point and how you stand ready, at least at the United Nations to help address them? FARHAN HAQ, DEPUTY SPOKESPERSON, U.N. SECRETARY-GENERAL: Yes. We are in touch with our counterparts in the Moroccan government who are in the lead in terms of all of the humanitarian efforts on the ground, including the search and rescue efforts. We have brought some additional experts to Morocco right now. And we're on standby, waiting for requests for assistance. But in other earthquakes and natural disasters in the past, we've been ready to coordinate assistance on the ground, including for the sort of things we believe will be needed in this case, such as food and water, health care, including blood supplies and other things and shelter so there's a very clearly the needs for that. We're monitoring the situation; it's obvious that there are a large number of people who have to sleep outside out of doors, given the weakness of different structures.

      "sentences": "Well Becky, what we know about the meeting at this point from the Kremlin certainly is that Kim Jong-Un willbe in Russia in the coming days they say. From the North Korean side from state run media, they say that it will be soon. So we don't have a specific timeline for when we should expect it to see the two leaders together. But what we have heard when it comes to the Intel it's from the U.S. and the South Korean side, primarily about what they believe is happening with this closer relationship between Russia and North Korea. The U.S. intelligence and U.S. officials have said that they believe that they are actively moving towards this arm deal, something that both Moscow and Pyongyang have denied. But we've heard from U.S. officials backed up by the South Korean side that they believe that that the Russians are looking for ammunition for example. This is something we've been hearing from other experts in the field as well that they need more ammunition they need small arms, for their war in Ukraine. And this is something that we know that North Korea is able to produce very well and in great numbers. So that's certainly something that they could provide. And of course, there are also similarities between the militaries in Russia and North Korea, in the sort of weapons and ammunition they use. So potentially ammunition which was given from North Korea to Russia could be used immediately or at least quite quickly with little modification, and that is of concern to Washington and Seoul and of course, to Kyiv as well. And so what we know from the other side, what would North Korea get out of some kind of deal? U.S. officials have told CNN, they believe it could be satellite technology, it could be nuclear submarine technology that they would get in return because North Korea is a transactional country, it would want something in return for anything it could give to Russia. But it is an interesting dynamic change. We saw the two leaders meet four years ago back in 2019. Kim Jong-Un traveled to go and meet Vladimir Putin. Now there were many pledges of friendship of promising closer ties but nothing materialized from that. There were no agreements or announcements after that meeting. But now it appears that the dynamics are very different now, that as U.S. officials say Russia needs something and it needs this that multiple types of ammunition, according to the NSC. So it will be interesting in the coming days to see what the dynamics are like to see what kind of meeting it is. We don't expect to have any communique or any kind of detailed statement the likes of which we would have seen from other bilateral meetings from these two countries, but certainly what they do agree will be of concern to Washington to Seoul to Tokyo and to many other capitals around the world, Becky?",

Of course, the IAEA has and you were describing that, in your introduction, has a number of activities in Iran. We have an open process with Iran, which is, like you say, like you said, not making the progress, we would like to see it making. But at the same time, we are aware of the fact that there is a bilateral dialogue of some sort, because there is no direct, as you know, conversation between the Islamic Republic and the United States, there is some conversation where nuclear issues are discussed. But this, the IAEA is not, it's not a party to that conversation, which has implications, of course, for what we do. So I think there has to be some separation in order to understand what is happening.

But of course, Iran is the only country, is the only country in the international community not having nuclear weapons, which is enriching at 60 percent level, to have weapon grade material, you have to go to 90 percent. So it's a fraction a little bit more that you should do. So again, this is not forbidden. But it's obvious that it's not, but now, it has repercussions people are concerned.

So this is something that strikes concern into many MPs about how they might have been. How they their backgrounds, the details of their references and interests in China may have been looked into and what this person was doing with the information they were getting. And there's, there are other MPs, some of whom who've been sanctioned by China are disappointed and upset that they weren't informed sooner. Because the police actually arrested these two men, a 20-year-old in Scotland and a 30-year-old in Oxfordshire bought them to London. Back in March, they'd been released on bail since expecting to be charged, they'll be formally charged in court with breaking the Official Secrets Act espionage in October. So there's been a big delay in many MPs, if you want to know more finding out about this. And it's been made, much as information has been made public in some of the British newspapers over the weekend actually causing the researcher in question to try to clear his name as well saying that the idea that he's been spying for China is untrue, that he has been trying to tell people about the dangers of the Chinese Communist Party. Chinese Embassy here also pushing back very strongly calls it fabrications. Becky?",

He didn't attend. What do you make of what was one suggested about the conversation that Sunak had with the Chinese Premier? And more widely just, you know, what was achieved at G20 this weekend?",

And the other part of his meeting there that you said he had with the Chinese Premier, did discuss other areas of mutual interest. And I think there's a perception, perhaps among some of the Conservative Party, that this Prime Minister is being softer on the Chinese than others might and hence, we heard that very strong language for him. But you know, where does this you know, where does this sort of push that relationship and what came out of the G20, not as strong on Ukraine, and that was anticipated going in if you don't have President Xi, don't have President Putin. That's too big holdouts of the meeting. India trying to hold that position of all doing good for each other, the rich trying to help the poor up and of course, that's the ethos of the G20. But I think widely regarded as a summit that set out to achieve a lot didn't fail, but really didn't have a huge impact. Obviously Africa being invited to join, that is significant going forward.",

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) PAULA NEWTON, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Not all ideas are winners and those duds' flops losers and never made it to the marketing world are the stars of a new exhibit in Washington DC called the Museum of Failure. And despite the soul crushing nature of its theme, organizers say it's a fun experience that shows how failure can lead to success.",

NEWTON (voice-over): Visitors are invited to take a spin on the Hewlett chair designed to work out your abs while sitting at a desk. That is, if you stay still long enough to get any work done. There's also fish flavored water for cats, but the fussy felines turn their noses up at it, or spray on condoms in peppermint and banana varieties. But those didn't catch on, like the more than 150 other products displayed in the exhibit, which has successfully toured the world for the past six years. Here visitors can appreciate the endless combinations of Oreo cookies, some of which just didn't dunk well with consumers. Then there's the former board game of a former president that didn't gain much of a following. And then there's a new addition the Starbucks Oleato drink and olive oil infused coffee. That's getting mixed reviews and still on the market. But it's definitely a no for some customers who complained it sent them straight to the bathroom. The event organizer says deciding what to include in the show isn't exactly an exact science.",
