Which means really that the divine imperative and demand of all human beings is to love our Creator and to love our fellow human beings and to love for them what we love for ourselves. And this message is universal, certainly among the three monotheistic religions around the table here, but almost all religion believes in being kind, being generous, being just.

But I think the message of Christmas is that God enters into it with us, and we're not alone in it.What I'm so struck by is that the story of Christmas is about a Palestinian Jew. Now, how often do you find those words put together. A Palestinian Jew born into a time when his country was occupied, right? They can't find a place for her to even give birth. His mother, they're homeless. They eventually have to flee as refugees, into Egypt, no less. I mean, you can't make up the parallels to our current world situation right now. And so in some way, that is who we believe, God becomes, born into that situation. And yet that very man, Jesus, says, love one another, love your enemies. There is hope. There is light in the darkness. I'm attesting to that. So somehow that God enters that experience of suffering and that struggle and is actually born into it. That is what is so miraculous about this celebration for me.",

So that the Jesus that Imam was talking about, this Jesus who says, love God and love neighbor, I struggle with that. I mean, we're struggling right now in our world how you do that. So if you can actually ask it not to be your own breath all the time, but you breathe in the spirit of God, that kind of inclusive God. And so I think that is a wonderful analogy right there.",
