The head of Sudan's army has indicated he's willing to extend the truce by another three days says he is willing to begin talks with the leader of the so called Rapid Support Forces.So far, there's been no response from the paramilitary group. The current ceasefire is set to expire late Thursday local time. Each side has repeatedly accused the other of violating the agreement. The fighting now in its second week has already claimed more than 500 lives, according to the health ministry. Wounded nearly 4,200 people. According to the U.N. about 20,000 Sudanese fled to neighboring Chad. Thousands more have headed to other countries in search of safety. Many more are expected to leave Sudan in the coming days and weeks. Meanwhile, there's growing concern over who is in control of the National Public Health Laboratory in Khartoum, which stores samples of deadly diseases like TB, polio, COVID, and measles. The Rapid Support Forces has now denied seizing the facility. But experts say whoever is in charge are the most at risk of exposure to the diseases stored at the lab. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DR. MICHAEL RYAN, EXEC. DIR, WHO HEALTH EMERGENCIES PROGRAMME: We want to make sure that the people occupying the building know the risks to themselves.

And let's stay take a step back in terms of why now, you know, as Nic pointed out, this had long been rumored for months, but especially after Xi came back from Moscow, especially after that flurry of diplomatic visits to Beijing by European leaders, like Macron and von der Leyen.And then you juxtapose that with China's growing desire to be seen as a global peacemaker. Following that deal, they broke her between the Saudis and Iranians. So it was in this broader context, this highly anticipated call finally took place. So, some analysts see this as a response or even a reward from Beijing to Europe so willingness to engage with China on this issue. But then let's not forget what had just happened in the past few days that as one of the country's most prominent so called wolf warrior diplomats, Chinese ambassador to France, really caused an uproar across Europe when he questioned on live television, the legality of the sovereignty of former Soviet states. So even though China has since distanced and decel in those remarks, the damage was done. So the need for damage control, according to some observers, may finally tip the scales in favor of this rather modest gesture in the form of this phone call dealing with Xi Jinping did assures Zelenskyy about the so called strategic partnership between them but also promises to send a special envoy. But the thing is, as you mentioned, even Chinese state media commentators acknowledge this one phone call is unlikely to change anything on the ground in the short term, given the chasm between Russia and Ukraine and their positions. And observers have also pointed out it's going to take a lot more than just one phone call to convinced China's critics and skeptics in Europe about it's been serious to play this unbiased role, as you said, because they still refuse to call this war, Russian invasion. And they're still media here continue to parrot a lot of Russian talking points on a war on a daily basis. But what this does show, of course, is China's now at least willing to engage with the Ukraine more directly more regularly from this point onward. And it's definitely trying to show you that it's -- it wants to play the same more active and constructive role in ending this war, despite its increasingly close ties with Russia.
