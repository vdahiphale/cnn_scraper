So there's not a concern here to public safety.They're not answering our questions about the status of the shooter or shooters. They are urging, however, publicly, for patients and asking people to send in photos or videos if they've got any piece of evidence saying that they are not in a rush to get answers on this, that they're doing this methodically, and that is the way that they will ensure justice. John, we did speak to the assistant football coach, Michael Taylor, who calls one of the victims, Phil Dowdell, like a son. He's been coaching him since he was nine years old.

JIM JORDAN (R), CHAIRMAN, JUDICIARY COMMITTEE: Here in Manhattan, the scales of justice are weighed down by politics. For the district attorney, justice isn't blind. It's about looking for opportunities to advance a political agenda, a radical political agenda.

The GOP has held on other topics and they are saying that this is a political stunt, this is an abuse of power. You know, a couple of them have said to some of the victims, you know, we acknowledge these experiences you've had. This is horrible, but this is not our jurisdiction to be policing crime here in Manhattan. And of course, this comes, as you said, as Republicans on the House Judiciary Committee are trying to investigate Alvin Bragg's investigation of Donald Trump. Bragg shot back in court. He sued them trying to block a subpoena they sent to one of the former prosecutors who worked in the office. Today, House Republicans, via their attorneys, responded in court saying the judge should reject Alvin Bragg's argument, arguing that what the committee is doing is essentially immune from civil lawsuits because it is part of the legislative sphere. So essentially, this is a fight that's going to keep on rolling, John.",

There was actually -- it was after Donald Trump put out a social media post saying that he's going to get arrested. The investigation was still ongoing at that point.Republicans wanted to move forward and bring Alvin Bragg to come testify. That simply does not happen. They contend there's a legislative purpose. It's unclear exactly what that is other than, perhaps legislation to prevent a prosecutor, local prosecutor from bringing charges against a presidential candidate. That's their argument. They're trying to advance, to contend that this is not an effort to interfere with this investigation. What will be interesting to me is that if Donald Trump is charged in any of these other cases, in Georgia or on the federal level, will this Republican Russia defense also happen? Right now, they think the Bragg case is out of bounds. Will they think that about the other case?",

And particularly in New York, we saw it play out in the 2022 elections that there were a lot of voters who went to the Republican side specifically. And in cities across America, we see voters, you know, concerned about rising crime rates and unconvinced that Democrats in some cases, have a plan to address this problem.However, by turning this into a referendum on the Trump indictment, Republicans are muddling that message. You know, this is not a legislative hearing on a new crime bill that would put more cops on the streets where Republicans can say, look, you know, Democrats aren't solving the crime issue, but we are. Instead, they are going after this prosecutor in a way that, as you say, does call into question their commitment to principles about, you know, local government rights and limited government and all of that. So I think that makes it harder for them to make a straightforward message on the issue where they might actually reach some people.",
