Record high temperatures are expected to hit Houston this week, just as people there are picking up the pieces from the wild hurricane force winds that caused serious damage and at least seven people were killed in those storms.

But I want to start with a skyline because that is why we are here.You can see that some of these high-rise buildings look like checkerboards. The city of Houston has established what they call an exclusive zone. It's an area that's about six blocks wide where a lot of this glass crashed on the streets and the sidewalks and it's still too dangerous for people to transit through that area. According to the mayor of Houston, they are still trying to assess how many buildings were damaged in this area. Damage assessments are still ongoing. They're still trying to figure all of that out. But one of the big problems is power outages. And before I talk about households being without power, I want to talk about traffic lights because if you've ever been to Houston, you know that our traffic here is a nightmare. And there's about 2,500 traffic lights in the city of Houston, about 400 of them are impacted, nearly 300 are without power. So, there are crews here in Houston from all across the state trying to restore these lights because it makes it a very dangerous situation when lights across this city are without power. So, city officials are urging people that if they don't have to be on these roadways, that they don't need to be on the roadways. Now, here's the good news about power outages. At the height of this storm, there were nearly 1 million customers without power in this region. Right now, in Harris County, that number is about 200,000. And there's about 7,000 workers that are trying to restore power very quickly. Now, here's the bad news. Take a look at the heat index. And if you have ever been in Houston in May, it is hot, it is muggy and you can see that heat index, 99 today and 100 and over for the rest of the week. And, Kate, that's the worry for city officials that are very concerned because it is hot, it is humid, and some people still don't have power, which means they don't have air conditioning. Kate.",

So, it just adds to his political burdens there.And, you know, I think the president deserves some credit for raising issues that now are being widely debated, even in Israel.

You saw Senator Cotton last year introduce a bill with Senator Rubio and Cruz on this exact same issue. And now you've seen them telegraphing those moves for several weeks, given the noise coming out of the ICC.You're going to see President Trump take a strong stance, I would imagine, against the ICC and its potential claims to jurisdiction against the Israelis. And, you know, this is part and parcel, kind of the way that Donald Trump has always run his campaigns. So, you go back to 2016, he talked about the global order. This is exactly what he was talking about, this global international court system which is now claiming jurisdiction in nations that don't even recognize its legitimacy. And so you're going to see him use this as another cajole against President Biden. He can talk about the fact that President Biden rescinded that executive order that Donald Trump put in place initially, and then also this kind of week language coming out about the ICC. I think President Biden politically is to take a pretty hard line against it, not just for politics, but also the policy, given the precedent it would set should the ICC be able to go after Netanyahu. It means it could potentially come after U.S. troops in a future incident as well.",

The Iranian government says in the aftermath of this shock there will be no chaos, no disruption.

The second question is going to be, what does this mean for Iran's long-term stability? And here this becomes a problem. The supreme leader has one goal, to transition Iran to a new generation of leadership that can sustain the revolution. And Raisi was part of that.

He doesn't have someone like that I put in that chair.So the next president, who they've got to identify in about 50 days, is going to have to be someone in - sort of a second tier person who can assure stability while they again try to figure out what happens for succession.
