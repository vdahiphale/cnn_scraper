They're going to come back and do it all over again in a couple of hours.You know exactly what I'm talking about because the House voted to adjourn until noon tomorrow, a vote that Kevin McCarthy won by really the skin of his teeth. And coming back to vote again because there has not yet been a speaker of the House elected. And it's all right now seemingly about buying time for more negotiations behind closed doors. So, the fact the motion to adjourn even passed, well, that's a little bit of good news for Kevin McCarthy. He did speak to Manu Raju just a little while ago saying that he still believes that he will become the next speaker of the House, but he wouldn't commit to when that would actually take place or even getting it wrapped up by tomorrow.

Well, that was just today, and you can add that to what's happened in the past over the past several days. His own party has told him, nope. That comes, of course, from Congressman Lauren Boebert, that we don't want you, a total of 11 times this week. This, frankly, is nothing like any of us have seen at least in our lifetimes. We may have heard about it and we have read about it, known that it could happen, but this is the longest speaker contest in 164 years. Now, I don't want to scare you all the way, but back in 1855, the contest for speaker at that time, it went for 133 ballots. So right now, we are in the small potatoes category of all of this. But here we are tonight, 11 votes, and there is still not a speaker of the House. And this -- frankly, all of this dysfunction, this what's known as an embarrassing display by so many who are talking about what's happening on Capitol Hill right now, this seemingly complete inability to get the job done or even be able to move past this particular hurdle and begin doing the jobs that many have come to actually do and were elected to do, well, maybe is this a preview of what's going to come down the road? You have to wonder if Congress will be able to get a lot done, if anything, in the near future if there can't be the cohesion to elect a speaker of the House. I want to get right to Manu Raju who is on Capitol Hill. Manu, good to see you. I mean, look, all the chaos that is happening right now, we're actually hearing from the man of, well, the past 36 hours and beyond, Kevin McCarthy. What is he saying?",

But, really, in the last 48 hours, 24 hours and just this past day, they have really, really intensified. In fact, right now, behind closed doors one of his top lieutenants' office, Tom Emmer's office, there's a meeting that is still going on with some of these holdouts. They've been meeting in that room all day long. Kevin McCarthy has been part of those discussions. So, he believes eventually when the deal is reached that will help them get some support and then even more support as he tries to get some of the other holdouts. Now, he also defended the concessions that he's made even though some are concerned that would make him a weaker speaker. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

If they're not there, that would actually change the threshold for how much majority, what would be a majority to elect the speaker, it would go below 218 votes because it's said the majority of those who are present and voting. That's how they count the votes, but that doesn't necessarily mean it'll help him if his supporters aren't there and actually may be more difficult for him to reach that threshold. So, that underscores the fact they're likely going to weight.And one other thing to note, my colleagues, Annie Grayer, Melanie Zanona, tonight, are reporting that there will be a conference call tomorrow with the full Republican conference, and they decided to do a conference call instead of a closed door meeting, like they did on Tuesday. And that Tuesday mid-morning meeting was very harsh, lots of curse words, yelling at each other. And it led to actually a very difficult situation. But a lot of people say that's almost hardened the opposition of McCarthy, made it more difficult to get him to speakership instead. Of doing an in-person meeting, they're doing a phone call tomorrow instead. They're hoping it goes off better and see if they can get there.",

But it's interesting because all of these notions, you've got a lot to get done. And, frankly, even though Republicans are suffering in the intraparty disputes right now, it impacts Democrats right now. They also are Congresspersons-elect at this point in time. Many are not in the same boat, of course.But you see, this doesn't bode well for the American public, I would assume, right, I'm sure you think so, that if you have all these things to get done, if this initial hurdle can't be cleared, how is there confidence that you'd like the electorate to believe there is possible to get those things done with this holdout minority?",

We need first downs and we need a score, but there is progress being made. And I still remain an optimist, but we have to realize what's the higher purpose. As you point out the higher purpose is to serve the people. And I'm from Montana. And in Montana, water is really important as an example. The administration reenacted the waters of the U.S. rules. Now, Congress can act and defund that and mitigate some of the damage. You know, Second Amendment, things that are important to Montana. Now, those are important to Montana. There are other issues that are important to the states. We can't address any of those unless we're a functional body if there's not a speaker. Now, I was a SEAL. I can tell you I've been in a lot of battles in my life, and I have. And not every battle is run by a commanding general like George S. Paton, because generals don't win wars.

And, again, on all the points that we're talking about, when -- by McCarthy potentially giving this small faction whether the ability to vacate him from the speakership either with one vote or with five votes, that could ultimately mean that Democrats have to come to that speaker's rescue, whoever it is. So, that way they stay in power because of the fact that, again, on the debt limit if that -- those five or more than them decide we don't want to vote to increase the debt limit, all they have to do is go and say, we're going to raise a motion to vacate the chair and try to kick McCarthy out to avoid a debt limit increase.",

The same document says one of the surviving roommates said she was awoken around 4:00 a.m., heard crying from Xana Kernodle's room and heard a voice say, \"It's okay. I'm going to help you.\" And that she heard the crying and saw a figure clad in black clothing and a mask. She describes him as 5'10\" or taller, male, not very muscular, but athletically built with bushy eyebrows saying he walked past her as she stood in a frozen shocked phase. But questions still remain about why no one called 911 until almost 8 hours later. The affidavit says security video around the time of the murders picked up distorted audio of what sounded like voices or a whimper followed by a loud thud. A dog can also be heard barking. The document also details multiple sightings of a suspect vehicle from surveillance footage showing a white Hyundai Elantra like this one that helped lead to Kohberger's arrest. About two weeks after the murders police from Washington State University where Kohberger attended school flagged his vehicle later seen at a traffic stop in mid-December in Indiana while driving with his father to Pennsylvania.",

That, of course, is about seven days after police announced that they are looking for a white Elantra or any information about someone driving one in the area. When he gets there, what we're told is the surveillance team sees him cleaning that Elantra from top to bottom inside and out, not skipping a single spot to get it spic-and-span, wearing surgical gloves as he moves things in and out of the car, that at one point he comes out at 4:00 in the morning to take the garbage out.
