      "sentences": "This is fragile. There is absolutely no trust between these two parties, Israel and Hamas. I'm told that very specifically by the mediation team who worked these talks from here in Qatar. It is fragile and, therefore, the team here baked in very specific obligations for both sides every single day to ensure that they can keep to this deal.What are those obligations today? Well, the first is that these 13 hostages, and Israelis now know who those are, women and children, will be released by Hamas into the arms of the ICRC, the International Red Cross and Red Crescent. They will then be taken through Gaza and into Israel by whichever route seems most appropriate. And that really depends on where these hostages are being held. They may not all be being held, of course, in the same place. Once-- as we understand it, once the Israelis have seen that those hostages have been released, then they will begin to release 39 prisoners, women and mostly young men under the age of 18 Palestinian prisoners from a jail or a number of jails in or close to Haifa. They will be taken to Ramallah. So, those are the first obligations. The second obligation today and every day of this pause is that there is no hostilities either on-- or there are no hostilities either on the ground or through surveillance drones or drones being flown in the air very specifically around the period of time that these hostages are released. And they are expected to be released around about the same time every day. Today, that will be around or after 9:00 A.M. Eastern Time, 4:00 P.M. in the afternoon there in Gaza. And the third is, of course, ensuring that this border crossing at Rafah is open for at least 200 trucks worth of supplies coming through into Gaza, which is so badly needed. So, let's get more information now and what we understand to be the fine detail here. Let's get to Jeremy Diamond. He is near the Israel- Gaza border. And, Jeremy, help us understand the context of where you are in relation to the hostage release. [07:05:00] JEREMY DIAMOND, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Well, Becky, our understanding is that these 13 hostages today will be brought to various crossing points to be able to cross into Israel. One of those points is near where we are standing right now, and that is the Kerem Shalom crossing, which is just over my shoulder here. This is one of the main crossing points between Israel and Gaza. It also has a point between Israel and Egypt as well. And this is where we know that a lot of aid has been checked in order to be able to go into Egypt. And it is also where two hostages, the Ranand (ph) family, where they were brought into Israel by Gal Hirsch, who is Benjamin Netanyahu's special representative for hostage affairs. He went and got them at this very crossing, which is just over my shoulder here. And so this is certainly one of the potential points where some of these 13 hostages could be brought to. Our understanding is that there is an agreement and understanding between the Israelis and Hamas mediated by Qatar, where there are several different potential crossing points where these hostages could be brought to, depending on where their location is in the Gaza Strip. As you mentioned, Becky, Hamas is first expected to deliver those hostages to the Red Cross, and then it will be the Red Cross that brings them to these various crossing points. Now, once they get to these crossing points, our understanding is that if the hostages are children under 12, they will be met by their families, either at or very near to those crossings. If they are over 12, our understanding is that they will be taken directly to hospitals in Israel. They may also stop at an air force base nearby. What we do know is that the Israeli military has been preparing for this scenario in a number of ways. They have been preparing helicopters to fly these hostages to this air force base and also to hospitals across Israel. Our understanding is that there are five different hospitals in Israel that are prepared to receive these hostages and also where they will meet their families. Of course, beyond that, there are other preparations, psychological preparations, financially that will be provided to these hostages and to their families. So, this is really a whole of government effort that we are watching begin to play out right now, and part of that effort could certainly play out right over my shoulder here at the Kerem Shalom crossing.",

Eastern Time, 4:00 P.M. local time. And that is why Clarissa and I are talking about this being in a couple of hours' time. But let's be quite clear about this. I mean, you know, this is not sort of-- we're not working in normal conditions here. So, it could be much later than 9:00. We know that it's just going to be at some point afterwards. At this point, there is an operations room now up and running here in Doha, in Qatar, with members of the ICRC and with members of the mediation team. Remember, it was Qatar who is at the heart of this really, you know, incredibly tough negotiation. And they have basically got phones set up. They are monitoring this truce and the subsequent hostage releases every second of the way to ensure or certainly try and ensure that there is no slippage. I started this by saying this is incredibly fragile. No trust on either side of this. So, it's clear that many things could go awry at this point. But there is an agreement. There is a process in place. And at this point, the hope is certainly for those families of hostages who are on the ground who will now know who these 13 are today. There will be some sense that this tragedy, this trauma that they've been going through might at least get some closure at some point in the next hours. Back to you.",

COREY SHDAIMAH, 84-YEAR-OLD STEPMOTHER HELD HOSTAGE BY HAMAS:  Well, we know that the families whose family members will be released were notified. And so our understanding is if we are not notified, that we are not in that group. But that's really the way that we know. But like Amichai said, there's a lot of pain, there's a lot of suffering.

I've also said that she's a person who has an open heart and open hands to receive everyone who kind of is lucky enough to come in her ambit. And she's very dear to us and to the whole family.

They will be taken from two jails in Northern Israel and driven to a prison south of Ramallah. CNN's Nada Bashir joins us from Beitunya in the West Bank.

      "sentences": "Look, Becky, this is a process that has been the focus of negotiations for weeks. Now, as you mentioned, we will see those 39 prisoners departing, being transported from those two jails southeast of Eastern Jerusalem. But then, of course, they will be moving here to the Ofer Prison, which is just in the distance behind us. And there is quite a crowd that has already gathered waiting to see this process unfold, waiting to hear the names of those who have been released. As we know, there will be 39 released today as part of that deal. But, of course, as we have heard repeatedly now from the Israeli military and government, those 39 will not be released until we have that confirmation of the safe evacuation of at least 13 hostages who are set to be released from Hamas captivity today.Now, of course, once they are brought to this Ofer Prison, they will undergo checks, according to the authorities, by the Red Cross. They will be held there until that confirmation is received at the safety of those 13 hostages. And then they will reach this Beitunya crossing behind me, where they will be released and allowed to return to their home. So, of course, as we know, there are some 39 people expected to be released today. That is amongst 150 who are set to be released over the course of this four-day truce, if indeed the terms of that truce are upheld for the next four days. We did see earlier in the week a list of 300 Palestinians currently held in Israeli custody who may well be amongst those released, but still no clarity on exactly who is set to be released. As we know, many of those who were listed in that initial release of 300 names are young men between the ages of 16 and 18, not charged with serious offenses. And, of course, there are women and children amongst those in the list. Again, no clarity on who is set to be released. But, again, this is being seen as a welcome step for many in the Palestinian community, particularly here in the occupied West Bank, but this is just a small fraction of the more than 8,000 Palestinians currently held in custody, in Israeli custody, including more than 3,000 currently held under administrative detention, which means no clear charges have been laid out. There is no ongoing legal process. And, according to Amnesty International, that is a process that could go on indefinitely. So, of course, a small fraction of that total figure. And we have been speaking to some of those families and friends waiting to see if their loved ones will be amongst the 39 released today. Many have told us that they will not be celebrating their release. While they are hopeful that their loved ones will be freed today, this has come at a heavy cost. They are, of course, referencing the lives lost in Gaza in this exchange. They see this as, of course, a terrible situation that they are faced with. And while they are welcoming the release of some Palestinian prisoners, particularly here in the occupied West Bank, they are, of course, still mourning the lives of Palestinians lost in Gaza.",
