      "sentences": "Well, it is so incredibly relevant. I mean, you imagine that they are celebrating, commemorating, and thanking the veterans from 80 years ago today, as both the Secretary of Defense and the President of the United States, and the President of France, turned to those veterans and said, thank you, you saved the world.And they have all, though, cast their speeches and cast the atmosphere of today's, and this year's commemoration and celebration, in terms of what we face in Europe and in the world right now, which is a soaring and a searing rise in authoritarianism. Democracy is on the backfoot. The far right is poised to win in the upcoming European elections, which are happening just this weekend, while President Biden remains in Europe on this state visit. And so, the stakes are huge. President Biden framed it in talking about how this alliance has simply grown NATO, the greatest military alliance in history, as he called it, has grown over these last 80 years, and including the newest members, Sweden and Finland. He talked about Vladimir Putin as being a tyrant. He used that word. He said, bent on domination. He talked about not forgetting and not letting Ukraine fight its war alone. And remember, these are all really important words, but actions must be louder than words, because Ukraine is very, very much suffering from the delay in American aid that took some seven months, saw for the first time in these three, now nearly three years of war, Russia take advantage of that gap in weaponry and that gap in ability to fight them off, and started to come through the Ukrainian frontier towards Kharkiv. And these -- this has really concentrated the alliance minds and have made them realize that actually Europe and the United States, the entire alliance, needs to do so much more to step-up to this moment, that is testing this alliance, and the entire world order that the United States put in place after World War II. And so, this is going to be the theme, presumably, going forth from these days. The moments of -- of -- of such poignancy, with President Macron, and President Biden going up to at least 11 of the American Veterans conferring on them from the French side, the (inaudible), and from Biden, you saw him press a presidential coin into each of their hands as well. And they are really the heroes. And as you said, John, the watch is so poignant, celebrating and thanking their forebears and passing the baton to this generation and to future generations, whose job it will be, to -- to save and to defend what these people died saving and defending. And I think that, that is just so incredible to really contemplate and digest. And then, the last thing I suppose, is to remember that in the horror and the chaos, and the destruction of World War II, it was America, again, with the Marshall Plan that invested in building back the enemy's, building by Germany into one of the greatest democracies in the world, building back, and helping Japan, the enemy from the Pacific into a solid Asian democracy. And that makes this alliance so huge. He's -- he's right, Biden, that is the biggest military alliance in the world, because it spans the entire length and breadth from the American continent to the Pacific. And so, this is all what they're remembering, what they're commemorating, and what we all have to be up to -- to actually preserve for the future, because the challenges are not just -- not over. They are as dangerous as ever right now.",

      "sentences": "Well, I took note of his baton passing to the future generation acknowledging that the veterans who were here 80 years ago, and are also here today that their time is coming to an end, but that it rests on the future generation to carry that mission forward, he said, let us be the generation, that history is written about our time, 10 20, 50 years from now.We met the moment. Our alliances were made stronger. We saved democracy, and our time as well. Of course, he is issuing that challenge to a generation that has seen the political fabric in the United States, and across western capitals, be fraying in recent years as some populist forces have been on the rise. Certainly, Biden is trying to pledge his unbreakable assistance and commitment to the NATO Alliance, which he notes was created in the wake of World War II, and is stronger than ever today in his words, but there is a cost associated with that commitment. And it is a cost that European leaders are attempting to step up to the plate with, we know that more leaders are trying to meet that two percentage points of, 2 percent of GDP defense spending target by the NATO Summit next month. And we also know that President Biden has been seeking more money from European leaders to fund the war in Ukraine. Christiane mentioned the Marshall Plan, which in today's dollars, would have cost $171 billion. The U.S. already has pledged $175 billion in military and financial aid to Ukraine. So, the numbers are staggering at this point. And the President really needs to rally our western allies to -- essentially pledge their share of that fight as well, in addition to, you know, passing this baton to the future generations, and very forceful words, against a very somber backdrop on a very emotional and humbling day here in Normandy.",

Number one, as far as that investment goes, President Biden said, it's not just altruism, it's self-interest. It never has been just altruism. Fighting for freedom is in the self-interest. He made that point, relating it back to 1944. And today, and just the framing and looking toward the future, Kayla, and thank you very much. President Biden actually began the speech on January 5, 1944, poised, looking forward to the events on D-Day and ended it, I think, on the eve of this new fight for democracy around the world, poised to how the United States in the world will make decisions looking forward.I want to bring in Tim Naftali, who's been watching this, along with us right now.

We're very good at memorializing the great events of our history, both at official ceremonies like this one, but in the movies, I mean, there's a World War II movie or two or three every year, that celebrates that victory, and celebrates that test met. Biden is making the argument and he's not alone in this, that, the U.S. and its allies are being tested, again, in Ukraine, and with threats from Russia, beyond Ukraine, and from China to Taiwan, and beyond. And he said, just before that line, isolationism was not the answer 80 years ago, and it is not the answer today, in effect, saying it is good to celebrate those great moments, great tests met from the past. But, we're being tested again. And the challenge now is to meet that test. And to Tim Naftali's point, that was not a certain answer in 1939, or 1941, or 1944. There were many in this country, quite powerful people who argued much as we're hearing argue today, that the sacrifice was too great, that the war in Europe was not America's war, much as you hear today about Ukraine or about Taiwan. They could have won the argument, right? It was not certain that the U.S. was going to join this war. FDR fought for years. It was Pearl Harbor that led to that ultimate decision. So, Biden's point, in effect, is while you're celebrating that moment 80 years ago, you have to, in his view, make the same decision today to stand up.",

You're looking down from the top of the booster in the bottom left, and then, a camera in the top flap of the ship, looking back in the bottom right, so we're getting a couple of different looks as starship heads up hill. Once we get the hot staging, a lot of things happen all at once simultaneously. We're going to light the engines on the ship, starting with (inaudible) first, and then, the three-center sea-level engines before we're separated, all of that exhaust gets bloomed out the side of the hot stage. And then, the ship will separate itself. All, but the three-center engines are going to shut down. So, the booster never stops its thrust while we go through this hot stage maneuver. After that, the booster is going to do its flip, start heading back. And then, the ship will be on its own power, on its way to space. So, that should be coming up in just about 30 seconds from now.

This is the rocket that is designed to land American NASA astronauts on the surface of the moon for the first time since the end of the Apollo program back in 1972.Someday, it is also hopefully going to be used to allow humanity to colonize Mars or that is at least Elon Musk's dream. So, what you're watching right now is the fourth flight test of this vehicle. The first two ended in rather early explosions. But, the last flight test, flight test three, which we saw just about two and a half months ago, was a resounding success. Yes, both the booster and the spaceship ended in an explosion. But, you have to remember, this is a flight test. The goal of that test was just to see if it could get into orbit. And it did that. And it gave us some incredible live images along the way for about an hour long. This flight test, the goal is to go one step further. They want to get starship into orbit. But, the key thing here, is they want to see if it can survive those extremely high temperatures on re-entry. So, what we're going to see, hopefully, is first, if the booster can splash down safely somewhere in the Gulf of Mexico. The booster is the thing that propels starship into space. [08:55:00] And then, after about an hour, we're going to see if starship can actually do a controlled re-entry into the Earth, back into the Earth's atmosphere, survive those high temperatures, do a little belly flip, and then, land a very controlled landing in the water, both vehicles would be lost. But, in the end, the idea is that these would someday be completely reusable rockets, something that would make spaceflight much easier, much faster, and much cheaper, frankly. So, that's what we're watching here. I believe you have the booster on the left, and starship on the right, John and Kate.",

The U.S. has, of course, done it, on the other side of the moon, but not the far side. That's a much higher degree of difficulty. And China wants to build a base on the south pole of the moon, in the exact same place that the United States does, with NASA astronauts, both essentially perhaps someday competing for those valuable resources like water in the form of ice on the south pole of the moon. So, that's what's at stake here.
