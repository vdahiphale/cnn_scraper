And let's get right to the news.We begin on Capitol Hill with Republicans scramble to respond to President-elect Donald Trump's selection of their former colleague, Matt Gaetz, as his nominee for attorney general. Hanging over his appointment, a House Ethics Committee probe into a whole host of alleged wrongdoing, including allegations of illicit drug use and sexual misconduct involving a minor. With Gaetz having resigned from Congress on Wednesday, will that House report ever see the light of day? Speaking to reporters earlier today, the Republican speaker of the House, Mike Johnson, said House rules in his view say no. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. MIKE JOHNSON (R-LA), SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE:  And what I am saying is if someone is no longer a member of Congress, we are not in the business of investigating and publishing reports on people who are not part of this institution. I think it would open a Pandora's box. I think it's a very important rule that should be maintained. If its been broken once or twice, it should not have been because that would be a Pandora's box.

They argue, as part of that regular vetting process, when someone is being vetted for a cabinet position, like the attorney general office.Now, one thing to keep in mind here is that Democrats right now control the Senate Judiciary Committee that is going to change in January but after the speaker made the comments that he was going to ask Michael Guest, the chairman of the House Ethics Committee, not to turn over this report to the Senate Ethics Committee, this is what senate. Senate Ethics Committee spokesman Josh Sorbe said. He said, quote, there is longstanding precedent for releasing ethics investigation materials after a member resigns, whether in the House or the Senate. The now former congressman shouldn't be able to resign away an ethics investigation involving allegations of grave misconduct, especially when he will be nominated to be our country's top law enforcement officer. Now, there's also pushback from Senate Republicans who want to take a look at this report. Keep in mind, they have to vote on these nominees and part of their job as senators is to advice and consent on the presidents cabinet picks. Here's what one of those Republicans, Mike Rounds, told our colleague Manu Raju. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN.

You know, the list is long from Robert F. Kennedy Jr. I mean, he's claimed the 1918 influenza pandemic, HIV somehow originated from vaccine research, no science to support that. And you both well know that vaccines have saved lives, eradicated disease -- diseases. Meg, start with giving us an overview of RFK's strongest positions when it comes to public health. MEG TIRRELL, CNN MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT:  Yeah, Jim, you know, a lot of attention he's been getting recently has been for this make America wealthy again platform. And this seems to be, you know, some of the things that President Trump is really focused on in choosing RFK Jr. And a lot of people in the public health world say, yeah, these things sound great. Let's focus on our chronic disease rates. Let's focus on the fact that the us does spend so much on health care, but we have some really poor health outcomes. He's talked a lot about food and nutrition. Those things are not necessarily controversial. Though, some of the ways he's talked about going after those things, like getting some NIH research or totally changing the FDA, those things are more controversial. Then you get into things like fluoride in the water. He put out a tweet recently and he was interviewed, talking about how he would direct the government to tell local water systems to take fluoride out of their water. His tweet pointed to risks that studies show are really only found at extremely high levels of fluoride in the water over extremely long periods of time, not the levels that are recommended in the U.S. water systems. The CDC is called public water fluoridation, one of the top public health achievements of the 20th century. However, some folks do think look more closely into this as we understand some of those risks at high levels. But then you get to things like vaccines, and that's where people are really frightened about the impact of RFK Jr. on health care in this country. Listen to Hawaii Governor Josh Green last night with Laura Coates. He's a doctor and he says he responded to a measles outbreak in Samoa in 2019 that he links, in part to a rhetoric from RFK Jr. and his group. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV. JOSH GREEN (D), HAWAII:  We had a terrible experience in Samoa. RFK went and rallied that country against vaccinations when there was a measles outbreak. It resulted in the deaths of 83 innocent children. If he is confirmed as HHS secretary, what he will do is he will cast doubt on vaccination programs across America. That will mean thousands and then millions of people will consider not getting vaccinated. We will not have herd immunity and physicians like myself and pediatricians and all sorts of other health care providers will see cataclysmic spread of disease. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

They are very influential in making recommendations about the vaccine schedule, which is influential in determining, you know, what vaccines kids get and when.So there are a lot of things. Potentially, they\\re worried about that he could do as HHS secretary to dismantle those institutions around vaccines. But then also just even more broadly, we even heard from Paul Offit, the vaccine scientist from CHOP, this morning, saying he'd already heard from a pediatrician in Connecticut who said three parents came in saying they didn't want to vaccinate their kids because of what they've been hearing in the news, even as RFK Jr. has just been swirling as this potential pick for HHS secretary.

It felt that at least 94 percent of a community has to be vaccinated against measles for there to be, you know, herd immunity, and were starting to see the impact of vaccine denialism in the United States. Look at Florida, Dr. Joseph Ladapo, who is the surgeon general of Florida, has been a very vocal critic of vaccines. And in the three years that he has been surgeon general, there's been a relatively steep decline in vaccine vaccination rates for kindergartners, so much so that prior to his arrival, the vaccination rate was like 93.6 percent. And in just two years, it dropped to a little over 91 percent. Now, that seems like a small decline, but in the years prior, the decline was in the fraction of a percent and now in Florida, the vaccination rate for kindergartners is lower than the rate felt to be necessary for herd immunity for measles. And we're starting to see out, you know outbreaks of measles in places like Florida.",

People really agree with a lot of those things.But then when you kind of dig in on how he might get there on a lot of these things, he's talking about getting rid of infectious disease research at NIH, in order to focus more on alternative and holistic and preventive areas. And people are certainly into prevention, but they're worried we shouldn't just stop researching infectious diseases so that is a main concern with how he's going about it.",

This is likely one of Joe Biden's last major international trips as the president before Donald Trump takes over in January. The main concern for world leaders is the significant shift in engagement on the global stage, expected when Biden departs and Trump replaces him. Right now, President Biden is meeting with his Peruvian counterpart. CNN's MJ Lee joining us from the White House. MJ, earlier today, Biden met with the leaders of Japan and South Korea. I wonder what you're hearing, one, about what Biden and his team are hearing from U.S. allies abroad in light of the election results, and then what the message in return is? MJ LEE, CNN SENIOR WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT:  Yeah, you know, we just heard President Biden trying to hail the relationship and the alliance that he has really forged between the U.S. and South Korea and Japan during his term in office, clearly trying to emphasize part of his foreign policy legacy that he would like to boost and bring attention to the work that he has done to boost the U.S.'s alliances throughout the Indo-Pacific. The president did say, importantly, that he is hopeful that that alliance is built to last. But, Jim, the reality is that that may be his wish. But the reality that is facing many of the global leaders that are contemplating the idea of Donald Trump coming back into office is that there is a question mark and an asterisk next to every sort of foreign policy question and every relationship, frankly, that the U.S. has with its various alliances allies and other countries. And the fact that they know and remember very well from Donald Trump's first term in office, how that, first and foremost, his foreign policy worldview is very we know very well, which is America first. So even while we have President Biden, you know, going on this sort of swan song last big foreign trip that is expected, you know there could be another one that gets filled in before he leaves office, but this is going to be the last major one with international conferences like this. A lot of the global leaders are basically looking ahead to the Donald Trump era and trying to glean from U.S. officials, what can we possibly expect? And I think the realistic answer is that a lot of folks actually don't know and don't know what the right answer is.",

And one of the main things that U.S. officials try to emphasize around that summit was there needs to be better lines of communication that is open.But just as we were talking about, this is yet another example where it's impossible to say exactly what U.S.-China relations might look like under a second Donald Trump term. I mean, for one, one of his favorite topics that he likes to talk about is tougher tariffs and this is something that a lot of folks expect that Donald Trump will want in terms of China. But again, I think anybody that is trying to sort of game out exactly how these relations might play out they don't know. It's just impossible to say.

And so that was really interesting to get insight into that.And then another aspect of this, of course, is that that fighter jet can actually only hold about eight air to air missiles at a time. So they had to land at a base that was under alert itself because of the threat of an imminent attack, a base in the Middle East. And while they were landing debris from intercepted missiles and drones, was falling onto the runways overhead and so there was a real danger to personnel who were on that runway trying to get these jets refueled and reloaded and back in the air. Here's what another fighter pilot told me about what he saw that night, in terms of the bravery of these guys who were on the ground. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) LT. COL. CURTIS CULVER, UNITED STATES AIR FORCE:  There was an airman at one point standing next to a fuel truck with tons and tons of jet fuel in it just pumping gas into the jet with stuff exploding over the base.

It's tense and uncomfortable, but here, officials say comfort isn't meant to exist. There's no mattresses. There's no sheets. You've got a toilet over here for them to go to the bathroom. You've got this basin here that they use to bathe themselves, and then you can see there -- there's a barrel of water that they can drink from. This is a rare look inside El Salvador's terrorism confinement center known as CECOT. He says there's always somebody standing here in front of the cells. And then if you look up, there's another corridor with more security personnel, 24/7 light. The prison sits like an isolated fortress, nestled in mountainous terrain about an hour and a half drive from the capital. Even with government officials on board with us, we're stopped a mile out. Okay. He's going to inspect bags. We'll get back in. Only to hit another checkpoint. Approaching the main gate, our cell signals vanish. They want to do a full search on us before we enter. Once cleared, we tour the vast campus. It's been equated to seven football stadiums. It's almost multiple prisons within the prison.
