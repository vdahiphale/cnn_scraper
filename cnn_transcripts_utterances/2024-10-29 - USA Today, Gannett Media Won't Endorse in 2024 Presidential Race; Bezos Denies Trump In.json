      "sentences": "I mean, kudos to the Washington Post's Dave Jorgensen and their social media team for being willing to put that out there. And The Washington Post, I should say, has been doing some really good reporting on itself, on what's happening here and what's happening with their owner, Jeff Bezos. Jeff Bezos' op-ed that was published last night is still one of the most read pieces on The Washington Post website, which goes to show you the interest level that people have in what happened behind this endorsement.What I've been hearing from people at The Washington Post and what's been also published publicly, including by their media critic Eric Wemple, there are people who are calling it cowardly, calling it unprincipled. Saying, hey, if they had just gone forward with their planned endorsement of Vice President Kamala Harris, no one would really have paid attention. Or, of course, if they had announced this non-endorsement strategy months ago, when Jeff Bezos first apparently expressed doubt about this, again, it would have been a story briefly, but nobody would have been talking about it. And they're talking about the timing here. Others are claiming that this op-ed is some sort of distraction tactic, a way to get us to talk about the journalism, state of journalism, and distract from other questions that, like that video showed about questions about potential business interests. But Jeff Bezos, in his op-ed, made the case that not endorsing contributes to perceptions of bias in the media, that the trust in the media by the public is at all times low, and that The Post, he says, is increasingly talking to just a group of certain elites. He says, what presidential endorsements actually do is create a perception of bias, a perception of non-independence. Ending them is a principled decision, and it's the right one. He did address the timing. He said this was inadequate planning, and he wished it had been made earlier. And I have reporting, because according to a meeting that the opinions editor held yesterday, Jeff Bezos first expressed skepticism about the endorsement back in September. And David Shipley, the opinions editor, spent those remaining weeks trying to convince him to move forward with the endorsement until last week, when Jeff Bezos blocked the endorsement. David Shipley told his staff, I failed. He said he failed in trying to convince him to continue with the tradition of endorsement. As a result, we now have three members of The Washington Post editorial board who have stepped down from the editorial board. That's nearly one-third of the 10-member board. Now, they're all keeping their jobs with The Washington Post, but they've stepped down as a form of protest to this decision. And as you noted, we are hearing, this is according to NPR, that something of upwards of 200,000 subscribers have canceled their subscription to The Washington Post after this announcement was made. The Washington Post has so far not commented on these numbers, but it is notable that they are not denying them -- guys.",

And he finally posted saying, for the record, the Harris campaign has not passed on doing the podcast. He said they offered a date for Tuesday, and I would have had to travel to see her, and they only wanted to do it an hour, and he felt the best way was to do it in Austin.I should note, though, that he says this is not necessarily means that they won't do one. His interview with former President Donald Trump has 35 million views on YouTube. It makes it Rogan's most watched episode of the year to date. That's according to YouTube, so it could be very valuable for the vice president to sit down with Joe Rogan -- guys.",

You know, this is really huge for travelers because we have all been there. Your flight gets canceled, but the airline gives you a travel credit or a voucher, not exactly what you want, but those days are officially over.This is known as the automatic refund provision, and the Department of Transportation says it fully went into effect yesterday, forcing airlines to give you your money back without you having to ask. Here are the conditions. Not only does this apply if your flight is canceled, it also applies to delays. Refunds are triggered automatically when a domestic flight is more than three hours late. You get a refund for an international flight if it's more than six hours late. There is one little catch here, though. This is the fine print. If an airline rebooks you on a different flight or offers you some other compensation, you must walk. You cannot double dip here. Now, Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg first announced this back in April. Airlines initially fought back against this, calling this much too complicated for them to implement, but now the industry's top lobby tells me it supports this. Even President Joe Biden posted about this on X. Who is that handsome reporter that he retweeted?",

That's when cancellations really begin to creep on up. But the good news is the problems that led to mass cancellations in 2021 and 2022 are now in the rearview and the cancellation rate for flights now down to about 1.6 percent of all flights this year. But never say never. You've got to remember the crowd strike outage caused Delta to cancel about 7,000 flights back in July. That affected about a million passengers.
