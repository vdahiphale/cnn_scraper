You can be charged for essentially the same conduct by the federal authorities and by local authorities. Some people may say it's unfair. And DOJ policy says we like to avoid that because we don't feel the need to pile on, but this is going to be Fani Willis' charge.Beyond the, sort of, technical aspect of it, there could be tension. First of all, trial dates, there's only so many trial dates to go around. We're now going to have four indictments.
