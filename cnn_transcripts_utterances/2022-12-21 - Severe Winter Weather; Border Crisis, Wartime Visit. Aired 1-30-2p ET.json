Winter weather alerts for snow and ice are in effect in more than 25 states and could affect more than 90 million people, 90 million. Wind chill alerts extend from the Canadian border all the way to the Gulf Coast. Meteorologist Derek Van Dam is in the CNN Weather Center and Lucy Kafanov is at a warming center in Denver, Colorado.Derek, let's start with you, because every state in the lower 48 is expecting below freezing weather at some point this week.",

The Denver Coliseum behind me is being converted into a 24-hour warming center for anyone that needs to get out of the cold, whether it's families or unhoused people.You have to also keep in mind, Ana, that we've had here in Colorado, and especially in Denver, a massive influx of migrants arriving in recent weeks, and so shelter capacity has been strained which is another reason why they're opening this Denver Coliseum. Some of those migrant families will be brought here to get out of the cold. My colleagues covered the temperatures here in Denver. You can see by how I'm dressed that we're not feeling the cold just yet, but in just a matter of hours, those temperatures are going to drop severely by as much as 30 to 40, to 50 degrees in a matter of an hour. The wind chills are going to be felt. We're already feeling that wind picking up. And so, this is -- I know you've lived here, Ana, I know that you know how quickly the weather can change here, but this is being described as a once in a generation storm. That cold is going to be incredibly dangerous.",

And here's the latest, the Biden administration wants the Supreme Court to allow a policy restricting migrants from entering the US to end, but not for at least another week. Title 42, originally, put in place because of COVID concerns, was set to end today but Chief Justice John Roberts hit pause.Thousands of migrants and border town officials are left asking, what now? CNN's Ed Lavandera is in El Paso where the mayor has already declared a state of emergency as food banks and shelters struggle to keep up with demand. Ed, what's happening there today?",

      "sentences": "Well, everything as you mentioned, kind of sits in limbo as we wait for the US Supreme Court to decide what to do with the fate of Title 42. And just to explain again what that is, this public health policy that was started under the Trump administration and essentially has been used to be able to quickly expel about 2.5 million migrants from the United States because of the COVID pandemic.So all of this kind of playing out, continuing to play out whereas where city and local officials say they're using the time to really prepare for the anticipated end of Title 42. The Biden administration has been predicting that anywhere from 9,000 to 14,000 migrants per day could be crossing the US southern border from South Texas to California. Here in El Paso, the city in the area has been dealing with its own surge ahead of the possible end of Title 42. And what we're being told now is that the number of migrants crossing has declined significantly. It was about 2500 per day. We're told that now, according to DHS figures, that it's about 1,500 per day. And just moments ago, you can see the border wall behind me was able to walk out there and see the area where migrants are still lining up to enter the United States and turn themselves into border patrol agents. There are several hundred people out there still lined up this morning as well. And this was kind of playing out not too far from where the Texas governor had dispatched Texas National Guard soldiers to set up a long fence of razor wire. The migrants simply just moved to another area to turn themselves into border officials. But the mayor here in El Paso says that all of this needs to be solved, that the way things are being dealt with right now and handling the surge is not sustainable. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) OSCAR LEESER (D), EL PASO, TEXAS MAYOR: I want to talk to the DPS. I want to talk to find out why they feel they need to have it in for any length of time. It's very important that we continue to work together but also this is not sustainable. They give us the resources, continue to give us the resources, but this is not long term sustainable.

When you talk about people lining up, ready to turn themselves in to border officials, are they lining up in a place where they would be turning themselves in through the traditional ports of entry? Or are they just trying to surrender themselves anywhere along the border still?",

      "sentences": "Right. Let's be clear, because of Title 42 you are not able to come through a traditional port of entry and request asylum that has essentially been shut down. That is why you're seeing so many migrants between the ports of entry. The area that we're talking about was just underneath one of the bridges crossing connecting Juarez to El Paso.This is technically still an illegal entry, but the migrants are literally lining up at the door of one of the border wall there, waiting to turn themselves into border patrol agents. And they take small groups at a time and begin the processing. So that does not mean that these people get to stay. The Department of Homeland Security says here in the El Paso Area alone, over the course of the last week, about 3,400 migrants were quickly expelled under that Title 42 rule.",

It's simply because the Senate has not essentially gotten a deal to get to a final vote on the spending bill to keep the government open. They were hoping to get to that final vote and get out of town and avoid this monster storm that is coming. But instead, they're going to be stuck here waiting for those votes to happen. So as a result, those seats eventually will be filled.Now, this comes at a critical moment where Republicans in particular are divided over how to spend more money and whether to spend more money for Ukraine. Senators like Lindsey Graham say that is essential here, and others are pushing back. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN.

Let's start what's happening right now.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is on his way to the White House. This is his first trip out of Ukraine since Russia began its invasion in February. Now, as he arrived in the US, Zelenskyy posted that he was in Washington to thank the American people for their much needed support. He accepted an invitation from President Biden just a week ago. And since then, the US has worked with Ukraine on some really tight security arrangements for this short trip. The visit will last just a few hours, and after the White House meeting, Zelenskyy will then address a joint meeting of Congress. Joining us now is CNN's chief White House correspondent Phil Mattingly and senior international correspondent Will Ripley, who is in Kyiv. Phil, let's start with you. The administration just announced a new $1.8 billion aid package for Ukraine. Tell us about the timing of the trip and what they'll discuss today.",
