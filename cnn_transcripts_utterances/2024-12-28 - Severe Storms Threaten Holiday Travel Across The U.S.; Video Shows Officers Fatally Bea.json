What happened when it was obviously hit or it appears to be hit, and then what did Russia do after the plane was probably hit? Did it force it out across, you know, the water to another location?

It's about a 270 mile or so distance from Grozny to Kazakhstan, where the plane ended up crashing.And that was a significant distance for an aircraft that has been basically damaged by, you know, some external force that is a considerable distance for it to travel and to travel so far without falling out of the sky.",

Now, that ban is slated to take effect on January 19th, just one day before Donald Trump is slated to be sworn in to office. Now, the thing that is currently before the Supreme Court and what justices are currently weighing is whether or not this ban violates First Amendment rights.
