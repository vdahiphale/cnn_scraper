Now they, in addition, note that the suspects fled in a red vehicle, and there is a regional lookout that has been issued.

A hospital official tells CNN that all operating rooms are out of service, and that with oxygen levels running low, no neonatal units are now working. They've all been shut down. The Israel Defense Forces say it attempted to deliver fuel to the hospital overnight. You can see this video of them delivering the fuel, they say. Israel also says that Hamas terrorists are using the hospital to hide a terror tunnel complex underneath. The hospital director says the staff there were too afraid to leave to retrieve this fuel that you're seeing the IDF put down right now. There is other video, this obtained by Reuters, which shows this. It shows babies taken out of incubators, placed into beds. Doctors say the only way to keep the infants warm and alive is to wrap them in foil and place them next to bowls of hot water. For its part, Israel says now the 239 people are still being held hostage inside Gaza, including a three-year-old American citizen. The White House says the toddler was taken on October 7th after his parents were killed by Hamas. CNN's Nada Bashir is in Jerusalem with the very latest. Nada.",

And the babies aren't on life support anymore. Their life support stopped because the electricity stopped. And -- the reason the things the babies need to survive is, indeed, warmth, because they're premature, they can't regulate their own body temperatures, but they also need oxygen because their lungs are immature. They don't breathe normally like a normal baby does.So, there is so little time, and so much need. And it -- we want to make it clear to the world, hospitals should be safe havens, but they're being transformed in Gaza into scenes of death, devastation, and despair.",

There had been talk of much bigger amounts being provided. What we need is the end of the blockade all together.

So, any of these other things, ultimately once the hostilities stop, it will be useful to have a surge in of aid and assistance. But the only thing that's going to save the people in the hospitals right now is the end of the hostilities, a cease-fire.Now, this is a man-made crisis. This is not an earthquake.

And they're defending against allegations that they made fraudulent financial statements by inflating the value of assets. These are the properties that they own. And then giving those financial statements to banks and insurers to get better rates and terms.So, he'll be the first one up. He already testified for the state. And the difference here is that as a defense witness they will be able to shape the narrative. They will be able to ask him the questions that they want, and he will have a lot more leeway in the answers that he gives. Now, he had previously testified that he had nothing to do with the financial statements. He was not involved in their preparation. And then he said he signed off on them only after he was consulting with accountants and lawyers, so distancing himself from them. But they -- today he will have more of an opportunity to lay out the defense, which is that they didn't intend to defraud anyone and that the banks were not victims, that they were not harmed in this, and that many of them continued to do business with them. So, he'll be the first of the witnesses. His testimony is expected to go all day. It could carry over into tomorrow because the state will have a chance to cross-examine him as well. And then Trump's team is expected to call a number of expert witnesses. These are people who will testify about how the real estate industry works, valuing properties. And then they eventually will call some banks. We expect their defense to continue for several weeks. Kate.",

This is the same Donald Trump Jr. who testified a couple weeks ago. The difference, as Kara said, is, now he's being called by his own lawyers, by his own defense team. So, they will have broader latitude to question him. And I think that quote sort of isolates what one of the key defenses will be, and has been, which is, look, I'm running this organization at a very high level, as executive vice president, and I'm relying on our accountants to do what accountants do.But here's the problem with that defense, the weakness with that defense is, is the defendants in this civil case are the Trumps individually, but also the whole organization.
