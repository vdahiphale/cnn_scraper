We were at the protest last night and there was so much energy. It was anguish, it was heartbreak, it was frustration and anger, anger at the government, anger at the prime minister for not adjusting and toning down, if you will, his -- the deal he was trying to negotiate with Hamas. And that anger really played out late into the night, but walking on the streets today and being in the square with a lot of other people listening to some ladies singing, just sort of a vigil, a man playing more full songs on a grand piano position there in the square, just overlooking the six wreaths that were placed in the square yesterday for the -- for the six who died and in the middle of the wreath it says, sorry. What you just heard from Hersh's mother really encapsulates that the feeling on the street here today, the protests are not there in the numbers, that they're there in spirit. But it feels like today, the energy of yesterday is dissipated a bit, souls are beaten. And I think as well, when you look at the fact that it's Itamar Ben-Gvir, the sort of right way member of Prime Minister Netanyahu's cabinet appealed into the Tel Aviv courts to get an overturn of the union's decision to go on a national strike, that the fact that that was overturned this afternoon kind of sets the mood. I think everyone's really wondering, OK, we know what we want to do. We know we want to get the prime minister to change his mind, but how do we -- how do we do that? And the street protests are clearly going to be one of the ways to do it. And undoubtedly when the prime minister speaks, he'll be -- he'll be trying to resend the message that he sent yesterday that none of this was his fault. It was all Hamas' fault. It just doesn't cut on the streets here in Tel Aviv, pretty much. I have to say.",

Nic Robertson, thank you. Let's get the perspective now from Washington, Kylie Atwood at the U.S. State Department. Short comments from President Biden, but notable, given that in the past, he has been reluctant to criticize Prime Minister Netanyahu publicly, at least, is his part in not moving this deal forward, putting the onus and pressure on Hamas.

Three of those murdered hostages were expected to have been on that first phase of that deal to have been released home, as you know,101 hostages remain in Gaza, seven of them are American, four of them now believe to still be alive following the murder of Hersh Goldberg-Polin. Kylie Atwood, thank you. And I'm joined now by Moshe Lavi, the brother-in-law of Omri Miran, who was taken captive during the Hamas attack from his kibbutz on October 7th. Moshe Lavi is a former captain in the Israeli Defense Forces, joins me now live from New York. Moshi, welcome back to the program. Again, I wish it wasn't under these circumstances. I know that you have been speaking over the weekend following news of the heinous murder of these six hostages, what looked like so close to a deal. And God knows what hell they've lived through now for 329 days before they were discovered. You say that everyone should be blamed for the fact that there isn't a deal now that your brother-in-law isn't home from the Israeli government, from Hamas, and even mediators, including the United States. Can you explain why you view that? MOSHE LAVI, BROTHER-IN-LAW OF HOSTAGE OMRI MIRAN: Yes. Thank you for having me on the show again. It's been a difficult few days for us to process the news as families of hostages coming together. I think so many mistakes were made by the different parties to the negotiations. And I'll elaborate. Hamas, of course, holds the prime blame here. It murdered and kidnapped Israeli citizens, Israeli residents and foreign tourists on October 7th, and holding them captive, and not allowing access to medicine or visitation, and executing them in cold blood. And so it's clear that Hamas is to be blamed. And it needs to be dismantled for the sake of Israelis and the Palestinians and the wider region. But I believe the international community failed here because it did not unite on October 8th in demanding clearly that Hamas needs to be dismantled, that the hostages should be returned. And the U.S. administration has well failed because it did not implement policies that could have pushed sponsors of Hamas to agree to a deal, to agree to release the hostages. Countries like Qatar were retaining their known NATO ally status, retaining the U.S. base that is there. Countries like Turkey remain being a NATO ally. Countries like Iran are now suffering the consequences of pushing proxies to attack Israel. But also, hold my elected officials responsible because it appears to be that there are other interests overriding bringing home the hostages. And they're not being honest with us that those interests override bringing home the hostages. What I demand Israeli leadership is to look in the eyes of the citizens, the majority of the Israeli public, according to all polls, and say, we are not prioritizing a deal right now to bring home the hostages. We have other objectives to be prioritized. So this is what I demand from them. And I demand from them as well to explain to the Israeli public that this current situation is not normal. It should not be normalized by the citizens. It's perhaps what happens as a result of a global problem, as a result of their failures, but it should not be normalized. And my sense is that the current government is normalizing the horrific situation in which our family members, our loved ones are held captive by Hamas.",

And they're not afraid of doing that because they understand that our social contract, our dear social contract is under threat and that politics will be overriding another line of interest such as the redemption of our captives. Second, there are just a lot of disagreements in our current coalition. And sadly, we have a culture of leaking meetings, including meetings between elected officials and families of hostages for political benefits. I wish that wasn't the case. But there are clear disagreements between the minister of defense and the prime minister. I think what was done last week was a great mistake passing that decision and the government self-sabotage the negotiations and now terminating that decision. Reversing it will only embolden Hamas. So Israel is now at a cross world when he made a terrible decision last week and now it can't reverse it because that will be even more terrible. And I think that the murder by Hamas, of the six hostages, made so many people upset, made people understand that they have to go to the streets and they have to showcase that the government cannot continue doing what it does, prioritizing other things over the redemption of our captives, which according to our tradition, the Jewish religion, according to Shulchan Aruch, when it's possible to expedite, we need to redeem the captives and not doing so is as if we shed one blood.

It will be their first time on the trail together since the democratic convention. Harris will also travel to Detroit for a campaign event. Both stops are designed to highlight her campaign's commitment to working class voters, especially in swing states. And Donald Trump does not have any Labor Day event plan, but he is again igniting controversy with comments about the last election.

      "sentences": "So throughout this period, since the departure of President Joe Biden from the race, Trump hasstruggled to gain traction in framing a case against the new democratic nominee, Kamala Harris. Lots of people around Trump have been asking him, I've spoken to a number, to just focus exclusively on the economy, on other issues which tie Harris to the Biden administration, for instance, high grocery prices. And to his critique that the world is spinning out of control and Biden and Harris can't do anything about it, but he appears absolutely determined to continue this personal series of attacks. What it looks like to me is the former president is trying to tear Harris down personally and politically and as a viable political figure. And in some ways, this makes sense because Trump has never in a battleground state or in the national vote in the national election got more than about 48 percent of the vote. If Kamala Harris is able to unite her coalition, win over independents and moderate voters in swing states, she can potentially get to 51 or 52 percent. So he needs to really bring down her ceiling because it's very hard to see at this point that anyone who's not already committed to vote for Donald Trump may be persuaded to do so. So that's potentially what might be going on inside Trump's own strategizing even as his campaign seems to want to do something completely different.",

Harris has spoken potentially about doing a second debate, but the wrangling over the terms of this one don't give you an awful lot of hope that it might happen. Trump needs to try to damage Harris to slow her momentum, coming out of the democratic coalition, and since she took over the Democratic ticket. I think it's an important moment for Harris to create the generational change. And I think what she would like, and this is why she wanted the microphones unmuted is she'd like a wild, unchain performance by Trump because that would play into her central concede of her campaign. And it's time to move on from such chaos and bitterness and divisiveness. And then Americans want something more forward looking and optimistic.
