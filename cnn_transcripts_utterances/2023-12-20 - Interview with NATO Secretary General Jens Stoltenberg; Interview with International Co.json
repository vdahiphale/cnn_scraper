I discuss with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg. Then, half of Gaza's population is starving. says the U.N.'s World Food Programme. We bring you a report on the grave situation and I'll ask the president of the International Committee of the Red Cross what needs to be done now to save civilian lives. Next, Adam Driver takes the wheel. My conversation with a Hollywood star about his new film, \"Ferrari.\" Plus, \"How to Know a Person.\" New York Times columnist David Brooks joins Walter Isaacson about tackling loneliness. Welcome to the program, everyone. I'm Christiane Amanpour in London. Ukraine shocked the world in 2022 when it fought off Russia's invasion, defying expectations of its imminent demise. And now, nearly two years later, Kyiv is still hanging on, but just barely. With world support slipping for this critical fight for democracy, one Ukrainian medic recently told CNN, without aid, we are finished. The U.S. Senate won't vote on that aid to Ukraine until 2024. Putin has boasted this month that Ukraine has nothing, and even the staunchest Ukraine supporters know that their summer counteroffensive failed to achieve its objectives. So, this is a decisive moment for the war as another dark winter looms, as NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg has worked tirelessly to get Ukraine what it needs. And he's joining me now from Oslo. So, Secretary General, welcome to the program at the end of this year. Did you expect that by the end of this year, things would be so dire, and maybe Putin will be proved right to have said that he can wait out the West?",

That didn't happen. The Ukrainians has been able to push back the Russian invaders in the north, in the east and in the south. But of course, now we see that the front lines have not changed in any significant way over the last year. And therefore, it's even more important that we, very clearly, continue to provide support to Ukraine because they need our support to be able to prevail as a sovereign independent nation in Europe.",

They used force against Moldova. They have forces in Moldova. They invaded Georgia. We see the brutality of the Russian forces in Syria. And then, they annexed Crimea in 2014. They went into Eastern Donbass in 2014. And then, if they then are able to take the rest of Ukraine, then of course, the lesson for them is that they can violate international law, they can use military force, they can invade neighbors and they get what they want. And that's a very dangerous lesson. There are other countries which -- in Europe, which have been under heavy pressure from Russia, Georgia, Moldova and others. So, we don't see any imminent threat against NATO allies, but it will become a more dangerous world and we will be more vulnerable. And it is also important to remember this is not only about Europe. South Korea and Japan are very concerned about this because they also know that Beijing is watching closely. And the more Putin is able to succeed in Ukraine, the more risky it will be for countries also in Asia for any potential use of military force from another authoritarian regime China.",

And that's also the reason why we increased our military presence in the eastern part of the alliance after the full-fledged invasion of Ukraine last year. Because we have two tasks. One is to support Ukraine, as we do, and the other is to prevent this war from escalating into full-fledged war between Russia and NATO, and that's the reason why we have increased our military presence. Then, of course, what happens in Asia matters for NATO. We see how China is violent against national law, how they behave in the South China Sea, how they're cracking down on fundamental rights, which are important for NATO in Hong Kong and also against their own minorities. And then, we see how China's coming closer to us in cyberspace in Africa, in Arctic, but also trying to control critical infrastructure in Europe. So, security is not regional. Security is global. What happens in Europe matters for Asia. What happens in Asia matters for Europe.

We can always discuss if it was possible to do even more from our side earlier in providing support to Ukraine. But what is clear is that United States and NATO allies have provided unprecedented support to Ukraine in the beginning with, yes, light weapons like the anti-tank weapons, the Javelins, and all the types of anti-tank weapons that made a huge difference the first weeks. Then with heavy artillery, then with advanced air defense systems. And now, also with cruise missiles, long range cruise missiles. And we have started the training of F-16 pilots, and F-16 planes will soon be delivered. So, this is the reason why actually the Ukrainians have achieved a lot, they have been able to liberate 50 percent of the territory that the Russians occupied at the beginning of the war.",

And yes, you are right that the front lines have not changed significantly over the last year, but Ukrainians have been able to inflict heavy losses on the Russian forces.

So -- but nowadays, people are being sent out of the hospital because there's no space, there's no functioning sewage system anymore. This will spread diseases enormously.

And so, I emerged not surprisingly as maybe the most -- not the most intimate person on the face of the earth, maybe the most -- not the most emotionally available. And so, I've been on a journey really over 15 years, and you've known me for a long time, Walter, to try to become a more -- a person better at recognizing my own emotions, recognizing other people's emotions, better intimacy and better connecting with people.

And so, to me, the art of conversation is really the art of being a human being. And so, you know, I learned, like most of us, I was not as good as I thought I was at being a good conversationalist, at taking a mediocre conversation and turning it into a memorable conversation. And one of the things I focused on -- in the book and in life is just asking really good questions. Most find -- I sometimes go to a party and I leave and I think, you know, that whole time nobody asked me a question. And I found that only about 30 or 40 percent of humanity are question askers. So, after I get to know somebody, I try to ask them big questions, and these are questions like, if this next five years is a chapter in your life, what would the chapter be about? Or what would you do if you weren't afraid? What role does fear play in your life? If we met a year from now, what would we be celebrating? And these are questions that really, you know, people don't have easy answers to these questions, that they have to think about it.

And social media has just been -- had this corroding effect on our ability to have relationships. And part of the problem is that in social media, there's judgment everywhere and understanding nowhere. People are performing themselves, but they're not really vulnerable with each other. They're not really having the kind of communication that human beings require. And so, part of the book is just like an antidote to an age of shallow performative relationships and to get us back to having, like, real conversations, to talk to people who are depressed, to talk to people who are suffering from grief, how to talk to people across difference.

There's something unique about the culture of social media as it interacts with a bunch of other causes. Some of them are, like you said, Robert Putnam, we're just less active in civic life. Some of it is we have a very individualistic culture, which makes -- it gives us a lot of personal freedom, but makes us pretty bad at social convention. But the piece of the story I sort of focus on is skills. To get to know another person, to cure loneliness, you've got to be open hearted, and that's part of it, but it's not enough. You've got to be able to practice certain practical social skills. Some of it, like we've been talking about, having -- being great at conversation. Some of it is like, how do you critique somebody in your workplace with care so they feel supported while you're critiquing them? How do you break up with someone without crushing their heart? How do you host a dinner party so everybody feels included? You know, I saw a study just a couple weeks ago, the number of young men who've never asked anybody out on a date is super high these days. And why? It's because they stink at flirting, and they don't know how to ask people out. And so, it's a basic loss of social skills that we somehow have failed to teach succeeding generations.",

And a conversation in which people are storytelling. They're telling a narrative. You even mentioned our mutual friend Michael Lewis, and you said, why is he so popular?

And it sounds like I'm trying to relate to you, but really what I'm doing is trying to say, let's stop talking about you. Let's start talking about me and my superior experiences. And so, one conversational rule is don't be a topper. But then, on the plus side, as you said, it's -- just make it storytelling conversations. So, even in politics, when I'm interviewing people for my job, I no longer ask them, what do you believe? I ask them, how did you come to believe that?

And to me, empathy is three things. We think of it as just like a gush of emotion, but empathy is three separate skills. The first is the skill of mirroring. If I want to catch the emotion you're feeling, and that's just like instinctive. You're angry, I feel that. You're sad, I feel that. So, I'm mirroring. The second is mentalizing. And that's where I use my cognitive abilities to imagine what you're going through. So, if it's your first day on the job, well, I've been on first day on a job. I know the mix of emotions that happen on that. You're excited to be there. You're anxious. You're not going to live up. You're meeting all these new people. And so, I can mentalize what you're going through. And then the third is caring. So, con artists are really good at understanding what other people are thinking, but they don't care. And so, we don't say they're empathetic. So, you've got to be effectively caring. And effective care is doing the thing the other person needs, not the thing you feel most comfortable with. And so, I read about a case by a guy named Rabbi Irwin Kukla (ph), and he had a woman in his congregation that had suffered a brain injury, and sometimes she fell to the floor. She just fell. And she's told Kukla (ph), you know, when people see me fall to the floor, they rush to pick me up because they're so uncomfortable seeing an adult lying on the ground. But what I really need at that moment is for somebody to just get down on the ground with me. And I think that's like the definition of empathy. Some -- just the ability to get down on the ground metaphorically or literally with another human being and offer them what they need at a time of stress.",

And so, we've living with this time of where it's -- we're under assault, where there's violence, where there's rhetorical violence, where there's canceling. And my view is the only really effective and practical response to that kind of climate is a kind of defiant humanism, that is saying, the world around me is brutal, but I'm still going to leave with curiosity. I'm going to still lead with trust. I'm going to leave with vulnerability. And sometimes, I'll be betrayed, but I'm still going to lead with trust because I think most of the time if I lead with trust, the person I'm encountering will lead with trust. And if I lead with curiosity, most of the time, we're going to get to know each other. We're going to have a good relationship. And so, in a brutalizing age, it's important to know how to have conversations across difference, across racial difference, ethnic difference, political difference. And one of the tips I've learned when people come to me with critique, because they disagree with me from the left or the right, is -- my first instinct is get all defensive. But I think what I really want to do in those circumstances is try to stand in their standpoint. It's to ask them three or four or five times, tell me more about what you think. How did you come to believe that? Tell me more. What am I missing here? And if I ask them three or four questions about their point of view, I may not agree with them, or I may not persuade them, but at least I'm showing them respect. And in any conversation, respect is like air. When it's present, nobody notices, but when it's absent, it's all anybody can think about. So, when we're having conversations across difference, we have to ask them again and again, what am I missing here? We have to show respect those type of conversations.",

And so, to me, democracy is elementally about the kind of social skills that I'm talking about here. And the other thing about the book, and as you mentioned Benjamin Franklin, I think we've both been affected by Franklin, you know, the idea of self- improvement is such an American emphasis that we're just going to get better and better.
