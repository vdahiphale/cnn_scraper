I want to give viewers an idea of what it's like for the folks in the fire department when this hurricane is coming through.

And $1,650 million for a migrant shelter program to be administered by FEMA and then more than $35 billion this year to FEMA for disaster relief. There's no basis for these claims.

Now, I've been talking to sources about this. This is unlike anything that they have seen before. And from my coverage of hurricanes, the Department of Homeland Security, it has also been striking to see just how much information has been out there, false information that people are gravitating toward. In fact, Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg spoke with Elon Musk about something that he had posted on his platform, X, about recovery and rescue efforts. And I am told that the president had asked his team this week to put together a memorandum on the digital response and how they we're remediating misinformation. So in the White House, this has become a growing concern. And this storm is only exacerbating -- this storm being Milton -- those concerns because seeing what they've seen already, seeing that the FEMA personnel in North Carolina are getting threats by people because of this false information, they are trying to get ahead of it as best they can. I had one source told me, look, unfortunately, we have a playbook now that they had to pull together over the last week to put into play now with Milton to make sure that the information, the right information is getting to these survivors and people who are currently evacuating in Florida. BASH: I mean, Bri, think about this. That, you know, we have been talking about misinformation, disinformation for years. And it has largely been through the prism of politics. This is life -- life or death. And it's stunning to me that it is happening in -- with the magnitude that it is. And you guys played the sound byte from Iran, DeSantis, as, I think, you said, certainly no fan politically of Joe Biden or Kamala Harris, echoing what they said about the danger of people believing things, like Boris was told by somebody there in the storm, about that this is sort of a manufactured weather system by who knows who.",
