Today we are standing by for the, we'll call it the second most important speaker of the week to take the stage behind us. Donald Trump tomorrow will be speaking. Tonight, his vice presidential pick, J.D. Vance steps into the spotlight with what is likely the biggest speech of his political career so far. Its V.P. night here at the convention, and so Vance is now just hours away from his first and first for some, and reintroduction to some Republicans and Democratic voters alike, speaking to the Republican hopefuls -- faithfuls that are in the hall, but also it could be, he could be setting the tone and the stage for his future face-to-face with the current Vice President Kamala Harris. CNN's Alayna Treene leads us off this hour. She's joining us now. Alayna, you have new reporting just today about what he plans to say, what he wants to convey in this big speech.

And I don't think anyone would question that he really has had an incredible journey. He went from someone who grew up in a very poor rustbelt town in Ohio. He had a pretty unstable childhood. His family struggled with opioid addiction.But he went on to become a Marine, to go to Yale Law School, to work in venture capitalism, be successful businessman. He was a bestselling author. And then of course he went into the Senate, and only after a year-and-a-half in the Senate, he has now how been picked as Donald Trump's running mate. So it is a pretty remarkable journey. And again, he's only 39-years-old, so he's still fairly young now. I also think what's important to keep an eye out for, Kate, is the undercurrents that have been percolating within the Republican Party. J.D. Vance is really seen as someone who could be a torchbearer of the MAGA movement. And I'm told when I've talked to Donald Trump's campaign, they've said that that's actually something that has been important to the former president. He wanted to pick somebody who he thought could carry on the movement that he has started and really keep discussing the political agenda, the America first agenda that Donald Trump has really drilled into all Republicans minds, even beyond the end of Donald Trump's own political career.",

There are several former members of Donald Trump's administration who still have bodyguards to this day because of Iranian death threats.I am concerned, again, about the lapse in security planning on Saturday and that if what we saw Saturday was the enhanced security detail that President Trump had because of the Iranian threat, the senior leadership at the Secret Service really has a lot of explaining to do and we need to understand why that lapse happened.

What you have is a court that follows the law and applies the law to the facts.Justice Scalia, one of the great justice of all time, famously said, if you don't sometimes disagree with your result as a judge, you're not judging right. And I think most of the justices on this court would in fact disagree as a personal matter with the opinions they reach, but they reach them because that's the right decision on the law and on the facts.

So that's one in piece of this. The other piece is, they are deeply concerned about retaliatory attacks in response to this, that those on the extreme right wing extremist groups might -- and some of them, frankly, who are buying some of the worst conspiracy theories floating around out there that perhaps this was an inside job, right? That they might then target Security Services or even those tied to President Biden in part because of those conspiracy theories in retaliation for this attack. They're talking about lone actors, hoax bomb threats, swatting, attempts to attack election related infrastructures, you see there, and leaking of official's personal information. And what strikes me, Sara, looking at this warning here, is that all of those things there are things that have happened, right? Extremist groups have used these methods to go after election workers, to go after, you may remember there was an armed attack on an FBI office, right, in the past.
