So you have a little bit more information on this meeting with the McCarthy holdouts. What are you learning? LAUREN FOX, CNN CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, we expect that this meeting is going to be really important because it is a key sign of whether or not these lawmakers are going to get behind Kevin McCarthy today, tomorrow, the next day, next week. And I think one of the things we're going to be looking for is if these concessions are really making a difference. The most important one that you pointed out, of course, lowering the threshold of how many members it would take to force a vote to oust a sitting speaker, just from five members, now down to one. The other concession that Kevin McCarthy made that will fundamentally really change the way that the House could function is he promised to put more members of the Freedom Caucus, some of those hardliners, on the influential Rules Committee. That committee sets the agenda for which bills come to the floor, how those bills are structured on the floor, how many votes they take, what the amendment process looks like. It's a very important functioning committee. And it's usually just an extension of the speaker's office, most of the time his key allies sitting on that committee. So another important concession. I'll tell you, this morning, one moderate that I spoke to had a lot of concerns about how far McCarthy is going here and the influence it would have on their ability to govern going forward.

He said, I will not budge on the motion to vacate. I will not given into that. It will make me an ineffective, weak speaker. And, you know, that was his red line. And he refused to give this to the conservatives. Something that they -- their number one demand. And now he seems to be giving in to it so that he can get the votes that he needs to get to 218 even though it doesn't even guarantee that. But this is a huge question. And not just that concession but also allowing these members to sit on the rules committee, to pick who sits on the rules committee, bringing spending bills to the floor with kind of an open rule so members can bring up any amendment that they want. All kinds of concessions that are being offered behind the scenes right now.

That's when we are hoping to learn when and if Bryan Kohberger will be in court today. But he is here at the county jail, which is in the same building as the courthouse. It's a small facility here. And he was booked last night on four counts of murder and one count of burglary. And that is after a very long flight from Pennsylvania with multiple stops. He finally landed just across the state line in Washington at the Pullman Regional Airport. And he was quickly whisked away. But before that we did see -- you could see it on camera, police putting a helmet and a vest on him when they were making that handoff, when Pennsylvania State Police handed him off to the local authorities just before they took him away in that car. The entire time, the police has told us, they were keeping the details about his transport very tight due to security reasons. And you can see that extra layer of security that they added on him. Now, the reason that he was in Pennsylvania is because he took a cross-country trip with his father in that white Hyundai Elantra that police have been looking for. That was earlier in December.
