Police say at least five people are now dead, two are injured after a heavily-armed gunman wearing a bulletproof vest opened fire on the city streets.

When officers arrived, they found multiple gunshot victims, but then they also heard more gunshots.

But certainly, it is somewhat ironic that Russia, a country that has launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine since February of last year, is complaining about a few drones over Moscow. Now, according to the information we have, there were five drones in the Moscow -- Moscow metropolitan area. Four of them were brought down by air defenses, one by electronic warfare means. Now, as a result of these drones, which didn't cause any damage or injury to people, the -- 14 flights at one of the four airports in Moscow were diverted. That, according to the TASS news agency. And of course it's important to keep in mind, this isn't the first time that drones of unknown origin have been sighted over Moscow. In May, there was an incident where, in fact, one drone, the Kremlin claimed, exploded over the Kremlin itself.

There have been regular drone attacks on -- across the border in areas in Southern Russia. And therefore, this is really, more than anything, part of a psychological warfare effort against the Russians that goes back quite some time.

Nothing is the same as it was.\"I want to now bring in retired U.S. Army Major Mike Lyons and Bloomberg editor and foreign affairs columnist Bobby Ghosh. Bobby, I want to start with you, because when you look at the dynamics right now, you have the political situation in Israel. You obviously have the long-running tensions, some escalation in the West Bank that has been kind of evolving and progressing other the course of the last several months without question. But you also have significant weakness in the Palestinian Authority and the leadership. How does this -- I'm not saying end. I'm saying how does this calm down? This feels like it's just moving towards another major, major blow-up. BOBBY GHOSH, EDITOR/FOREIGN AFFAIRS COLUMNIST, BLOOMBERG: It does feel like the new reality in the West Bank. We've been, unfortunately, used to seeing these kinds of images from Gaza, but West Bank relative to Gaza was -- was stable. The Palestinian Authority, as you say, its leadership has been weakening. Its ability to control the street has been -- has been diminishing. Now those images from Jenin are very familiar to me. Twenty years ago, the last time Israel mounted such a major operation within the West Bank, I was there in that camp, covering that -- the battle of Jenin. The big difference now is that the Palestinians know that they're completely isolated in the world. Even their fellow Arabs in other states are making separate deals with the Israelis. Not a lot of sympathy there for them. And Iran is taking advantage of this vacuum and making in-roads into the West Bank through Islamic Jihad, just as they have done in Hamas for many, many years. That's a potential game changer. And of course, on the Israeli side, you have an extreme radical right- wing government that wants to take more West Bank territory. That only adds up to one thing: more and more and more of these clashes. I fear that unless one of these things change -- there's a different attitude from the Israeli government. There's better political authority from the Palestinian Authority and something done to push Iranian influence out of the West Bank -- I fear that we're going to see more and more military actions. We're going to see more and more sort of terrorist attacks from Palestinian groups. This is the new reality in the West Bank.",
