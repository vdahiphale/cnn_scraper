This breaking overnight, police say the murderer who escaped from a Pennsylvania prison nearly two weeks ago now is armed and still on the move. Officers swarmed an intersection about 25 miles from the prison late last night after a confirmed sighting and sent out this social media post just before 2 a.m. \"He is armed.

Danny, another overnight of major developments. What's the latest? DANNY FREEMAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, Phil, Poppy, frankly, this was the update that many feared for so many days, Danelo Cavalcante now armed but still on the loose. And I've got to tell you, we're along Pottstown Pike right now, at a staging area that police have set up. A lot of activity this morning. We just saw an armored vehicle with a lot of law enforcement officers in camouflage racing into this area. This is just indicative of what we've been seeing all throughout the night. But I really want to explain to you how we got to this moment, because it is important. And I want to tell you what we do definitively know at this time. Remember, yesterday was actually a pretty quiet day in the search. Law enforcement officials, they were focusing on this area about 20 miles North of the prison called East Nantmeal Township. It's a pretty small little community, still in Chester County, but importantly, it is the community where Cavalcante ditched that stolen dairy van over the weekend. So that was why police was focusing on that area. But it was pretty low key for most of the day until last night. And we saw a flurry of increased police activity. We saw police vehicles flying down this road, Pottstown Pike. Helicopters were in the air, and then a few things happened. First, Chester County alerted that there had been a shooting in East Nantmeal at around 10:10 p.m. in the area of Country -- Coventryville Road -- excuse me -- and Ridge Road. Then police confirmed to CNN at 10:24 last night there was a confirmed sighting of Cavalcante. Then that reverse 911 call went out to the South Coventry Township community, just about 3.5 miles up this road right here, to lock doors and to lock your windows, because Cavalcante may be in the area, and he is possibly armed. Then around 1:45 this morning, Pennsylvania State Police confirming Cavalcante is armed at this point. Urging residents in this area to take precaution. Now, there is a new perimeter, as we understand. Like I said, it's about three miles North of this staging area where all of the media is set up right here. The search area also, importantly, is just 4.5 miles or so North of where that dairy van was ditched. So Cavalcante still in Chester County, according to police, still in this general area. And we're working to confirm a little bit more details about what exactly happened last night when it comes to the shooting. What kind of weapon Cavalcante has. But again, day 13 of this manhunt, a lot of developments overnight -- Poppy, Phil.",

Right now, Kim Jong-un is on the move inside of Russia, but it's a big mystery where the North Korean dictator's armored train is heading and where he will eventually meet with Vladimir Putin.Overnight his train was spotted crossing the Russian border. There are new indications this morning that Kim and Putin could potentially meet at Cosmodrome, where Russia launches space rockets. It's hundreds of miles North of a city you've been hearing a lot about in recent days. That is Vladivostok. That's where they were expected to meet. U.S. officials have been sounding the alarm about this meeting.

But we know that his armored train does not move quickly. So he's heading North. And we understand from TASS state-run media, they actually asked the Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, where are they going to meet? And he said to that, at this point we're not saying, in the far East. Also saying that it would be in the next few days. So still, the location and the timing is not being clarified by either side at this point. But what we do know is that there will be a military feel to this meeting.

Meanwhile, in the Georgia election interference case, Trump is making his first attempt at getting the charges dismissed entirely, in a motion that adopts ones made by his fellow co-defendants facing RICO charges. Trump's lawyers echoed that the indictment has defects and that the state failed to meet the racketeering statute. I want to turn straight to CNN's Katelyn Polantz, who joins us now.

They want Judge Chutkan to look at whether Judge Chutkan believes Judge Chutkan can hear this case.So she's going to have to be determining it for herself, something that she already likely already was thinking about as a judge, as most judges do when they look at this. And so, as a legal filing, it does have to be looked at by the judge. And she does appear to want to come to some sort of decision on this pretty quickly. She's asking for the Justice Department to weigh in, in the coming days, and then Trump to say what he wants to say again. And then we would expect to get a decision on this pretty quickly. But as a legal filing, these things rarely succeed. There are standards here about when a judge can recuse themselves. And so, it's not something that happens very typically in a case. In this sort of circumstance, it is possibly a legal filing Trump's team wants to make, because they believe they need to do this now so that they can set up -- themselves up for appeals further down the road. But they also may be wanting to make this as a public statement, saying that, you know, Judge Chutkan could be hurting this trial or the public's confidence in this trial by her statements. And they're flagging in this filing one of the things she said at a sentencing of a January 6th rioter, an Ohio teacher, who was quite remorseful and who had argued -- the teacher had argued that she was wrapped up in emotions that were brought on by Trump. And when Judge Chutkan sentenced this woman, she said, \"The people who mobbed that Capitol were there in fealty, in loyalty, to one man, not to the Constitution. It's a blind loyalty to one person who, by the way, remains free to that day.\" The Trump team is clearly unhappy that she had said that on the record.

And when we spoke to people at that village, they told us that they had spent the first few days digging with their bare hands, that the rescue teams had only just arrived yesterday. And of course, hope is dwindling fast. We've spoken to survivors waiting for news of their loved ones. They've told us that they have lost all hope that they have survived this earthquake. Take a listen to what other eyewitnesses and survivors have had to say. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MOUHAMED AITLKYD, SURVIVOR (through translator): The government didn't come. We didn't see anyone. After the earthquake, they came to count the number of victims. Since then, not a single one of them is left. No civil protection, no assistance force. No one is here with us. KHADIJA AITLKYD, SURVIVOR (through translator): We feel completely abandoned here. No one has come to help us. Our houses have collapsed, and we have nowhere to go. Where are all these poor people going to live? (END VIDEO CLIP)",

But what we have seen now is that request for international aid. We've seen support coming in from the likes of Spain, the United Kingdom, Britain, Qatar, some of Morocco's, it has to be said, allies, in that sense. So that might be a key factor, a key consideration there. And that has to be a clear sense of frustration amongst those who have survived. They've told us that they haven't seen those rescuers on the ground and are questioning why it has taken so long to get that support.",
