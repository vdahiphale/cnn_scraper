      "sentences": "There are concerns over the company's decision to make cuts to the team tackling election misinformation.A crucial high stakes summit that could help shape the future of NATO is underway in Lithuania and already it's off to a productive and seemingly unified start. After resisting for months, Turkey has agreed to back Sweden's bid to join the Alliance, but it's Ukraine's path to membership that will likely dominate the two-day agenda. Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said he's confident NATO will send a positive and strong message to Kyiv. But in a robust and fiery tweet a short time ago, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy slammed Western allies for not setting a timeline for his country to join. CNN's Melissa Bell joins us all now live from Vilnius in Lithuania. Melissa, has Zelenskyy strongly worded statement, which includes the fact that he doesn't think there's a readiness to invite Ukraine to NATO, nor make it a member of the alliance? Has that shifted the mood or the will at all there?",

It was moments after President Zelenskyy had tweeted that fairly blistering attack on the fact that the wording of the statement was being agreed even before he arrived.He's now on his way here to Vilnius. But it was just moments after that that President Biden stood by the Secretary General of NATO proclaiming that he was confident that NATO allies were going to be able to agree on that wording that has been so difficult to find. And I think one shouldn't has underestimate the divisions that have existed thus far. Not only on the question, of course, as you mentioned, of Sweden's succession now result after some very last minute haggling that took us to the very eve of the summit, but also the divisions over the question of when and how Ukraine should join. The fact that these NATO allies that posed for that family photo just ahead of a meeting that's now ongoing of what is now the NATO council with the leaders of the 31 NATO countries, plus Sweden since it hasn't formally joined for the time being, that is not a simple matter getting to a point where that wording, which goes pretty far in the direction of what the Baltic states, Jens Stoltenberg, those who were on the side of getting a strong signal to Ukraine could have hoped for. And despite the objections and reticence of Washington and Berlin on this question, it was already a lot. Essentially, what we expect the wording to be at this stage is to announce not just things like the preparedness of Ukrainian forces, the interoperability to use the jargon, not just the fact of this first council that will take place tonight as we understand it with President Zelenskyy present the NATO Ukraine Council, the first of its kind, but more importantly, the setting aside of what's referred to as a map. A map that allows normally countries that want to exceed to NATO membership to go through all the phases of the reforms they're going to have to put together, and this can take years. The setting aside of that crucial phase, the membership accession plan for Ukraine, the third part of that deal is a huge step in Kyiv's direction. And yet, Bianca, you're quite right to point out that the words that came from President Zelenskyy as strident as they were warning, that any hesitation, any lack of clarity over Ukrainian accession was simply more motivation for Russia was fairly strident language. He says he's on his way here to discuss it openly, and yet the optics will still be of President Zelenskyy here in Vilnius for the first time with his -- the 32 eventually members of NATO alongside him. And that will be at the next big family photo that'll be organized for tomorrow, Bianca.",

Thank you very much.Ukraine isn't claiming outright responsibility for the death of a Russian submarine commander, but Kyiv appears to be providing details about how he was apparently killed. According to Russian media, the commander was shot dead in the southern city of Krasnodar by an unknown person. Early Tuesday, Ukrainian intelligence said it happened at 6:00 a.m. while the commander was jogging in a deserted park. CNN's Clare Sebastian joins me now to discuss this. Clare, there have been many deaths of prominent Russian figures from the military industrial and energy complex that we've seen often potentially attributed to the Russian state itself. This one seems different. What do we understand?",

      "sentences": "So both sides, essentially, the Ukrainian defense intelligence and Russian media, the Russian Investigative Committee, they agree that this happened, right? That this man died early on Monday, mourning in the Russian city of Krasnodar. We've got two very different tellings of the story there, right?The Ukrainian Defense Intelligence statement says he was a commander of a submarine in the Black Sea Fleet. They named the submarine as Krasnodar, incidentally, the same as the town in which he died. They say that, you know, these submarines are fitted with cruise missiles. We know that strikes from submarines in the Black Sea have been some of the deadliest in the war. So this could be, according to that report, someone who was involved in the war itself. They then go into great detail about how he died. They say it was at 6:00 a.m. They named the type of pistol that was used. They say he was shot seven times. They say that it was raining, and so the park was deserted so there were no witnesses. By contrast, the Russian telling of the story and the state media not only does not describe him as a commander of a submarine, and it says that he was a essentially a bureaucrat. He was the deputy head of the mobilization department in the -- for the city of Krasnodar. So at some point, perhaps, he transitioned out of military service into some kind of bureaucratic role. We don't know. In terms of accusations, we're hearing from Russian military bloggers blaming Ukrainian special services with this. We did get another interesting statement later in the day from Ukraine Strategic Communication for the Armed Forces saying somewhat cryptically that he -- this man had, had sort of realized that strikes on civilians were not effective. And so he was killed by his own men for that. So this is really murky at this stage, but I think what it does show the open killing of a Russian commander on Russian soil is that, you know, it underscores the uptick in violence, the sort of spillover effects of this conflict into Russia, and it could have repercussions.",

And Ukraine can expect these to be not routine, but to follow on that there's something here, a path for Ukraine, not to the membership that it's been -- that it's speaking about and that President Zelenskyy is angsting very publicly about. But in terms of keeping the military fight going, I think the reality for Ukraine becomes they can have a better sense of how they're going to fight the fight because they're getting all the equipment they want. And that's messaging for Russia too. And I think this allows Ukraine to look forward to the next year of battle because the battlefield isn't going as fast now. Now they'll be able to plan perhaps and say, OK, we'll get so far this year and we'll have to do more next year, and I think that's perhaps going to be the narrative that emerges over the next few months.",

The trains other 20 or so carriages, some updated as recently as last year, have remained a closely guarded secret until now. Zircon Service is a Russian company that builds what it calls elite wagons for its clients, specializing in luxury designs for private and state corporations, and of course, the Kremlin. Among a trove of documents, including blueprints, letters and images, obtained exclusively by the Russian investigative Dossier Center and shared with CNN. This one from Zircon Service, dated August 2018 notifying the Kremlin of a test run for what it calls the sports health wagon that's been ordered. Accompanying photos show what the Dossier Center says is Putin's private gym onboard the train. As recently as last year, the Kremlin was looking to upgrade the gym with American equipment to replace the Italian machines originally installed. A former member of Putin's personal protection service, who says he fitted the train's secure communications equipment before defecting from Russia told the Dossier Center, the Kremlin leader started traveling by train more regularly in the build up to the invasion of Ukraine last year. KARAKULOV (through translation): Planes can always be detected. While there are so many trains and there's no real way to track them. So, this way was just for secrecy so nobody knew his movements. CHANCE (voice over): But discretion for the Russian president doesn't mean discomfort. Leaked plans for the train also show a luxurious spa onboard, including a Turkish steam bath. And according to the Dossier Center, a fully equipped cosmetology suite with a massage table and high-end beauty equipment including a radio frequency machine used to enhance the tightness of human skin. (on-camera): Now the Kremlin disputes the Dossier Center's findings telling CNN that President Putin neither owns nor uses a railway car like the one described. But in the aftermath of a recent armed rebellion here in Russia, in which Putin's authority was threatened, the focus on his isolated existence is higher than ever. (voice over): And the idea of Putin being pampered as he travels incognito by armored train underlines how strangely cloistered the Kremlin leader has become, even paranoid and besieged according to his former speechwriter.

The White House's National Security Council Spokesman John Kirby just talked to CNN.

And we understand that it's pretty hard to work on some of those reforms when you're at war. And of course, they are at war right now. So NATO membership in the immediate future isn't likely because that would put NATO at war with Russia. Now, what the allies will do over the next couple of days is talk about a pathway to get Ukraine there eventually and what that pathway needs to look like. And part of that path, Phil, will be making sure that the allies stay united on two things. One, supporting Ukraine in the fight they're in so that they can succeed in this war against Russia. And two, that we look at their long term self defense needs. What kind of security commitments are they going to need from the United States and from allies and partners as they work towards that path towards NATO membership?

So that's the clear message. And what they mean by that is not joining NATO immediately. No one's talking about that. They talk about a political invitation to NATO which would be implemented when the conditions are right i.e. after the war, that's number one. And number two security commitments.

But the Biden administration has been examining every single weapon system, kind of weapon for weeks if not months for fear of escalation. Jake Sullivan once again a few days ago talked about the danger of a Third World War. And so there is an extreme caution from the Biden administration which I think is counterproductive and certainly the Ukrainians see it that way. Plus the fact that it's quite clear that the Biden administration is thinking that they want to get Ukraine to the point of negotiating. And it's almost as if NATO membership and Israel style security commitments are going to be a reward for Ukraine beginning a negotiation in which it might have to give up some of its territory so -- which I think is a very problematic position for the United States to take.

That would tie him with the legend Roger Federer for most all time at the All England club. In the other men's matchup, you have Italian eight seed Jannik Sinner. He's in the Wimbledon quarterfinals for a second straight year, and he's going to face off against 25 year old first timer at Wimbledon, Roman Safiullin of Russia. Now on the women's side, the number one ranked player in the world, 22-year-old from Poland, Iga Swiatek, she is facing Elina Svitolina right now of Ukraine. Swiatek is a four-time grand slam champ, but she had never made it past the fourth round at Wimbledon. She's seemingly struggled with grass in the past, but now she is mowing through the grass and her opponents as she carries a record wins this year. Not record. She's leading with 42 wins this season on tour. Now, the 28-year-old Ukrainian Elina Svitolina, she's playing for something much bigger than herself. After her last win here, last round at Wimbledon, she got emotional, saying that she has a lot of people back home in Ukraine cheering for her as they continue their ongoing invasion by Russia. [08:55:10] She's also playing for her daughter, becoming a mom to baby sky just nine months ago. And then in the other women's matchup underway, world number four, Jess Pegula. She's taking on Czech Republic's Marketa Vondrousova. Pegula has overcome injuries. She has been emotionally stressed by her mother's cardiac arrest, which has rocked the family, but she's continuously chipped away at adversity and continually climbed that mountaintop at majors. She's been now in the quarter finals of all four majors and right now, she's looking to make her first ever semifinal. And Vondrousova, though, she's ranked 42nd in the world. She is an Olympic silver medalist and she's a French Open finalist. And when she is healthy and on, she's scary good. So, Bianca, get your popcorn ready or your berries and cream and strawberries and cream, if that's what you prefer. It's going to be some good action today. Some of it's going on right now.",
