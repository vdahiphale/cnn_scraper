I'm Rahel Solomon alongside John Berman.We continue to follow breaking news for you this morning, just frightening scenes coming out of Japan on this New Year's Day. Japan's west coast reeling after a powerful 7.5 magnitude quake caused widespread damage, triggered tsunami warnings and four-foot tsunami waves. This is the moment that the quake struck just a few hours ago. You see that building crumbling to the ground on the screen's upper left side there. And take a look at the scene from inside of an office building.",

We have seen pictures of roofs there just fallen down. The earthquake also caused fires in some areas. And at this moment, tsunami warnings do remain in effect. They have been downgraded.You can see the initial impact of one of these tsunamis, one of these small waves there. It doesn't look like much, but this can be a threat, particularly if you get repeated waves. The warnings now are of waves of up to ten feet. We have full team coverage for you. CNN's Hanako Montgomery is in Tokyo, Derek Van Dam at the Weather Center. Hanako, first to you. What are you hearing at this point from the Japanese government?",

      "sentences": "Yes, John. So, right now, it's currently night time in Japan. So, we're still waiting to confirm a lot of outstanding questions about the extent of the devastation from the earthquake and subsequent tsunami. But what we do know is that 33,000 homes in Ishikawa Prefecture, which is very close to the epicenter, have lost power.We also know that bullet train lines have been suspended. Some roads have had cracks in them, making it very difficult for emergency medical personnel to get to survivors. We also know that fires have broken out across Ishikawa Prefecture and a thousand self-defense force personnel have been dispatched to aid in evacuation efforts. This is along with 1,700 firefighters also to help in evacuation efforts. Now, 20 self-defense force aircraft are also monitoring the area to just try to get a sense of the extent of this devastation. Now, also, I just want to point out that this did happen on New Year's Day, a time when many people are celebrating New Year's with their families, in their homes, with their loved ones. And when this quake hit at 4:10 P.M., that initial quake hit at 4:10 P.M., it shocked the entire country. People were forced to leave their homes, leave their belongings and evacuate to higher ground. Of course, the aftershocks that followed soon afterwards were also very powerful. And it's reminding a lot of people of the 2011 Tohoku earthquake and tsunami because of just how long the quakes are, how the tsunami warnings have also been issue, John, and just really a lot of fear and just lots to confirm about the extent of devastation.",

One is the buildings that have collapsed or partially collapsed, if there are people trapped in them, the emergency forces have about 48 hours to get the people out, or mostly it's too late. So, that's a race against time. And I'm sure the firemen and self-defense forces will do the best they can.The second risk is there's a very small probability, maybe only 1 or 2 percent that you could have an even bigger earthquake in the next week or two. There sure to be aftershocks, but almost all the time they're smaller than the main shock. So, the aftershocks will only be a problem for buildings that have already been damaged and any little further blow can demolish them. But if you have a bigger earthquake, that could really be a problem. It's not very likely, but it's not impossible.",

The move is seemingly to help them prepare for prolonged fighting in 2024. And it comes just days after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that the war against Hamas will continue for months.Joining me now is Journalist Elliott Gotkine in Tel Aviv. So, Elliott, what more does this look like and what does this mean for the people in Gaza?",

      "sentences": "Rahel, what this means is that about 20,000 soldiers, give or take, are going to be allowed to leave the fighting in Gaza, go back to their homes, to their families, to their jobs, to enable them to regroup, recuperate, refresh and also retrain for the war ahead. What this doesn't mean is that Israel is moving to anything like this lower intensity phase of fighting, which the United States has been pushing for.And one of the other reasons for allowing these soldiers to go back home is because the impact this war is having on Israel's economy. Many companies, many businesses have lost some of their key workers as a result of this fighting. And just to underline the uncertainty in the economy, the Bank of Israel has just announced cutting interest rates for the first time in 18 months. It was raising them like many other central banks around the world to fight inflation before this war. So, a lot of uncertainty surrounding the economy and the IDF saying that this, where they hope will, you know, lend a little bit of a hand to the Israeli economy. As far as the Palestinians in the Gaza Strip go, where, of course, according to the Hamas-run Health Ministry, more than 20,000 people have been killed since the fighting began on October the 7th, since Hamas' murderous rampage through Israel on October the 7th. And there isn't much to celebrate this New Year either, because this doesn't mean the fighting is going to wind down. It doesn't mean that the war is ending any kind of endgame. All they can really hope for is more humanitarian aid and some kind of truce, which it should be said many in Israel are also pushing for in order to get more of those 100 plus hostages who remain in captivity in the Gaza Strip, who were kidnapped by Hamas and others on October the 7th to get those hostages back into Israel in exchange for the release of Palestinian prisoners. There have been conversations. There are some hopes that we may be inching towards another truce. Nothing concrete yet. We're not there yet. But that really is the only hope for a pause in fighting for the people in the Gaza Strip right now. Rahel.",

But as Elliott was saying, there's been a real outcry across Israel about businesses going out of business. A lot of single proprietors who've had to be deployed in Gaza, losing their markets, their groceries, their restaurants, because they're not there to run things.I don't think it means a lessening, however, of combat operations in that Israeli officials have talked about a number of high-ranking Hamas officials still being at large inside Gaza, just as they approach Southern Gaza with combat operations, which is where most people have fled to, it's densely packed, and it's also known as one of the areas where the tunnel system is just as robust as it was in the north.",

I think this year what you see is that war has been normalized for the people of Russia. The outcry against it has largely been beaten silent, no mention of the hundreds of thousands of troops lost to death and injury in this fight. In a sense, he is implacably pressing forward, as he also goes to another election in March, where he is pretty much the unchallenged candidate to become president once again.So, war ahead, all systems go, is his message, as his war machine also has stepped up the pace. And he's also secured supplies from countries like Iran. One of the major components of the aerial bombardment of Ukraine in the past few days has been Iranian-made drones, this just as Ukraine has been fighting to get in supplies of basic ammunition to keep up its fight.",

One of the things that we -- in addition to what Kim mentioned, we have to look at there's about an 800 percent increase in the trade in certain materials between China and Russia. And that material is predominantly war material that has been shipped into Russia from China and also North Korea.So, the Russians can sustain this for some time. What can really stop them is some kind of industrial problem that they might have. Their production rates have increased for things like tanks and even airplanes and also munitions. So, the big thing that we have to look for is some kind of impact that the sanctions are having on their arms production. And I think that impact is at the moment not as great as the west thought it would be. So, he can keep this up for about another six months or so, I think.",
