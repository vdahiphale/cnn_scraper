Overnight, Israel says it struck more than 100 military targets inside Gaza, including Hamas headquarters, military compounds, and missile launchers. Hamas responded by firing rockets at the Israel city of Stradot.The IDF also says a missile strike killed a Hamas commander who allegedly led deadly attacks on kibbutz near in Israel over the weekend -- last weekend. The overnight strike comes as Israel forces are preparing for, quote, the next stages of the war. And as conditions inside Gaza continue to deteriorate, with water and food supplies running dangerously low, Doctors Without Borders is warning of a complete catastrophe in Gaza. Israel, a bipartisan Senate delegation led by Majority Leader Chuck Schumer was forced to take shelter today from a Hamas attack. A reminder, Schumer tweeted of the need for the U.S. to help Israel defend itself. And the Pentagon says the second U.S. carrier group led to the region, led by the USS. Eisenhower is deploying to the region. As Iran warns of far-reaching consequences, if Israel doesn't stop its attacks on Gaza. The number of Americans killed in a Hamas attack says now risen to 29. And with at least 15 U.S. citizens remain unaccounted for and are potentially among the hostages held by Hamas inside Gaza. And this morning on CNN STATE OF THE UNION, President Biden's national security adviser says covering those American hostages is a top priority for the administration. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

But if Hezbollah does get involved at the border -- right now, it seems to be Hezbollah is just using mostly harassing attacks that engage the Israeli military, making it concentrate on two different fronts, making it split its assets like the Iron Dome assets.

In terms of the conference that Egypt is putting forward. Look, we think these kinds of initiatives are good or good ideas. Anything that can look in practical ways that how we can help get assistance to Palestinians who need it, that can look at ways to ensure that this conflict doesn't spread, that can look to the future as well. I think it's a positive thing.And what's very clear is this, there are two very different visions for the future and what the Middle East can and should be. There's a vision that we very strongly espouse that has countries in the region, normalizing their relations, integrating working together in common purpose, and upholding and bringing forth the rights and aspirations of the Palestinian people. That's one vision. It's very clear. There's another vision that Hamas has demonstrated in the most horrific way. And that's the vision of death, of destruction, of nihilism of terrorism. That's a vision that does nothing to advance aspirations for Palestinians, that does nothing to help create better futures for people in the region. And does everything to bring total darkness to everyone that it's able to -- to affect. So I think the two -- the paths are clear, the visions are clear. And I have no doubt what path people the overwhelming majority of people in the region will choose and will prefer, if given the opportunity. So our responsibility, all of us who believe in that first path, and that's everyone I talked to. Our responsibility is to make it real, to bring it to life, to make it a clear, affirmative choice. And that's what we're determined to do. We have to get through this crisis first. And we're working to do that. But we also have to get back in a very clear, practical way to that vision to making it real. If we do that, everyone in this region will be in a much better place and so will the rest of the world. Thank you. Thanks, everyone.",

A senior Republican House member tells me he has spoken to 20 Republicans were vowing to block Jordan if he forces a vote on Tuesday. He can only afford to lose four, a big reason why Republicans don't want to reward the hardliners who ousted Kevin McCarthy and sunk Steve Scalise. His number told me we can't reward this behavior. He said, we can't let a small group be dictators.But another source familiar with the matter says Jordan has had positive conversations with his colleagues this weekend and is ready to force that Tuesday vote. Jordan believes he can eventually convince the holdouts to back him. Our panel is back. Leigh Ann, you're in the hallways every day with me talking to these members, getting a sense of -- of where they are, what do you think of Jordan's strategy, if he goes through with this Tuesday vote, potentially to dare those members to go up and vote for somebody else at this time? LEIGH ANN CALDWELL, WASHINGTON POST EARLY 202 CO-AUTHOR: Well, as one senior Republican aide told me, it's risky, because most people -- many people, I should say, who I talked to say that Jordan does not have the votes and that he's not going to get the votes. There is a lot of hard feelings. There's a lot of division, there's a lot of, you know, disarray within the Republican Party. So I think that the question is, you know, some people want him to have this vote, just to put people on the record. See where everyone stands, how much support he is lacking. There is another Republican who told me that it is actually very dangerous to put a vote on the floor to show how many people would vote against Donald Trump, because Donald Trump isn't backpacking, Jordan, and against Jim Jordan. But -- so there's a lot of political calculations to be had. But ultimately, this party has been unable to govern to function and do the easiest thing possible, which is supposed to be elected leader. BURNS: I mean, there's just something genuinely funny at this point, actually, about somebody having the strategy and put this vote on the floor and dare people to vote against the nominee for Speaker of the House, right? Like, we've seen this plot several times. People are fully willing to do that. It sort of should be baked into the sort of strategic calculations of the people involved here. And look, I think, you know, we heard this in your reporting that you just outlined, basic problem here is it's not really clear what the Republican Conference wants to do with power, right? That if they had a governing agenda that had some urgency and consensus support of the party, somebody would be able to make the case that the longer we spend chasing our -- chasing our own tail in the process of electing a speaker that is putting off our opportunity to do XY and Z for the American people. But what is that agenda?",

So there's a lot of possibilities how this could play out. Maybe Jordan forces this vote. Maybe he drops out. There has a conference meeting, I'm told, tomorrow evening. House Republicans are expected to meet. There's pressure to discuss their way forward. We'll see how that -- that goes here.There's also the possibility that others could jump in if Jordan drops out, some names have been floated the way Congressman Mike Johnson, Congressman Mark Green, Byron Donalds, Tom Emmer, Patrick McHenry, who is the Interim Speaker, even speaker -- former Speaker Kevin McCarthy, himself. The problem was that none of them seem possible to get 217 votes, which is really the -- the underlying problem no of this. BARRON-LOPEZ: Right. And to Alex's point, if Israel being attacked by Hamas, you know, I think there was some thought that after that happened, that maybe that would rally Republicans to move very quickly to try to find a speaker. And that didn't even get them to unify and find a speaker and they left for the weekend. And one House Republican texted me saying that the fact that they can't even get a speaker and be able to pass aid for Israel sends the wrong signal to adversaries that democracy can't work.",
