      "sentences": "We've been able to see a couple of things from this location, Wolf. We're seeing rockets taking off that are not intercepted quickly which means that they are flying towards the center of Israel. Up towards the sort of Tel Aviv- Ben Gurion direction which is what Hamas is claiming. We don't know if they're impacting there but what we would expect is that the Iron Dome defensive systems further up into Israel will intercept them.What we've also seen, and this seems to support part of what Hamas is saying, Hamas is saying it's launched a massive barrage on Ashkelon. I don't think we could call it massive, but we have seen outgoing missiles from Gaza heading in the direction of Ashkelon that had been intercepted by the Iron Dome Defensive Missile System there. And there were quite a number of impacts and intercepts but it does appear from the earliest reports that at least one of Hamas's rockets has got through, has impacted in Ashkelon, and Hamas quite simply tries to fire a lot of missiles, and we're hearing a lot of explosions just now. Because as soon as those barrages of missiles went out, we heard fighter jets and helicopters in the air. There was an impact there. Probably in Gaza. It's right behind me. That's where the impacts seem to come from. So Israel is responding. You typically try to fire back at the launch sites of those missiles. So there is a real tempo, there's a real rhythm of war, beat war of this, Wolf. We've seen this up tempo with these outgoing salvos of Hamas rockets. We've seen the Iron Dome intercept them. We've heard the helicopter gunship and I'm hearing it again come on the station above here, and of course heard the fighter jets and then the explosions inside of Gaza. So there's a lot of moving pieces in terms of those rocket salvos. On top of that, the security forces in Sderot, as they are in other places, are also still, and we had information about this in the past hour or so, still in this town trying to hunt down a suspected two or three Hamas militants still at large in this town -- Wolf.",

They know they're brutal. They know they do terrible things. They know they're terrorists. They know that that's how they operate. But the medic I was talking about, a doctor was treating some of those people, wounded in Re'im, in that aftermath of that music festival, he said people were shot with rocket-propelled grenades.They had their throats cut with knives. They were shot by gunfire. Innocent people with no way of attacking these armed Hamas militants coming at them. So -- and that's possibly a missile being intercepted overhead, I'm not clear. But there are -- this is part of the tempo, the war that I was talking about. These bangs that we're hearing here. But in terms of that music event, there were people who were enjoying it, the sun was coming up in the morning, and then suddenly they were being attacked. It's the scale and the scope and the barbarity and the immediacy of it that has really just caught people by surprise. And I think this is why we're seeing the death toll climb so steeply today is we're still in the throes of defense forces here, still in the throes of getting to grips with what's happened, chasing down Hamas militants that are still inside Israel proper, as well as trying to recover and get to grips with the situation. Recover and identify all those who were brutally murdered at that music event. And this is why the figures have gone up so much, as medics could get in, as the Israeli Defense Forces could get in there. It's just shocking. Everyone you talk to who's played a role in helping the recovery and rescue effort there is still in shock about it -- Wolf.",

On Saturday morning when we realized what was happening, we started hearing first of all the rockets and the mortars falling on our community and then we ran to the safe room which for people who live in our area close to the border is usually where the kids are sleeping. So we just joined our two daughters in the room. We locked the door. We locked the windows.And we expected something that we have experienced before. Mortar fire on our community. We are accustomed to it unfortunately. But then we started hearing automatic gunfire. And we realized that this is a different kind of event, that terrorists have infiltrated our community. And at first we heard the gunfire in a bit of a distance, and it got closer and closer until we heard it right outside our window. They were shooting into our house. I told my parents that we are locked in the safe room. That there are terrorists in the neighborhood and that there is nobody there to help us. The Israeli military was caught by surprise. And I have to say, Wolf, what happened yesterday is the biggest failure of any Israeli government in the history of this country. The government did not function and the citizens were left alone for long hours to try to defend themselves. And so I told my parents who live in Tel Aviv, it's about an hour, 20 minutes' drive that this is the situation. And my parents said we're coming. Now the roads were blocked. Terrorists were infiltrating community after community all over the border. What happened in our little kibbutz, our community was not unique just to us. It was happening in many different places, at the same time. You mentioned this music festival, you know, that's a 10-minute drive from our home. More than 200 people were slaughtered there. And so the military was caught by surprise and did not have enough resources in the beginning to help everyone. And the tragic result is what we're seeing, this large number of casualties. But my parents made their way toward the border area. And toward our kibbutz. At some point they split, my mom stayed, you know, in a more safe place, and my father began a very dangerous journey to try to get to our community. On the way, he witnessed -- he just had a pistol with him. He witnessed an ambush of a group of Israeli soldiers by Hamas. And he and another soldier intervened to help fight the terrorists. And then took two wounded soldiers back with them. They had already got in close to our community. But they went back with the wounded soldiers and handed them over to my mother so she could take them to the hospital and try to save their lives. And then they returned. They made the drive again, and when they arrived this time for our community they joined a group of soldiers who were planning to begin the process of going from house-to-house in this community. We are a community of about 500 to 600 people. You know, from house-to-house, look for the terrorists, kill them and free the people. And they did this methodically. They went through dozens of houses. We were not aware that this was happening because by that point we had lost all cell phone reception. But we heard the gunfire. We realized that there were exchanges of fire between two sides, and that's when I told my two young daughters who were beginning to lose patience. They were real heroes but they were beginning patience after nine and a half hours. I told them grandfather is coming. Stay silent, stay quiet. And grandfather is coming. And after another hour of these, you know, battles from home to home that the soldiers engaged in, we heard a large bang on the window of the safe room and the voice of my father and my older daughter, she's 3 1/2 years old, she said grandfather is here. And that's when we started crying for the first time after 10 hours in this situation.",

And this is what we've been saying for years. This is the Hamas that we're fighting against.

If I had to guess on this, I think their first goal right now is to get Hamas out of Israel, to shut down the border, to make sure no more can come in and to go after and kill all of those who are terrorizing the Israeli citizens throughout the state of Israel. So, secondly, they'll look to say what do we have to do to get all of the rockets being launched, and it raises another issue, how does Hamas get so many rockets.Gaza is a poor area. It's impoverished. So where do the rockets come from? I think those roads lead back to Iran. There's a fuse that runs from Iran all the way through to Syria, to Hezbollah in Lebanon, and certainly to Hamas. And that fuse has been lit and that's one of the reasons why the United States and everyone in the region needs to be concerned.",

I assume we'll learn more about that but right now we've got to be vigilant of course about Lebanon in the north and potential attacks from Hezbollah as attacks continue from the south and Hamas. Rockets continue to rain.All right. So you've got to be very -- we've seen in recent months more coordination from Iran, their proxies, Hezbollah and Hamas. We've seen Palestinian jihad of course deeply involved in this. So you're seeing much more coordination of these terrorists and their proxies in the last months and they've been pretty public about that coordination. It appears you saw that -- we saw that yesterday directly but it appears that seems to be what's happened, but of course we're going to learn a lot more in the days and weeks ahead.

U.S.-based air carriers including American and Delta nixing all flights from the airport to New York's JFK through at least Monday. United Airlines and Air France have suspended service to and from Tel Aviv indefinitely.

That would be in the southern part of Israel, in (INAUDIBLE).
