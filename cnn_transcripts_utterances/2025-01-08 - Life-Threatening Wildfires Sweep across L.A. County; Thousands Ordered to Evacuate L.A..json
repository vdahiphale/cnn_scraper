      "sentences": "Well, first of all, Becky, this is indeed a huge debate. That press conference yesterdayby Donald Trump is all over, for instance, here in Germany, obviously, German media; of course, in Denmark and in Greenland as well after those comments. And I do believe that a lot of European politicians do believe that the European Union, European countries in general, are going to be in for a pretty wild ride. And the discussion that you mentioned is exactly the one that's going on. And the one that we're really hearing a lot in Central Europe, especially in Germany, is one of the comments that Donald Trump made, talking about European countries or other NATO countries having to put away 5 percent of their GDP for defense, that he thought that that was an adequate number. Now anybody who heard that, during that press conference, you might have gotten the impression that maybe that was just sort of a number that Donald Trump came up with. But it is a big discussion here in Europe. And if you look at Germany, there's some politicians who are saying this is outrageous, especially from Olaf Scholz's Social Democrats. There are other politicians, however, who are saying, look, no matter what the number, European countries do need to do more for defense. And the new incoming president is going to demand that as well. There are some politicians who are saying, though, look, we can't necessarily take everything that he says at face value. But certainly European politicians believe that the incoming Trump administration is going to be a lot tougher on Europe than the Biden administration has been and is going to be a lot more demanding. And I think one of the things that you're seeing right now, in the runup to the change of power in Washington, is really European politicians sort of trying to feel Donald Trump out, see what's going to be going on. You had Giorgia Meloni on the ground in Mar-a-Lago just the other day. But then with the issue of Greenland, that's really a whole different thing, because that's, of course, is a security matter, a transatlantic security matter, where you have had the Danes come out and said, look, this area is simply isn't for sale. But they are also trying to be diplomatic about it, because they do realize that, of course, the United States is extremely important for European security as well. I want to listen in again to what Donald Trump said about Denmark and Greenland. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

I've been in Greenland a couple of times, including the last time in 2019, when Donald Trump tried to say that the U.S. could buy, could purchase Greenland. And even back then, that idea was shot down. The influence that Denmark has is there but it certainly isn't something that is in a big way, that you would feel in the big way. Certainly Greenland does administer itself to a large extent. Nevertheless, the arctic region is becoming more important, both militarily and economically as well. So the U.S. certainly has some interest there. But one thing that I think is really important in all this, Becky, is that Denmark is probably one of the U.S.' most loyal allies on the European continent. Almost every military operation abroad that the U.S. went into, the Danes were by their side. And the Danes certainly are very loyal to the United States in NATO as well. So, hitting out, lashing out at one of your staunchest allies like that is certainly something that a lot of people in Europe aren't taking very well -- Becky.",

      "sentences": "Well, Becky, you can put this in the bucket of things that the president-elect's team is looking atthe first term to see what they can bring back. And this is an idea that they want to resurface. It's also an idea that has continued to gain momentum among Republicans over the last several years. And, of course, that is designating Mexican cartels as foreign terrorist organizations. Now as you mentioned there, Donald Trump came close to doing this in his first term but then held off at the request of the then Mexican president. But there was also pushback internally, according to sources, because it is a controversial idea. Of course, it prefaces the use of the U.S. military on Mexican soil. It also can lead to tougher financial penalties and legal ramifications. Now there are tools at the disposal of federal agencies to crack down on cartels and their human smuggling networks, as well as what they do in drug trafficking and gun trafficking. And that has been put to use by those federal agencies over the last several years. But what Republicans argue and what the president-elect's team is considering is that something like putting cartels on the foreign terrorist organization list would allow the U.S. government to do even more and to go even further in their crackdown of these criminal organizations. And Republicans are even continuing to talk about it on Capitol Hill, with the lead of House Speaker Mike Johnson, in hopes that they, too, can move legislation on this, as they have introduced over recent years. Now to do something like this, Becky, it goes through the secretary of state, in consultation with the attorney general and the Treasury Secretary. They would then notify Congress to do this. Some of those that are already on the list, for example, ISIS and Boko Haram. So certainly this would be a major step, should they move forward with this. And it's unclear from the sources I'm talking to when exactly they would do it. But the intent is definitely there. Now another source I spoke with said, look, even if this doesn't give us that many more tools at our disposal to go after these cartels, it very much puts pressure on the Mexican government to cooperate with the United States. And so that is part of the lens that they are viewing this through, which is to make sure that they have that cooperation from Mexico to crack down and double down on these cartels, which, in addition to the drug smuggling, are also partaking in human smuggling, which connects directly to the president's agenda on border security. So again, sources say that this is all under review and discussion. There is still some internally who believe that it may not be worth it. But there are other voices who say it is time to do exactly this now, in the second term, after the president-elect spoke of it so often on the campaign trail but also before then, during his first term, Becky.",
