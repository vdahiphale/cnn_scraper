He's a top of the ticket on CNN.That means no studio audience, that means no crib sheets. And, of course, that means that those mics will be muted while the other candidate is speaking.

Harris's team saying that they did not agree to the mics being muted Donald Trump's team saying, we always said all along it was going to be the same rules as the CNN debate. And we want those mics muted. Now, Donald Trump is saying that they have come to an agreement. We are told by sources outside of Donald Trump's campaign that those mics well be muted.

Let's go and take a closer look at why the campaigns are so focused on the economy now, right? Obviously, this is something any campaign is focused on. But let's take a look at the 2020 map. If these campaigns are being honest with you and most of them are, and if they're not, you can just look at where they're spending or where they're sending their candidates, they care about seven states right now. They care about Nevada. They care about Arizona. They care about Georgia. They care about North Carolina. And of course they care about the blue wall. Now, let's look at the polling. The most important issues in each of those states by far, if you look at the latest \"New York Times\"/Siena polling, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, all seven of those states, the economy is number one by far, the closest other issue, it's usually either immigration or abortion, five, six or seven points behind. That is why you have seen a bare-knuckle brawl breakout over the course of the last couple of days on air in campaign advertisements, why you saw J.D. Vance today in Michigan talking about the economy. The former president was in Michigan, would be in Pennsylvania, will be back in Michigan, will be in Wisconsin, talking about the economy, other issues as well. But its always the economy that they're focusing on, with their visits, with what they're saying on the campaign trail and with their advertisements. It's also why you're going to see the Harris campaign in their bus trip, the first trip after the convention, both Kamala Harris and Tim Walz in the state of Georgia. Now we all know this is a critical state that Joe Biden flipped back in 2020. This bus tour that there'll be taking, though, is fascinating. The southern part of the state, and it will end here in Savannah, Georgia, in Chatham County, this is a traditionally Democratic county. It is also a county that White House officials and the current administration point to as critical in their economic recovery. And one where the Harris campaign knows they need to turn out bigger voters. As to what's happening on air? Well, this is what the advertisements look like.

This is the January 6 federal election case in court in Washington, D.C. against Donald Trump. The charges, the four charges that Donald Trump has been facing for quite some time now. They're the same in this, what's called a superseding indictment. So a rewritten version of the criminal charges against the former president for conspiracy and other counts related to what he did after the 2020 election.But what the special counsel's office is saying they're doing here is they needed to go back to the grand jury, Phil, and rewrite those charges so that they would incorporate what they need to say that's in line with what the Supreme Court told them they must do. Remember, the Supreme Court just in June made that decision on presidential immunity, saying that some of the things in this case had to be cut out, such as things that were allegations that may be part of Donald Trump's official duties as president, especially his interactions with others below him in the administration. So I'm still going through the superseding indictment documents that we have. It's a 36-page document. And so, what we have here now in this filing is that there are coconspirators listed, but one of those people that we had before that would have been heard by many people on the jury if it had gone to trial, there would have been a lot of information about that official, Jeffrey Clark. He's not one of the coconspirators any more. He was Justice Department official. Now, it is six different private people, five private attorneys plus a private political consultant.

And at the end of this week, we are expecting, Phil, the Justice Department to tell the judge what they want to do for the path forward.This appears to be one of the steps to take -- to move things forward and to set up the next phase of this case. And the way the special counsel describes this in sending this out to the public is that they say that they brought this indictment before a new grand jury, one that had not heard about this case before that it approved the statement against Donald Trump previously, that they approved it. That is the process for an indictment. It has to go before a grand jury of more than 20 people, and it reflects the efforts to implement the Supreme Courts holdings and what to do next. And so, what this does today is it kicks off that next phase so that the Justice Department can continue attempting to prosecute this case in a way that they have said for some time now, they want to happen as quickly as possible as efficiently as possible. They're not waiting to Friday to tell us what they're going to do next. They're saying now, here's the plan, and then we're going to be working forward from that in court -- Phil.",

Elie, break this down for us. After the great reporting from Katelyn there going through very quickly this filing, what exactly did Jack Smith do here? Was this expected?",

      "sentences": "So, Phil, what Jack Smith has done here is paired down the original indictment dramatically in an effort to save it. So the original indictment you'll probably recall charged a broad ranging conspiracy that essentially tell a whole bunch of different buckets of conduct by Donald Trump, his pressure campaign on Mike Pence, his pressure campaign on the Justice Department, his attempt to pressure state officials, the fake electors scheme.Well, in this new indictment, which is called a superseding indictment, and now essentially replaces the old indictment, the part about the Justice Department is out, the part about Mike Pence is out, and all we're left with in this superseding indictment is the charges relating to Trump's effort to pressure state and local officials and to submit false slates of electors. Now, if you're wondering why would Jack Smith pare back, cut back his own case? The answer is because of the U.S. Supreme Court's immunity ruling, which came down in July. And in that ruling, the Supreme Court said that many of the things that Donald Trump did while he's in office, including specifically his interactions with DOJ, some of his public communications, likely his interactions with the vice president, the Supreme Court said, those things are likely going to be immune and therefore out of this case. And so, Jack Smith has now made a tactical decision. I'm not going to fight the battle to keep those things in the case. I'm going to take them out of the case. I'm going to focus on the pressure that Donald Trump put on state and local officials and the fake elector scheme. And I'm going to try to move ahead with those pieces of the case still in place.",

There is simply no way because in the immunity ruling that came out in July, the U.S. Supreme Court said, Donald Trump has the right to appeal whatever the district court, the trial court finds is in or out of the case.So, again, this is a big win for Donald Trump. I mean, I think it's a smart tactical move by jack smith. But half of the case or so, maybe more just fell away against Donald Trump. That said, he's not going to be satisfied. He's still going to argue the whole case should be dismissed. I think that argument will be rejected by the district court, but the Supreme Court said Donald Trump's still can appeal that -- meaning to the D.C. Court of Appeals and then potentially back to the Supreme Court before trial. So there's no way Phil, that we get through that whole appeals process and still started trial between now and November 5. I mean, that's just not going to happen.",

And one of the things that this refocusing of the charges looks like is that it focuses on how Donald Trump was using people in battleground states, Arizona, Michigan, Georgia, et cetera, to try and change the electoral votes or deceive the state people, the people in the legislators in those states.One of the things too that the prosecutors have to do here is they have to be able to show how Donald Trump was doing this. And one way they want to do it is with his Twitter account. Now, they have to walk a really fine line here. And this is the sort of thing that could very well be adjudicated with the judge, that they're going to need to talk about related to immunity because he was president at the time and they have to right in here. Here's a quote, the defendant Donald Trump, continued to make false claims nonetheless, with deliberate disregard for the truth, including through his Twitter accounts. That's the allegation. And they say that although he was sometimes using his Twitter account to communicate with the public as president about official actions and policies, he also regularly used it to personal purposes including to spread knowingly false claims of election fraud and try to get his supporters to travel to Washington, D.C. So, there you see the two sides of the coin that the prosecutors are going to have to have the judge look at and come down on their side, to say, yeah, if we go to trial, we want to be able to use things that Donald Trump tweeted from his account on Twitter while president but we want you to decide that those are personal things he was doing as a candidate and not as the president.",

How much if the Justice Department wanted to move forward with this case, how much would it still revolve around Mike Pence, the vice president?This was something that the Supreme Court did not give a clear answer on and basically said the lower courts were going to have to figure out how much of the interactions between Donald Trump is president and Vice President Mike Pence at the time would be falling under immunity, something that could very well end up back at the Supreme Court. And from what I'm seeing here on these pages, there are several pages that document, Donald Trump's interactions with vice president Mike Pence as part of the key allegations in bringing these charges against Trump and continuing them on. That means they want Pence to stay part of this case, and they very likely want him to stay a potential witness in this case. The way that they're trying to walk this line is there articulating dates when Donald Trump and Mike Pence either met in in-person or had conversations about what Pence was to do as president of the Senate. So a different branch of government, than what Trump and Pence were doing as president and vice president. And so they're very likely going to be putting that before, not just Judge Chutkan in the near future, but also very likely appeals courts, even potentially the Supreme Court ultimately, on this question what Mike Pence and Donald Trump talked about every time Trump was berating him, turning the conversation with him to January 6, telling him what he wanted him to do to block the certification of the electoral college votes when Pence would preside over the Senate session. All of that is very like play going to be something the prosecutors are going to fight to keep in this case. And Donald Trump's team is going to try and argue, we don't want Pence here at all.",

This does not play well with those voters who don't like Donald Trump, but it also doesn't play well with the voters who are sort of the Trump to Biden voters who turned against Trump because of his behavior, goes to sort of character issues. It goes to democracy issues.It also goes to this idea, and you heard this in Kamala Harris's speech, this idea of if Trump assumes the presidency again, what would a Donald Trump without guardrails be like? What would this immunity ruling mean for a second term of Donald Trump? So I think anything that's sort of a reminder that maybe Trump's time in office wasn't about of a chicken in every pot, which is what Republicans like to frame it is, is just not good particularly with these independent and swing voters.",

He's going to be talking about this. He's going to kind of rehash his grievances.And that's not something that even and his supporters like. They want to know, what are we going to do next? What's your plan going forward? Not keep giving me the old hits. I want to know if you're coming out with a new album. And he keeps going back to the well. And the other thing true, too, when we talk about the immunity piece and I know he didn't get all of this in court, but when -- in focus groups, you say that Trump argue that he should have immunity even in cases of murder, which is what they argued. People are shocked. And so, if we are having that conversation again, it's just going to remind people something that is very core to Trump's brand. He thinks he's above the law. No one should be above the law, not even a president, that's what voters uniformly agree. And so I don't think this is going to be good for keeping him focus and not being distracted.",

So it replaces the original indictment, the original indictment was about 45 pages. This new one is about 36 pages. And what DOJ has done is take out those items that the Supreme Court specified are now clearly covered by the immunity ruling. Most obviously, the allegations that were in the original indictment relating to Trump's effort to pressure DOJ. Those are gone. Those are essentially deleted out of the new indictment. The allegations relating to Mike Pence remained in the new indictment. They're changed a little bit as Kaitlan said before there's sort of more focused on his role as president of the Senate than his role as vice president. But here's what's going to happen next. They're going to go into court within the next few weeks. Donald Trump's team is going to say, great, they got rid of the DOJ stuff. We agree with that, but we also think everything that's still in the indictment should be immune as well. Judge Chutkan will make a decision. If Donald Trump loses that, he'll appeal to the court of appeals. And then if he loses that, he'll try to get it back to the Supreme Court.",

However, the timing -- that's a surprise. There was an expectation it might come later in the fall, especially after there is a deadline on Friday in a hearing set for next week in this case to figure out the path forward. The fact that it's coming before those things happen, that was a surprise. The other thing is that Donald Trump's defense team didn't get a heads up from the special counsel that they were going back to the grand jury in federal court in Washington, D.C. today to approve this new set of allegations and the rewritten charges, even so with this here, before them, it's something that the defense team is going to be able to look at, demand more about what was said to the grand jury in Washington, D.C.'s federal court as they were looking at the rewritten charges and asked to approve them. So more evidence potentially to go forward to the case and then also, there may be a lot to contest here still in court that the defense team can try -- Phil.",

First of all, it said there was a presumptive, if not absolute immunity for the former president, for his official acts. It also very broadly defined what would be an official act that could be shielded.What Jack Smith has done in this new -- this new document is to try to narrow that idea of what's official and brought on what candidate Trump would have done. Here are some examples. He stresses that the January 6 rally that led to the attack on the capital, that that was a candidate Trump doing that, he was in no way in an official capacity. Twitter statements that, you know, involve misstatements about the election in a private capacity, his dealings with then Vice President Pence for the certification of the election on January 6. The new indictments stresses that those were part of ceremonial, not executive branch actions of the former vice president.
