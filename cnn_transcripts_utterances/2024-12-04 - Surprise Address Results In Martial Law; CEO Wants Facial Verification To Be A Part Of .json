So, we want to go from using it multiple times a year in airports, to multiple times a day. Today, let`s just say you live in L.A. You could use it getting into an Uber for rider verification within the rider app. And then let`s say you`re going to the Intuit Dome to watch a Clippers game with just your face and CLEAR, right, because you are your age and your payment. You could check in at a doctor`s office with your face. You`re there for your appointment. What I see as the ultimate check in at the doctor`s office is, your face is your appointment, it`s your insurance card that`s verified and validated, and then it is also your copay and your credit card.

Answer is coral. A colony of small animals which have similar ring-like growth patterns to trees visible within their skeletons. Throughout this week, Call to Earth is turning the spotlight on French Polynesia and an organization working to restore coral reef ecosystems around the world. Titouan Bernicot started Coral Gardeners in 2017, cogitating over healthier oceans when he was just 18 years old as part of the Rolex Perpetual Planet Initiative. They are on a to plant one million corals worldwide by the end of 2025, a strategy they`ve dubbed Odyssey 2025. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ZAIN ASHER, CNN INTERNATIONAL ANCHOR (voice-over): This is Tahiti, one of three permanent ocean-based coral nurseries in Mo`orea. As Coral Gardeners, both by company name and by profession, these sites are at the core of what they do on a daily basis. TITOUAN BERNICOT, FOUNDER &amp; CEO, CORAL GARDENERS: Coral gardening is the coolest thing on Earth. You are underwater. There is nobody talking. You hear the sound of the parrotfish, like the noise of the waves. You have those thousands of little coral fragments, and you have the fish. They become your co-workers. It`s something so tangible. It`s such a rewarding feeling to see your tiny coral fragment growing.",

According to apublished study, chemists at University College London successfully created nanopasta, spaghetti strands 200 times thinner than a human hair. But how? Well, where traditionally spaghetti is made by pushing a flour-water mixture through a metal press, the study says nanopasta is made by pulling threads of flour and liquid through the tip of a needle by an electric charge, producing strands so incredibly small they can`t be seen by the human eye or even conventional cameras and microscopes. The scientists say they don`t see the process being useful for making palatable pasta, instead seeing potential for creating things like smart bandages and aiding bone regeneration. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
