Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer says lawmakers will vote son a right to conception bill today. He calls the Roe reversal one of the worst Supreme Court decisions of modern times.He also warns that state abortion bans are just the tip of the iceberg, and the Republican Extends to contraception as well. The Biden campaign is hosting a press call right now to highlight how if elected Donald Trump and his allies plan to attack access to contraception. Joining us now is the President and CEO of the Center for Reproductive Rights, Nancy Northup. Nancy, thanks so much for being here. So, Republicans say that this contraception bill is too broad. And unnecessary GOP Senator John Cornyn said, \"It's a phony vote because contraception, to my knowledge, is not illegal. It's not unavailable.\" Your response.",

And contraception could be in the crosshairs next. It's really important that we codify in federal law that there is a right to contraception.So, I would disagree with any notion that people should not be concerned. We saw what happened with IVF in Alabama. You've got to be sure that the whole range of reproductive health care is guaranteed in federal law. We can't just depend on the courts.",

So, really just a record smashing year in 2023.ANTONIO GUTERESS, U.N. SECRETARY-GENERAL:  Let me be very clear again. The phase out of fossil fuels is essential and inevitable. No amount of speed or scare tactics will change that. Let's hope it doesn't come too late. WEIR (voice-over):  While the head of the United Nations has been railing against polluters and petrostates for years, he is using this report to plead with world leaders to cut dirty fuels faster than ever.

So, these actions, as you say, to treat fossil fuel adverts as if it would be, you know, we treat banning conversations around tobacco or at least warning signs if you do smoke, these are the consequences. We need to get, I think, more savvy to do that around greenhouse gas emissions as well.WEIR (voice-over):  To avoid the worst, scientists say global emissions must fall 9 percent a year until 2030. And while they still went up last year, it was only by 1 percent thanks to a boom in clean wind and sun power, a sign that humanity could finally be on the verge of bending the carbon curve. COBB:  Yes, 1 percent is in the wrong direction, but it's getting close to zero and then it can start going into the negative territory. So, in fact, we are predicted to have peak fossil fuel emissions within the next year or two, which is something I frankly never saw coming even five years ago. So, that's real progress. And I think people need to really appreciate that. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Because we are now just one minute and 45 seconds away from liftoff of the first crewed flight of Boeing's Starliner spacecraft. The weather looks good. They successfully troubleshooted all of those ground computer problems. And so, the two NASA astronauts on board, Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams have just delivered their final pre-launch speeches. Their visors have closed and they are now ready for liftoff. If all goes according to plan, they will be spending eight days aboard the International Space Station.And, Alisyn, the reason this is so critical is because NASA wants redundancy. NASA does not want to be dependent strictly on SpaceX to get its astronauts to the International Space Station, not does it want to be reliant upon the Russian Soyuz rockets to get its astronauts up there. So, this is about having more options for NASA and its astronauts to allow them to focus on bigger, loftier goals like returning American astronauts to the moon for the first time since the Apollo program, Alisyn. So, here we go. 48 seconds away. All systems go for launch, Alisyn.",
