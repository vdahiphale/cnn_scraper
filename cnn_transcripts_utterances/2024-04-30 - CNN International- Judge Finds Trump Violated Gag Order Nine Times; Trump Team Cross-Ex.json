He is a former federal prosecutor and was also a special assistant with the Justice Department. Michael, always good to have you here and get your insight. As we are waiting for that next witness, the fact that there remain to be concerns, as we know from the prosecution, about letting the defense team know too far in advance who the witnesses would be, I wonder whether you think the ruling from the judge this morning that Donald Trump in fact violated the gag order, do you think that could have any impact on that decision moving forward?",

I think they remain concerned about Donald Trump's potential intimidation of them. So, I think that what we have today is pretty much the status quo, except for the fact that Donald Trump is $9,000 poor. He still has the obligation to remain silent, except for one small point that he won, I guess in court, which is, if Michael Cohen or Stormy Daniels attacks him, he is allowed to respond in kind. So, I think that's a fair ruling on the judge's part.So, onto the next case, we're in the middle, if you will, each case has a beginning, middle and end. Pecker was the beginning. He set out the broad conspiracy, the terms of it, what its objectives were. Now, we're getting the bankers who are saying how it is being given effect, will ultimately get to Michael Cohen, who is the linchpin in this. They will get all the bank records to support what Cohen said. So, so far so good for the prosecution. I think Todd Blanche is doing the best he can with the case he has available to him, irrespective of whether Donald Trump likes his lack of aggression or not.",

There has been some discussion about additional evidence, some text messages that prosecutors want to bring in as evidence. We're now learning that one of the prosecutors said, if Donald Trump decides to take the stand that he wants to bring in those gag order violations during cross-examination. That's interesting too, because in the very beginning, when there was that hearing to decide what could be brought up if Donald Trump in fact does take the stand, the judge said that what could be brought in would be the fact that he violated a different gag order in this civil case, not very long ago.So, I guess in some ways, it's really not surprising that the prosecution would want to bring that up.

I think the prosecutors really have to stay focused on the essentials of this case which is this is a case that involves the suppression of information that would be deleterious to the campaign and the business records violations that allowed it to go forward.

Behind me is what is supposed to be the only access onto the Columbia campus that will be used by students and faculty. However, the list of those who can actually gain entrance to the campus since last night grew smaller and that is because of the events that took place at Hamilton Hall. Now, if you look behind me, you can actually see that space that is used for the entrance here. The way this has been working all day, Rahel, is that you have people, mainly students and staff will go up with their Columbia ID. They will scan it. And the system, which has been adjusted since last night, will automatically tell them whether or not they actually are either essential workers or students who already live on campus.There is an important question to be asked here -- to be asked and hopefully answered is exactly who or what is behind what took place yesterday. Of course, I'm talking about those pictures that we saw. You see that -- those stand in sharp contrast when you compare it to the situation that played out really the last couple of weeks with people that were forming as part of that encampment in the heart of Columbia University that we had seen relatively peaceful. But then, there was a dramatic and a seismic shift overnight, when you began to see these people advance on the building that you see behind me, still with a banner outside. But, there is still a question as to who they are, if they are affiliated in any way, shape or form, with the students that were occupying that encampment.

Now, the United States, in the shape of Antony Blinken, the Secretary of State, has been in the region, Saudi Arabia, Jordan. He is going to Israel, trying to work out a deal, originally proposed by the Egyptians, that would allow for the release of 33 hostages, accompanied by a pause in the fighting, followed by a second phase that would involve a longer ceasefire and the release of all the hostages.But, we're hearing now from Prime Minister Netanyahu that he is going to -- they're going to go ahead with a Rafah operation with or without a deal. Well, if they go ahead with a Rafah operation, there is no deal. That's a violation of the deal. And it's -- the Israeli media indicates that he is tending to lean in the direction of those far- right extremist members of his cabinet who have threatened to leave the government, cause it to collapse, if he goes along with a deal and essentially ends the war if -- because part of the Egyptian proposal, the second phase is perhaps a year-long sustainable period of restoration of calm, as they say. One diplomatic source told CNN it essentially means a permanent ceasefire to the extent you can have a permanent ceasefire in this very long conflict. But, certainly, it would indicate that the Israeli Prime Minister is wavering about whether he wants any deal at all, that his real priority is perhaps to carry on, continue this war, which has largely failed to win the release of any hostages, and simply continue this war and stay in power, the hostages in Gaza be damned.

The place is in shambles. But, you might be able to go home. There might be a cessation of the violence which has left more than 34,500 people dead.But, as I said, it appears that the Israeli leader, despite the efforts of the United States, the suppose an ally of Israel, that he seems to be putting his political fate above the fate of the hostages, ignoring the efforts of the United States to try to bring the fighting finally to an end, because if this Rafah operation goes ahead, even though the Israelis are talking about moving the more than million people who have sought refuge in the Rafah area, there will be a huge number of civilian casualties, and that's obviously something the United States is trying to avoid.

They've also been driving around some vehicles decked out in pro-Trump slogans, blaring music as well and horns. I can tell you that I've been here most days. The crowd is definitely a little bit larger than what we've seen at the trial so far. You may recall, Donald Trump was railing on what he saw as a lockdown security in the area. I can also tell you that, having been here, it is not a lockdown in the area, and the spaces available to protesters and supporters has been the same every day of this trial. But, it seems that message may have gotten through to some of Donald Trump supporters. It's definitely are more here today. Earlier today, Judge Juan Merchan fined Donald Trump $9,000 for nine violations of the gag order placed on him in this trial, and ordered the former President to delete seven posts from these Truth Social account, and two from the his campaign website by 2:15 Eastern Time today.

It's likely that he doesn't know much, I'm guessing, about this hush money scheme since he was Executive Director of C-SPAN Archives.But instead, he'll just be used as this person who can get in evidence, because of course, part of this trial isn't only eliciting testimony. But, prosecutors actually have to get a lot of hard evidence, whether we saw bank accounts, account records, invoices, but perhaps also video testimony or video records that will be put into the record that the jury will be able to use, and prosecutors can use to bolster their case against Donald Trump in this falsification of bank records case. So, I'm guessing that this will be a very short witness. But, like you said, this is the fourth witness of this trial. We started testimony last week. We've gone through four witnesses.

And in 2016, they broadcast a lot of Trump's rallies and a lot of his campaign appearances. So, Dr. Browning is testifying that the Manhattan DA's Office issued him a subpoena or issued C-SPAN, I should say, a subpoena to turn over recordings that they had in their archives of Donald Trump. In particular, there is a video recording dated October 14, 2016. That was a rally in Greensboro, North Carolina, also October 22, 2016, a rally in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania. And actually, in court right now, it looks like the prosecution is playing a clip from one of these rallies. There is also a clip from January 11, 2017, after Donald Trump was elected President, a news conference. Now, what's interesting, the first two video clips that I mentioned, October 14 and October 22, those were just days after the Access Hollywood tape was released, and then they were just days before that payment was made to Stormy Daniels. So, it's unclear sitting here, watching the feed coming in from our reporters in the courtroom, if Trump made any comments during those campaign appearances about the Access Hollywood tape. Presumably he did. My memory doesn't go back that far. But, it's probably why they wanted to get this into evidence, to talk about the fact that Donald Trump knew about the allegations against his campaign. And again, going to further this idea that Donald Trump's campaign, according to prosecutors, they were in scramble mode and they were trying to do anything they could to really clean up the mess that was made by the Access Hollywood tape, and then to stop any further issues or further accusations. Women maybe started coming out of the woodwork a little bit after this Access Hollywood tape. And as is evidenced by the Stormy Daniels payment, they had to get that under control, pay off Stormy Daniels in those crucial days before the election here. So, Erica, that's what it seems like prosecutors are using this witness for just to get that video evidence into evidence.",

It's a phony deal. I have no idea who these women are. So, setting that stage, as you pointed out. Jessica, appreciate it. Thank you.

It's the epicenter of campus protests across the U.S., as some students there oppose Israel's war in Gaza. Overnight, dozens of protesters, as we can see in this video, barricaded themselves inside an academic building on campus. This is Hamilton Hall. Meanwhile, at the University of Texas at Austin, dozens of protesters have been arrested with organizers saying that police used flash bangs, mace and other chemical munitions. So far, hundreds of students have been arrested at major U.S. universities. And these pro-Palestinian protests on American university campuses are being closely watched around the world. In Gaza, a banner was displayed in support of the demonstrations, thanking students for their solidarity with civilians in the devastated enclave. And in Iran, the U.S. protests in support of Palestinians are being praised. But, you also may remember that Iran cracked down on its own student protest movement which erupted in 2022. CNN's Fred Pleitgen reports now from Tehran. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice- over): Pro-Palestinian protesters at U.S. colleges getting vocal support from Iran. Conservative students and faculty at Tehran University staging a demo this weekend, chanting \"Death to America and Death to Israel\", saying they stand with those occupying U.S. universities. We not only support them, we are one united voice, this woman says. We are like organs of the same body.",

We didn't think that they would come out, but the fact that they came out shows that we're fighting for the same thing.PLEITGEN (voice-over): This movement by American students shows that freedom seeking and support of the oppressed has expanded all over the world, this man says. The Biden administration ripped into Iran over its crackdown of protests that swept the country in the fall of 2022 after the death in police custody of Mahsa Amini was accused of breaking the country's strict hijab rules. ANTONY BLINKEN, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE: The international community has come together to condemn and confront Iran's brutal crackdown, and we'll continue to act in support of the right of the Iranian people to speak out for their fundamental freedoms. PLEITGEN (voice-over): But now, Iran says the U.S.'s support of Israel's operation in Gaza, killing tens of thousands of Palestinians and police action against some of those occupying campuses is tarnishing America's own reputation. PLEITGEN: Iran's leadership has been extremely vocal about the pro- Palestinian protests going on, on some U.S. campuses. They say the arrests that have been seen undermine America's role as a leading supporter both of civil rights and of free speech. PLEITGEN (voice-over): For decades, Iran has been the U.S. and Israel's strongest adversary in the Middle East. Iran and Israel recently trading direct military blows for the first time. I went to a press conference of the Iranian Foreign Ministry, the spokesman saying Tehran believes global opinion is now shifting their way. Public opinion of the world and free thinkers of the world will not tolerate this genocide and their loud voice won't be silenced, he said. And through police actions and violent crackdown policies, they cannot silence the voice of those that protest against this crime and genocide. Tehran ripping into the U.S. as the protesters on American campuses demand schools divest from Israel and want the Biden administration to pressure Israel to stop its attacks.

President William Ruto, who is a champion across the African continent for climate action, has called these people the victims of climate change. Yes, there is extreme weather. There is a lack of infrastructure here. But, it's all been exacerbated by the changing climate.And as African leaders have constantly pointed out, that even though Africa contributes about four percent of the global greenhouse gas emissions, the people worst affected by the effects of climate change are here on the continent. And from my own reporting being here and reported across up and down the continent in Nigeria, in Malawi, elsewhere, the people who are most affected are those who can least defend themselves. They're usually the poorest of people who live on just enough to subsist them for that day.
