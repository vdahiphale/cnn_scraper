But, you know, it's not as if that threat just went away or disappeared or, you know, went into the ether, it's still very real. Trump is now running his third election campaign, as you've just been saying on this program. And this time he will be surrounded by people who are much more serious about carrying out, not just in foreign policy, but in domestic policy, in all kinds of spheres, much harsher and much more anti-constitutional policies.One more thing I would say is that, remember, Trump is now running explicitly - explicitly on a policy of rejecting the U.S. Constitution, of saying that the insurrection on January the 6th was correct, was the right thing to do. He will then - he will then be a U.S. president who takes power, having explicitly rejected the U.S. Constitution. And that will be something that we have not had ever before.",

It's slowly beginning to dawn on them that this could be real.I mean remember that U.S. support for -- sorry, European support for Ukraine is actually about the same size as American support for Ukraine. It comes in different forms. Some of it is financial rather than military. And so it's not as if Europe has been doing nothing, but it's still, you know, it's still the - the, you know, the bulk of the ammunition, much of the military equipment and aid, much of the intelligence is still coming from the U.S. because that's how NATO was set up. That's how the - you know, that's how - that's how - that was how it was -- has worked from the beginning. And I don't think they're really ready. You know, remember that U.S. allies in Asia are also watching this with the same - same amount of trepidation. I mean if - if Trump would abandon Ukraine, would he save Taiwan?

You know, these are - these will immediately, everywhere in the world where the U.S. has any interest or any stakes - and, by the way, this is - this is true, you know, even - even if Trump loses if the Republicans refuse to give aid to Ukraine, this could also - this could have a similar effect.",

And it was highlighted just again last week in a massive release of data from the National Transportation Safety Board about a close call in Austin in February. The air traffic controller in that case said he was working an overtime shift on a six-day week. In that incident, a landing FedEx flight, a departing Southwest flight came within about 100 feet of colliding on the runway. It was the pilots of the FedEx flight that saved the day.Now, the air traffic control staffing system is a huge issue that the FAA is scrambling to fix. The Department of Transportation says that it is 3,000 workers short. And when you factor in retirements and attrition, the workforce has grown by only single digits. A net gain of only six employees. Now, former air traffic controller union head Paul Rinaldi tells me there is no doubt that workers are stressed. Listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
