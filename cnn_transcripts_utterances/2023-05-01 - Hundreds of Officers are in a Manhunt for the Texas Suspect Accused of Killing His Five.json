Welcome to CNN Tonight.A manhunt is underway for the suspect in that mass shooting in Texas, including nine-year-old boy. The victims had allegedly asked the suspect to stop shooting his rifle next to their house. The noise was keeping their baby awake. But instead of simply arguing with them, he shot and killed five of his neighbors. There's also the 79-year-old Illinois man who fatally shot his neighbor for using a leaf blower in his own driveway and the 29-year- old in Texas who shot and killed a guy for posing as a valet parking attendant. What used to be screaming matches are fistfights have become fatal shootings. Tonight, our panel offers their explanations for why. Plus, the suicide of a 17-year-old student at an elite boarding school is forcing the school to admit the horrible mistakes they made when it came to bullying and how they felt, quote, tragically short in protecting this promising young man. What this case tells us about today's version of bullying. And how many of you out there are members of the Kiss army, like me, and know that Paul Stanley was made for loving you? Yes, he was. Well, now, Kiss' Paul Stanley, someone who knows a lot about wearing makeup, he dazzled us in high boots. He is sharing his thoughts about gender identities, and he seems upset. We have a lot to discuss. Okay. But we start with the serious topic of the manhunt of the suspect in the Texas massacre of five people, including a nine-year- old child. He is considered armed and dangerous. More than 250 law enforcement officers are on the hunt for him tonight. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Now, all of a sudden, we have the dry dirt from below, now up on top all crumbled up. And so, the wind that we had around this low pressure, right over the Great Lakes was up to 45 miles per hour today.And there is rain here, but there is not rain where the crashes were occurring, where the dust storm was occurring. Now the winds are down to about 20. This green area, about 20 miles per hour. But tomorrow afternoon the same thing could occur again, winds are going to be 45 miles per hour one more time. So, let's get to this. This is very much the heart of Corn Country. Here is Chicago, here is -- all the way through Illinois. Here is Springfield. I-55 coming down south of Springfield. And this is where it occurred. What do we see here? Concrete, no. We see dirt. We see farmland. We see fields. We see farmers doing farming things especially now at the beginning of May. Tilling that soil, tilling that dirt over, making it crumbly. All of a sudden you have so much exposed dirt and so much exposed dust, the wind came across those farm fields and right here on to I-55 where all of that occurred earlier today. The winds are coming across the field, picking up the dirt, picking up the sand, the dust, the soil from what the farmers need to do every spring. It's just two things went together at the wrong time, Alisyn.",

A spokesperson says Lightfoot died of natural causes at a hospital in Toronto. Just last month he canceled his 2023 U.S. and Canada concerts due to health-related issues. And you can hear what's probably his best loved song, \"If You Could Read My Mind.\" (MUSIC PLAYING)",
