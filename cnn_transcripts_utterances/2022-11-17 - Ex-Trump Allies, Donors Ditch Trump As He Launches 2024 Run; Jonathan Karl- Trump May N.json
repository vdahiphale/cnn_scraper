We're also seeing a growing number of the GOP billionaire mega donors distancing themselves from Trump including Blackstone CEO Steve Schwarzman, who told CNN he believes it is time to move on from the former president.Citadel Group Hedge fund CEO Ken Griffin also says he plans to back Ron DeSantis, when and if he runs. A spokesman for the cosmetic heir Ronald Lauder conforming to CNN that he is also not going to be backing Trump's 2024 bit. So joining us now to talk about all of this who better than ABC News Chief Washington Correspondent, Jonathan Karl who is the author of the best-selling book, 'Betrayal: The Final Act of the Trump Show' which is now available in paperback we should note. John, you and I covered the Trump White House together, spent many years in that briefing room. It is remarkable to me though, to see these donors, these people close to Trump who aren't running for president 2024 turning on him in this way. And I wonder if you think it's final?",

I mean, there was only a single member of Congress there, all these loyalists that he has in the House, and he still has loyalists in the House. But the only one that managed to come was Madison Cawthorn. And he's only going to be a member of Congress until the first week of January because he lost his reelection. So will it last? That's a great question, Kaitlan. I mean, the thing that did Republicans fear most about Trump at this moment is that - is that if he cannot win the Republican nomination, he will allow nobody else to win.

Most companies, we found that were just as productive on Zoom, if not more productive, but we can also hire from everywhere, we can increase diversity. And I think the way to predict the future is to look what young people and young companies are doing, and they are voting with flexibility. So that's where I think the future is going.

We want to leave with values. At the same time, we have 4 million people in some nights living together from nearly every country in the world with different political backgrounds and we have to be able to be bridge builders, bringing them together.So I've chosen to weigh in when they are issues that we know something about. When there was a travel ban. In early 2017, we said well, we know something about travel. So we're going to speak out against that and we spoke out against it. We even put together a Super Bowl ad. There are there other issues that we don't weigh in as much. So I think it's really about do these issues, connect to who you are as a company what you stand.",
