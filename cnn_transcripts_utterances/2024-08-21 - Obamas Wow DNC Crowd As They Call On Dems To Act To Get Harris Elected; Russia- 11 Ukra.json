So it did work out well for the two of them.Joining us now, former DNC vice-chair Michael Blake is here with us, and former Republican congressmen for Illinois, Joe Walsh. Gentlemen, what a night. I'm starting with you because it wasn't Doug Emhoff, it wasn't a politician, it wasn't a celebrity that took the night away. It was one person who is not running for office and who happens to have the initials M.O. MICHAEL BLAKE, FORMER DNC VICE CHAIR, FORMER WHITE House AIDE FOR PRESIDENT OBAMA:  First lady Obama shut the place down last night. You can tell she has been waiting for years to give that speech. She was tired of Trump disrespecting her and her family and reminding folks that her husband had the Black job of presidency and one of her closest friends is about to have that Black job in Kamala Harris. And she did it with swag. I mean, we just can't ignore that. As a former Obama aide, last night was one of those moments that you just will never forget because we were hyped to see our bosses take the stage. But let's be very clear, in that household, first lady Obama took everything over last night. JOE WALSH, (R) FORMER U.S. REPRESENTATIVE FROM ILLINOIS:  And as a former conservative Republican congressman, she gave a speech that I could have given 12 years ago. It was amazing. She appealed to American values, regular values -- the things that matter. The things that my party used to talk about. And it was inclusive. She wrapped her arms around everybody and contrasted herself and the Democrats right now with the stuff that my former party is feeding us, which is just fear.",

Because she also tied in the dynamic of Trump has consistently failed up and has been able to have success that we don't get to have.And so when you talk about a Black job -- and we're -- let's be very clear. They mean low-wage jobs and all the disrespect that they have right there. She said out loud what we feel. And so as Black folk, not only can you say we're proud, we're excited, but you feel validated by someone saying it to the crowd and saying we will not tolerate the racism that has existed from the other side.

So they have been making progress there, so we're watching that. But we're also seeing now, they say some two weeks in, that there are signs that the Russian resistance, a more organized resistance within the Kursk region is starting to take shape even, of course, as the Ukrainian military shows off its efforts to sort of shoot down with drones Russian trucks and destroy pontoon bridges and things like that. We're hearing again from a Ukrainian commander of a battalion active in Kursk and he says he's seen a shift in the behavior that the Russian units that have brought in and now trying to storm the Ukrainians and are not surrendering in the hundreds as they did at the beginning, he said. But one of the interesting things has been to watch how President Putin himself has responded to this. His response has been to not say very much at all. It's been a little haphazard. Take a look at this split-screen here. On the left you will see what was this week in southern Russian, him greeting crowds of Russians. And then on the right is what he did just a few days after the Prigozhin mutiny. Again, very similar scenes greeting Russians. Showing off, essentially, his popularity and his authority. So what we're seeing him -- is him drawing on this sort of crisis playbook even though it seems on the outset slightly fumbling -- Kate.",

There is so much positive energy. And in American politics we needed that so desperately and Tim Walz helped to bring that, but it's our MVP.

Well, Kate, the new data adds to what's been an ongoing debate about whether there is a possible link between an increased risk of suicidal ideation and taking semaglutide medications. Semaglutide is that active ingredient found in drugs like Ozempic and Wegovy.And what's been said about this so far, the European Medicines Agency has said that there has been no available evidence showing a link. The FDA says it's continuing to monitor this. And some previous studies have found that there may not be a link but there actually may be a lower risk of suicidal ideation. We do know that obesity itself is associated with an increased risk of depression. And I will say the one drug, Wegovy -- on its warning label it does mention monitoring patients for depression or suicidal thoughts. But what this new study now adds to the conversation is in this study researchers looked at reports of suicidal thoughts among patients taking diabetes medications. And they found specifically among patients taking semaglutides there was an elevated rate of these reports by about 45 percent. But again, Kate, this just adds to the ongoing debate. For patients right now, the takeaway message is if you, yourself, have a history of depression or self-harm and you're interested in a semaglutide medication or you're currently taking a medication, then you want to talk to your doctor about our risks and benefits. Your doctor may recommend monitoring you closely for symptoms or side effects. And if you do develop symptoms, they may recommend to stop taking the medication. But this study is no reason to panic.
