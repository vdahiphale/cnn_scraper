These incoming strikes around just coming after 2:00 to 3:00 here in the morning, coming after Hamas launched its most coordinated assault in decades, militants storming Israel's border, taking hostages and firing thousands of rockets. Right, now intense fighting is still taking place between Israeli Security Forces and Hamas fighters, as Israel is trying to regain control of all of its communities and bases. And Israeli official says at least 300 Israelis have been killed, but the former prime minister of Israel, Naftali Bennett, tells me that number is much higher. He'll be with me in a moment. We do have gruesome video in, though, right now which appears to show Palestinian militants opening fire on a civilian car. You hear the gunshots, the car crashes, and there are no signs of life inside. Dozens of Israelis, we know, have been taken hostage, including this young woman who was kidnapped and taken away on a motorcycle. And in just a moment, I'm going to be speaking to her roommate this hour. Now, Hamas is warning anyone taken hostage is now, quote, present in all axis of the Gaza strip, what happens to the people of the Gaza strip will happen to them and beware of miscalculation. Meantime the Israeli military is mobilizing tens of thousands of reservists, fighter jets and drones are now carrying out strikes on Hamas targets in Gaza. The show of force, though, really coming only after Israel was caught completely by surprise, despite investing enormous amounts of money and resources into its intelligence agencies. And tonight, we're learning the United States may be just hours away from announcing new assistance to Israel. Our team of reporters is standing by. Nic Robertson live in Israel tonight, Sam Kiley also with us from London. And let me begin with you, Nic. There were rockets behind you when we just spoke about a half an hour ago. You had sort of a barrage, an assault coming in, which was fended off successfully by Israel's Iron Dome Missile Defense System. What is happening now?",

Just over the hill to my left over this direction here, earlier on this evening, we've now learned that Hamas tried to assault the beach there with a seven-man force to have another incursion after nightfall into this area of Israel. That's a completely separate incursion to those that occurred this morning. Now, that was intercepted by Israeli Defense Forces. They did control that situation. But, of course, the concern is, as you say, all of those Hamas militants that came across the border, where are they? That's something Israel has to be able to answer, and it's trying to do that tonight.",

But something on this scale is completely out with their experiences, not what they've been expecting.It is, in some ways, people's worst nightmares. People living close to Gaza earlier on today found themselves cowering in their houses with Hamas militants banging on the doors, pulling some of them out in some cases, hiding, trying not to get caught. And, of course, everyone in Israel is aware of this. They've seen the pictures. They know what's happening in their country. And what we witnessed earlier today when we flew in here and arrived at Ben Gurion Airport, Israelis very afraid of the situation that they were in. I saw people clutching loved ones and hugging each other as sirens were going off, as intercepts were happening in the air above, people lying on the ground crying because they were afraid. It has brought a level of fear even to scenarios like missile attacks that people are familiar with. It is unsettling and unnerving, and it will take quite naturally a little bit of time for people to get accustomed to that and to find their feet with it and to know where they are in terms of their own emotions about it.",

Nic, thank you very much.And tonight, an IDF spokesman telling me that dozens of Israelis, including a substantial number of civilians, are being held hostage right now by Hamas. He told the story of one group that had been freed as we were speaking but saying it is dozens remaining. It's a terrifying situation and one that he called delicate in terms of what it does to limit Israel's potential response. We do want to warn you, some of the images that we are going to share about what we know about these hostages are graphic, and Sam Kiley is out front. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SAM KILEY, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice over):  A living nightmare begins for this woman taken hostage as he disappears in a captured jeep with Israeli military plates into Gaza. Palestinian militants launched a complex attack killing dozens of Israelis on assaults from the air, sea and land. And they've claimed to have taken numerous hostages. The Israel Defense Forces say they are prisoners of war. And this soldier was captured alive after his tank was destroyed at the Gaza border. His fate is now unknown. The Al-Qassam Brigade released a heavily edited propaganda video that purports to show militants overrunning Israel's Erez crossing, the most heavily fortified location on the Gaza fence. The video shows dead Israelis and prisoners. Their fate is also unknown. These scenes are intended to galvanize widespread attacks against Israel. Amid this, Hamas call to arms, if you have a gun, get it out, he said. This is the time to use it. Get out with trucks, cars, axes. Today is the most glory notice and honorable history begins. So far, that call has not been answered. But the Hamas operation involved unprecedented firefights inside Israeli territory, in which civilian cars were targeted in Sderot and civilians gunned down on roads, where what are reported to be militants were also killed.",

This is the IDF approach to not only Gaza but also managing the level of violence they unleash against Gaza that doesn't result in a conflagration elsewhere, an uprising on the West Bank or within the Israeli-Arab population, the ethnic Palestinians who have Israeli citizenship, live inside Israel. There's a heavily armed population, according to a Knesset report.So, all of these are combined, and all of them are part of the Hamas planning. They know, and the Israelis know, that they're going to walk into some kind of trap that's already been set in Gaza for which the bait really are these very significant numbers of hostages. Now, Israel takes hostages extremely seriously, and this does give the Hamas militants a very, very serious advantage when it comes to any kind of future negotiations they might enter with Israel through third parties, such as Qatar and Egypt, as they have done in the past, Erin.",

And then if the residents didn't come out, they started burning their houses so the smoke would push people out. I was on the phone with people while this was happening. They were sort of whispering so the terrorists don't hear them. This is reminiscent of horrible things in our past. And it should not happen. It was sort of like a pogrom but this is the state of Israel. And at the same time, I can tell you, Erin, that our soldiers, our fighters have a very strong spirit. We're ready to go. They want to fight back, and they are fighting back. Unfortunately, not few commanders have died in action, and the commanders have fallen because that's what Israeli commanders do.

What's interesting, President Biden also put out a message just a few minutes ago on Twitter basically saying other countries in the area who are thinking of interfering, don't. That's a signal to Hezbollah, Iran and various other nations that might pile on to this terrorist attack by Hamas.

I want to go to Ian Bremmer now, world renowned global affairs analyst, host G-Zero World on PBS. So, Ian, you've said this is Israel's 9/11. You hear Oren talking about this, I mean, a massive attack months in the planning, the former prime minister of Israel was saying that to me, as well. And now they have to be fears of what else they don't know. I mean, such an intelligence failure by such an elite intelligence force, right, one of the world's -- the creme de la creme.

It's their surveillance on the ground with human intelligence, operatives. It's their border security, and it's also the Israeli Defense Forces, and all of them failed in unprecedented fashion.But I remember a few months ago, Erin, when you and I were talking about Israel before, we weren't talking about the Palestinians. We were talking about something else that was unprecedented, demonstrations that were going on, larger than you've ever seen, every day, you know, consistently across the country because of the judicial reform. And that included a lot of defense forces of Israel. There was obviously a lot of distraction going on because the Israelis were focused on their own internal instability. Also, so many of Israel's Defense Forces have been focused on the West Bank, on border security there, as well as on settlements, Israeli settlements that have been expanding under this right wing coalition Netanyahu government and also on Palestinian backlash and violence against Israeli civilians and Israeli settlers. All of that means that you had far fewer Israeli troops on the ground in the south that would be defending against the Palestinians, Hamas radicals, coming over these borders. So, you're right, of course, I do believe this is Israel's 9/11. We already know of hundreds of Israeli civilians dead in a country of less than 10 million people. Just imagine what that would be in a country like the United States, not to mention the fact that you now have the -- all of these civilians being held hostage, many of whom -- dozens of whom have been brought back to Gaza where the Israelis have now declared war.

It doesn't mean it can't ever come back, but, certainly, the Saudis were expect is at least some window dressing that the Israelis would improve the situation with the Palestinians. That obviously the exact opposite of that, will now necessarily happen in response to these terrorist attacks. Also, the idea that the Israelis are going to be cutting a deal with the Saudis in today's environment, when the Saudis' initial foreign ministry reaction was not that -- they were still condemning the attacks but they were saying that Israel was partially responsible for them because of what they had done to the Palestinians historically.
