There were about 8,000 troops that took place. I think last year, it was closer to 12,000.The number of armored vehicles was far fewer. In fact, there was only -- as you mentioned, there was only one tank that was on display this year. And that was a Second World War tank. So no modern tanks. The centerpiece, of course, remained the intercontinental ballistic missiles. One of them, at least, that was paraded through the cobbles of Red Square. So they're still taking pains to make sure everybody understands that Russia is a nuclear power. But the fact that there was such a reduced number of -- of military vehicles, reduced number of personnel there, as well, I think is a reflection of two things. First of all, the security concern because, you know, there's been an upsurge in attacks against key Russian installations over the course of the last couple of weeks. Just last week, there was an attack by drones, according to the Kremlin against the Kremlin itself, just a short distance from where this parade was being held. And so there was a great deal of insecurity and concern and tension ahead of this military parade. Secondly, I think there's -- there's, you know, speculation that actually, Russia doesn't have that much military equipment that isn't already deployed that it can draw on to display in a military parade like this. And so, it was a very telling military parade, Victory Day parade this year, Poppy.",

They're saying after Thursday, that number could shoot up by another 2,000 to 10,000 per day. Here on the streets of Brownsville, we saw firsthand people sleeping on the streets. The record numbers that they're already seeing here prompted the city last month to declare a state of emergency. Team Brownsville, which is a nonprofit that helps migrants after they cross into Brownsville and the Rio Grande Valley, says at its respite center, they have 1,000 migrants staying there, and they're at capacity, which is why people here are sleeping on the streets. Overnight, you mentioned Texas Governor Greg Abbott announcing a security operation, securing a point that has been used historically as illegal point of entry for individuals crossing, Abbott saying he expects to do the same in other border communities like El Paso, which just like here and the Rio Grande Valley, has historically seen a large number of people cross, using it to cross the border. The Biden administration, meanwhile, has announced 1,500 active-duty troops are going to be sent here to the border. They'll join 2,500 National Guard members who will serve in an administrative capacity over the course of the next 90 days. They have a plan in place, but the big question is will that plan work?

And in conversations I've had with key allies, as well as close aides to the speaker over the last 24 hours, one thing has emerged as increasingly surprising but true. McCarthy walks into this meeting today with potentially more leverage than anyone in that room expected him to have. And that is because the vast majority of his conference was united around a plan to reduce spending and increase the debt ceiling. And many of them tell me that they still trust the speaker to go into that room, negotiate the best deal that he can, and that's not to say that a resolution comes out of one meeting.

And they will get something done. And they're hoping, look, the risk of a default is not zero. And that's a terrible position to be in, but they're hoping that something gets done here. When you look at the treasuries and the treasury market, that's where you can start to see the stress playing out and the worries playing out. The cost to ensure against a default have skyrocketed.
