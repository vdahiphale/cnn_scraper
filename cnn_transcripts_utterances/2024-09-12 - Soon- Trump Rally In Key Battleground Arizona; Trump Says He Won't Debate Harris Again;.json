We'll monitor that. CNNs Steve Contorno is at the Trump event in Tucson. Eva McKend is with Kamala Harris in North Carolina. We'll get Harris's reaction to all of this. But Steve, let me go to you first. What reason does Trump give for not doing another debate? STEVE CONTORNO, CNN CORRESPONDENTNow, I should note that a CNN poll of registered voters who watched the debates, 67 percent of them, excuse me, 63 percent of them said that Harris outperformed Trump. Trump, though, is making the case and his campaign has made the case that they have gotten more of a bump out of this debate than Harris has. And they see no need for a second debate when 65 million people watch the first one. So instead, he is hitting the road. Today, he's in Arizona, a critical battleground, also a border state. So we can expect that immigration will be on his mind. It certainly was at Tuesday's debates. He also is going to focus on the economy on this -- behind me on the stage, there are signs set up with some of his economic messaging, including make housing great again and no taxes on tips, even in a state like Arizona, where it's a border state and immigration ads have been flooding the airwaves. Most voters say the economy is their number one priority going into this election, just as it is in all the other swing states, Wolf.",

And although winning a debate is not the same thing as winning an election, they feel as though overall it just provided a lot of momentum for the campaign though they are still measured in their response and know that they have a lot of work to do.Wolf, let's talk about North Carolina. They believe that this state is really in play this cycle for a whole host of reasons. One of which they feel as though the candidate, the Republican candidate for governor here is especially weak in a way that benefits them. They also are encouraged by the amount of momentum here when it comes to early voting, 161,000 people have requested ballots to vote early. You also have nearly a dozen historically black colleges and universities in this state, and so they can speak directly to those voters. [17:05:13] I can tell you that I spoke to some young women in the crowd from Bennett College. They are very excited, and this is the first time that they'll be participating in a Presidential Election. And so for those reasons and then also running on the strength of reproductive rights, they think that they can really compete in this state in a way that they haven't been able to do in the recent past. I'll leave you with this Wolf. The last time a presidential candidate was a Democratic presidential candidate was successful in this state, it was 2008 with President Obama, And let's take a listen to how the Vice President spoke about the debate in Charlotte earlier this evening.

But one of the things he clearly did not like was that contrast on stage. The contrast benefited Vice President Kamala Harris. It did not benefit Donald Trump.Of course, he could have a rematch. He could actually prepare for this debate, which clearly he did not do for the debate in Philadelphia. But no, I'm not surprised necessarily at the outcome, because he is trying to live in an alternative universe where he says he won the debate. He says polls say he won the debate. That clearly is not true. Republican advisers, Republican allies, Republicans who want him to win tell me they think he missed a big opportunity. So the reality here is he believes he can sort of live in this unity or this world where he is saying he won but he clearly didn't.

Do you see Trump refusing to do another debate as a tacit admission that he scared and that he lost?MICHAEL ERIC DYSON, AUTHOR, \"REPRESENT THE UNFINISHED FIGHT FOR THE VOTE\": Of course, she beat him like a dirty rug. She smoked him like a pack of Menthols, and his fatal mediocrity was revealed. Here is a man whose delusional narcissism has made him believe that somehow he won that battle. Remember, he said she had just turned Black, so he was racially charged in his rhetoric, and then he said she was stupid and not very bright. She was so bright she just charged you with intelligence and logic and overwhelmed him. Here's a guy who's proud to be unmolested by enlightenment, facing up against a woman who was his intellectual superior, and she drugged him in all certain terms.

But overall, he got off track for most of the debate after the economic portion was done.I'm not surprised that he wouldn't want to do another debate. I don't think there's much to be gained for him in another debate. I think, you know, he's done seven. He won one, which was the Biden debate in June. The other six, the snap polls say he didn't win, and he lost three to Hillary, but he still won the election.

She filleted him, breaded him, fried him, and then chewed him up and had him for dinner. So this is undeniable. Donald Trump is used to lying and saying lies so many times over and over and over again that he himself begins believing them and thinks people are stupid and going to believe them also. The reason he's not doing another debate is because he thinks it's not going to be good for him. And it's very ironic, because we all remember, he spent weeks, if not months, you know, mocking Joe Biden for not wanting to do a debate, which was false, but he would do it at every rally. I think Kamala Harris should do the same to him, mock him, goat him, call him a coward, call him a chicken. Send people in chicken costumes to his rallies. And, you know, remind him that if he wants to -- then if he's so brave and he wants to defend his boxing title, he should go back in the ring.",

But now he is in front of a very friendly audience who is cheering him on. As you said, he said he had a monumental victory. At one point, he said that they won with women and independents. Of course, as we know, our polling did not show that. They havepointed they the Trump campaign to a number of conservative straw polls taken right after the debate. But as we have reported repeatedly, there were a lot of people who went into this debate knowing who they were going to vote for. So it's not surprising that, if you look at a conservative straw poll, that conservatives would think Donald Trump won the debate. But obviously our polling didn't show that. He went through a number of different claims. He criticized the moderators. All of this appears to be a lead up as to why he is not doing this third debate, as he announced earlier today. Just a couple of things that he said, he said that the Kamala Harris claimed I want to want monitor women's pregnancies. That's not something I want to do. But he really particularly took issue with the fact that the moderators fact- checked him unsurprisingly, and then he said that they didn't fact- check her even when she was talking about Project 2025. That is something we know has gotten under his skin of all things. He mentioned this twice in just the short span. He was speaking that they didn't say anything about the fact that he has claimed to have nothing to do with Project 2025. Then he went on to his same claims about the fact that he won the debate, and that she said, no, to the other debates that she asked for a second debate right away, which means he won. And, Wolf, this is just him again, relitigating the entire debate. I can tell you time and time again over the last several days, I have picked up the phone and called Republican allies of Donald Trump, who have said in different words that they were disappointed with his performance on Tuesday night. Do they think it cost him the election? No. But he is hearing from people, and he is hearing these reports of Republicans saying that he could have done a better job. He should have stuck to the issues. That is what every Republican that wants him to win in November has told me about his debate performance. And clearly it is getting back to Donald Trump, who seems anxious on stage. He is ranting. He is angry. All of this again, relitigating Tuesday night, but this time he is in front of a crowd of Trump supporters. You can hear them cheering. He's getting the reaction he wants in that room.",

But to Kristen's point, so many of his allies thought that he missed an opportunity. He went down one rabbit hole after another. He followed the exact debate that the Vice President was trying to leave for him about crowd sizes, et cetera, and he's ranting. But that does not mean that his supporters won't like it. They obviously will, but one of the whole issues here is he spent so much time in his bubble delivering many of the lines on stage at the debate that he does at rallies, into friendly audiences, and they simply do not comport with the reality here.

Jen, thanks very much for joining us. You just heard Brian's report. Trump on Saturday, threatened to jail election officials if he wins in November. He posted, when I win, these people that cheated will be prosecuted. Has your agency reached out to any election officials to provide support for them in the midst of these threats?",

They're our neighbors. They're our friends. They're in our communities. And they're not doing this for pay or glory. They're doing it because they believe in our democracy and they deserve our support and our respect and our gratitude.",

And we have the threats from foreign adversaries who are intent on undermining American confidence in our democracy. But I spend an enormous amount of time with election officials. They have done tremendous work to ensure that the security and resilience of election infrastructure is better than it has ever been.They have put safeguards in place to mitigate risk, and I have incredible confidence in them, and the American people should as well. But for those who don't, be part of the process, be a poll worker, talk to your election official. It's a transparent process. What they'll tell you is three key things. First of all, for the voting systems that you'll use to cast your ballots, they are not connected to the internet. Secondly, 97 percent of registered voters will cast their vote in jurisdictions that have paper records. Those records can be verified to ensure accuracy. And finally, election officials put multiple safeguards. There's testing before they use election equipment, there's cyber security controls, there's physical security controls, and there's post-election auditing. So multiple layers of controls that can help to ensure that risk to election infrastructure is reduced as much as possible.",
