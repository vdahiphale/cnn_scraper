      "sentences": "Hello, I'm Anna Coren live from Hong Kong. Ahead on CNN Newsroom.Air raid siren sound in Japan and South Korea after North Korea tries and fails to launch a satellite into space. Vladimir Putin accuses Ukraine of trying to kill Russian civilians, even as his military continues to pound residential targets across its border. And leaders in artificial intelligence are sounding the alarm early warning of the potential for global annihilation if their technology is left unchecked. After weeks of hype, preparation and international concern, North Korea says its attempt to launch its first military spy satellite has failed. Well, state media reports the missile carrying a satellite malfunction during the second stage of launch and crushed into the sea. South Korea says this is a piece of it. Pyongyang says its national space agency will investigate the failure urgently and attempt another launch soon. The launch early Wednesday morning jolted South Korea as air raid sirens blasted in the capital Seoul. The situation was similar in Japan where authorities issued emergency alerts for the southern island of Okinawa and urged residents to take shelter. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) HIROKAZU MATSUNO, JAPANESE GOVERNMENT SPOKESMAN (through translator): North Korea's continued actions threaten the safety and security of our country, the region and the international community. This kind of ballistic missile launch violates U.N. Security Council resolutions. Our country has lodged a complaint against North Korea through diplomatic channels in Beijing. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "Well, it was confusing for many, Anna, it's certainly not the usual to have an air raid siren here that has not been pre-planned as part of a drill. And there was also some confusion when it came to the text messages that come through the emergency alerts as they're known as usually. This one was a presidential alert just 10 minutes after that air raid siren telling people to evacuate. And it was another 20 minutes before another alert came out saying that that had been sent in error.Now it was the fact that this flight path had been shown ahead of time or had been warned ahead of time by Pyongyang. North Korea had said that they were going to carry out this this military satellite launch. They said it would be between May 31 And June 11. They'd warn Japan's Coast Guard, for example, who had then given a security warning for ships in the area for any possible falling debris. What we know from the North Korean side, we've heard through state run media, a very unusual and a very swift admission that it did not work that this rocket failed. They said that there was an issue with the engine in the second stage so unusual in itself that they would be quite so open about this. But what they did say is that they are going to try again as soon as possible. So of course, depending on whether they have another rocket ready or potentially another satellite to try and launch into space really determines how soon as soon as possible will be. But there has been political fallout here in South Korea. There is confusion as to why an alert was put out when the residents in Seoul did not appear to be in any danger. And we spoke to some people on the street about it. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (through translator): I thought it was an urgent situation and soon it turned out to be false. So I was very confused. Such an important issue must be delivered cautiously. But this time it wasn't. UNIDETIFIED MALE (through translator): At the moment the Korean government seems to have a backward system on issues as warnings and disasters. So it needs to be improved. But it seems it's not going well. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

North Korea, even though it does have a failure will of course have learned something from this process and is planning to do this once again. Now, the condemnation came in quickly from South Korea, from Japan, from the United States as well saying that they are concerned that these risks destabilizing the region but that condemnation came even before this launch happened when North Korea said that it was going to carry this launch out there. Now from Pyongyang's point of view, they say that it's necessary for them to have a military satellite in space to be able to counter what they call the dangers from the United States. They refer back to the U.S.-South Korean military drills, and the fact that they need to be able to monitor what is going on. And that is their reason for putting or trying to put this satellite into space. Anna.",

      "sentences": "Absolutely, Anna. The U.S. is accusing China of a risky encounter of the South China Sea on Tuesday. The U.S. military said that a Chinese fighter jet carried out what it called an unnecessarily aggressive maneuver involving a U.S. military plane above the South China Sea in international airspace.This incident took place last week on May the 26th and video of this encounter has been released. Let's bring it up for you. And in this video, which was released by the U,S, military this was taken from the cockpit of the U,S, reconnaissance plane an RFC 135. It shows there the Chinese J-16 against the clear blue sky. It's moving from right to left and then it makes a move it cuts in front of the U.S. plane's nose and cockpit and the U,S, plane visibly is shaking as a result of the wake turbulence that was caused by that maneuver. The U.S. Indo-Pacific Command said that the plane, the U.S. reconnaissance plane was carrying out a safe and routine operation. It also added this nice statement quote the U.S. will continue to fly sail and operate safely and responsibly wherever international law allows and the U.S. Indo-Pacific Joint Force will continue to fly in international airspace with due regard for the safety of all vessels and aircraft under international law. The spokesperson for China's embassy in Washington DC offered a response to that U.S. military statement. The spokesperson Liu Pengyu saying this quote, China urges the U.S. to stop such dangerous publications and to stop deflecting blame on China, unquote. And we are awaiting the daily Ministry of Foreign Affairs briefing to take place in just a couple hours from now for additional response from Beijing. But this incident that took place on May the 26th according to the U.S. military represents part of a bigger trend of increasingly risky behavior being undertaken by Chinese military aircraft. In fact, it was in December when one Chinese military plane came within three meters or 10 feet of a U.S. military plane and forced that American plane to take evasive measures. And of course the incident that happened the latest one on May the 26th is happening as tensions continue to simmer between these two global superpowers over an increasingly long list of issues from Taiwan from access to technology like semiconductors and of course, ongoing territorial disputes in the South China Sea.

And now the captain is under investigation for culpable manslaughter. CNN Scott McLean has the details.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SCOTT MCLEAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT (on camera): There are a lot of unanswered questions here. But what we know so far is that Sunday evening, a 16-meter houseboat set sail in Lake Maggiore outside of Milan for a birthday party. It had 24 people on board, two of them were crew members. There were no official weather warnings at the time and yet, the boat was apparently hit by what Italian media described as a waterspout that came out of the blue causing it to capsize. Some of the 20 survivors managed to swim to shore others were rescued. Four bodies have now been recovered, and by Tuesday morning, the focus was on getting the boat off the bottom of the lake. Now adding to the mystery of all this is that two of the four victims were active Italian Secret Service agents meaning intelligence officials. A third was a retired employee of the Israeli security forces according to the Israeli Foreign Ministry. Now, Israeli media is also reporting that the only reason he was on the boat at all was because he had missed his flight earlier in the day. Now according to the prosecutor in the case, the Italian military police have been called into hell because the case may deal with state secrets. The boat's captain whose girlfriend was the fourth victim is under investigation for culpable manslaughter because the boat was overloaded beyond its passenger capacity. Scott McLean, CNN, London.

So they're racing to develop increasingly powerful systems.And they're putting that priority ahead of safety. What this means is that we don't really know how to control these systems reliably, nor do we really understand their inner workings at all. So that means that we have an extremely powerful technology which could be potentially a loose cannon. So that's one possible risk. And that could possibly, like the nuclear arms race, lead to humanity's extinction. A more typical concern someone could have is if we have advanced AI systems, someone could repurpose them, maliciously use it for harm. They could use it to develop a bioweapon, or they could use it to develop a rogue AI agent and have that try and takeover. Somebody tried to do that already, but fortunately current AI technologies are not powerful enough to pose the risk of extinction, but given the extremely rapid pace in this AI arms race, we may arrive at that point much more quickly than most people are expecting.

But you know, people in the early 30s weren't thinking that nuclear weapons were that large of a concern and then we started building them and then it became more concerning.Now we're starting to build AI systems that are about good as human on some tasks but not all of them. But the point may be reached soon where we have AI systems that are potentially smarter than people. Humanity has been able to be the apex species on Planet Earth because of our intelligence. Not because we have the sharpest teeth, not because we have the biggest muscles. So AI may end up taking that mantle.
