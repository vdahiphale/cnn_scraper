I'm John Vause at the CNN Center in Atlanta where it's just gone midnight, and at this hour US President Joe Biden is on his way to Israel, a high stakes visit which became even more complicated as scenes of chaos and devastation unfold in the aftermath of an explosion at a hospital in Gaza.And a warning, the images you're about to see are hard to watch. According to Palestinian officials, hundreds of people at the hospital were killed in an Israeli airstrike. The Israel Defense Forces, though, denies that. Insisting the explosion was caused by a rocket that was misfired by the Palestinian Islamic Jihad Movement, sources tell CNN. The US is analyzing intelligence which is being provided by Israel. The World Health Organization says the hospital has been treating hundreds of wounded Palestinians, has also been a sheltering place for thousands of people forced to leave their homes in Gaza. Global condemnation has been swift. The UN human rights chief calls it horrific and unacceptable. US President Biden says he's outraged and deeply saddened. Here's the Palestinian ambassador to the UN. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And once you get the material, you'll be able to see it, and you'll be able to have proper analysts have a look at it. But the bottom line is that we stand by the information that we released.

And at the border crossing, footage shows smoke billowing from multiple airstrikes nearby on Tuesday. Desperate families gather here for hours a day, praying authorities will allow their exit. So far a diplomatic standoff keeping this crucial corridor shut. Cairo is reluctant to take in refugees but says it wants to see aid allowed into the enclave.
