His Republican political opponent, former House January 6th Committee co-chair, Liz Cheney, just found out. Later, what alleged CEO killer, Luigi Mangione will face in a Pennsylvania courtroom tomorrow and what he could be facing when he's brought back to New York to face murder charges as soon as tomorrow night. Good evening. Jim Sciutto here sitting in for Anderson. If you're looking for a preview of the kind of drama and potential dysfunction that could be coming when Donald Trump takes office, and everything changes when someone hits post on social media, you got a taste today and he's not even president yet, and he is not even the one who hit post. His new friend who nobody elected to do anything, by the way, did, and it could lead to a government shutdown Friday night at midnight. Until this morning, that seemed at least somewhat unlikely. Republicans, who narrowly control the House and Democrats had agreed on a 1,500-page stopgap spending bill. A number of Republicans were unhappy with parts of that measure, but House Speaker Johnson was behind it. Then Elon Musk, the multi-multi-billionaire man behind the curtain, if you will, posted this: \"Any member of the House or Senate who votes for this outrageous spending bill deserves to be voted out in two years. Musk, along with Vivek Ramaswamy, is one of two unelected billionaires the president-elect has tapped to cut government spending.\" That post and dozens more from Musk was followed by a Trump-JD Vance joint statement calling for a spending bill, \"without Democrat giveaways,\" calling anything else, \"a betrayal of our country.\" In a later post, Trump added another complication calling for lawmakers to raise the debt ceiling, which is always political dynamite, particularly for an incoming president who railed against debt ceiling increases under Democratic leadership, which, as you might imagine, has stopped everything cold now. Except, that is, for a simmering Republican rebellion against the House Speaker. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Everyone who's watching this should strap on their seatbelts because this is what the next four years are going to be like.

And, you know, if this is -- if he's in this kind of jam, now, imagine where he's going to be, then I don't know what's going to happen to him. What was confusing to me is Musk sends out one of his tweets and he says no one should do anything until January 20th when Trump gets there, Trump sends out a tweet saying they ought to pass a clean CR with a debt ceiling -- raising the debt ceiling, because as Adam says, he doesn't want to be blamed for it.

This is the fact that you have widespread conservatives, including Donald Trump, as well as including Elon Musk, about ultimately what has been put into this package. And, you know, the key thing that Donald Trump wants, he's long believed that the debt ceiling should maybe even just be raised and go away, that Congress can eliminate the actual debt ceiling. That's something that you don't necessarily need to have congressional approval to increase in specific amounts.

And this morning, he posted this on social media, quoting now, \"Liz Cheney could be in a lot of trouble based on the evidence obtained by the subcommittee, which states that numerous federal laws were likely broken by Liz Cheney, and these violations should be investigated by the FBI.\" The subcommittee report says that Cheney \"tampered\" with at least one witness referring to former Trump White House staffer, Cassidy Hutchinson, who appeared before the committee. It spotlights conversations between Hutchinson and Congresswoman Cheney, calling it, \"unusual and potentially unethical for a member of Congress conducting an investigation to contact a witness if the member knows that the individual is represented by legal counsel.\" However, as former Congresswoman Cheney writes, it was Hutchinson who contacted her. Here is how she described it in her memoirs: \"She told me that she was inclined to represent herself going forward. I was very sympathetic to her situation, but I did not want our committee to be advising her on what she should do next. I told Cassidy that she could consult another lawyer and seek his or her independent advice on how best to move forward.\" Hutchinson's own account corroborates this, and would appear to cast doubt on the subcommittee's suggestion of wrongdoing, whether that registers with the president-elect is unclear, given his posting today. What is true, either way, given the loyalist he has appointed to lead the FBI, is that he does not even have to issue the order to make bad things happen for Liz Cheney as his full remarks on \"Meet the Press\" seem to show.
