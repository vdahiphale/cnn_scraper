If a president is afraid to act because they're worried about being indicted when they leave office -- a President of the United States has to have immunity and the Supreme Court is going to be ruling on that.

The bottom line is that there's a few things under consideration, Kasie. Number one, if you're going to talk, as everyone does, about everyone being equal under the law, that means the president certainly would be under that umbrella. Why would he be treated any differently than anyone else? Number two, if you want to talk about what immunity would be proper and improper, you can't have a situation where a president could do anything in the Oval Office with impunity and never accept accountability for anything at any time based upon any circumstance. Number three, as you have these trials moving forward and as you have the Supreme Court weighing in on this issue, you have to look at the legal basis for why immunity would be necessary. Can you really commit crimes while you're the president because you're the president and there's nothing to see here? I think immunity may have some place but it certainly doesn't have a place here when you're the president exercising your duties. And so, I think Jack Smith wanted to really put a seal on that deal to have the Supreme Court, as they begin to entertain this matter, entertain it by using its legal basis and purpose and rejected out of hand so these trials can continue. I think he's frustrated by the bottleneck, Kasie, and wants to have these matters proceed.",

Do you have opinions about the case before? Do you like the president? Do you dislike the president? The critical inquiry, rather, is whether you are right for this jury. Whether you can, based upon the facts and evidence in that courtroom, make a rational judgment as to guilt or innocence. And so, is this jury for you? It may not be.
