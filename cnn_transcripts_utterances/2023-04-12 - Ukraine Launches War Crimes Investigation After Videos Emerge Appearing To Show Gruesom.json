We are live in Ukraine.Plus, cries for help. Dramatic new 911 calls from the bank shooting that left five people dead, as we're also learning new details about the shooter's past. And in a story you'll see first on OUTFRONT, fears growing the U.S. could be dragged into a war with China as Beijing says its military, it's ready to fight. Let's go, OUTFRONT. Good evening. I'm Erica Hill, in for Erin Burnett. OUTFRONT tonight, beheaded. Two horrific videos out of Ukraine that appeared to show Russian troops mutilating Ukrainian soldiers. The video is not surprisingly graphic and what we're about to show you, it's just a few images from these two videos. So in this one image, you can see what appears to be a Russian soldier crouched over Ukrainian screaming in pain as that masked soldier uses a knife to behead him. We also have images from a second video, and here you'll see what appear to be the bodies of Ukrainian soldiers that have been beheaded by Russian troops. This sickening footage sending shockwaves across Ukraine, and it all comes as we're learning Russia's private military was trying to buy weapons from a member of NATO. That's according to those leaked us intelligence documents. Members from the Wagner Group actually met according to those documents with their so called Turkish contacts in order to purchase weapons and equipment from Turkey. Of course, this is a country that's already providing military support to Ukraine and has publicly opposed Putin's invasion. Ben Wedeman is OUTFRONT tonight in Eastern Ukraine. So, Ben, I know you've been looking into these just horrific beheading videos. What more do we know about what happened and when it happened?",

The Russians are trying to do everything they can to take the city of Bakhmut. And the Ukrainians are still holding out in one small corner of that city.

He's the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee. Good to have you with us tonight. As I understand it, you had an unclassified briefing this afternoon about this leak of classified intelligence documents. Did this temper any of your concerns? REP. JIM HIMES (D-CT):  We did have a brief, unclassified briefing by telephone today with officials from the Department of Defense. And no, it didn't -- I'm not exactly sure why we had the briefing because it's a little early in the investigation for them to know anything. I suspect it was to try to calm the waters and to out -- to do a little outreach to Congress. But, no, I mean, I must say -- I'm glad to know that the State Department is reaching out to our allies and I'm glad to know that there's an investigation underway. But this is really serious stuff. And, you know, what I didn't hear was something I expect to hear in the coming week or so, which is, you know, who did this? How were they able to do this? And most importantly, how can we make sure it never happens again? And this is pretty key for our allies, right? You know, we rely on our allies to share intelligence and they need to trust us. And right now, for all the soothing tones that I heard from the secretary of state, if I were an ally right now, I would be wondering whether the United States can keep their secrets safe.",

Now, we have this. You know, this is -- this is -- you know, guarding our classified intelligence is truly a matter of life and death for our sources. It's a matter of life and death for soldiers on the Ukrainian battlefield right now. So we just need to do better and no, I'm not going to be mollified until I hear what the plan is to do better.",

Because if they're false, why didn't he bring a defamation claim?So it kind of makes no sense? It really reads to me like he's just trying to put his defense in the criminal case out and try and get his statements out there in the court of public opinion, because if you remember, Judge Merchan basically warned everyone about trying this case in the public and doing anything to affect the criminal trial. Now, he's going to say, well, I legitimately was able to put everything out there because it's in the course of litigation. And so, it's just the timing is suspect. The claims are suspect.

This information yet he's the one who allegedly brought the suit. I also think it's worth noting that there is a little bit of witness intimidation going on here as well.
