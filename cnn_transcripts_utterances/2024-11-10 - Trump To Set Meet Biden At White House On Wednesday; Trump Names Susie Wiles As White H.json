And a moment for Biden to show the country and the world that there will be a peaceful transfer of power even after he called Trump a threat to democracy.

And also we're learning that the Trump team is being nudged by the White House to complete some of the transition agreements to unlock some of those key briefings.

But this is essentially just going to slow down what is already a pretty expedited process to make sure that, you know, come Inauguration Day, Trump is able to be up and running with the government functioning as it should be. We do expect pretty significant shakeups within this next administration, especially given the focus on Schedule F, for example, a policy that Trump was working on towards the end of his first administration that would essentially allow him to, you know, replace civil servants with political appointees.

Now, we know Egypt is also a key mediator.But at this point, Qatar has said that there just doesn't seem to be the willingness on either side to try and push this deal through talking about Hamas and Israel. Now, the Biden administration, a senior official said that they have been invaluable when it comes to these talks. And just last year in November, there was a deal that had been struck to release some of the hostages along with some Palestinian prisoners and Qatar was key in getting to that point. So what they have said is that about 10 days ago, they notified both sides as they were negotiating saying that if this time the agreement is not made, they will pull out of that role. They haven't ruled out getting involved again though. They say if those talks restart and it looks like there will be good faith negotiations on both sides, which they say there hasn't been up to this point. They've also said they're going to close or suspend the Hamas office in Doha. The Hamas officials of the Political Bureau have been allowed to stay and operate in that country. It's not clear, though, that they are expelling Hamas. A diplomatic source says there doesn't seem to be a timeline or an ultimatum for those members to leave. Again, they say that can be restarted, reopened if there is a willingness to talk. It is a very disappointing notification to the families, the friends of the hostages still inside Gaza to millions of civilians in Gaza who are finding it increasingly desperate. Their situation to survive, to find food, water and shelter, as you mentioned that just more than 36 have been killed just in one area in northern Gaza over today itself.

What would a plan look like to pull this of?LAURA COLLINS, DIRECTOR, BUSH INSTITUTE-SMU ECONOMIC GROWTH INSTITUTE AND FORMER DIRECTOR OF IMMIGRATION POLICY, AMERICAN ACTION FORUM: Good morning. You're a lot of details about what this plan would look like. I've seen some reporting since the election about potentially focusing on people with final deportation orders or just going after criminals. I think it's important to note that the United States government considers people who violate immigration law to be removable because of the crime of violating immigration laws. So, you really are talking about the entire undocumented population, many of whom are here working and paying taxes. So, this would be incredibly expensive, for starters, not to mention difficult since there are so many undocumented workers in the United States.",

We've seen administrations try to tighten asylum access at the border. Ultimately, that gets challenged in court.

They are raising the cost of housing across the country.

But we know that, just like you and I, people are more burdensome to their local economies and their local cost and their local government. So, it's a mixed bag there. The burden on state and local government tends to be a little higher than it is on the federal government.But I think the important thing to remember here is when you look at certain industries that are really important to our economy, agriculture, construction healthcare, lots of different areas, there are people here who are doing these jobs. Your housing points an interesting one because we know that a large percentage of the undocumented population works in construction. And so, construction is one of those places where we really would need for -- we really would need the workers that are already here. BLACKWELL:  Laura Collins, thank you.",

A FEMA employee has been fired for advising their disaster relief team to avoid homes with Trump signs while canvassing in Florida after Hurricane Milton. FEMA's administrator called the actions, quote, \"reprehensible\" and emphasize that such behavior will not be tolerated. FEMA is investigated -- is investigating how many homes were missed and has called on a new team to the affected area. Now, Florida's governor has also directed state officials to investigate. Tony Todd, the actor best known for his iconic portrayal of \"Candyman\" in the horror franchise, has died. He first gained recognition for his role as Warren in Oliver Stone's Academy Award winning film \"Platoon\" and went on to star in other notable movies like \"Bird,\" \"Lean on Me,\" and \"The Rock,\" but it was his performance as \"Candyman,\" a spirit summoned by saying his name five times in a mirror that cemented his status as a horror legend. He was 69 years old. Jury selection is set to begin Wednesday in the trial of Jose Ibarra, the man accused of murdering nursing student Laken Riley. This comes after a judge denied several motions to suppress evidence in the trial against Ibarra.

Voters in only two states, Arizona and Missouri, approved measures to expand abortion access. And keep in mind, even if the ballot measures in Arizona and Missouri improve access in those states, about 40 percent of women of reproductive age will still be living in states where abortion is either banned or restricted.Now, it's not clear what the new Trump administration's strategy will be around abortion.

You can see that smoke plume right through there, kind of crossing over New Jersey and into New York. This was yesterday. There is still a fire concern today, but it's just a little bit farther north and east.So, the red flag warnings today are for Massachusetts, Connecticut, and Rhode Island, where you're still going to have those gusty winds and also incredibly low humidities. But there is light at the end of the tunnel. We are finally going to see some rain, especially late this afternoon and into the evening across much of this -- much of the northeast. Again, not a ton of rain, but at this point, anything helps not only with the fire, but a lot of this area has been dealing with extreme drought conditions too. So, that's certainly going to help many of these areas, even though the rain finally moves out by Monday. Another area that is dealing with very heavy rain has been portions of the Gulf Coast, especially Louisiana, portions of Mississippi and East Texas. You look at how much rain has already fallen. Look at this, just from the last 24 hours, widespread, three to five inches, but there were some spots that picked up eight to 12 inches of rain. Now, is actually coming from the Gulf Coast. You can see those flood watched that we do still have an effect and one flash floods. But when we talk about where, look at this, Tropical Storm Rafael well out into the Gulf of Mexico. But a lot of that moisture is being drawn up from Rafael into the cold front that has been slowly starting to creep across the southeast, and that's what was fueling a lot of that incredibly heavy rainfall that was there. But there's no concern here about it actually making landfall in the U.S. or even really Mexico for the next couple of days because there's just so many things out there that are blocking it. So, it's basically, for lack of better words, just spinning doing donuts essentially in the Gulf of Mexico and is likely going to continue to do that over the next several days and then will likely just dissipate at some point in the coming days, not really having much of an impact at all, which is the kind of news you want to hear when it comes to the tropics.",
