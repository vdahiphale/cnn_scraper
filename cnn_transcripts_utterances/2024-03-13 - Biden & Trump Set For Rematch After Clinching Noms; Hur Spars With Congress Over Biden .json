This is what it looks like printed out it's actually Biden himself that brings this into the conversation, and he's talking about a series of events that happened in a certain period.He does remember the exact day, May 30th. And then there are sort of this back-and-forth where someone jumps in and he's kind of like, well, which exact here, oh, 2015, right? The portrait that the transcript seems to paint of this moment does seem different. SCOTT:  There was so much context missing, and it reminds me of, you know, you remember going all the rallies on the campaign trail. And would you get clips that we share or that hit the social media? And when you look at the clip or read the transcript, more fully, you realize, oh, this perhaps would sound differently if I included this part or if they heard this part. And that's what I think a lot of Democrats tried to highlight. And even moments where Republicans try to get her to even take it further, like the whole bit about whether or not he's senile.

They've always been in -- I've been doing this a long time and they're working with the palaces and they've always been very reliable and generally they give accurate information. Of course, there's spin to what they give you, but in terms of the information they give you it tends to be accurate.Now there are two sides to this. You know, posting, an image of your family to social media, which a lot of people would say, yeah, you can touch it. Up you can use a filter, you can crop it. You want to look good. That's how, how the system works. But this wasn't just posted to social media. It was also sent out as an editorial image to news organizations like CNN. That image clearly was edited and manipulate -- not just edited, so it wasn't just a filter. It wasn't just cropping it, it was manipulated. And there were parts of the four people in this image who had been moved. And we've got -- you know, it wasn't in our view, a true reflection of exactly what happened in that moment. So therefore, it's not a news picture. We had to sort of call it out. Of course, this could have been a very minor touch-up which any mother would do to make their family look great. But there is a line in terms of journalism and AFP news agency of spoken about that from their point of view, they feel a line in journalism was crossed. So it is more complex than you see. It also feeds into all the conspiracy theories that there's been a cover up here. And I don't think any of those are going to be laid to rest until we actually see her back on engagements. And all we know is that's going to happen around Easter, but no confirmation of that. But just imagine, Kasie, the frenzy of cameras are going to turn up to that. I really can't imagine. We have, what, two weeks or so until two-and-a-half weeks until Easter. So have fun Internet in the intervening time. Max Foster live for us in London. You can do anything. I appreciate it.
