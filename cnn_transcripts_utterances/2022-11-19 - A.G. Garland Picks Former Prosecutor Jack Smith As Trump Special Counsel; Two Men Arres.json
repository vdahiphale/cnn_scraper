Attorney General Merrick Garland announced Jack Smith, a former war crimes prosecutor and registered independent, will oversee both the investigation into sensitive government documents found at Mar-a-Lago, as well as Trump's actions surrounding the January 6th attack. Garland says the move was prompted by extraordinary circumstances notably Trump's 2024 presidential announcement and President Biden's stated intention to run for reelection. Last night Trump spent several minutes railing against the special counsel announcement. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

They're bringing in witnesses. People are getting testimony dates for even the next couple of weeks before the end of the year.

And, you know, we need to be careful about the way that we speak about the court and when we attack the court because the court serves an extremely important function in our society. And it's supposed to be neutral. It's supposed to be without bias, making decisions based upon the Constitution. And if we lose confidence in the court, then, you know, to me, it's a very dangerous place to be, quite honestly. And so we just need to be careful about this. I'm not saying that we shouldn't publicize and if in fact leak occurred, you know, that shouldn't have -- the leak should not have happened. If it did occur, it was wrong.

Ended up searching a friend's apartment late last night, where they came up with the ghost gun with the extended magazine. They were both the subject of a citywide alert that went to thousands and thousands of police officers' smartphones with a photo. According to the New York City Police Department, two MTA, Metropolitan Transit Authority police officers spotted them in Penn Station last night just after midnight. And Christopher Thomas Brown, 22 years old, has been charged with making terroristic threats, aggravated harassment and criminal possession of a weapon. We're told that when he was arrested he had the red Nazi arm band, a large hunting knife, and the gun was found in the apartment of his friend, as police were closing in.

This is an industry that has often times seen hacks and companies that outright steal their customers' money.FTX seemed to be different. It seemed to be different for two reasons. The first was Sam Bankman-Fried, who was this boy wonder, who was on the cover of magazines and became quickly one of the most powerful in business, in academia, in journalism. And with, that he cultivated this image of someone who was a mainstream, respectable, trustworthy figure. On top of that, FTX and Sam Bankman-Fried paid money to the most powerful people in sports and in Hollywood, to, you know, rep the FTX brand, Steph Curry, Tom Brady, Larry David, Naomi Osaka. All are named in lawsuits and all were under the FTX brand. But it wasn't just celebrities like that. It was also politicians. In April, Tony Blair and Bill Clinton appeared alongside Sam Bankman- Fried in the Bahamas in the FTX conference. This is something that we have seen before. Look at Theranos. Theranos infamously had a board of former government officials that gave this fraudulent business credibility. With FTX, people around the world saw FTX and the powerful people associated with it and thought it was a safe harbor for their money. Now, that's money they might never get to touch again.",

I'm disappointed but not surprised. This is what the GOP leaders do. They will spend the election time talking about inflation and talking about this and that, putting all of the blame on the president. When they take control of the House of Representatives, they don't want to talk about affordable housing or bring prices down for working families. They don't want to talk about the leading cause for death for children is gun violence. They want to talk about Hunter Biden. This is the reality of Republican leaders right now. We're going to fight against that. And also make sure we're focusing on issues that working-class families care about. The Republicans will do what they want the in the House of Representatives.
