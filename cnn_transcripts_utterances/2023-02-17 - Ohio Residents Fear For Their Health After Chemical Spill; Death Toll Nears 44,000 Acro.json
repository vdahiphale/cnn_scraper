JAMES FABISIAK, UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH: So, there's a couple levels of question there, so you know, you had mentioned that the chemical would still be in town. I say that there are probably multiple chemicals, and that's one of the sort of difficulties, is we don't know which specific chemicals or agents are those that we should be most concerned about. Which of them are present in the highest concentrations. I think there should be some long-term monitoring program of people's well water, drinking water, soil samples. One of the things that concerns me is that there is a large sort of reservoir or pool of chemical that is located very close to the derailment and the spill that can continue to migrate over time to perhaps maybe reach well water in the future or, you know, contaminate the soil that then poses a risk that way. So, I think, you know, you should watch these things over time. And that with a good monitoring system, you would be able to respond to them in some way.",

This is in rural northern Mississippi. We're talking about 30 miles south of Memphis, Tennessee. So, stay with us. We've a report coming up. Learning some new details right now.But until then, we're seeing both heartbreak and hope in Turkey and Syria 11 days after that powerful earthquake. So far, nearly 44,000 people have died. Most of those deaths in Turkey. Turkey's vice president says there are now fewer than 200 search and rescue operations still active in the earthquake zone. Despite that, the miraculous rescues continue. Just in the past few hours, we've learned of a 45-year-old Turkish man who was pulled from the debris alive, 278 hours after the earthquake hit. CNN's Nada Bashir joins us now from Istanbul. To hear there are still people being pulled alive is no less than a miracle. Tell us about the situation there now.",

And this has been a moment of hope for the thousands of people still waiting for news of their loved ones still buried beneath the rubble.Earlier today, we saw video of a man, 33 years old named Mustafa, he was rescued after being buried beneath the rubble for 261 hours. And the first thing he did when he was pulled out is call his friend, whose phone number he had memorized. Take a listen.

But we're talking about investigator Peter Rudofski, who was on the stand, and analyzed car data, and phone data from both the victims, Maggie and Paul Murdaugh, and the defendant Alex Murdaugh. And one of the takeaways was that when he left his house the night of the murders it was at 9And as he was driving to go to his mother's house, as he said, he slowed down, according to the GPS data on his car, and he slowed down at the very spot investigators say they found Maggie Murdaugh's phone in the woods. So this data is suggesting that perhaps he slowed down to dispose of that phone. Also, at some points during the night, he's driving around much faster than he is at other times during the day, about 81 miles per hour was his top speed. But there were also questions about the time he spent at his mother's house that night. That's been a real sticking point between the defense and the prosecution. Here's what the data showed.

He says he had just found his son and wife dead at the property, at the dog kennels on the property. But the data shows -- GPS data shows he only arrived 20 seconds before he made that 911 call. Did he have time to check the bodies as he said? He said he checked the pulse on both of them. Tried to turn his son over a couple of times. That's a lot to do in 20 seconds, according to the prosecutor. So again, more inconsistencies to be considered by the jury -- Victor.",
