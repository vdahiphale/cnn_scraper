While inside, emergency teams continuing to sift through the debris say they expect to find more bodies. And with more than a 140 people injured, the death toll is expected to rise. In a nationwide security operation, investigators say that at least 11 people have already been detained, including the four gunmen suspected of carrying out the mass shooting on Friday night. State media has been broadcasting grisly images of some of the men, tied up and bloodied, being manhandled and interrogated. One suspect, speaking broken Russian, is shown allegedly confessing to carrying out the attacks in the Crocus City Hall for money. Well, ISIS has claimed responsibility for the assault, posting images of what they say are the attackers with their faces covered. The terror group says the attack was a normal part of its war against countries fighting Islam. U.S. officials say they have no reason to doubt the ISIS claim. But the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, who's been vowing revenge for what he calls a barbaric act, has attempted to link the attack to Ukraine, saying preliminary data suggests the gunmen were attempting to escape there across what is an extremely heavily militarized border. That's something Ukrainian officials strongly deny.

I think this gets to the heart of the potential risk here for President Putin.His unspoken contract really with the Russian people is that he provides security and they stay quiet and accept ever greater levels of state control, and obviously serious questions will be raised about this terror attack, the biggest in Russia in over two decades, especially given that there was western intelligence leading up to this that Putin publicly dismissed. So, there is that. I think there's also concern for Ukraine, even though President Putin's narrative around this was a little jumbled on the one hand, talking about that link to Ukraine saying that that was window opened on a border, he said, for the attackers to escape, but also then saying that he counts on other states to join this fight against terrorism. I think the fact that did not mention ISIS and that Russian propaganda is now rallying around this idea of Ukraine somehow being behind this suggests to Ukraine that this could, as Matthew was suggesting, be used as a pretext for escalation. So, I think that's why you see that rhetoric from Zelenskyy echoing, of course, other officials in Ukraine flatly denying that they had anything to do with this. Kim.",

He says it invests in the American people and strengthens the economy and national security, but he also acknowledges this was a compromise and not everyone got everything that they wanted. And you are seeing both sides emphasizing what they say they're getting out of this bill. For example, there are 2,000 new border patrol agents funded as part of the package, 8,000 more detention beds for migrants. And you hear Republicans emphasizing how this bill strengthened security on the southern border. What you here Democrats emphasizing is the billion dollars for federal child care and education programs like Head Start. And the $120 million for cancer research also included new money for Alzheimer's research. What this Bill also does is cut funding to the U.N. agency that's responsible for getting aid to the Palestinians. The Biden administration has accused some members of that agency of aiding Hamas. Now, in that statement, President Biden does point to the next big funding battle on Capitol Hill, which is this fight over more aid to Ukraine. And you will remember, President Biden has requested $60 billion in additional assistance for Ukraine, that has stalled on Capitol Hill as many Republicans, particularly those closely aligned with the former president, Donald Trump, say that they won't approve any more assistance to Kyiv. President Biden has said that this is necessary, and you are hearing ever more urgent calls from the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who has said that if American aid dries up that Ukraine could lose this war. [04:10:00] Now, the House has gone on break for Easter for two weeks. So, we won't see any movement on that Ukraine aid in that span. What we do understand is that the house speaker, Mike Johnson, has tasked members of the House with coming up with some options for providing that Ukraine aid, but it remains very unclear at this moment how that will move forward. And in this statement, President Biden says that it's time to get this done. Kevin Liptak, CNN, Washington. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

What's striking about this is that House Republicans for decades have been operating under what they have termed the Hastert rule, named after a former speaker in which they would only bring bill to the floor if it had support from not only a majority of the House, but a majority of their own members.They had abandoned -- they had to abandon that again to pass this, as they have really on every major kind of housekeeping bill they have passed to kind of keep the lights on to avoid debt default and so forth. A majority of Republicans voted against this. They needed Democrats to pass it. And it is just a measure of the chaos that has engulfed this very small House majority, House Republican majority, as its majority continues to dwindle with another Republican, a young, talented committee chair, indicated that he is walking away within weeks, you know, pushing up his retirement. So, it really has just been chaos since day one. And it's not abating in any kind of meaningful way. It's interesting that Marjorie Taylor Greene thinks this was a defeat. And obviously it was in the sense that the kind of the far-right militant edge of the caucus did not get what it wants. But what Republicans have learned really over 30 years of experience, going back to Newt Gingrich and Bill Clinton and Bob Dole, is that shutting down the government simply is not a tool that can allow you to get what you want. All it really is, is like kind of holding a grenade while it goes off in your hands. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

But Cancer Research U.K., you know, strongly encourages people to take up their screening invitation because we know that screening saves lives. And that's because, like you said, screening is designed to catch cancer at an earlier stage. And if it's caught in an earlier stage, treatment is much more likely to be successful. So, screening is definitely one part of the picture when it comes to early diagnosis. And the other thing is remembering that actually, some cancers are preventable. Actually, in the U.K., almost four in 10 cancers are preventable. And that's through things like stopping smoking if you smoke, cutting down on things like alcohol, trying to keep a healthy weight, and also things like staying safe in the sun.

Additional video also shows when police went to Jodi Hildebrandt's house and found Franke's nine-year-old daughter, authorities describing the child as petrified and she was hiding in a closet as well as malnourished. You can see in the video, first responders trying to talk to her and even giving her some pizza. You know, sadly, the journal entries also detail months of abuse and it includes making the children stand and sleep outside, making them do wall sits, shaving the girl's head and even at times withholding water, food, and oxygen. Now, Franke pleaded guilty to four counts of aggravated child abuse. She was initially charged with six counts but then pleaded not guilty to two of the counts as part of a plea deal to testify against her business partner. And Hildebrandt, in her own plea agreement, also pleaded guilty to four counts of aggravated child abuse. They were each sentenced to four consecutive sentences of one to 15 years in prison, but it's now the Utah Board of Pardons and Parole that will oversee the length of their prison sentence. CNN has reached out to their attorneys for comment about the newly released evidence. Camila Bernal, CNN, Los Angeles. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

This is what a care school for men looks like. And more than just learning how to change diapers, this is a place where Colombian men can learn how to be better husbands, fathers, and sons. JUAN DAVID CORTES, FOUNDER, HOMBRES AL CUIDADO (through translation): We can all say it at the same time, first thing we are told is that men don't cry. POZZEBON (voice-over):  And that includes, for example, learning how to tie a ponytail. CORTES (through translation):  Combing hair is not just combing hair. It's about the emotional connection that you create. Investing in men learning about care will allow us to assume this responsibility at home and yet I don't lose masculinity.
