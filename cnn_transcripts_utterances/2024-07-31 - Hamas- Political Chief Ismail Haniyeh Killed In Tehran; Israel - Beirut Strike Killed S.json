      "sentences": "Welcome to CNN Newsroom. I'm Becky Anderson. We are following breaking news. Hamas says its political leader Ismail Haniyeh has been killed in Tehran. You can see him here meeting with Iran's newly elected president on Tuesday before the President's inauguration ceremony which he had attended. In his statement, Hamas claims Haniyeh was killed in a \"Zionist raid on his residence in Tehran after that ceremony.\"There is no official word from the Israeli military when asked for comment. Only a brief statement saying \"they don't respond to reports in the foreign media.\" Well, Haniyeh was a longtime member of Hamas joining in the late 1980s and rising through the ranks over the years before becoming the group's political chief in 2017. Hamas officials have been quick to respond to his assassination with one warning, \"it's a moment of truth for Israel.\" And others says it's a \"cowardly act, which will not pass in vain.\" And Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas calls Haniyeh's is killing a \"dangerous developments.\" Well, joining me now here in London is our chief international security correspondent Nick Paton Walsh. Nick, your initial thoughts in response to the news that we've just reported?",

And if this was Israel with an airstrike inside Iran, it also calls into question, of course, whether the new Iranian President would be willing or able to actually pursue U.S.-Iranian sort of diplomacy going forward as well. Nick, you've laid out why this is such a consequential morning here in London, morning in the Middle East and why this has such significant impact. Thank you. Nick Paton Walsh on the story following his sources more from him shortly.Well, earlier on Tuesday, as Nick suggested, Hezbollah's most senior commander was killed in a drone strike in Beirut, Israel has claimed responsibility, saying it was retaliation for the deadly rocket attack in the occupied Golan Heights. Well, the IDF blame forward soccer for Saturday's attack which killed 12 children and as well as other attacks on Israel in recent months. Hezbollah and Lebanon have not yet confirmed the commander's death but Hezbollah now confirmed Shukr was present at the time of the strike. The Lebanese health ministry says a woman and two children were killed in that Beirut strike, with 74 others injured. This marks the most significant Israeli escalation since tensions with Hezbollah fled after the October 7th Hamas attacks. Hezbollah has denied responsibility for the Golan Heights attack. Meantime, Lebanon's caretaker Prime Minister condemned the IDF strike in Beirut, calling that a clear violation of international law. Paula Hancocks is with us. Paula, as we consider the news that we have just received the assassination or death of the Hamas political leader, Ismail Haniyeh, so we consider what the last 24 hours has wrought with the death of the Hezbollah leader in Beirut. What more do we know at this about -- point about the circumstances of his death and what happens next?",

      "sentences": "Good morning, Becky. It's good to be with you from Beirut. Well, certainly very tense moments both in Lebanon and across the region. Everybody watching what this means, how this is going to unfold. It's noteworthy that Hezbollah has still not confirmed that the commander targeted yesterday in the southern suburbs of Beirut Fuad Shukr has indeed been killed.They're saying that the rescue operations are still underway. And that, to me sounds like they want some time to think through what their next move is going to be. When it comes to the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh in Teheran, what I found interesting was to watch videos of him yesterday evening, walking around Tehran seemingly very comfortable, at ease, not worried about his security to then have him assassinated in his -- in a residence used by veterans in Tehran shows you that he did not fear that he might be a target at this point in time which I would think is a little bit odd. You'd think that all Hamas leaders knowing that Israel as promised to target them would take more security measures, especially at this time. It also shows you that Israel has some good intel, both in Lebanon and in Iran. They're able to carry out these assassinations quite easily. I would say we've seen many commanders in Lebanon, targeted by Israeli strikes over the last nine months, mid-level commanders, but they are able to get the intelligence to conduct these assassinations. And similarly, for the targeting of Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran, he was -- he doesn't live there full time. So, it's not as though the Israeli state track his routine over many days. He had arrived for the inauguration of the Iranian, new president. So, a lot of good intel, probably intelligence gathering on the ground, agents providing information for Israel. The key question, of course is how are Hezbollah and Iran going to respond to this? We are getting very close to the possibility of an all-out conflagration. But I'd like to put forward a possible other trajectory. Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister can now declare a kind of victory. He has, in a way gotten payback for October 7th. He has targeted a very high-ranking Hamas leader or be not one in Gaza itself. Yahya Sinwar is still alive and conducting, you know, day to day operations there. And that could allow Benjamin Netanyahu to then say I'm ready for a ceasefire deal. But it all depends on how Hezbollah and Iran are going to respond. They are going to respond. The question is, can it be contained and choreographed in the same way that it was in April when Iran and Israel, you know, launched missiles and drones at each other.",

      "sentences": "Well, I hope that the Biden administration would counsel Netanyahu strongly against that. And all the statements we're getting from Washington are about restraint, calm, and very interestingly saying that an all-out regional war is not inevitable. Of course, they also say that if it were to come to that they'd stand by Israel. But I find those words not inevitable. Very interesting. And yes, you know, the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh could take the region into all-out war.The same way that we got to that brink in April of this year. Iran felt it had to respond to save face at the time. And that's what it did. Because the targets in Damascus at the time if you're a member for which Iran wanted to retaliate was the killing of an Iranian Revolutionary Guard, Islamic Revolutionary Guard Commander inside a Iranian diplomatic facility. Is Iran going to go to war for Hamas? Over the last nine months, I would say that Iran and Hezbollah have shown clearly that while they want to show that they stand in support of Hamas, they're not willing to go to all-out war for Hamas. And that has been a very fine line to walk for them. Remember, in 2020 a strike targeted the commander of the Quds Force, Qasem Soleimani in Iraq and the Iranian response wasn't what, you know, what we expected it to be. It's been a non-response so far. So, it really depends on what Iran thinks is in its best interest today. Does it want -- does Iran want a full-out war? I don't think so. If they don't want a full-on war, how are they going to respond to this assassination on Iranian soil in such a way that it can be contained and they don't look like the ones to ignite the region further.",

Well, joining me now from Brisbane, retired Australian Army Major General Mick Ryan. He is also a former commander at the Australia Defense College. The question at this point is just how worrying a development this is. Mike, let's start with what we do know. We know the Hamas leader was killed in Tehran. We don't know who was responsible. All indications are or at least expectations are that Israel was responsible even as the IDF says it doesn't respond to foreign media reports, which of course, isn't true because they often do. It's the media reports that they want to respond to. But be that as it may, Mick. If this were Israel, how would this have worked? MAJ. GEN. MICK RYAN (RET.), AUSTRALIAN ARMY (via Skype): Well, I think this would have been all done by humans. I mean, at the end of the day, this isn't the kind of thing where they want to fly drones or missiles into Tehran. This would have been a human-based operation. In January when Israel killed another Hamas commander in Beirut. After that, the head of (INAUDIBLE) once again, asserted that they would hunt down, they would find everyone responsible for the massacres of 7th October and this appears to be the Israelis making good on that promise.",

But there's no sense that there is a positive feeling in all of Israel following this apparent assassination of Ismail Haniyeh in Iran. And that's because while Ismail Haniyeh was officially Hamas's political leader and was not necessarily intimately involved in a Hamas's of military operations.And it's not clear how much knowledge he had a prior for Hamas's October 7th terrorist attacks. There's no question that Ismail Haniyeh was viewed as being responsible for the October 7th massacre. There were images of him celebrating those attacks on that day. And so, there is a sense of happiness in Israel that Haniyeh is no longer of this world. Israeli government officials had made clear for months now that they would carry out -- that they would take out any and all Hamas leaders involved or viewed as responsible for the October 7th attacks. Making clear that the long arm of Israel would strike those leaders and officials and commanders wherever they may be. And we have now seen that they have made good on that promise. As it relates to Hamas is a political leader Ismail Haniya. And of course, the question now is what will this do to the region? Haniyeh's killing came less than 24 hours after we saw Israel carry out this targeted airstrike in the southern suburbs of Beirut taking out Hezbollah's senior most military commander, Fuad Shukr there. And so, already there were questions after that airstrike about what this would mean for the region at such a very, very delicate moment. And now you add on to that the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh to key leaders of Iranian proxies of both Hezbollah and Hamas killed in the span of 24 hours, raising questions not only about how Hezbollah will respond and whether it will change its plans for how they would respond for the killing of Fuad Shukr. Also, how Hamas will now respond, but the bigger question, of course, whether Iran itself will feel compelled to respond to. And that's because we are in a new world following those Iranian attacks -- the first open Iranian attacks on Israeli soil back in April. We are now in a new world, a new calculus in terms of Iran-Israel relations and how they feel prepared and compelled to act militarily against one another. And so, will Iran feel like this was a violation of its sovereignty such that it feels it needs to respond directly to Israel or will it respond instead via its proxies? But there's no question that this is a very tense moment, a very delicate moment for the region. And all eyes will be on how Iran and its proxies responds to this latest development.",

And in addition to that, he was also viewed as a somewhat pragmatic figure in these talks, perhaps more inclined to make concessions, more inclined to try and reach a deal than Yahya Sinwar, Hamas' leader in Gaza, was himself.And so, this raises questions about the future of those negotiations. As you said, coming at a very delicate and critical moment in those negotiations. Earlier this week, Israel, on Sunday, submitted its official response to those negotiations to the mediators, which was then transmitted to Hamas. Hamas then said that Netanyahu appeared to be reverting back to his strategy of delay and resistance to these talks, inserting several 11th hour demands. But there was nonetheless a sense of momentum over the course of these last few weeks, make no mistake, that momentum is absolutely gone with the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh. It doesn't necessarily mean that those talks are dead altogether, but certainly, at least in the short term, it is going to have an enormous impact on those negotiations. As far as the medium- and the long-term, we will have to see who succeeds Ismail Haniyeh as the head of Hamas and the extent to which Yahya Sinwar in Gaza gets expanded influence as a result of this power vacuum.",
