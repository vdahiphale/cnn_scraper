They don't think that the Supreme Court is going to come out and say, actually, yes, you are completely immune from prosecution, but they're looking for a way to essentially have them split the baby where they do they are vindicated on certain points of this, and it does go back down to a lower court to figure out, okay, what's an official act and what's not an official act, therefore, delaying the case even further.",

You know, we're going in there, we're saying blanket immunity, but we don't know if this is actually going to go anywhere. We just know the fact that the Supreme Court is taking it up is going to delay the case.But when I talk to their various legal advisers, the members of the campaign, they feel cautiously optimistic. And that is not based on just their hopes. This is based on what they saw, particularly the line of questioning from Justice Kavanaugh and Justice Roberts. They're looking at this for any kind of limited immunity. Because, as you said, this is all about how can they delay this case past the election? Now, I would argue that it isn't just a maybe of whether or not he's going to dismiss the case if he wins in the fall. This is certain. That is part of the plan that they have had all along, that these two federal cases would be gone almost the moment that he enters the White House if he is to win again. So, the whole point has been to push this further and further. Now, in their mind, their calculus says that if everything goes terribly and they lose on all fronts today, that it's still possible this could get delayed past the election, just given the fact that it would be so close to the election, there might be some kind of conversation around political powers and political sway, but they don't know if that would work.",

He has to restructure the case. He has to do sorting between what was personal and what was an official act, and then this will get delayed beyond the election, which, of course, would mean that Donald Trump would eventually be able to dismiss this case.",

So, in a way, they kind of acknowledge that, and I don't necessarily think that that's where this is going to come down to.I do think that the court has already said by just taking this case that they want to put this issue on the table. They think it's a legitimate issue for them to address on. And, secondly, I think that just that alone is a victory, even if they don't answer the full question, which we've seen just in this term on a number of occasions, they have not decided on the full question, they might leave it open just enough that it keeps this issue alive, not just right now in this case for Trump, but down the road should another situation like this emerge.

It's already made two decisions here, which have effectively gone Donald Trump's way. Number one, Jack Smith asked to have the Supreme Court rule on this last January, like way in now, come early and tell us now what you think about this, they said, no, no, it's not for us. Let's let it work up the court system here.And then when ultimately it did go past the appeals court and the Supreme Court decided it was going to get in, it's not that they've taken their time, but you will note this is the last case they're deciding in this term.

Now, an argument can be made that any engagement of an executive branch agency is an official act of the presidency, even if it was committed in furtherance of fraud. Now, look, I don't agree with that, but a court has to sort that out. And I think where this, what the Supreme Court does is take allegations like that and send them back down to Judge Chutkan and say, figure out what's official and what's not. Now, to be clear, they could have done that and they can do that today if they so choose. But oral argument, they seem to suggest that they would not and send it back down.",

Decisions are coming down on the final day of this term, where we are going to learn as the Supreme Court has had some momentous decisions before them. But the one we are waiting on right now could have the largest impact, certainly on the upcoming 2024 election, and that is Donald Trump's claim that he is immune from prosecution. We are waiting any moment now to get this ruling.And, Kristen Holmes, obviously, Trump's team is also waiting any moment now. They have kind of been running through all the scenarios of this in their head based on what I heard. They're kind of just waiting to see what it is into what extent the Supreme Court weighs in on this issue. Maybe they'll get into officials acts and non-official acts. Maybe they won't. I mean, that's just a major question. But the other aspect of this that I've been hearing in talking to Trump people is about Trump's view of the Supreme Court. I mean, we've seen how he has talked about the three justices that he put on this court. We've seen how his other attorneys, including Alina Habba, have talked about, you know, Justice Kavanaugh remembering what Trump did for him by not pulling his nomination when it was, you know, in the middle of a frenzied chaos and a question of whether he'd get confirmed. I mean, Trump has a very singular view of how this court should act in accordance with the fact that he put three of these justices on that court.",

They believe it could be complicated. They believe there could be nuance. And all of that nuance is going to affect what happens next.
