LT. COL. PETER LERNER, SPOKESPERSON, ISRAEL DEFENSE FORCES: So, I think, you know, they can do the worst. Obviously, the situation on the ground is Hamas has over 100 hostages, abductees that are being held unlawfully in the Gaza Strip by Hamas. They decided strategically to do this. Our role is to bring them home and our role is to destroy Hamas' capability so that they can never ever hold a sword over Israel's head ever again.",

The Nukhba Force is what they -- is their commander unit and they have special force training. They breached the perimeter, they breached the barrier, they stormed into Israel and many of them were involved in the butchery of Israeli civilians in our communities and of course, the military outposts on the front lines.They are a focus of our operations at this time. We are taking out their capabilities. We're intercepting them. I'd also say we're identifying them from the videos they shot themselves. Some of those pictures that Becky was referring to, I've seen them as well, but they distributed their own videos of people being burnt alive, people being butchered, people being beheaded, they're doing it -- they did it because they're proud of what they did. So, when we look at what our forces are capable of, we have the ability to foresee their operational capabilities of terror -- tunnels, of rockets launches against Israel, intelligence capabilities that we are currently striking and attacking. And of course, the leadership of Hamas from their political leadership that have instructed and directed and strategically decided to assault Israel and go on this offensive and bring us to this war, and of course, down to work to the operatives that we will seek out and take out those that are involved in this in this attack against us.",

They have the responsibility. They need to be held accountable by -- first and foremost, by the people of Gaza, but also the world. And I think Secretary of State Blinken's very strong words goes to show that there are people that are choosing to be on the right side of history, holding these people to account. And our job is the idea is to seek out and defend the Israel -- defend Israel. We are -- our enemy is Hamas, not the people of Gaza. And our targets are Hamas targets. We will do our operations in accordance to the laws of armed conflict in order to minimize the influence on civilians.

These are, as described by Benjamin Netanyahu's office, horrific photos of babies murdered and burned by the Hamas monsters. He said, Hamas is inhumane, Hamas is ISIS.

Horrific. The other two images, let me tell you, which we're not going to show our viewers, are of small bodies that have been burnt beyond recognition.
