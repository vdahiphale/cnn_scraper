Prosecutors are asking a federal judge to sentence Ethan Nordean to 27 years in prison after he and three other Proud Boys were convicted of seditious conspiracy and other charges related to the January 6 attack. And just moments ago, a fifth member, Dominic Pezzola -- you see him here using a police shield to break a window at the Capitol on January 6 -- he was sentenced to 10 years in prison just moments ago. He was the only one convicted in the case, not found guilty of seditious conspiracy, but he was convicted on seven other charges. And there are significant developments in the election subversion case in Georgia. We're awaiting a key ruling on Mark Meadows, of course, who is Trump's former White House chief of staff. Meadows asking to have his charges move from Georgia to federal court. In the meantime, we have learned that Trump's trial will be seen both online and on TV, assuming that it does indeed stay in Fulton County, Georgia. The presiding judge there saying all hearings and trials in his courtroom can be livestreamed, can be televised, and that will also apply to Trump's 18 co-defendants. Today, one of those co-defendants entered a not guilty plea. Attorney Kenneth Chesebro, the architect of the Trump campaign's fake elector plot. First, we start, though, in Washington, D.C., where another member of the Proud Boys will be sentenced just minutes from now. We have CNN justice correspondent Evan Perez, who is covering the story for us. What more are we learning about Pezzola's sentencing, Evan?",

That's on October 23.Now, today, his lawyer asked the judge to force the district attorney to speed up production of the necessary evidence. A trial date that's just seven weeks away, is that realistic? MICHAEL MOORE, FORMER U.S. ATTORNEY:  Well, I'm glad to be with both of you. It's realistic because it's required by the law. He opted to take advantage of the Georgia Speedy Trial Act, which means that he has a right to have his case tried that term of court, the term after his indictment. The DA had nothing to do with it. The court had nothing to do with it. If they did not set the trial, if the court had not scheduled the trial, he would have been automatically acquitted and adjudged not guilty. So the speedy trial is what it is. The motion that he's asking for about discovery, he still has a right under the Constitution to have this information, and he has a right to have his lawyers, under the Sixth Amendment, be in a position to be prepared to provide an effective defense for him. So, this is basically a nudge to the court saying, OK, we told the DA we're ready to go. She cannot get outside of our obligations to give us this discovery material in time to prepare. So, that will have to be turned over. It's going to be a lot of documents. But, again, he opted for this right to have the case tried quickly. And so now it's just going to be an expedited process to go through pretrial motions, the turning over of discovery and that type of thing. So we will see it, I think, in the next few days.",

And so there's no prohibition on having these proceedings televised. Remember that this kind of cuts both ways for Trump. On the one hand, being on TV every day sitting in a courtroom would remind people that he's a defendant in a criminal case. On the other hand, it gives him essentially, from a political angle, an ongoing campaign ad, because we know, just at looking at public polling and things, that his numbers seemed to go up with the indictments. And think about this too. Remember the pageantry of his arrival to surrender at the Fulton County Jail. I mean, it almost looked like an inauguration parade as he was going in there. And he's maximized that. So it cuts both ways. I don't think you will see any success if somebody tries to say, well, you know, we don't want to have this thing on TV. There's good precedent here, and, pretty much, it's up to the judge here in the case to make that decision.",

But in this case, because of the allegations, he's probably been told by his lawyers, step back. Let's not have the argument made to the jury that you're still controlling these people and their testimony and any actions. That's what they're trying to say anyway. And let's show that this is not an enterprise that's paying the funding, the legal bill for all of these folks. I mean, they're trying to get away from the RICO statute. And part of RICO means that there's a criminal enterprise, a corrupt enterprise. And so they want to remove that stigma by maybe disentangling themselves from each other.

You're seeing jobs added across various sectors, but also, if you look at June and July there, those numbers were actually revised down; 100,000 fewer jobs were actually added in those two months than previously expected, so a softening over those two months. The unemployment rate, though, ticking up to 3.8 percent, and that is because you have greater labor force participation, people in the market right now looking for a job. Here are the industries that added the most amount of jobs in the month of August. You have gains in health care, you have gains in leisure and hospitality and in construction. The sectors that saw declines are sectors that have been in the news recently. In trucking, you saw a loss of 37,000 jobs. That's because a trucking company, Yellow Trucking here in the U.S., went bankrupt, out of business. That was a loss of 30,000 jobs for those employees. You see that factored in right there. And then the ripple effect of the actors and the writers that have been on strike for so many weeks, you see that reflected, down 17,000 jobs in motion picture and sound recording. And, Brianna, one thing that economists are really looking at here is wages. They wanted to make sure that they didn't see wage growth increase too much, because, if wages increase, people have more money to spend, and that ultimately fuels inflation. In the month of August, we actually saw a decline in wages, which, of course, is not great for people's pocketbooks, but it's good for the fight on inflation, and the Federal Reserve, as you mentioned, Brianna, going to be meeting later this month. They're going to be looking carefully at this report to decide whether or not they're going to be raising interest rates in September or their next meeting of November of this year, Brianna. One economist saying that this report might be enough to put a pause on interest rates. Of course, the Fed really targeting that 2 percent inflation. We are still above that at 3 percent. So, work to be done, but remains to be seen if that's going to be happening, Brianna, still this year because of this report.",

We want to see more sustainable levels of job growth, more sustainable, probably slower levels of consumer spending growth.So I would anticipate going forward that we may see a slowdown in consumer spending, not only because you see a little bit less job growth month to month than we had seen in the past, as much as the White House loves to talk about continued job growth, but also because it's gotten more expensive to borrow, right? That is the whole goal of raising rates. The reason why the Fed is raising interest rates is essentially to cool demand, to make it a little bit less likely that people and businesses and others will spend quite as much money. So, you will see those interest rate hikes take effect most likely within consumer spending, amongst other areas, as well as a number of other policies potentially weighing on consumer spending going ahead, for example, things like the restart of the student loan payments.",

If you look at where markets think things are, based on how treasuries are priced, they don't believe the Fed. They think, essentially, that rates are going to stay about where they are through the end of the year, or the -- at least, that's the most likely scenario. And it may well be. As you have discussed, inflation has come down quite a bit. The job market remains relatively stable, slowing down, but not -- you're getting less of that mismatch between the number of jobs available and the number of workers available. So there are a number of reasons to think that the Fed may, in fact, decide to pause on raising rates any further, especially since we don't know yet whether the rate hikes they have already put into place have fully worked their way through the system.",
