McConnell says he'll address all of that this afternoon at the former president says he didn't say the thing that he definitely said. Saturday, Trump posted this about the 2020 election. Quote, a massive fraud of this type and magnitude allows for the termination of all rules, regulations and articles, even those found in the Constitution. Well, fast forward two days, now here is what former President Trump is saying. Quote, the fake news is actually trying to convince the American people that I said I wanted to terminate the Constitution. No, that actually is what he said and what he wrote, as you just saw. So, now more Republicans are slowly coming forward to put some space between themselves and Trump on this. Here are Senators John Kennedy and Mitt Romney. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. JOHN KENNEDY (R-LA): I disagree with the president. The Constitution can be amended. The Constitution can be interpreted. But the Constitution can't be suspended. SEN. MITT ROMNEY (R-UT): Well, as you know, the Republican Party has long been the party of the Constitution. And so when President Trump says he wants to suspend the Constitution, he goes from being MAGA to being rhino. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Senator Lisa Murkowski said, it's an affront to our republic. Senator Mike Rounds, quote, no one is above the Constitution.

And so we know about the link between ultra-processed foods and things like cardiovascular disease, obesity, cancers, but we haven't really looked that much at how it's associated with cognitive decline. And so researchers here took about 10,000 individuals in Brazil, who are average age of about 50, followed them for an average of eight years, gave them a food questionnaire and looked at their cognitive function. And they found, as you mentioned in the intro, that if their daily consumption of ultra-processed food, those calories that counted for over 20 percent of their intake, that it was associated with cognitive decline, global cognitive decline and also decline in their executive function, that's the part of the brain that's used to process information and make decisions.And as you mentioned, it doesn't take a lot to get to that 20 percent. That's about 400 calories in a 2,000-calorie diet. And so how might this be happening? We think that these ultra-processed foods may increase inflation, they might affect our microbiome, the gut bacteria, that there's a link there. They may end up damaging the vascular system. And - but it is important to point out, this was not a cause/effect study. This was an association. So there are limitations there.",
