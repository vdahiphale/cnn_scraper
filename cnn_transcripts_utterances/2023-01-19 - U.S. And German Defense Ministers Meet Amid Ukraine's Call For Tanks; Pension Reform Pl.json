The U.S. is urging Germany to send battle tanks to Ukraine or at least approve the transfer of those tanks from other countries. Germany reportedly wanted to make that contingent on Washington sending Ukraine its own heavy weaponry.

The top line of this package, the new element we are seeing that we have not seen before are these Stryker combat vehicles. These are armored vehicles, that, to Nic's point, will allow Ukrainian forces to press forward, to have some cover as they move forward to carry out offensives and take back territory. So that is a significant new mechanical capability that they will have that will be combined with the Bradley fighting vehicles, another kind of armored vehicle that the U.S. has just recently committed in the last aid package earlier this month. It was the biggest one. But the U.S. is not going to be sending their tanks. They have repeatedly made the case that it just does not make sense from a technical or maintenance perspective. They are too big. They guzzle too much gas. They want Ukraine to have Western tanks. But it does not make sense, they say, to send these American ones. So they are pressuring Germany. We are seeing it play out today. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin has been in, Berlin meeting with his counterpart and other German officials, they say, to put pressure on the Germans to not just send these Leopard 2 German tanks but, again, to allow other European countries to do the same. And the Americans, they say, are very optimistic that they will be able to come to some sort of positive conclusion with the Germans by the end of this week, when, as you noted, the U.S. is hosting that Ukraine defense contact group tomorrow in Ramstein, Germany.",

And let me  start by explaining what happened today because this is a non bindingresolution and it comes out of a report, it is an annual report that the E.U. Parliament always does, that refuse their security relations and their foreign relations around the world. And in that report, they condemned Iran's crackdown on protesters. I'm going to read you a portion of it here, these are the words of the European Parliament. It is appalled by unrestrained and disproportionate use of force by Iranian police and security forces. And out of that report, this vote was held; an overwhelming majority of E.U. parliamentarians voting this nonbinding resolution, urging the E.U. to designate the IRGC, that very important elite fighting unit as a terrorist organization. To explain that, Becky, I want to take you back to last year, when, if you remember, the JCPOA was trying. There were attempts to revive those negotiations. And Iran's foreign minister had one major sticking point at the time and that was the U.S.' designation of Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps as a terrorist organization. Iran absolutely wanted that designation reversed at the time the E.U. was pushing to restart those talks. Now fast forward to today, four months into a protest movement and the E.U. is looking at making a very similar move, considering a very similar move to the United States. So is the U.K. And Iran's response to this is, absolutely not. Iran's foreign minister has warned the E.U., says if they do designate Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps as a terrorist organization, he described that as the E.U. shooting itself in the foot. He urged E.U.'s parliamentarians to prioritize diplomacy and negotiations. But all of this just comes to show you, Becky, just how much relations between the West and Iran have deteriorated over the course of these demonstrations. They are absolutely at an all-time low.
