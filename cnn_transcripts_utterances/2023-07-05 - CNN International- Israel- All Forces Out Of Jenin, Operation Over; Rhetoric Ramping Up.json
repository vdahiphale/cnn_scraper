      "sentences": "Hello, you're watching CNN Newsroom. I'm Max Foster in London.Just ahead, thousands gather for a funeral in Jenin today, after the Israeli military said its operation there has ended. More details from the ground in just a moment. Japan will soon release treated wastewater from the Fukushima nuclear plant into the ocean, sparking much anxiety amongst locals. More from Tokyo on that. And live this hour, King Charles is in Scotland to receive the crown jewels there. We're covering all the pompom pageantry. Israeli troops have left the occupied West Bank city of Jenin after a massive two-day military incursion, leaving behind immense destruction and damage to critical infrastructure. Palestinian officials say at least 12 people were killed and scores more injured, some of them seriously. Funerals are now underway. And Israel says one of its soldiers was also killed. The violence, meanwhile, is spreading beyond the sprawling refugee camp. Early on Wednesday, the IDF says it carried out airstrikes in the Gaza Strip after shooting down five rockets fired towards Israeli territory. CNN's Hadas Gold joins us live from Jerusalem. Where is this operation going, Hadas?",

      "sentences": "Well, the operation has been declared over by the Israeli military after nearly 48 hours of constant activity. The largest Israeli military operation in the occupied West Bank since the days of the Second Intifada since 2002. But just as those military vehicles were seen leaving Jenin, that's when we got word of those five rockets being fired from Gaza towards Israel. All of them were intercepted, the Israeli military said. The Israeli military responding with what it called targeted airstrikes towards Hamas, weapons manufacturing and rocket launch sites. We have no reports of injuries on either side, and the rest of the night and into this morning was quiet. Much of the attention, of course, has been on Jenin and what happened there.As you noted, one Israeli soldier was killed during this operation. Twelve Palestinians were killed and more than 100 were injured. Now, Israel, when the death count was at 11, said the Israeli top -- the Israeli military's top spokesman when he was speaking to CNN last night, said that all of those that they believe no non-combatants have been killed. But they have acknowledged that civilians are among the injured. And in Jenin, there is massive amounts of damage. The roads are completely ripped up from Israeli bulldozers as they were trying to dismantle IEDs. There's damage to houses, cars, hospitals have been damaged as -- hospitals have been damaged as well. In critical infrastructure, the electricity and water was severely damaged, and thousands of residents fled over the past two days to try and to avoid the violence. So now they are probably making their way back into Jenin to try and assess the damage and start the cleanup. Now, over the past few hours, we have seen videos and images of a mass funeral for the 12 that were killed. They were all going to be buried in a communal grave. And we are seeing militants amongst them, masked with their guns, with their flags from Islamic Jihad and Hamas. And that goes to show you not only that some of those killed were probably affiliated in some way with militant groups. But no matter what the Israeli military said about their goal being to dismantle Jenin as a safe haven for militants and talking about all the targets that they reached there, there are, of course, still militants in Jenin. And they obviously feel comfortable enough to still go out on the streets full force to show off, essentially, during these funerals. This is clearly a message being sent by the militants there, that they are still there, that they will still be operating there. So now the question is, where do we go from here? The Israeli military saying that while the operation in Jenin is over, that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is saying it's not a one-time thing, that they will go back if necessary, if they believe they need to dismantle, once again, Jenin as a safe haven for militants. And then, of course, there is the rest of the occupied West Bank. We saw yesterday the Hamas ramming and stabbing attack in Tel Aviv, targeting Israeli civilians there. There is a question about where we go from here. Will there be more Israeli military operations? Will there be more attacks towards Israelis? This is not over, even though this operation is technically over. Max?",

      "sentences": "Yes, and the -- obviously, there's not a lot of margin for error here. Any miscalculation, obviously, could have huge consequences, not just for Ukraine, but for Europe more broadly especially. But in this case, President Zelenskyy is making a very specific accusation.He's saying that Ukrainian intelligence has information that there are objects that look like explosive devices on the top of several power units at Zaporizhzhia, saying essentially that this is a false flag operation or that Russia is looking to blow it up and to blame the Ukrainians essentially. This is something that the Ukrainian military has said over the last few days as well, saying that any explosion would likely be planned to look like Ukrainian shelling, but wouldn't have enough force to actually damage the actual power units themselves. Last week, Ukraine though, did start preparing for the possibility of some kind of a terror attack on this -- on the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, as you mentioned, the biggest in Europe. And the Deputy Defense Minister said today that there are four different regions where emergency services are doing these drills in the case of an emergency. The Zaporizhzhia governor on the Ukrainian side has also said that Ukrainian Special Forces are also preparing for this possibility. The Russians, though, obviously, they are denying that there is any kind of threat from the Russian side. The Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov, though, did acknowledge that the situation is tense, in his words, saying that the chances of Ukrainian sabotage is high and also pointing out the obvious that anything like that would have catastrophic consequences. The Russians also say that measures are being taken. Now, I think we have a recent satellite image, not the most recent, but one that at least gives you the lay of the land of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant that we can bring up. So the reactors there, they're built inside containment buildings which are supposed to be able to withstand the force of an accidental plane crash, say experts. But there's also questions about, you know, the weapons of war and what impact they might have, we just don't know. Also, you'll notice on that satellite images there's these cooling pools there where the spent nuclear rods go after they're used and those are wide out -- right out there out in the open as well. So again, there's a lot of moving pieces here, a lot of -- not a lot of margin for error. The good news is that nuclear officials on both sides, though, are giving some reassuring words, though, saying that the situation is stable, the situation is normal. The Russian nuclear official calling Zelenskyy's claims, frankly, garbage. Max?",

Mr. Zelenskyy says the Russian President's response to the Wagner mutiny led by Yevgeny Prigozhin was weak. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT (through translation): Half of Russia supported Prigozhin. Half of Russia supported Putin. We know from our intelligence reports that Kremlin was conducting all those surveys. 18 or 19 regions of Russia firmly supported Prigozhin's actions. 21 regions of Russia firmly supporting Putin. Some of the Russian regions were in the balancing in the meantime without knowing for sure who to support. We all see this process that shows half of the Russian population is in serious doubt.

He will make everything in order to break and nullify the Wagnerites fame and everything they were doing. He will be distancing himself from all that and will be communicating extensively in order to unify the society. His society is ununified. Pay attention to this interesting example. After all these events, where did Putin go? I can tell you, he rarely comes out to the street. We see him in his offices, et cetera, but we never see him out and about. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "Well, Max, if we listen to what a senior Treasury Department official said earlier this week, the expectation is that there will be no significant breakthroughs. But the fact there is discussion taking place is very significant.If we look back at the calendar, it was in January of this year we were talking about the shoot down of a Chinese spy balloon over the United States, and then we had basically diplomatic silence. Now, nearly six months later, we have seen a visit from the U.S. Secretary of State and now the Secretary of Treasury. There is room, though, for discussion, especially on an economic front with the Treasury Secretary. For example, the American business presence in China is significant. We have Apple, we have Tesla that have had a big part of the market there. Apple, in particular, using China as a backdrop for manufacturing. And then, as we have also been talking about many times, Max, the Chinese economy right now is having some real tough times. China has now brought in a new economist into its economic sphere, someone who has been educated at Harvard and at Cambridge to perhaps bring some new perspective. So this discussion could perhaps bring to set the stage for even more discussion. This -- Treasury Department official has described this visit as something that'd be very frank. I mean, we could likely hear some discussion about human rights issues that the United States is concerned about. The real question is, will this set the stage for a broader meeting between Chinese leader Xi and President Biden?",

There has been reporting in the South Korean press that there are -- has been a run for sea salt because there is fear that there could be contamination from this release.But scientifically speaking, this impact is seen as negligible. It is a practice that other nuclear facilities around the world have engaged in. So the standard has been set, if you will. This release, though, is not going to be just a one-time event. It's going to be something gradual, Max. It's going to probably take years, even decades to complete. And the International Atomic Energy Agency knows that the world is watching. They have set up an office, or they will set up an office here in Japan to monitor all of this. And this is really important for Japan because it has to look to the future, especially for energy. The Prime Minister has made it very clear that he feels nuclear energy, despite this past, is going to be part of the nation's future. So it's important that this be done right. And there's also this emphasis on learning from mistakes from the past, especially looking toward the future, Max.",
