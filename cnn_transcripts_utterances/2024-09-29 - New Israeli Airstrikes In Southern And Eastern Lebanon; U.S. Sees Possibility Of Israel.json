These airstrikes continuing and as a result of that we have seen this mass exodus of civilians, of the people of the area known as Dahiyeh, Beirut.And I think you can see behind me -- right now, we're starting -- we're still seeing people who are either now getting the chance to leave with the little they can carry or who have tried to go back and pick up some belongings and get out of there. We're right outside a school that has been turned into a shelter. This is one of several of those shelters around Beirut. But the authorities are struggling to keep up with the number of people who have been displaced. In a matter of days, Jim, according to authorities, about a million people have been displaced across Lebanon. Mostly in the southern part of the country. The southern suburbs of Beirut, as well as the eastern part of the country. And if you look at Beirut's southern suburbs this is one of the most densely populated areas, or was of Beirut. It had Hezbollah presence. As we saw this is where the Israelis killed the leader of Hezbollah, Hassan Nasrallah and other top commanders of the group. But it is also home to hundreds and hundreds of thousands of people who have now been forced out of their homes. As I mentioned, some are in the schools but then you also have so many others who don't know where they are going to go. [06:05:05] For days now, they have been on the street. I mean, just a short time ago, we were in central Beirut in the heart of the capital, and we found people still camped outside on pavements, in parks, families with little children. We spoke to Lebanese families, Syrian refugees who have been in this country for 10 years, who fled the civil war in their country and now they're here displaced again with nowhere to go. We met migrant workers from Bangladesh, from Ethiopia, an absolutely desperate situation. And we're talking about people on the streets with no toilets, no facilities. I mean, we heard from some people saying they've had to go down to the sea to wash because they have nowhere else to go. And I met an elderly woman from Syria. And she said that she fled the airstrikes. She didn't even have shoes on. All she grabbed was a little plastic bag with her medications and a little pack of tissues because that's what she does to survive. She sells those tissues, Jim, and she lives off of that. And now she broke down crying, saying she just doesn't know what is going to happen to them now. She doesn't have a home in Syria. It was destroyed in the civil war. And she has no money, no place to go to here. And it's story after story, like this. An absolutely desperate situation here, Jim.",

Jeremy, I understand the U.S. perspective here is that they are watching, at least for the possibility of an Israeli ground incursion into southern Lebanon. Israeli officials today have said that's just one option on the table for them. What is the latest and has Israel put in the preparations to allow for a force to cross the border?",

      "sentences": "Well, the preparations are certainly underway, whether they have sufficient troops or not, depending on the scale of this ground incursion is another question altogether. And beyond that, of course, what is clear, Jim, is that the Israeli government has yet to actually make a final decision about whether or not a ground incursion is indeed the next step.U.S. officials telling us that they are indeed seeing the preparations being made for a limited ground incursion and they're seeing that based off of the mobilization of troops along Israel's northern border, as well as clearing certain areas that could be used to send troops into Lebanon. My team and I, actually, filmed video of Israeli tanks near the border with Lebanon on Friday. We saw them amassed in a field off the side of a highway. We were told that they had just arrived there in the hours before we passed by. And so, clearly the Israeli military has activated two additional reserve brigades, sent them to the north in recent weeks. They had also sent the 98th division, which was fighting in Gaza, redirected it to the northern border. So, it's clear that the preparations are being made. And the messaging is quite clear from Israeli generals as well, who said as recently as -- or as late as last Wednesday, that they were indeed preparing for that eventuality. In the meantime, though, what the Israeli military is doing right now is that they are continuing to carry out dozens of strikes in Lebanon. Most of those strikes happening in southern Lebanon as well as the Baalbek region. But we've also seen, of course, an increased pace of attacks in the southern suburbs of Beirut as well. That's because Israeli officials tell me that they believe Hezbollah right now is in disarray, that their operational capabilities have been extremely debilitated by the rounds of Israeli airstrikes over the course of the last week. And of course, the killing of many of its senior leaders, including of course, on Friday, its leader Hassan Nasrallah. And so, they believe that this is the moment to do as much damage to Hezbollah as possible. But they are also quite clear-eyed about the fact that Hezbollah can reconstitute and likely will at some point. And so, that's also why they are watching to see what Iran does, what remains of Hezbollah does, and what the decision-making is eventually about how much of a wide-scale retaliation will be planned for Israel and when that might come, Jim.",

What would be -- and I know you're not in the room there -- in the situation room as they planned this on the Israeli side but what would be the likely additional mission of ground forces on top of the airstrikes? COL. CEDRIC LEIGHTON (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST: One of the big aspects of a ground incursion, Jim, would be the idea of actually taking territory and holding it. So, what could happen in a case like this is the air campaign has soften up targets. They've destroyed some things. The ground forces would then move in. They would then see how badly it would be -- Hezbollah weapon systems have been destroyed and to destroy them even further if they -- if they could, if they're right there with them. Or they would make sure that they could not be used in a -- you know, an attempt to attack the northern part of Israel. So, ground forces become really important to hold territory as well as to ensure that any damage caused by an air campaign is basically a permanent form of damage.",

House Speaker Mike Johnson released a statement saying, in part, Hassan Nasrallah's reign of bloodshed, oppression and terror has been brought to an end and, quote, the world is better off without him.Like many of its Western allies, the U.S. designates Hezbollah as a terrorist organization.

Camila, I wonder what else you're hearing from U.S. officials, because, of course, this strike came in the midst of a concerted U.S. effort for a ceasefire between Hezbollah and Israel. Of course, the chances for that one seem greatly reduced as the war escalates. CAMILA DECHALUS, CNN WHITE HOUSE REPORTER (on-camera): Well, Jim, President Biden and other top U.S. officials have really stressed that they believe that Israel has their full support and has the right to defend itself against terrorist organizations. But they also stress a need for a ceasefire deal in order to mitigate some of the escalating tensions in the region. Now, just yesterday, President Biden put out a statement, and this is what he had to say. He said, in Gaza, we have been pursuing a deal backed by the UN Security Council for a ceasefire and the release of hostages. In Lebanon, we have been negotiating a deal that would return people safely to their homes in Israel and southern Lebanon. Now, Jim, as you can see from that statement, Biden did not go into detail about what this deal would entail. But it's very clear that the President and also U.S. officials believe that the only path forward is for a diplomatic solution in order to just ease some of the rising tensions in this region.
