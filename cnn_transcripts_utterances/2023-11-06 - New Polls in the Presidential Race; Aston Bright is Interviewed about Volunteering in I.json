On the economy, if you take a look at that, on the top line, based on these polls, voters in those battleground states trust the former president to do a better job compared to the current president, 37 percent.Now, on the issues of immigration and national security, critical issues that Trump talks about often, they trust Trump to do better, while 41 percent shows Biden. What about the ongoing Israeli/Palestinian conflict? This, new numbers that we see come out, 50 percent trust Trump, 39 percent trust the current president. Now, Biden does outperform, and this is critical, on the issues of abortion and democracy, but even then it's only by single digits. Biden's up 9 on the issue of abortion and three on the issue of democracy. These are issues Democrats consistently point to as Trump cards here. And the major lingering issue of Biden's age? Well, it has become very clear, that is now proceeding, 71 percent say Biden at 80 years old is just too old to an effective president. The irony here is only 39 percent feel that way about Donald Trump. He is 77. Now, there is a caveat to all of this that we should keep an eye on here. If Donald Trump is convicted and sentenced in the federal election subversion trial, the picture changes dramatically. In that situation, those polls say that Biden wins in all of those swing states, every single one of them. Something to keep an eye on going forward. Poppy.",

They are counterwheeling (ph) things. But if Democrats are starting to slide among young people, among Hispanics and African Americans, when a lot of the fact patterns are pretty good, it's in part because Biden's team has not been selling the accomplishments of this administration and they have not been responding clearly enough to these kind of trends that are not their friend. Now, I -- one thing really freaked me out about the poll, though, was the three-point gap where Biden is leading among democracy. I frankly don't know what to do about that.

What's at stake, voters could hand Republicans a trifecta of control in the commonwealth, which already has a Republican governor and Republican-controlled state house. And this could have major repercussions for several key issues, from gun control, to the environment, to what's become the biggest issue of the election and probably the 2024 election, abortion.Here's Governor Glenn Youngkin. He's calling for a 15-week abortion ban. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV. GLENN YOUNGKIN (R-VA): And on the topic of abortion, this is a tough topic. It's one of the most divisive topics across Virginia and America today. I really feel that this is a moment for us to come together around reasonable limits where we can protect life at 15 weeks, where a baby feels pain, with full exceptions in the case of rape and incest and when the mother's life is at risk. And I think this is a place that Virginians can come together. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And abortions that happen after 15 weeks, it's because something has gone horribly wrong, and that is a complicated decision that needs to be left to patients and healthcare providers.",
