Also happening over the next two hours, rousing speeches from the Obamas at the Democratic National Convention, taking aim squarely at Donald Trump as they rally for Kamala Harris. Hope for a ceasefire in Gaza fading after Israel's Prime Minister bluntly warns there might not be a deal. This despite continued efforts from world leaders, including U.S. Secretary of State, Antony Blinken. And Argentina quarantines a cargo ship as concerns grow over the outbreak of Mpox. We're also keeping a watch, of course, on stock market futures. Markets here in New York City open just about 30 minutes from now. Little bit of green there for you to start your Wednesday on the East Coast of the U.S. we'll keep an eye on that. Meantime, all focus on politics here in the United States. And it is a big, big night for Governor Tim Walz, who, of course, will be the headliner tonight. He is Kamala Harris's running mate taking the stage in Chicago. Former President Bill Clinton also on deck Tuesday night, providing a night of Democratic star party at the party's national convention. And a little Stevie Wonder there for you. Former First Lady Michelle Obama, getting a raucous reception, really bringing down the House as she made her impassioned case for Kamala Harris to be the next president. Her husband, the 44th President of the United States, focusing on themes of unity and hope as the driving forces to get Harris elected. But both Obamas really taking the gloves off last night and hitting back at the man who succeeded Barack Obama in the White House and who has attacked them for years. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MICHELLE OBAMA, FORMER U.S. FIRST LADY: For years, Donald Trump did everything in his power to try to make people fear us. See his limited, narrow view of the world, made him feel threatened by the existence of two hard work and highly educated, successful people who happen to be black. Who's going to tell him that the job he's currently seeking might just be one of those black jobs. BARACK OBAMA, 44TH U.S. PRESIDENT: There's the childish nicknames, the crazy conspiracy theories, this weird obsession with crowd sizes. We do not need four more years of bluster and bumbling and chaos. We have seen that movie before, and we all know that the sequel is usually worse. America is ready for a new chapter. America is ready for a better story. We are ready for a President Kamala Harris. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Michelle Obama led the crowd last night in a refrain of, do something, do something. She was pleading with Democratic voters not to be complacent, because often when you're in a convention, and we've been in this almost Democratic bubble for the last month, as this new ticket has unfolded, it can seem like the outcome is preordained, that Democrats are going to win this election, but it is going to be a very close election. Donald Trump is exceedingly strong in some of these swing states, notwithstanding the fact that Harris has improved upon Former President Joe Biden's position and Trump still leads in most polls on the two key issues in this election, the economy and immigration.

I think worth noting as well that look, if you see that Russia has really two key allies in the world as it tries to sort of build up this axis against what it sees as Western dominance.

So far, authorities have not said how many people are on board this ship named Ina-Lotte with a Liberian flag. It comes from Brazil, where it last docked at Santos Port and was sailing to San Lorenzo Port here in Argentina. Now it is close to this port where it is not allowed to dock. Previously, between June and July, it was in Russia, and it has not had any port calls out of Europe since at least before April. According to the health ministry, so far, Argentina has not registered any cases of the clade 1V variant of Mpox.

That is the same lines that they have used for months now in their oppo against RFK Jr. So, kind of a weird turnaround for Donald Trump there. And I also -- you know I think be interesting to see if other Republicans would be so accepting to having him be a key part of not only the Trump campaign, but also in a future administration. Now, I also just want to quickly, we actually just heard from J.D. Vance of course, Trump's running me this morning on Fox &amp; Friends. He was asked about this comment. I'm going to just read for you a little bit of what he said. I don't think we have it written up yet, because he just made these remarks.

He went on to say that his pitch to him until a lot of his voters would be the Democratic Party of my grandparents that supported his Uncle John F. Kennedy for president has been completely abandoned by the modern leadership of the Democratic Party. Now I think -- you know a lot of people would question that last line from Vance. But Vance is backing Donald Trump on this saying -- you know I think we should welcome him, and it would show a line of people leaving the Democrats, particularly given he is a Kennedy and joining the Republican ticket. But also, worth noting in all of this Erica that RFK Jr., himself had said that he would potentially consider dropping out and endorsing Kamala Harris and her administration.
