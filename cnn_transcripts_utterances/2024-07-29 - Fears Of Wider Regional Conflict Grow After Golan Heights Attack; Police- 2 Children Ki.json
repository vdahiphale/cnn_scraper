      "sentences": "Well, what we heard yesterday was that after a meeting of the Israeli cabinet that Prime Minister Netanyahu and the defense minister, Yoav Gallant were authorized to strike back at Hezbollah at a -- in a manner and at a time of their choosing. Now, the anticipation was that last night, perhaps in the early hours of the morning that Israel would indeed strike Hezbollah. But that didn't happen.So the anticipation is growing about what and where Israel will strike. Now, today I had the opportunity to speak by phone with Lebanon's caretaker foreign minister, Abdallah Bou Habib, who told me that through diplomatic contacts, Lebanon had received assurances that Israel's response to that strike and the and Majdal Shams in the Golan Heights would be limited. Now, he didn't know exactly what limited means, but he told me that the Lebanese government interpretation of that was that it would be limited to military targets relating to Hezbollah, not the Beirut Airport, for example, or particularly the southern suburbs of Beirut, which is where many of Hezbollah's leaders are based. Nonetheless, because of growing fear of an Israeli response, we've seen, for instance, Germany and Italy advising their nationals to leave the country as soon as possible. We've seen, for instance, Lufthansa, the German airline, is canceling all flights to and from Beirut until the 5th of August. Air France has suspended flights today and tomorrow to Beirut. And there is simply a growing fear that Israel's response will come and it will be strong. Specifics we don't know about, but it's that lack of awareness is really feeding the sense of uneasiness here in the Lebanese capital -- Boris.",

And of course, Hamas came out and said that Israel had imposed a whole raft of new demands. Now, the prime minister's office in Jerusalem has denied that, but it does appear that hopes for a breakthrough on a ceasefire and the release of hostages and Palestinian prisoners have been dashed for now.Now, the hope was that basically, if there's a ceasefire in Gaza, that will certainly dramatically reduce tensions, not only there, but also on the border between Lebanon and Israel. Hezbollah has made it clear that as soon as there is quiet in Gaza, there will be quiet on the border. Now, we've seen they've actually made good on that back in November, when there was that brief period, when there was a truce, a ceasefire in Gaza and prisoners and detainees were released. Hezbollah stopped firing. The border was quiet. The hope is that if there's a breakthrough, there will be quiet here as well -- Boris/",

You know, we're seeing the sales drop because the prices have gotten out of whack.Fast food and McDonald's, it's supposed to be cheap. But over the past several years, we've seen McDonald's prices jump 40 percent since 2019. And so many consumers are saying we're not going to be paying these higher prices anymore. And what they're doing is they're cooking at home. They're shopping at Walmart or discount grocery stores like Aldi. And then when they do go out to eat, they're looking for places where they can really get value and a bang for their buck. So we've seen Chipotle sales actually rise 11 percent during its latest quarter. So this seems to be more of an issue with McDonald's than other chains.",

McDonald's says that this deal has drawn back some customers. The problem, though, Boris, is it's a limited time offer for McDonald's. So it's not going to last into the fall and the winter. It's just too cheap for the company to be able to make money off of it. So McDonald's is going to need some new strategies. It says it's going to be trying to add bigger hamburgers. So customers could look forward to bigger hamburgers. But these are some significant challenges for McDonald's, and it faces really tough competition.",

What you mentioned with the plot on the assassination attempt, that was obviously the most severe thing that we've seen on that front for a long time.This is more long-term covert meddling, trying to sow discord in the U.S. The U.S. intelligence officials believe that Iran was behind organizing some protests related to Gaza. Doesn't mean to say that all those protests are related to that, but this is kind of just a number of fronts in which Iran allegedly is trying to up the temperature here in the U.S., trying to make it more difficult to discern true from false online. And like you said, it comes on the heel of the assassination plot. So clearly, there is an increased tempo in Iranian efforts to influence the U.S. presidential election.",

And right now, more than anything, the determinant for that is who supports more aid to Ukraine, which, you know, across the ballot, whether it be on the Senate or House side or on the presidential ticket. And Donald Trump has made pretty clear his skepticism for supporting Ukraine on a number of fronts. So that hasn't changed. What has changed, according to the new assessment, Boris, is that Russia is continuing to use sort of these private companies to hide their hand or try to hide their hand in the way that they present information to Americans. So launder it through -- hire someone to write an article and not tell them who is behind the outlet.So if you're a freelance journalist, say, I need 100 bucks. Sure, I'll write a story about blah, blah, blah. And then later we learned that that might be a Russian intelligence cutout, that they're hiring people to do that.
