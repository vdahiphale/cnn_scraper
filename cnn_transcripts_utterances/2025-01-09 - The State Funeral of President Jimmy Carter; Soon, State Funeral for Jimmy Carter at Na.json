There's only one president left of the 20th century, which is a quite a statement that we are in a completely different era now from when Jimmy Carter was president of the United States. And you have to imagine that if you are a former president in those pews, you're thinking about the fact that, at some point, this is going to be a moment that will happen for you.I mean, I can't imagine what that must be like to know that this pomp and circumstance that you're witnessing for someone else could be at some point extended to you and all of those men, will be extended to them, all of those men there have gone through the planning process, all of those men there have thought about it, I think particularly of President Trump, who I think surprised a lot of people with how, at least his written statements and some of his verbal statements about Jimmy Carter have been incredibly gracious. He disagrees with Jimmy Carter on virtually everything, but something tells me that understanding he has been president once, he will be president again, understanding what that job entails, understanding what this moment means, having President Trump, not one, but two near death experiences just in the last year. He has been incredibly gracious about Jimmy Carter in at least his written word and some of his spoken word, despite a lot of policy disagreements, including some that he's trying to actively overturn right now as we speak.",

Almighty God, look with pity on the sorrows of your servants for whom we pray. Remember them, Lord, in mercy. Nourish them with patience. Comfort them with a sense of your goodness.

And just thinking about where we are now, where there are democracies, including this one, but also all around the globe, where world leaders are being ousted by their people, whether they're Democrats or Republicans for lots of reasons, but in large part because of economic despair, because of inflation. So, there are a lot of kind of bookends and similarities and parallels between the times back then and now, Justin Trudeau, coming back to him he's on his way out because of that.And, of course, there we see President Biden.",
