Now, with waning support in the West for his enemy, Russian President Vladimir Putin appears more emboldened than ever to pursue his war on Ukraine. The U.S. plans to roll out new sanctions on Friday, a day before the two-year anniversary of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. A senior U.S. official says the sanctions were in the works and are now being supplemented in the wake of Alexei Navalny's death. Vladimir Putin met with his defense minister on Tuesday, suggesting Russia should expand on its recent battlefield success after the fall of Avdiivka. And he mocked Ukrainian forces, saying they fled the town in chaos. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) VLADIMIR PUTIN, PRESIDENT OF RUSSIA (through translator): The leadership of the Ukrainian Armed Forces issued an order to withdraw its armed forces when they were already on the move and leaving the settlement. As I understand, that was done for political reasons in order to cover up the move and give it the appearance of an organized withdrawal. We see and know that was not the case. That it was, in fact, a runaway in the literal sense of the word. (END VIDEO CLIP) CHURCH (voice over): The global backlash over the death of Putin's fiercest political rival, Navalny, has done little to slow the Russian government's crackdown on dissent. According to state media, a U.S. Russian citizen has been arrested for treason, accused of collecting funds for Ukraine and openly supporting Kyiv. And on Tuesday, another American detained in Russia, Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich appeared in a Moscow courtroom, where the court upheld his detention until the end of March. In Ukraine, military officials are taking stock of what looks like a deteriorating situation. A Ukrainian commander on the outskirts of Avdiivka, says Russian forces can and will continue their advances in the war-ravaged town. What's clear is that Ukraine desperately needs weapons, ammunition, and other military support, promised by the United States. And Capitol Hill is dark with the U.S. House and Senate on recess. The White House lays the blame for the loss of Avdiivka on Republican lawmakers. Saying congressional inaction was the reason that Ukrainian troops were forced to withdraw from the town. CNN's Christiane Amanpour asked Ukraine's foreign affairs minister what he thinks about that. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Opposing the Kremlin right now is an extremely dangerous path to take. CHANCE (voice-over): Alexei Navalny knew it firsthand.

And it is just as despicable and cowardly that they are now hiding his body, lying pitifully, and waiting for the traces of another Putin's Novichok to disappear.

What you really see, and this is hugely problematic, Rosemary, is the same U.S. administration tactic being used in New York at the U.N.

And the message is keep international law out of this question when it involves our ally, Israel, whether in The Hague or in New York. And why that's so problematic? Is if you can't fly international law to Israel, then you can't apply international law to Hamas. And we reap what we sow here.

Scenes like this have played out across Ecuador over the past few weeks. The Armed Forces making a very public show of force, attempting to reinstate order within their own prisons. It's part of Ecuador's effort to neutralize terror groups and weed out gangs which have unleashed chaos nationwide from a live T.V. studio armed takeover, to random shootings in the streets. This most recent surge in violence sparked by the suspected escape of this man Jose Adolfo Macias known as Fito.
