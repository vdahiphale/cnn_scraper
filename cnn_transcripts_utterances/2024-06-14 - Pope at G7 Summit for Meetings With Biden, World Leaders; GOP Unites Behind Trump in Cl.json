In an address next hour, Pope Francis will talk about the risk of artificial intelligence. His message will be one drawn from his own experience with A.I. last year. Take a look at this deep fake photo of him in a white puffer jacket that I'm going to go ahead and show you the picture that went viral.CNN's M.J. Lee is in Italy, where President Biden will meet one on one with the pope today. M.J., let us know what you're going to discuss, and we should mention that that was not the picture with the puffer jacket. We have all seen it. He's got this big, huge puffer jacket on that actually he wasn't wearing. What are what are they expected to discuss? There it is. There's the A.I.-generated fake image there. But it is so interesting that the pope is discussing this with his age, with his knowledge about what's going on in the world to all of these leaders who are deeply concerned about things like deep fakes. M.J. LEE, CNN SENIOR WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, Sara, you're right. We have all seen that deep fake and remember it really well. It did go viral. And that is one of the reasons that the pope is set on discussing this issue that is important to the world leaders when he comes to the G7 today, he arrived actually in the last hour or so, and making history, becoming the first pope to attend this gathering. But there are a number of other really weighty issues that we expect the pope to discuss with the world leaders, including the two conflicts that have been the focus of some of these sessions already, the war in Ukraine, the situation in the Middle East, where, of course, the pope has been calling for an immediate ceasefire. But as a senior official talking to reporters here earlier today was saying it's also the pope, you know, he really has the freedom to talk about any issue that he would like with the leaders and going in the other direction, too. You can imagine that the leaders are going to be eager to talk to him about a number of different things when they meet today. And the president is going to be meeting separately and privately with the pope as well. They, of course, met back in 2021 at the Vatican. You can imagine that that was a really personally meaningful sit down for the president when that happened, given his faith. These are two men that are -- two of the most powerful and well known Catholics in the world. So, whatever comes out of that is going to be really interesting to seeing what kinds of things the two men end up discussing. The other thing I would just note the pope aside that is on the agenda for day two of the G7 summit today is a session on the Indo-Pacific. And I bring that up because this is the session where the G7 leaders are expected to talk about China's contribution to Russia's war economy and its defense industrial base and also just the broader issue of China flooding the global system with what the U.S. has warned is a production and manufacturing overcapacity. [07:05:09] And I do bring that up because that has been such an important feature of President Biden's foreign policy in his first term, trying to sort of deter China from all of those things that I just mentioned. So, the fact that that is going to be a focus of one of the working sessions coming up today, that is notable as well.",

She wouldn't say yes or no the president would or wouldn't commute his son's sentence. And that in and of itself had sort of taken on a life of its own and the White House knew that the president had a very good chance of being asked about that.I will just quickly note the first lady, Jill Biden, is not traveling with the president on this trip, but several of his grandchildren have joined him on this trip, and actually some of them were sitting in the front row at that press conference last night.",

There's a very good chance that who Donald Trump ultimately picks as his running mate was in one of the rooms, one of the meetings yesterday with House and Senate Republicans. And, really, the majority of people under consideration are lawmakers. You can see it here on the screen now. That includes Senators J.D. Vance, Senator Tim Scott, Marco Rubio, as well as Congressman Elise Stefanik and Byron Donalds. And so very well there could be someone who was in that room yesterday who is Donald Trump's potential vice president.

The justices could soon decide what happens when a pregnant woman shows up to the hospital during an emergency in a state where abortion is banned. It comes just one day after the Supreme Court ruled the abortion pill Mifepristone can stay on the market and after Senate Republicans voted to block a Democrat- led bill that would guarantee access to IVF nationwide.CNN's Medical Correspondent Meg Tirrell is joining us now. How does this ruling on Mifepristone impact what could happen in the ruling that is going forward on emergency room care?",

      "sentences": "Yes, Sara. So that Mifepristone decision was a unanimous tossing out of the case really on standing. They did not get into the merits of the case, and that is not expected to be the case with this next opinion that comes down regarding abortion. This one concerns a federal law known as EMTALA, which concerns hospitals that provide emergency care and participate in Medicare, which is essentially most hospitals, and it's a federal law that was enacted in 1986, essentially requiring those hospitals to provide stabilizing care to any patient who shows up, including pregnant women. And it's regardless of the patient's ability to pay. This was really put into place to avoid dumping patients at other hospitals if there were concerns about their ability to pay.Now, this law, folks say, is in direct conflict with Idaho's abortion ban. Idaho's abortion ban essentially bans all abortions except to save the life of the pregnant person and with rare other circumstances. And so there's that question over the saving the life of the patient versus stabilizing the health of the patients. And what doctors argue is that you could have situations where somebody shows up who is pregnant and they're having a complication that could threaten their organs, their future fertility, the only way to treat them is an abortion. And right now they say in states like Idaho and particularly Idaho in this circumstance, doctors are afraid to provide those procedures. And we have even heard about patients being shipped out of Idaho to other states so that they can get that care because doctors are too concerned to provide it. So, we are waiting to see if we get that opinion from the Supreme Court today. We do not know how that is going to go. But the previous decision yesterday came down allowing access to medication abortion, which is the most common way that people access abortion in the country right now. About two-thirds of abortions are obtained through medication abortion. 19 percent of those are obtained through telehealth. And that was really a key thing that's allowed to stay the same for medication abortion as a result of yesterday. Sara?",

It's something that's very important to him. The pope himself likes to crack jokes. He said to the comedians, please pray for me, not against me.
