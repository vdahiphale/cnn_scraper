There's running into the kicker and there's roughing the kicker. Both look like the same, but they're different penalty calls, right? One is more egregious.And I think, to Ryan's point, right, he's talking about the more egregious part of what Trump's rhetoric is doing right now because there are underlying issues. Just look at what's happening in Springfield. There are more migrants that are coming into the area, the police department there and how they handle it, there's a language barrier with dealing with Haitian immigrants. So, there are issues, fundamental issues that are administrative. But the administrative part, to Van's part, is not sexy. It's not sexy to talk about the crisis at the border and to talk about the administrative issues with the backlog of asylum cases and all of that hiring more agents to help, right? None of that is sexy, Laura. So, what Trump is doing is trying to, what Van said, he's trying to over amplify it. But the data doesn't show that because violent crime in Aurora is down 14%. Assaults are down 4% year over year. Men lie, women lie, numbers don't. So, I'm the ultimate balls and strikes umpire here, as you know, Laura. There is an issue, but it's so much more sexier to make it this trumped-up version, no pun intended, which is what Donald Trump is doing when you could actually talk about the core issues that are fundamental because the people that are working on the ground are saying it's an issue. COATES: Well, I love the analogy. I remember the roughing and the running into a kicker, a really good one, although baseball fans everywhere now are like, you couldn't give me a baseball analogy, Mike Leon?

And so, that's why people are concerned. Now, it's the easiest thing in the world to say, yes, he won the election, and he's going to lose -- yes, Biden won the election and Kamala Harris is going to lose the next one. That's what any normal politician would say. When you have a politician like a J.D.

Now, back to Van's overall point, right? If it's a non-starter, why does he keep bringing it up? Laura, you and I have talked about this before. The way we are framing questions when we asked the former president why he won't accept the results of a 2024 election, he's participating in the process. Of course, he's going to accept the results. I know what happened on January 6th. But you don't participate in something that you feel like you've been wronged in three different times. In 2016, he feels like he won by more. In 2020, he feels like he didn't lose. You don't participate in something three straight times. And I think for J.D. Vance, the reason he's pivoting is typical republican strategy message, right? Answer through the question and get what you want to get out about it. And so, I think for J.D. Vance, he's doing the right thing by pivoting and reframing the question, but I think it is imperative of us to kind of move away from it and ask, reframe the question in a different direction about trusting the institutions and putting this fear and doubt into the public.",

Look, I'm the Latino on the panel, even though I'm a quarter Afro-Cuban, so I'm going to throw myself in the mix there. Far from me to police the African-American community, right?But Roger Steele, the popular Black golf influencer, has a video out there where he's playing a Trump course, and he says, it's a really nice course. Makes you want to think about it. Right? And he's like, no, absolutely not. But the Democratic Party does need to start talking to us. And he's like, you're right, you're right. And I've always thought about that video because that's always the refrain I hear, not only in the Latino community, but in the black community as well, right? Like Democrats take advantage of us. They take advantage of the vote, right? And so, I think to Nina's point and to Professor Dyson's point, good to see you again, brother, one of the things that I think that is imperative of Kamala Harris to talk about is the struggles of people like me. For example, Laura. I grew up in the Bronx, right? I grew up in a community where education is at the bottom of the state of New York. You know, foods are high, trans fats in that community, right? The cost of living in that community is very cheap because you don't make that much money. And I had to move 45 minutes north to Westchester County to actually be around a 90% white community that has now delis and not those foods and high trans fats, and has a community and environment that I could grow up in and go to high school because I couldn't make it out of the Bronx if I had stayed there. That was my parents' fear. How do you talk to those inner cities and those communities? And I know she has been going to Detroit and making stops in Pittsburgh and other suburbs -- I mean, excuse me, other urban cities. And that's what I think at the core of Nina's issue, is go into those communities and talk about how you're actually going to affect change because the statistical data is there to show that these people don't see a way out and there's very few of us that are on TV, let's say for example, to be able to showcase that way out or whatever career path they want to take.",

He thinks that, you know, the states of this election are existential, as probably lots of people do, kind of which side of the existential divide you find yourself on.And so, Elon really did not want Joe Biden to win. But he was somewhat maybe lukewarm about Trump specifically. And then over the course of the spring, he had a series of dinners with friends where he sorts of kind of got into the idea of spending all of his resources to elect Trump. He really is concerned about illegal immigration specifically.
