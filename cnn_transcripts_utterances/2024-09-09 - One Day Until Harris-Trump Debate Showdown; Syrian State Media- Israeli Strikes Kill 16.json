We are one day away from the first presidential debate between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump, not only will this be their first debate, but it will also so be the first time the two candidates have even met after the former president skipped Biden's inauguration in 2021. In preparation for tomorrow night's pivotal campaign moment, the vice president spent the last few days in Pittsburgh participating in mock debates Trump has said not to like debate prep, opting for what his team calls policy time. More significantly this weekend, Trump warned, threatened, we should say that he'll jail any official he considers an election cheat. He also suggested voting in Pennsylvania is fraudulent. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT &amp; 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: This election, they're lying, cheating, thieving, hoaxing, and plotting will come to an end. We got to stop the cheating. If we stopped that cheating, if we don't let them cheat, I don't even have to campaign anymore. We're going to win by so much. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

With 57 days until the election, the race remains too close to call. The latest CNN poll of polls shows Harris averaging 49 percent, Trump 47 percent. That is, we should note within the margin of error.Let's bring in CNN's Kevin Liptak and Stephen Collinson. Kevin, begin with you, Harris, is there for some voters and some of this is in the polling data that a lot of voters open to her, but don't know enough about her. And if the campaign is aware of that, I wonder how they're preparing to answer those questions for such voters.",

So I think when she heads to Philadelphia, that will be her task. And as she has prepared for the debate over the last couple of days, what her advisers say, she's doing is trying to come up with answers that melt both her agenda and her policy proposals with aspects of her biography because they really do think that that combination is a winning one when they're talking to that slice of the electorate that is still deciding between herself and Donald Trump. And I think part of the task that you will have on the debate stage is trying to separate herself from some ways, from the Biden administration policies. Of course, she's a member of the Biden administration. She's the vice president while also projecting, as she calls it, a new way forward and making herself out to be the change candidate. So it is a needle that she's trying to thread. And, you know, at these debate prep sessions that she's been holding in Pittsburgh for the last couple of days. Part of what she's trying to do is find ways to remain cool amid an onslaught of expected attacks from Donald Trump on the debate stage. She has tried to come up with arguments and retorts that won't sort of throw her off balance in a way that would look sort of unpresidential on a stage. And so it is kind of a large combination of things that she's trying to do in this debate tomorrow night.",

      "sentences": "That's right. It's interesting because if you watch the campaign advertising, if you listen to vice presidential nominee J.D. Vance, there is a clear and succinct argument that the campaign is making against Harris on the economy, basically saying that she is complicit in the surge in prices and supermarkets in high interest rates that were required to bring down inflation.[15:05:03] On immigration, they tackled her role as they see it, as their fate, as the failure of the Biden administration patient to crack down on undocumented migration. Trump has not found it very easy for whatever reason, to stick to those attacks is not on message. He doesn't like to be on message as we saw from his rally this weekend. And a very unhinged press conference which he spent about an hour rambling about his legal problems on Fridays. So I think it will be interesting, as you say, to see whether the former president can come up with a clear critique of the vice president or will he sort of stoop to his normal trade of insults and falsehoods and lies? The Harris campaign is clearly braced for that, and that was one reason why they wanted the mics and the debate to be unmuted. And one reason why the Trump campaign, I think did not want that to happen because they didn't want Trump to be fact-checked in real time and they don't want to play into the desire of the former vice president to show Americans on primetime TV before millions of viewers exactly what kind of volcanic temperament that the former president still has.",

Certainly this is the last debate that's currently on the schedule, but they're not ruling out the possibility that there could be further debates down the line depending on how tomorrow night goes. Of course, this debate, the rules for it had a lot of ways already been determined because this was a debate that originally were supposed to feature Trump and President Biden. Any future debates would have to have new rules debated and decided upon. So certainly, depending on how tomorrow night goes, a future debate could have a very different look and feel. I do think it's notable when you talk to the Harris campaign folks, the one fact that they keep repeating over and over is that Donald Trump has now or will now have participated in seven general election debates. That's more than any candidate in modern history, because he's been the Republican nominee for the last three cycles. And they do think that that puts Harris at a disadvantage. She has not been on a debate stage in four years. And so they do think they're heading into this as an underdog. So you do see this expectation games very much being played.",

She's used to that. I think everything she does is an opportunity to introduce herself further to the American people. The difference between other opportunities and tomorrow night, she will have her opponent on this stage. You would get an opportunity to talk about her record.

To me, the campaign begins tomorrow night in some ways, but it's also a moment in which the possibilities become seemingly the summer really showed us what is again to expect the unexpected, and we know that in politics.But when you're talking about how the Trump campaign games out this moment, a moment in which they're coming in a bit weak, you know, look, there's no question about it. There was a really successful DNC in Chicago just last month and the Walz and Harris campaign are coming off of that because Walz has had a good reception, but J.D. Vance is not and Donald Trump is right at the door waiting. So we need to be very clear. This is a man who's in cognitive decline and we see that in how he exhibits his sentiments every day of the week. He's a serial flip flopper, but lately, Jim, I've seen him behave in a manner that isn't just angry and unhinged because it's like palatable right to his base. It's because he's scared and doesn't know what's going to work. And so after tomorrow night, I think we'll see the campaign do what it's tried to do for many weeks, which is thread that needle of moderation while at the same time saying, hey, right wing, we got you, we'll enact a lot of Project 2025. I mean, he's quite public, is he not with his plans for a second term? Let's just take case in point. His post on Truth Social this weekend about going after election officials he called cheaters. I'm going to quote from it here. The 2024 election, where votes have just started being cast, that's not true yet, will be under the closest professional scrutiny. And when I win, those people that cheated will be prosecuted the fullest extent the law which will include long term prison sentences. Those involved in unscrupulous behaviors will be sought out, caught prosecuted at level, unfortunately, never seen before in our country. Just a brief fact check, Antjuan, I mean, it is Trump himself who was indicted multiple times for attempting to overturn the 2020 election, much -- much of which was public, right? And in public pressure on Republican campaign officials not to honor the results of that election how concerned should we be as we read these words as a menu of what he intends if he were to win?",

This -- we are cast in a survivable, but for every other constituency falls under the American, American umbrella. This is a generational election because whoever wins this election will ultimately have a large say so in what happens in this country for the next 46 to 56 years when you think about the courts when you think about the policy agenda, and when you think about protecting the progress that has already been may particularly in these past four years.",

And what is clear and just as you said, the defense minister just a couple of days ago over the weekend, was briefing troops in Gaza when he talked about, we could redeploy you at a moments notice to the north, and we've got everything in place to do it.There's a sense up here in the north that two things. One is, there is a slight up tempo in the military activity, IDF activity they see around them, not significant enough to indicate that there's any major, major operation about to start now. But I think what there's a deeper sense of here it's a real frustration that as you say, there's been an up tempo in the number of strikes here. In fact, a drone flying into a civilian building just inside northern Israel, a building, by the way, in a town that has not been evacuated. So there are civilians living there. Luckily, no one was injured in that particular strike, but apparently some troops were injured elsewhere by missiles coming across from -- from Lebanon today. So, the other sense you get from speaking to people here is that the government isn't doing enough, that some people are already so frustrated here. They're talking about moving their families back in here, despite the evacuation orders, so that they can try to get on with their lives here. They know it's going to be a massive rebuild, but that's the level of frustration. So I think at the moment, people here would tell you at the moment what they're hearing from the government in terms of deeper military actually in Lebanon. It's still talk.

No, there's a lot of talk about it, a lot of pressure from the United States, from the U.K., from the French as well on Israel not to have a deeper military exercise or operations up here in the north. But, you know, the frustration a and you'd probably pick this up when you were here as well, Jim, the frustration is that the movement that they need to see by Hezbollah on the other side is at least ten kilometers back from the border, and the removal of all the weapons.

Now, Jim, we have to note the timing of this report. It's coming out in the heat of the election season, just a day before the presidential debate and it does the Republican one does aim to implicate Vice President Kamala Harris in the chaos of the withdrawal. This is opposed to a preliminary report that barely made any mention of her. This report mentions her dozens of times as being part of the Biden/Harris administration says that she was in lockstep with President Joe Biden on that withdrawal. Now, McCaul, the chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, the Republican chairman there, said it was not meant to be a partisan report and that he is just seeking accountability here.

You've seen this in candidates, Senate Democratic candidates in Montana and Ohio and across the board, going after what they'll oftentimes have been facing very deep-pocketed of wealthy Republican candidates. Republicans on the other hand, as they're doing in Pennsylvania, trying to nationalize the race, tried to tide incumbent Democratic senator to issues like inflation, immigration, and the top of the ticket. And what is notable, too, is that Senator Bob Casey making clear that he is very much aligning himself with the top of his ticket, not concerned about getting tied to Harris and some of our more liberal positions there. But, Jim, already some Republicans jumping on that comment that he made, that saying where he breaks from Kamala Harris. We'll see if that position and those comments change in the weeks ahead.",
