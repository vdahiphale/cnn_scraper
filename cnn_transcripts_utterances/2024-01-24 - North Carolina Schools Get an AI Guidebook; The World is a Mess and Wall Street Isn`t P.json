Sierra Space conducted the testat NASA`s Marshall Space Flight Center in Alabama, it was to measure the strength of its expandable structure. The company says the module called a life habitat is a place for living and working on a future space station. It launches on a rocket and inflates on orbit and has to be strong enough to withstand the harsh environment of space. To test that, the soft structure was inflated until it failed. Sierra said, it exceeded in NASA`s stress recommendation by 27%. Sierra Space has an agreement with NASA to test commercial products at NASA facility and plans more aggressive testing of the habitat this year. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

North Carolinarecently became the fourth state to create official guidelines for using AI in schools. The guidebook says teachers can use AI to save time helping with things like automating administrative tasks so they can focus more on actually teaching and students while they can use AI tools to help them overcome certain hurdles like voice to text, for example, could help some students who may face challenges while typing or writing and translation tools could help some students who are still working to break down language barriers. North Carolina`s main point of emphasis was that they feel it`s important to incorporate AI in the classroom, but it`s just as important to do so responsibly. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DR. ROB JACKSON, SUPERINTENDENT, BUNCOMBE COUNTY SCHOOLS: To make sure our students are able to leverage the value of artificial intelligence while protecting from temptations, cheating and -- and doing something they shouldn`t be doing academically. We are charged with preparing our students for the world that they`ll enter as they leave our school system. We have to make sure they`re ready. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And I wanted to make sure that I can participate in creating a city and a country that they can be proud to come back to and work and live the same way that I have. And it`s never an easy topic to hear on the news about the perception of countries like mine when it comes to poverty, when it comes to difficulties of life. And instead of sitting back and watching, I felt that I had a conviction like many others to participate in changing that narrative by working here and really changing what a city like Addis Ababa could look like in the next 20 to 50 years.",

We are at Kubik`s factory facility where we`re going to be converting over 45,000 kilos of plastic waste every single day into our building materials. Today`s a very exciting and a very emotional day. It`s been two years in the making with a lot of ups and downs in making it work. So just even seeing a container open and seeing the stuff that we`ve been talking about for over a year has just put a lot of tears into our eyes. The team is really excited. We`re very uplifted. And we really want to see now this working not only in the factory but all over the country. ASFAW (On camera): Success for me is a happy customer. In our case, a happy customer is that person that never had the opportunity and choice to live in a clean, beautiful house, being able to do that. (END VIDEO CLIP)",
