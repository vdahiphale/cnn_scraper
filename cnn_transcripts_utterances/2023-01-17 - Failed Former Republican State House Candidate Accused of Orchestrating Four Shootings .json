They really just don't want to interfere. And I think we're seeing that coming from everyone from the president on down. He spoke at this MLK Day breakfast yesterday, and when he spoke privately with Reverend Al Sharpton, I spoke with him yesterday, he said that he didn't once bring up the classified documents issue. And when he did bring up House Republicans to Sharpton, he said that it wasn't to talk about the investigations that they're promising, but to talk about the fact that he wants to reach out to Republicans to talk about an issue like voting rights.
