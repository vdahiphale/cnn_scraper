And let's remember, the scrutiny isn't just on the actions of that day. Even the House Committee as well has been looking at the weeks leading up to it as well. And just to remind viewers, as well, when Lee is imploring the White House Meadows at that point to meet with Sidney Powell, Sidney Powell then be involved in that meeting in December, where Giuliani and others are putting out ideas such as seizing voting machines, at one point, wondering if there's anything they could do with the DoD as well in terms of martial law. So Sidney, even the referral to Sidney Powell, who was instrumental in efforts to try and overturn the election should be noted there as well.",

These are three Republicans who are competitive for House seats who attended Trump's January 6th rally.Now they all say they had nothing to do with the violence. But you have three who were at the rally, who are in play in three different states in Wisconsin and Ohio and North Carolina. Again, you know, you know, that's just 20 years ago, to think that somebody who showed up at a rally.

You also see it in the views of Americans and you see a big partisan splitter from that New York Times/Siena College poll of likely voters. Are you comfortable voting for a candidate who says the 2020 election was stolen, if you agree with most of their other positions, only 3 percent of Democrats are very comfortable doing that, 7 percent.So 10 percent of Democrats might do that, if you look at it that way, 74 percent of Republicans, 40 percent of Republicans say they are very comfortable voting for somebody who says the 2020 election was stolen, 34 percent of Republicans say they're somewhat comfortable the 2020 election was not stolen. KANNO-YOUNGS: Right. I mean, at this point just a year ago, it brings, there was a time immediately after January 6th, where you heard some Republican leaders say, well, this will be the moment that Trump fades away. It was almost like there was this rush to say that this was a one off that will now move on from. That hasn't happened at all. You saw same Republican leaders then going to Mar-a-Lago as well to show loyalty to Trump. You've seen national security agencies continue to issue warnings about how this rhetoric around the false claims of the of election fraud continue to motivate political at times, potential political violence as well and have seeped into the mainstream. These concerns have been repeated throughout and this is the result as you were saying.",

So he's winning or trying to win on the home front.But here in Ukraine, the timing of it, as you say, it's coming, you know, I'm feeling the chill here standing right now. By the end of the week is going to be even colder. We're entering that period where the temperature could drop below freezing. So for Ukrainians, it seems really callous. And that's the point that President Zelenskyy is making these attacks of terrorism. They're not on the front line. They're attacking the population. They're attacking the way that they live. But rather than weakening resolve, you know, people here are telling us that it's strengthening their resolve, strengthening their determination in the fight.

So this is political messaging at this point, they've run out of options at the White House. But it is clear that they do view this as a winning message.KANNO-YOUNGS: It was interesting to see also obviously the focus on young voters as well. But he did broaden it towards the end saying, look, go tell your grandparents as well tell your parents about this. It almost echoes the language around him making this very much about privacy rights making, trying to tell people that it may not stop here at this issue, but it could, there could be a precedent set here and that it really is about the loss of constitutional rights, talking to the white, people around the White House and Democrats. That has been an effort to try and galvanize a broad coalition of voters here.",
