Are you willing to do that? Is that what you're talking about when you're talking about a red line? And the reaction was, we don't want to expand this war. So, a little bit of a different stance there, although he also, to the U.N., said a red line had been crossed by Israel. We are waiting to see what happens. Iran has its fingers, of course, in backing Hamas. It also has its fingers in backing Hezbollah, which is in Lebanon. And they have fired rockets over into the Israel side. There has been some fighting on that part of the border, in the northern border. So, there is great concern that this is going to escalate into a regional conflict. Speaking of escalation, I want to talk to you about this airport in Russia that was forced to shut down after a mob of anti-Israel protesters broke in and charged the tarmac after they learned that a flight from Tel Aviv had arrived on Sunday. Take a look at this. A terrifying scene for people who are coming off that flight. It was a scene at the Dagestan Airport, a region that is mostly Muslim. Videos show a large crowd storming the airport, making people their way onto the runway. You can also see some of the people waving Palestinian flags. There has been a great deal of support for Palestinians in Gaza as they watch these massive airstrikes and ground operations there and the number of people who have been killed. Joining us now is Frederik Pleitgen. He is in Berlin watching all that's happening there in Dagestan. Tell us what you can about what happened here as we look at these pictures that if you were on that plane landing from Tel Aviv would have been extremely frightening.",

      "sentences": "Yes, all the planes that were at the tarmac at that point in time when that happened. And I think one of the things that we can certainly ascertain, Sara, from what we've seen so far is that this was something that was a lot worse than just a protest.Essentially, what this descended into was this mob of people, this crowd of people hunting Jews and hunting Israelis. That's essentially what transcended at that airport in the town of Makhachkala, which is actually the capital of the Dagestan region in the North Caucasus of Russia. There's some really troubling scenes not just of that protest that took place inside the terminal building, where that was charged, that crowd overwhelming the security forces, then getting onto the tarmac, but also some of the people in that crowd singling out folks who apparently were on that flight from Tel Aviv, taking away their passports, and essentially making them prove that they are not Jews. There's also some reports on Russian media and Russian social media as well about another crowd of people, or people from that same crowd also charging a hotel and going room to room, also once again, searching for Israelis, searching for Jews, so, definitely a troubling development that happened there in Dagestan. And you're absolutely right, it was after that flight from Tel Aviv landed, obviously a very angry crowd, was already there at that airport. It was quite interesting because we did see this morning there was some condemnation from the religious leader of that region, but we have also just heard from the Kremlin, they are blaming outside influence, as they put it, for inciting that crowd, Sara. SIDENR:  All right. Well, there have been protests, this one is very different, but there have been protests around the region here in Jordan, in Egypt and in Lebanon as well. But this is a very different look where they are literally hunting down Israelis and Jews that are landing there in Dagestan.

Hezbollah and other fighters, Al-Quds force, firing artillery, IEDs coming in via small parachutes, also attempted ground incursions, breaking through the walls here, Hezbollah fighters and others and Israel firing back.We got caught, my team and I, in the middle of that yesterday in one of those villages right up along the edge of the border, in fact, a village that is cut right down the middle by the wall separating Israel from Lebanon. [07:15:04] And it shows us the intensity of this conflict up here so far. Have a look. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SCIUTTO (voice over):  Towns like Arab al-Aramshe along Israel's border with Lebanon are mostly deserted now, evacuated due to fear of attacks by Hezbollah. Makes is one of the few who stayed behind. And from his roof, he shows us where Hezbollah fighters attempted to cross the Israeli border just a few days ago. Minutes after we arrive, we see the threat is constant. Hezbollah shells fired from across the border land on the hillside just opposite us. We are on a border town between Israel on this side and just beyond the fence is Lebanon. And as we've been standing here, if you see the smoke off in the distance, that is the result of Hezbollah artillery fire from Lebanon into Israel. You could see the smoke rising in the distance. And speaking to residents here, this is a regular event. It's happening every day. Makes and his twin brother sent their families south for safety, but stayed behind themselves to protect their homes.

Minutes later, Israeli soldiers block the road, warning of more incoming Hezbollah fire.We're very close to the Lebanon border in northern Israel, and soldiers have just blocked the road here in both directions. We can't go either way. You can hear mortar and artillery fire going out. That is from Israel towards Lebanon. We've also heard artillery fire coming from Lebanon. And the concern is, the soldiers telling us that there are possible infiltrations across the border from Lebanon by presumably Hezbollah fighters. And that's why the level of concern is so great. The Israeli military is focused on Gaza, but the northern front now faces daily attacks. On Sunday, a rocket fired from Lebanon landed in the city of Kiryat Shmona, setting this home ablaze. Hezbollah also claimed this strike on an Israeli tank a few days ago, with the IDF responding by targeting Hezbollah positions in Southern Lebanon. All the while, the constant exchange of artillery fire rumbles across the frontier. (END VIDEOTAPE) SCIUTTO (on camera):  The IDF updated just a short time ago, which seems to explain that incident that we got caught in the middle of yesterday that they saw a fighter approaching the border fence and they responded with fire and they say they eliminated that fighter. These are regular attempts across the border and many times a day fire across the border. Now, Phil, this is not a full scale war in the north by any means, but it is a low grade one. And, of course, the question becomes do these sporadic attacks turn into something more significant? And that would be truly a two-front war for Israel, and that's part of the reason, frankly, Phil, that you have this enormous presence of U.S. forces in the region, including in the Eastern Med to send a message to Hezbollah and its backers in Iran that if that were to happen, the U.S. would be here in the region as well with at least the capability of responding.

They are still conducting this investigation and say that a toxicology report is needed to complete and let us know what the cause of death is here. And, normally, these autopsies and toxicology reports could take several weeks, which means that we likely will need more time before we know what caused his death. Sources have told CNN, though, that no foul play here is suspected. The L.A. Times reporting that he was found unresponsive in his hot tub on Saturday. The 911 call came in at 4:07 and it was a water rescue emergency. Then it was LAPD who took over at 4:10 P.M., and they said that it was a death investigation. So, again, more is needed to exactly find out what happened here. His family released a statement to People Magazine saying they were heartbroken by the tragic loss of a son and a brother. But they also said that he brought joy to the world with his acting, but also as a friend. And he was a person that wanted to be remembered as someone who helped people. He was willing to be open and to share his struggles with addiction in order to help people. He said he wanted to talk to people one-on-one as a group, anyone going through those struggles, because he said he was able to overcome them and wanted others to overcome them as well. He wanted to be remembered as someone who lived well and loved well and was a seeker. Of course, a lot of us remember him by Chandler. That was really the role that brought him to fame. And it was, you know, him making us laugh, that sarcastic, very funny one-liners and the jokes. That truly was what brought so much laughter to so many of us in the 90s and the early 2000s. But there were many roles. He started out with smaller roles, got more prominent roles, and it was Friends, though, that really brought him to fame. But this is a group of people that were really close on and off screen. They negotiated their contracts together.
