Homes, neighborhoods, communities are unrecognizable at this hour. The mayor of Rolling Fork, Mississippi, says his city is gone. And the images we're seeing tonight offer terrible proof of that. But the heartbreak goes so much deeper. At least 25 people are now confirmed dead in Mississippi. Another person was killed in Alabama. For perspective in all of this consider this fact. More people have been killed by tornadoes in the past 24 hours than in all of last year in the United States. Last hour, I spoke with Mississippi Democratic Congressman Bennie Thompson, whose district includes some of the worst damaged from the storm. Here's what he had to say. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. BENNIE THOMPSON (D-MS): It was devastation beyond imagination. First of all, we had no lights in the entire community. People were absolutely stunned at what had just occurred. And so as the night wore on, it was clear that this was something that people have never seen before. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

But there also has been some hope that maybe there have been survivors and that's what we can see behind me right here. If you look down first responders, they've been working tirelessly now for over 24 hours to try and find survivors, to hunt through that rubble, and this area right here that's where the RM Palmer chocolate company used to be. But of course, as you keep seeing this video, it went up in flames in that explosion. So here's what we know at this point, two people confirmed dead, five people missing, no cause just yet, but again it's been a mixed bag because one person over the night, last night, was found alive in the rubble. First responders were able to take that person, and taken to hospital. But again still, we are looking for at least five more people and they do not know the status or they have not told us at least the status of those people yet.

That is a group of people who are incarcerated for their alleged actions on January 6th at that Capitol -- actions that they had inside of the Capitol.This song has been on iTunes, and it's something that he's clearly fully embracing. He asked the audience just stand up, clearly again giving reverence to the people that were incarcerated for this. We know that he's continued to call them political prisoners. But this was the first time the collaboration and the first time we've actually heard him air that song here. Now he's been going on since he took the stage about various investigations. It's unclear where he's touching on which one because there has been a variety here of talking about specific lawyers. Lawyers who worked for Hillary Clinton at one point. Talking about the potential indictment. But he is again really focusing in on what we've seen of this 2024 election, which is this kind of energy around retribution. That this is the final battle in 2024. It's something we heard him say at CPAC and we heard him say it here. And as you mentioned this comes after we have seen a series of messages on Truth Social, post on his social media site, essentially calling for some sort of violence, saying it could ensue if he is potentially indicted. Also calling for protests at a certain point. We know that aides had asked him not to do that. They said that it could create optics that were similar to January 6th. But again he took the stage today playing the song in which he collaborated with people who are imprisoned for their alleged actions that day on the Capitol, and he has continued to talk about the, as you just heard, rigged system. Talking about the judicial system. Talking about those various investigations. As we know there is a potential indictment looming in that New York investigation into the hush money payments. That's the one that he has really been posting about lately. But we've heard him touch on several and they expect that to be the theme of this entire speech here tonight -- Jim.",

We should remember that. And even this week, most Republican leaders a rallying around him.

They have to pass an act of Congress, I believe, and they've also got to make sure they know one thing that it is a National Security threat.There wasn't much in evidence during this discussion on Capitol Hill, and that's what they need to do. They can't just say it's dangerous, they have to show it's dangerous. And it's been going -- TikTok has been going through a review by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the US. So, there has to be actual evidence that this is happening and that was lacking in this hearing, I think.",

This is the speech of 150 million Americans.And so I think that's going to have challenges. There's going to be the consumer backlash.

Those are legitimate questions for Congress to ask. It's just that they don't do anything. And that to me is, you know, you can complain about these tech companies all you want, but it's a real abrogation of power by our elected officials not to do anything, including about addiction. They mentioned this here with TikTok during this hearing, well, all of the other apps have this problem, too. And so, it is a much more systemic issue.

But Russian officials say the moves were humanitarian gestures, not forced deportations.CNN's David McKenzie and his team traveled close to the frontline to tell the story of one such alleged crime and how Ukrainians tried to stop it. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) DAVID MCKENZIE, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice over): Approaching the southern front line in Kherson. In the liberated city, many have fled, it is deceptively quiet until the relentless terror. The often indiscriminate, almost daily Russian shelling. We've come to investigate a very deliberate horror of the Russian occupation. MCKENZIE (on camera): So the children who stayed here were under five years old mostly. This orphanage had more than 40 children here. MCKENZIE (voice over): Helena (ph) was a nurse here for 17 years, not a single child is left. (HELENA speaking in foreign language.) MCKENZIE (voice over): \"I feel emptiness. Emptiness. Everything has just stopped,\" she says. \"The children had everything. They were so happy. The children were happy.\" Now, it's just silence and small reminders of them. Their names still on each locker, because some children's home is now a crime scene. (HELENA speaking in foreign language.) MCKENZIE (voice over): \"They warned us to collect their clothes,\" says Helena. \"The Russians and collaborators called in the evening and said to prepare the children for the morning. The buses arrived at eight.\" The heartbreaking scenes captured for Russian propaganda shared on a Russian MPs Telegram channel. The bewildered children taken from their beloved nurses in October, transported to Russian occupied Crimea or Russia itself say Ukrainian investigators. But instead of hiding this alleged war crime, Russians advertised it. (IGOR KASTYUKEVICH speaking in foreign language.) MCKENZIE (voice over): \"Children will be taken to safe conditions in Crimea,\" he says. \"I will definitely go and visit.\" Investigators said it was part of a premeditated Russian mission to take Ukrainian children. They even targeted hospitals. MCKENZIE (on camera): There was a lot of pressure by the Russians to take these children. Weren't you afraid? (OLHA PILIARKSA speaking in foreign language.) MCKENZIE (voice over): \"It was scary. Very, very scary. So much pressure,\" says Olha Piliarska. \"Twice a day they demanded we show them lists of the kids to take to Russia.\" So Olha and her team came up with an extraordinary deception. They hid orphans in the ICU and they forged medical assessments saying healthy children were severely sick. They even faked an emergency ventilation she says. (OLHA PILIARSKA speaking in foreign language.) MCKENZIE (voice over): \"We understood that the Russians and collaborators would not forgive us,\" she says. \"We knew there would be serious retribution. We understood this,\" but they took the risks and managed to save children. And the critical care nurse took it a step further. Tetiana says she fell in love with one of the orphaned children. She worked desperately to keep the child off the list. MCKENZIE (on camera): How are you? MCKENZIE (voice over): Now she is adopting Kyra (ph). MCKENZIE (on camera): Nice to meet you. MCKENZIE (voice over): We met them at home, a Ukrainian mom with her treasured Ukrainian child. Kyra is almost ready to walk. MCKENZIE (on camera): What does she mean to you? (TETIANA PAVELKO speaking in foreign language.) MCKENZIE (voice over): \"She means everything to me,\" says Tetiana. \"I don't even know to be honest, I can't imagine my life without Kyra.\" This awful war has given her a precious gift.
