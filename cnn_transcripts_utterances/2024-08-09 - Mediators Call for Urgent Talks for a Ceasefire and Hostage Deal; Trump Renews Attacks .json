CNN senior international correspondent Ben Wedeman is in Beirut.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BEN WEDEMAN, CNN SR. INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Lebanon is waiting and waiting and waiting for Hezbollah to strike back at Israel for its assassination last week of the group's top military commander. Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah has vowed revenge is coming. Officials in Washington have warned it's imminent. The fear is that it won't stop there, that Israel will strike back, setting Lebanon and Israel on a slippery downward slope to all-out war. Thursday Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Galant put out a warning on X, formerly Twitter, vowing that Israel will fight back with all its might. Both sides continue to exchange fire along the border, daily clashes that may seem far away to people in cities like here, Beirut. But Tuesday and Wednesday Israeli warplanes broke the sound barrier multiple times over the capital, providing a stark reminder that the calm here is deceptive. Lebanon's health minister Firass Abiad saying the country's south is already at war, but worse could come. DR. FIRASS ABIAD, LEBANESE PUBLIC HEALTH MINISTER (through translator): Currently we are in a state of war, and not potential war. I mean, in southern Lebanon there are attacks on a daily basis. There are martyrs and wounded. From the health sector alone there are more than 22 martyrs. And this is contrary to all international norms, laws and treaties that are supposed to abide by the laws of the United Nations. We are currently in a war, but our fear is the expansion and increase of these attacks.",

But it's calculated. It's calibrated. And so we can say that we responded, but not so much that the Israelis have to then respond with something even greater. That means that we, you know, so that's the game that people are playing right now. And the Israelis and Hezbollah have been playing that game for the last nine or 10 months now. But here's the reality. There's really no such thing. There's no suchthing as having a perfectly calibrated escalation. When you set things into motion, then the law of unintended consequences comes into play. You can't guarantee that you'll shoot precisely that number of missiles into that particular geographical area and that number of people get killed or injured. There's simply no way to so forensically tighten it in that point. So it could be that they plan to only hit, for example, military targets of a particular type. And then, you know, something goes wrong because on the way, maybe a rocket misfires or malfunctions and hits. You know, I personally think that's what happened at shams in the Syrian-occupied Golan Heights where a rocket of some sort killed these 12 children, these 12 Syrian children who are under Israeli occupation. I don't think that Hezbollah meant to kill those kids. I'm sure that they were aiming at a more military target. It doesn't make any sense otherwise. But it's what happened. And I think that we have to be very sort of wide eyed to the fact that unintended consequences in such a deeply tense situation, it can have incredible consequences and ramifications. We've already seen Gaza go through tens of thousands of people killed by the Israelis, the vast majority of whom are civilians. We don't need to see a much wider regional conflict where more and more innocent people die.",

I don't think they do. So I think that they will retaliate. They will engage in a reprisal. But I think that they will try to calibrate it in order to ensure that, you know, that's the end of the matter. My concern is that their calibration will prove not to be precise enough, in which case the Israelis will then respond.

We did not see former President Trump out there doing these freewheeling press conferences. We saw a very disciplined message.And really what you saw today was a reversion to the mean, as I would say. It's sort of what we've come to know and expect from President Trump in the way that he campaigns. And so I think that what you saw was a little bit of a lack of focus. I think you saw a lot of different issues being addressed in the press conference. And this is nothing new for people who followed American politics and Donald Trump. I think the question is, how does something like this play in this totally new environment where he's not going up against Joe Biden? He's going up against Kamala Harris, somebody who brings a different kind of energy to the race. I think that question will play out over these next several weeks.",

I think the Trump campaign's theory of the case right now, the theory about how they win this election is they believe they're going to go out and find a bunch of voters who are much more episodic, do not participate in politics often, and they're going to motivate them. These are people who probably are working class, White voters. These are voters who reliably voted Democrat for many, many years, who probably in 2016 voted for Trump, thought about voting for him, if not voted for him in 2020.And they're counting on this group of people. It's not the MAGA base, to be clear. This is a different group of voters that they believe they can get to and motivate and bring out for this election who probably didn't vote in the midterm elections, would not vote if Donald Trump were not on the ballot. And that's their theory. They need to figure out how to motivate those voters. Now, the reality is those voters may not be enough to get Trump across the finish line against Kamala Harris. They were enough to get him across the finish line against Joe Biden. But this race is different now. So they're going to have to figure out if that theory still holds. And today's press conference probably spoke to those voters.
