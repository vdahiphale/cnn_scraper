Carroll's attorneys arguing an unusually high sum is the only way to deter Trump from continuing to disparage her.Now, we could be getting a decision any minute, as I mentioned, and we have CNN's Kara Scannell who is standing by at the courthouse as she has been throughout this whole process.

      "sentences": "So the jury's been deliberating for about an hour and 20 minutes at this point after hearing closing arguments earlier today and it was E. Jean Carroll's team that went first. They told the jury that the only way to stop Donald Trump from defaming E. Jean Carroll was to make him pay a significant amount of money. They said they are looking for at least $24 million for emotional harm and the money it would cost to repair her reputation and a very large amount of money in punitive damages to punish Trump from making these statements again and again.And it was during the closing arguments when E. Jean Carroll's attorney said that Trump, even last year, after the jury found him liable for defamation, 24 hours later, he was on CNN in a town hall repeating the defamatory statements. They said nothing will stop him from disregarding the jury's verdict. It was at that moment that Trump stood up, walked out of the courtroom with the Secret Service trailing him, and he didn't return until his lawyers were on the - were giving their closing arguments. It was during that closing argument that his lawyers said that he couldn't be held responsible for mean tweets that E. Jean Carroll received or even the death threats that she said she'd received because he was not responsible for the people who sent them. They also suggested that E. Jean Carroll had brought this upon herself, saying that she was a public person by going public with accusations against the president at the time that she was going to invite some scrutiny. Of course, Carroll's lawyers say that the reason why E. Jean Carroll sued Donald Trump is that so many of the messages that they got were parroting Trump's own words. And they said that E. Jean Carroll is the victim in this case. It's not Donald Trump. So the jury is deliberating. I'm just checking to see if we have any update from the courtroom, nothing yet. So it's been about an hour and 20 minutes. The judge telling them that they will go to 4:30 today if there's no verdict, then they'll return on Monday. Brianna?",

They're talking about him not being accountable. And they're talking about this jury holding him accountable, a person who just doesn't care, a person who will just continue to say things and do things that a jury already has found you being responsible.Remember also, Brianna, that his attorney was admonished, that as judge was like, no, we're not doing that, playing a clip of Mr. Trump talking about a witch hunt, et cetera, trying to propagate the narrative in closing that this just didn't happen. That has been determined. It's been decided. It was decided by a former jury last year that there was defamation involved in what Mr. Trump said. It was determined that sexual assault happened. So you're not going to and cannot deny that and so that's out of bounds. And so to repeat something again and again and again is troubling without question and it could certainly be used by that jury to award something large in the way of punitive and economic damage.",

Donald Trump has swept both states and President Joe Biden won New Hampshire as a write-in candidate despite not even being on the state's ballot. But polls also show that voters are not overly fond of the leading two candidates squaring off again, raising questions about whether a third-party candidate has a potential path toward the White House.One name being thrown around in speculation for a third-party run is West Virginia senator, Joe Manchin, who joins now. We should note, he is a Democrat. Senator, thank you so much for being with us. You decided against running for reelection this year. I'm wondering that ultimate question of whether you want to run for the White House, do you want to announce a run right here on CNN? SEN. JOE MANCHIN (D-WV): Well, Boris, first of all, thanks for having me on such a short notice and I appreciate it. And we're going around the country listening and talking to people. We were in South Carolina last night. We're in Georgia today. I'll be at Georgia State here in a few minutes. But it's interesting to find out what we're hearing on the road and it truly is as people aren't as divided as Congress and Washington wants us to believe we are. And the politics is basically being weaponized and we see what's going on. So people are looking for, is there going to be a challenge? Is there going to be any other options? We're just trying to tell people there's options out there, especially how you're able to get more people involved. So we put together what we call Americans Together, which is a movement that's showing people how they can change from what you see today in the discourse we have in Washington. It won't be changed in Washington. It'll be changed in South Carolina or Georgia or West Virginia. People have to get involved and demand better representation and they don't like what they're seeing now, and everything's politicized.",

Right now, all polls are indicating that they do. Is there a possibility that something can happen, that that could change and is there an opportunity for a third party up the middle? Well, I can tell you, 45- to 55 percent of Americans consider being center left and center right, not being extreme left or extreme right. They want common sense. They operate their lives that way. They make decisions for their family and their businesses every day in that boundary. And now, all of a sudden, can't we run our politics? Why did it get so toxic? Why did they weaponize it?

Again, he's demanding them now that news of this alleged improper relationship surfaced, but again, he's being met with resistance from District Attorney Willis, who has rebuffed his demands, and this is what she's saying in part of her response: \"Your request implicates significant, well-recognized confidentiality interests related to an ongoing criminal matter. Your request violate principles of separation of powers and federalism, as well as respect for the legal protections provided to an attorney work product in ongoing litigation.\" Ever since these alleged romance rumors really surfaced, Willis has been facing criticism from her critics, her foes. Now allies are asking her to step down. She's yet to directly respond to these allegations, but she has defended her selection of Nathan Wade, saying he's qualified, uniquely qualified to do this. Meanwhile, she is facing a deadline to respond in writing to these claims by next Friday, and of course, we've been reporting on these subpoenas of people who potentially have firsthand knowledge of this alleged romance.
