And he talked about economic force or potentially trying to annex Canada. Trump veered into other topics as well, including President Biden's new ban on offshore oil and gas leases. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT-ELECT OF THE UNITED STATES: The 625 million acres -- people can't realize. It's like the whole ocean. You have an acre, you have a big deal. Now you multiply that by 625 million acres. It's like -- feels like the whole ocean. It's called rain comes down from -- comes down from heaven. And they want to do no -- no water comes out of the shower. It goes drip, drip, drip. We're going to be changing the name of the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America, which has a beautiful ring. The windmills are driving the whales crazy. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Also with us is Nomiki Konst, a former surrogate for Senator Bernie Sanders.T.W., I want to start with you on what Trump said about not ruling out military force to try to take over the Panama Canal and Greenland. What do you think? Bluster, negotiating tactic, a real threat? What's your view? T.W. ARRIGHI, VICE PRESIDENT, PUSH DIGITAL GROUP &amp; FORMER AIDE TO SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM AND MIKE POMPEO: I think it could be a negotiation tactic. I don't know. I haven't spoken to the president about it. But I want people to realize that the Greenland conversation and Panama is actually just good statecraft. Could you imagine our posture toward Russia, our defense posture, if we didn't have Alaska or with China, if we didn't have Guam? Well, when we were going to acquire both those areas, you heard a lot of the same arguments you're hearing now about Greenland and -- and Panama. But I want to just say there are more people who live in Casper, Wyoming, than Greenland, which is our least populous state. And the fact of the matter is, China and Russia are licking their chops about making a move against Greenland because the Arctic is so vital for future trade routes, minerals, military. It is very much in our national interest to buy it from Denmark because they do not have the resources to keep China and Russia at bay in the Arctic.",

I know in the context of the Arctic, which is going to be one of the major hot spots in the future, I do actually believe Russia is bold enough to make a move at Greenland.As the Arctic ice shifts, you will see trade routes open up. Mineral deposits are massive there. And Denmark is not in a position to defend adequately against it. It's in our national interest to take control of it.",

If the U.S. is paying what it is paying, you know, he should be putting the screws -- tightening the screws on these other NATO countries to pay more as well. What do you say to that?",

European countries met just recently to discuss this because they are afraid that Donald Trump will completely pull out of NATO.So his negotiation tactic is not actually in the interest of Western peace and global stability right now. Ut's in the interest, frankly, of Russia and China. And, you know, European countries mostly know that they're so close to Russia. And they feel the repercussions right now. So they're doing what's in their best interest in investing more money. But the reality is, is that our national security depends on NATO as well.

He talked about oil exploration to bring fuel costs down, which will lower prices across the country. Those are all economic messages. And I want to make one more point about Panama because it didn't come up. I don't think we appreciate enough that China has a chokehold on the most important shipping route on the planet. That is so insanely important for us. And if we believe the Panamanians can handle it. All right. I would like to see the evidence of that. I think it is in our interest. And Teddy Roosevelt did a tremendous thing building one of the wonders of the world. It's a tremendous American accomplishment, and we ought to take some ownership of that. And I don't see -- and by the way, that also bleeds into our economy. If China starts screwing around with the Panama Canal, expect prices to skyrocket and our economy to crater.",
