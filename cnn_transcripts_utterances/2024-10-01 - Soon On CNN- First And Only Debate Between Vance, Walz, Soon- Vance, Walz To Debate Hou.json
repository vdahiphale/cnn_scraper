Many of the missiles apparently intercepted by Israel, some by the United States. US officials are monitoring this tense and dangerous conflict.The vice presidential nominees likely have already been briefed on this as well, as they head into their first and only debate. We're soon going to see how Ohio Republican Senator JD Vance and Minnesota Democratic Governor Tim Walz would address the situation in the Middle East and other urgent issues as they make the case for themselves and for their running mates, Donald Trump and Kamala Harris. This is currently the last agreed to debate of the 2024 presidential campaign, adding to the anticipation tonight with only with election day only five weeks away -- five weeks away today, we're going to get some updates from the Middle East where our correspondents are standing by with new information. And also, here in New York, our anchors, correspondents, and analysts are counting down to this debate, which you're going to see live on CNN less than an hour from now -- Anderson.",

What more are you hearing about from the Walz camp about the governor's strategy tonight?M.J. LEE, CNN SENIOR WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Well, Anderson, you know, you'll often hear Harris campaign officials saying that JD Vance and Donald Trump have a casual relationship with the truth, that their statements are sometimes unfounded in reality or facts. And I am told by sources that preparing for potentially false assertions made by Vance on the debate stage tonight has been a significant part of Walz's debate preparations. Now, sources will acknowledge that this is not an easy task. There's certainly no clear playbook on how to navigate this. You know, on the one hand, they feel like some real time fact checking can be really important. But on the other hand, there is a bit of weariness to the governor using his precious time on the debate stage to give unintentionally more oxygen to unfounded claims. And the bottom line, Anderson, is that Democrats have no idea going into tonight what might end up taking on a life of its own, sort of like Trump's claim after the last debate, that there were Haitian migrants in Ohio eating people's pets, that obviously ended up becoming a story line of its own, and they simply can't predict what that version of tonight might end up being -- Anderson.",

They were trying to prepare JD Vance to deal with that. One of the ways that they did this was by having Tom Emmer, the House Majority Whip who played Tim Walz, who's known him for ten years, study his mannerisms and use them effectively against JD Vance during these mock debates to try and disarm him. [20:05:13] But I was told by a source earlier today, they believe Vance is \"unflappable\". Now, as for the former president, I do just want to quickly note that he is getting on his plane shortly to go to Texas.

But when they're on this stage tonight, expect this to last about 90 minutes. Two commercial breaks that are expected to happen there won't be any cheering from the audience because there will be no audience in the room just like in the last two presidential debates, there is not going to be anyone in there watching except for the moderators and a few reporters. Their microphones will not be muted, Anderson, but the producers do have the right to shut them off if there's too much overlap in the talking to where you can't actually hear what one of the candidates is saying during this debate. The other thing you'll notice is neither one of them is going to bring anything on stage with them. No props are allowed, no pre-written notes from either of them on that stage. So, they will have a pad and some paper and a pen to write in case they take notes during that debate. But as this gets started, they're going to get straight to the questions, Anderson. There's no opening statements that are expected to happen, but you will see closing statements and because Senator Vance won a virtual coin toss that CBS News had the other day, he has elected to deliver his closing statement last. So, you'll see that back and forth, a very typical debate format where they each have two minutes to answer the question about a minute to respond. We'll see if that actually sticks. of course, often it gets lost in the shuffle of the actual debate but that is what everyone is going to be watching when the two of these candidates get on stage. They are pretty experienced debaters actually, even though they've never had certainly this level of scrutiny for any of their debates. And, Anderson, I will note, I am in what is known as the spin room. This is where surrogates come after a debate happens to spin their so- called and respective candidates performance. I will tell you, it's more like a store spin closet. It's very snug in here. So, once all of these surrogates are in here, because about each half, five on each side, they'll be in here. One interesting thing to note, Anderson, Senator JD Vance himself will be here in the spin room after that debate tonight. So, well hear from him how he thinks he did -- Anderson.",

Welch was the lawyer you'll remember who embarrassed Joseph McCarthy in the 50s. And it really started McCarthy's descent and he said to McCarthy at long last, sir, have you no decency?

I think he'd actually be much better off to litigate the substance of like the Haitian migrants eating pets, talking about how that's damaging to a community that's there legally talking about the actual issues and kind of elevating it. That's much better for this format. But I'm thinking about the fact that Donald Trump is going to be live Truth Socialing this, and watching it in real time. JD Vance knows he has an audience of one. And so the question is, is he going to play to the general election voters that they actually need to bring over, which means probably not making Donald Trump the happiest on Truth Social or play to the Truth Social viewer watching him.",

This is not acceptable behavior on the part of anybody in our American life. And I'm very glad that you have someone like Coach Walz who has stood up for underdogs, who stood up for gay kids.

That's because so far, Donald Trump has said he is not going to debate Vice President Harris one more time, even though she has accepted CNN's debate for an invitation, I should note, for a next debate that is going to happen and what happened just days away from the 2024 election. But Anderson, behind the scenes, some of Trump's allies have been privately urging him to take her on one more time. They believe he would benefit from a second debate, looking at what happened in 2020 when they thought he did not have a good debate against then candidate, former Vice President Joe Biden, but then performed, they believed much better in the second debate. They are hoping that could happen this time around. And one thing that they are watching for tonight is as Donald Trump is watching Vance on stage against walls, if that is a way that convinces Trump to actually decide to take Harris on one more time. It's a bit of a pressure campaign that's happening behind the scenes. But, of course, whether or not Donald Trump actually does debate her one more time is ultimately up to Donald Trump. Anderson?",

John King is at the magic wall mapping out the race to 270. John, what does it look like? Go ahead.JOHN KING, CNN ANCHOR &amp; CHIEF NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: So, Anderson, the big question, do the vice presidential candidates move the needle in what is a remarkably competitive race for 270 electoral votes? Mark me down as skeptical, but this is an unprecedented campaign, so we shall see. Where are we in the state of the race right now real quickly before I go through the states? National poll of polls. No clear leader. Maybe a slight advantages for Kamala Harris, but that's a national poll. We pick presidents state by state. So we have essentially a dead heat. So then you look at some of these battleground states and you get the same picture. We'll pop these up. In Wisconsin, no clear leader, very close. In Michigan, the same. In Pennsylvania, in North Carolina, in Georgia. Again, we don't have enough polls to average out in the other Sun Belt states, Nevada and Arizona, but we know from individual polls it is as close as it gets. So, can the vice presidential candidates make a difference? One potential theory, you have a senator from Ohio and a governor from Minnesota, the three blue wall states, the industrial, some call them rust belt states, are up for grabs. They are from the neighborhood. Let's watch how they talk about manufacturing and how they talk about jobs. Now, how do the candidates get from where they are right now very competitively to 270? These states are absolutely critical for everybody. It's Kamala Harris's quickest path to 270. She's at 225 right now. One, two, three and you win Nebraska's second congressional district, and you're done for the Democrats, right? But, but Harris can get there, unlike Trump, Harris can get there without any of the blue wall states. Trump needs to win one of those states unless he somehow flips in Illinois, or flips in New York, and that's unlikely to happen. Because if Harris won North Carolina, not saying this is easy, Georgia, Arizona, and Nevada, she gets there without the blue wall states. And so, as we watch the race tonight, there are a hundred different ways you could go through these scenarios. I would just argue, Pennsylvania remains by far the biggest prize. That's why they're spending the most money there. It's 19 electoral votes. If you win that, the candidate who wins Pennsylvania gets 19. Makes that path to 270 so much easier. But again, Harris would love to just sweep right here. Then she's on the verge of the presidency. The Sun Belt states are in play. Will the vice presidential candidates move the dial? Not so sure about that, but we do know this. Number one, there's a pressing global issue that's going to come up a lot tonight. But when you travel in these states and these states, the number one issue in all of them, cost of living.",
