Also, the high level talks come after Russia launched its biggest attack in weeks striking the capital of Ukraine, Ukraine carrying out new strikes too in Crimea and history in the making in Paris. King Charles becoming the first ever British monarch to address the French Senate, the King saying Britain and France damn with Ukraine and that cube will prevail. The Ukrainian military claims it has carried out a major attack on a Russian airbase in Crimea. Russia has sent dozens of missiles across Ukraine overnight.

The Ukrainian General Staff was saying that of the 43 cruise missiles that were launched their air defense forces man to take out 36 of those cruise missiles. But of course, some of those cruise missiles did manage to come to from what we're hearing from the Ukrainians.

That's according to White House officials who say President Biden wants to hear more about what specific needs Zelenskyy will need as this counter offensive wages on.But it does come at a time as you heard Lauren point out there, where there has been very real skepticism up on Capitol Hill specifically with Republicans about whether the U.S. should be providing more aid to Ukraine. Now, in the President's view, this aid is critical. That is why he's asked for that $24 billion from Congress. But it's unclear whether that actually has the ability to get across the finish line. Now, while Zelenskyy is here in Washington, the White House is also expected to announce a new round of military assistance, which will include artillery, anti-armor, anti-aircraft and air defense capabilities. But one thing that is not expected to be part of this package are those attack at arms, those long ranged army tactical missile systems that Ukraine has adamantly pushed for quite some time Ukrainian President Zelenskyy telling our colleague Wolf Blitzer, he would be disappointed if this type of machinery would not make its way into Ukraine's hands. Now, the White House has not ruled out the possibility of giving the attack comes to Ukraine at some point. And they've noted that there have been times in the past where they have really changed and revolutionize what kind of equipment they are providing to Ukraine. So it's not ruled out down the road. But for the time being, it does not appear it's going to be part of this package. Now, while Zelenskyy enjoys incredible support from President Biden and his administration. He is coming to Washington in a different political environment when he was here just nine months ago, at the White House and up on Capitol Hill. Democrats were in control of the House, there was a broader support for aid to Ukraine. But now there is some resistance that has been bubbling up and emerging that's very real within the Republican caucus, specifically in the house, even though there is bipartisan support for Ukraine aid up in the Senate. So, one of the challenges for Zelenskyy and for Biden today is going to be continuing to make that case, as the White House has tried to ensure that there will be support for Ukraine in the long haul.",

And I don't think Boris Johnson helped with that sort of personal relationship either. Certainly was not President Macron. And so this was a reminder that there were historic ties, Britain has always stood by France, in the past, in the war, for example, all these reminders really came through for many of the politicians there.

Now, the other development, of course, like you mentioned, is that Canada will be downsizing its diplomatic presence in India. And they did issue a statement a couple of hours back. I'm going to read from that statement. They said, with some diplomats having received threats in various social media platforms, Global Affairs, Canada is assessing its staff complement in India. As a result, and out of an abundance of caution, we have decided to temporarily adjust staff presence in India. That's a huge step that they are taking and responding to that in that media briefing today, the spokesperson did confirm that they had put a request to Canada to do this, because their numbers according to the spokesperson, in terms of the presence of diplomats in India is much larger than the presence of Indian diplomats in Canada. Also, the spokesperson then went on to say there should be parity in rank. Now, it's just intensifying the tensions between the two countries and this is essentially over the Khalistan movement, a movement by six separators for a separate homeland in the state of Punjab here in India. And India has always gone to Canada requesting for them to take action against what they call anti-India elements and extremists in Canada in their claims.

He first dipped his toes into the newspaper business in the 1950s.And it's obviously bought up a load of companies and become such a big voice in the media, news and entertainment business. In the statement that we have from Rupert Murdoch, he says he's just decided to transition to the role of Chairman Emiratis at Fox and News. As he said, his son Lachlan will also now be taking the role in his place, which wasn't always clear. I mean, the succession story of Rupert Murdoch is clearly one so interesting, that spawned a certain idea for a rather good TV series of irises, and this is a very interesting move. Lachlan Murdoch was always really perhaps considered to be the golden child, the most likely heir apparent. But there weren't, there were some sort of rocky phases during that, I remember him quitting a job at News Corp in 2005. And people question whether that was it. Now I'm going to take you through some of the statement that we've got here. Rupert Murdoch says our companies are in robust health, as am I. Our opportunities far exceed our commercial challenges. We have every reason to be optimistic about the coming years, I certainly am, and plan to be here to participate in them. I have a big question about what this will mean for votes on the board.

But the reality is, Lynda, I mean, you're an Australian, you've had Murdoch around in your life, all your life, my entire professional life of some 40 odd years. Rupert Murdoch has been a presence, right the way back to when I was a trainee, in the mid-1980s. When he closed whopping, I thought he closed Fleet Street and opened whopping to print his London newspapers. And then you push forward through to the phone hacking standoff, where he overnight flows, one of his most profitable titles to News of the World. And then he gives evidence, he gets a pie in the face. He was ahead of the game, Lynda, when he decided to merge companies, and then split them again. He was constantly looking, you know, between the higher profile, higher performing companies like Fox, and the movies. But his heart was always in News Corp. The print, the touch of the paper, and certain to say that he's stepping down is, I think, a misnomer to say he's stepping away, I think is an error.

Ford announcing that they've had to lay off six or 600 people, Stellantis just yesterday saying that 68 people are immediately laid off with possibly 300 plus coming and General Motors confirming yesterday that 2000 people are now on layoff.

And it all concerns of course, this tiny, ethnically Armenian enclave, home to some 120,000 estimated people.But a huge difference here now and that is during the ceasefire yesterday, the separatists, the Armenian separatists of Nagorno- Karabakh agreed to disarm, agree to lay down their arms that brings Azerbaijan ever closer to its goal of integrating this enclave. Of course, this area is internationally recognized as part of Azerbaijan. Why these changes? Why finally are the separatists agreeing to lay down arms agreeing to hand over weapons potentially to Azerbaijan? Well, that is because their supporters, if you will, are wavering Armenia, which is seen of course as the major backer of the ethnic minority, they're the ethnic Armenians. There has taken hands off approach saying it is not involved in these mediations. It does recognize Nagorno-Karabakh as part of Azerbaijan that set off demonstrations Wednesday by many who felt that their government was failing the ethnic Armenians of Azerbaijan. Russia, as well, which is a mediator has been a mediator in these talks and was able to negotiate that ceasefire on Wednesday. Russia has been seen as the security guarantor for Armenia and those Armenians. It also has been pulling away taking a hands off approach as it gets more involved in the Ukraine conflict. But all of that means that the ethnic Armenians again living in that enclave feel very much alone. They face the military offensive by Azerbaijan this week that reportedly killed dozens, including civilians and children. They faced a month along the blockade, one that they say that the Armenian separatists say has resulted in humanitarian concerns in that enclave. So going forward with these talks and the statement from all warring sides is that talks will continue without a scheduled date is what does disarmament look like? And what does it mean to integrate the tens of thousands of Armenians in that enclave? They will be concerned of course about equal rights, about humanitarian, access about being given what they feel like is their place in Azerbaijan.",

I probably would have declined and that's only because of family, things that were going on this past year.And had I known that I would have had to miss those very important events. I just would have had to say thank you, but no, thank you. But once you commit to the mission, once you're a part of the training, I would have been committed to the mission. FISHER (voice-over): By the time Rubio returns to Earth next week, he will have been in space for 371 days longer than any other American in history.
