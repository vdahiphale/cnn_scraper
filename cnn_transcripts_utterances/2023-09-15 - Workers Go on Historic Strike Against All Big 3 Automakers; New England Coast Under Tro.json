The companies failed to strike a deal with the United Auto Workers Union by midnight. And right now, nearly 13,000 workers have walked off the job at three different plants in Michigan, Ohio and Missouri. The union's president, Shawn Fain, says even more workers and plants across the nation will join the strike if their demands for higher wages, benefits are not met, since workers aren't getting their fair share of record profits while CEOs have been getting huge raises.

Bob, I appreciate your time. I want to start with kind of the components of the negotiations themselves, because we're talking about the politics or what it might mean for the macro economy. But in terms of what the UAE does, you put on the table, you talk about the 40 percent raises over 40 years, restore costs of living, pension, retiree health coverage provisions, four-day workweek, limits of part-time workers, enforced overtime. Obviously, the electric vehicles and that transition has been critical. Of those elements, what is most problematic for the automaker CEOs at this point?",

      "sentences": "No. Well, Phil, thank you for having me on this morning. And I agree with everything that you and Poppy (INAUDIBLE). This is very, very unfortunate that it has reached this position. And, again, I think, how did we get here?And then I'll answer your question is because household income has not been able to keep up with inflation. And inflation is a result of many of the administrative policies that are out there today. Energy is up 40 percent. That happened day one when they surrendered energy independence. So, if you look at this from a very pragmatic standpoint, household income has to keep up with inflation. They're just trying to make an earning to be able to provide for their families. So, I give them that point. Some of the other demands are really overreaching. It's possible to go back and put back in place the pension program that was negotiated back in '07, '08 and '09. And I can tell you that Bill Ford worked tirelessly to save Ford back then. We're all going through the financial meltdown. This is not a case where Ford says, I just want to take care of our workers. Ford lost $6 billion in the last two years with, again, another administrative policy to convert to electric vehicles. This took a $9.2 billion grant to be able to build a battery plant in Michigan. So, that's proved positive with their commitment to their UAW workers. So, I think some of these demands, 40 hours' pay for 32 hours' work, I understand you've got to put it all on the table and then come together. But this has been a very polarizing negotiation, and, again, historic when all three go out. The UAW has spent hours tactically deciding how to go on strike. I'm not sure they spent the same amount of time figuring out how to get back to work, Phil. MATTINGLY:  So, to that point, you have pointed out over the course of the last several weeks, your close relationship with Shawn Fain's -- the individual who was Shawn Fain at the time during the Great Recession, Ron Gettelfinger was a critical piece of why you guys were able to save the auto industry. But I guess my question, I think this gets to what you were just saying. This is what Shawn Fain ran on to be the UAW chief. And in large part, his kind of ability to get to this point derives from what happened in 2008 and 2009 and how workers feel about what's transpired since. So, why is anybody surprised by his position here?",

You came up through the top tiers of the business world. You understand leverage and the point here that Fain and his people are utilizing to get here. They're saying, they're doing that knowing all of that because they want leverage in these negotiations.",

You look at American Airlines, you look at the dock workers on the West Coast. UAW is just saying, hey, it's my turn, I'm standing in line. And all these other companies have been able to get wage increases for a standard of living for their family.And so I don't deny the importance of that. But, again, we have to have sound mind coming together. I mean, we could both stay polarized here and basically shut down Ford, shut down Chrysler, I like to call them Chrysler, and General Motors. That's going to have a tremendous impact on already a very fragile economy. That's my concern on the bigger picture, Phil.",

So, even though the center is expected to stay offshore of the coast of Southeastern New England, those tropical storm force winds are going to move into places like Cape Cod, Martha's Vineyard, Nantucket, as we get later today into tonight and then spread northward along the coast of New England and up into Atlantic Canada overnight tonight and early Saturday.",

That's inundation of ocean water moving in over normally dry land all the way from Long Island Sound all the way across the coast of New England up into Maine. So, that could cause some, you know, certainly coastal flooding, road closures and some inconvenience and some potential threat to life in some of these areas where the flooding might occur at the time of high tide and those waters will be a little higher.",

It asks, are you an addict? He checked, no. He was. Those are false statements. There will be, and Hunter Biden's lawyer has said this, a constitutional challenge to that statute, to that law as a whole. Now, the Supreme Court has been very broad on the Second Amendment, and certain groups, largely conservatives, have actually been challenging that specific law. They argue it's unconstitutional. It's too vague. And, in fact, one court of appeals, the Fifth Circuit, just last month said this law is unconstitutional. Now, that's not necessarily binding in Delaware, which is in a different circuit right now, but it could be headed up to the Supreme Court.

That's a good amount of money. I think it's very likely that Hunter Biden does see tax charges sometime soon. As to what happens next, Hunter Biden can go to trial, of course. That may well land during the 2024 election. It could be that Donald Trump is on trial simultaneously at a different courtroom, or he can try to enter into a plea deal. His lawyers are trying to revive the old plea deal. They're basically saying, that's still binding. DOJ says, oh, no, it's not.

But if he says he's going to -- willing to testify under oath that he never gave that order to delete the footage, there's only one way to do that. You've got to take the stand. There's no other venue or forum for him to do that.And taking the stand in any defendant's own defense is rare and very risky. And here, I think it would be completely self-destructive. I know Donald Trump has been saying he wants to testify. I assure you his lawyers are telling him, please do not do that. We advise you not to do that. It would be extraordinarily dangerous for you to take the stand and try to testify in your own defense. And, by the way, no defendant has to do that. No defendant has to prove anything. All they have to do is show the government failed to prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt.",

And it's something that is clearly a big moment for not just the economic scene, not just what's going on in Michigan with these striking workers and around the country, but also with politics as well. It's something the White House has been closely watching over the course of the last several months and certainly been honed in on in the last several weeks.I want to go straight to CNN's Arlette Saenz, who's live at the White House. Arlette, the administration has found their way out of so many of these types of moments with other industries, with other unions over the course of the last 2.5 years. What are they saying right now?",
