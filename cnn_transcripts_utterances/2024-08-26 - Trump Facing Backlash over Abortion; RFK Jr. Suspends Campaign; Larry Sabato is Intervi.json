The 2020 Election that Almost Broke America.\"Larry, wonderful to have you. Thank you very much for being here. Let's talk about North Carolina, why you decided to move it here. And how much do you think that has to do with the governor's race, where Republicans have a candidate who candidly has said a lot of things that are out of step with more moderate voters, certainly with even many conservative Republicans. A lot of things that people say are just downright offensive. LARRY SABATO, EDITOR, \"A RETURN TO NORMALCY?: THE 2020 ELECTION THAT ALMOST BROKE AMERICA\": Yes, the Republican nominee, Mark Robinson, is pretty much at war with the spirit of the age. But he fits Republicans in North Carolina and, frankly, many other states quite well. The problem is, North Carolina is a very divided state. It's closely divided. It has leaned Republican and voted Republican fairly consistently. 2008 for Obama being the major exception. And governors. They'll elect Democratic governors. But this particular Republican candidate has said so many outrageous things. And I don't want to get into the specifics. That will take the rest of your time. But it has alienated not just Democrats and independents, but also a slice of the Republicans. As a result, you actually have a situation that we often call reverse coattails. We think of coattails as coming from the top down, that a president can provide - presidential candidate can provide an extra point or two for the members of his party on the ticket below the presidential race. Well, occasionally, a lower level race becomes so hot, so controversial that it results in lower turnout for one party, higher turnout for the other, and it has a kind of reverse coattails effect. It can reduce the support for a presidential candidate of the party of the very controversial gubernatorial nominee. That may or may not happen here, but it - the elements are sure in place for it to happen.",

In a statement this morning, Brian Fallon, with Kamala Harris, tells me this. Quote, \"we have told ABC and other networks seeking to host a possible October debate that we believe both candidates microphones should be live throughout the full broadcast. Our understanding is that Trump's handlers prefer the muted microphone because they don't think their candidate can act presidential for 90 minutes on his own.
