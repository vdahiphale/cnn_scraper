Plus, breaking news this hour, Israel has amassed enough troops to launch a full-scale invasion into Rafah. This despite President Biden telling OUTFRONT that Israel will not get more offensive weapons from the United States if it does that. And the mystery is deepening over the little governor who suddenly flying on Trump's private jet, showing up at rallies and fundraisers. Is he going to be Trump's VP? Let's go OUTFRONT. And good evening. I'm Erin Burnett. OUTFRONT tonight, it's make-or-break in the Donald Trump hush money trial. This is what it comes down to the crucial testimony of Trump's former fixer, Michael Cohen, who finally took the stand today, sitting just 15 feet way from the man that he once said he'd take a bullet for, and the man for whom he actually went to prison for. Donald J. Trump, who Cohen without emotion now, refers to as Mr. Trump. Now the importance of Cohen's testimony and all of this cannot be overstated. This is what the case is all about. He is the only person who can testify about what is at the heart of the case, and that is Trump's direct involvement in the alleged conspiracy to falsify the business records in order to pay Stormy Daniels, not whether the affair happened, none of that falsifying, the business records. Now the testimony was intense today, Cohen rarely looked in the direction of Trump. He said the former president instructed him to pay Daniels $130,000, quote, just do it. He recalled Trump saying. And just before Cohen went to the bank on October 26, he testified that he called Trump again he said, quote, I wanted to ensure that once again, he approved what I was doing because I require approval from him on all of this. Everything required, Mr. Trump sign-off. On top of that, I wanted the money back and they pointed to crucial documents showing the call log saying that Trump and Cohen spoke twice on that day before that LLC was set up. Trump for the most part, leaned back as Cohen spoke his eyes were closed and now familiar stance by the former president. And I spoke to Cohen about this case many times here on this show. Back in February, he was adamant that his testimony when he took the stand and he has been ready to do so for a long time now, would help convict Trump. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Cohen said he enjoyed working for Trump and whenever he receiveddirect praise or completing a task, he felt like he was on top of the world. Cohen told the court that when Trump was mulling are run for the presidency in 2015, Trump warn Cohen, you know that when this comes out, meaning the announcement, just be prepared, that is going to be a lot of women coming forward. Cohen claimed that just weeks before the 2016 election, the editor of the \"National Enquirer\" told Cohen, Stormy Daniels wanted to sell her story about having an affair with Trump, which Cohen said would have been catastrophic and horrible for Trump's campaign. Cohen said Trump got angry with him when they spoke about the Stormy Daniels story. I told him that one of the things that we need to do is obviously take care of it. Trump allegedly responded absolutely. Do it. Take care of it. Cohen testified that it was his idea to include a punitive damages clause in the Daniels deal to ensure that she didn't speak. Cohen said Trump told him to drag the Daniels payment out as long as possible, in fact preferably until after the election because if I win, it will have no relevance because I'm president. And if I lose, I don't even care. And he added this damning allegation, he wasn't thinking about Melania. This was all about the campaign. Cohen walked the court through the process of creating several LLCs in order to transfer payment to Daniels, Cohen had to front the money himself and used a home equity line of credit because it was paperless. So he could hide it from his wife. I was doing everything I could and more to protect my boss, which is something that I had done and for a long time. Cohen testified that on October 28, he immediately called Trump after Daniel sign the agreement, telling him that this matter is now completely under control and locked down. Cohen said in early 2017, he tried to get repaid for the money he fronted to Daniels and needed Trump Organization CFO Allen Weisselberg's input for questions about taxes. Cohen said he would be reimbursed over the course of the next 12 months, disguising the payment as like a legal service rendered since I was then going to be given the title of personal attorney to the president.",

Now, I don't have to tell you. It would be hugely significant if Israel did actually move forward with such a military operation precisely because of what President Biden told you in the interview last week, he made very clear that the U.S. would stop sending offensive weapons to Israel if they were to take that step. And all of this would of course be in direct defiance of what the president has repeatedly warned Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to not do in the past several months. Now, in just a sign of how problematic this would be in the eyes of the Biden White House, one senior official telling me that Israel has made nowhere near the preparations that it would need to when it comes to food, shelter, and even a hygiene in preparation for needing to move and evacuate eventually more than 1 million people that are currently in Rafah. What's also interesting is that we are seeing U.S. officials increasingly questioning the way that Israel is taking an approach to the end of this war. Kurt Campbell, who is a number two at the State Department, told Kylie earlier today that Israeli leaders often talk about the idea of a sweeping victory on the battlefield and about this idea of total victory. But what he said to Kylie was, I don't think we believe that is likely or possible. So that's certainly a sobering assessment from a top us official as the Israelis continue to warn that they are going to move ahead with such an operation into Rafah, Erin.

MJ Lee, thank you very much with that crucial breaking news from the White House.I want to go OUTFRONT now to Democratic Congressman Adam Smith of Washington, the top Democrat on the Armed Services Committee. So, Congressman, I appreciate your time, sobering development tonight with MJ's reporting. Israel's amassed enough troops to launch a full- scale invasion of Rafah. Of course, President Biden has made it very clear. He made it very clear in that interview last week when I asked him that that was not okay. It was wrong and that he would withhold offensive weapons if Israel moved ahead with that kind of an operation into the population center of Rafah. So is there any turning back for Israel now? REP. ADAM SMITH (D-WA): Well, certainly there is. I mean, they have not gone into Rafah in that way and so they would have to make a decision to go in. So, clearly, there is turning back and look, Prime Minister Netanyahu was put Israel, the U.S., and the entire Middle East and a very difficult place. We do not want to withdrawal support from Israel, least, at least I don't, the president doesn't. We saw that when Iran attacked Israel a few weeks ago, if we are not able to help Israel defend itself, this war could spread as Iran and Hezbollah decide to jump into that void. But at the same time, Prime Minister Netanyahu is pursuing a strategy that is not in the best interests of Israel and not in the best interests of peace. He has no plan for a post-Hamas-Gaza. So, the president has been trying every lever we have to change that. But we don't really have the power to just force them to do something differently. And as I said, completely abandoning them comes with on high amount of risk for peace in the region as well. That's what President Biden is trying to navigate.",

My question to you is congressman, from your perspective, the information you have on armed services, can Israel go it alone even if it's using stockpiled U.S. weapons? But can they do it?

Well, I mean, its a real as I said, its a real problem. What Prime Minister Netanyahu is doing, not looking to a future where there is some kind of peace in Gaza. There has to be a future for the Palestinian people on his approach has been, you know, undermining that, at every turn. There are people who could come and govern Gaza, Palestinians. The Saudis are working with them. King Abdullah in Jordan is working with them. Egypt, UAE, others are trying to build that group.
