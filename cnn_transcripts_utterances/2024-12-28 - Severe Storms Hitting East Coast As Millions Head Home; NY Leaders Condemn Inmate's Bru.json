These are the reports already that we've had over the last 48 hours, 14 tornado reports, and as we go through the day you can see the area at risk is pretty similar. Some of the same areas could get beat up again. Here's a look though.This is a moderate level four out of five severe risk. We're not just talking about a couple of tornadoes, we're talking about a couple of strong tornadoes, violent tornadoes possible from Alexandria, Louisiana over towards Jackson, Mississippi even stretching into parts of Alabama. Even in the orange area, that stretches towards Birmingham. We could be looking at some strong tornadoes. These types of tornadoes you need to really seek shelter in basements or storm shelters It could really be pretty damaging. So, that risk again continues today into the night tonight. Then, it starts to shift to the East Coast tomorrow, Charlotte and Atlanta, with that severe risk. Now, it's not as intense, but we'll still drag damaging winds across the East Coast. We're already starting with a severe thunderstorm watch this morning for Dallas. As we go through the afternoon, these storms blow up in intensity. We're talking about supercells capable of tornadoes. And you have a line of these damaging winds that blow through parts of Mississippi and Alabama overnight. Make sure your phones are set on loud.

Peskov said, \"Russia will provide comprehensive support to both Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan in investigating the circumstances and causes of the plane crash. This readiness of Russia has been declared, and we are waiting for the results of the investigation.\" Of course, it is inappropriate for the presidential administration to say anything about this.

There is this, you know, Delta and the other airlines attempt to board people in an orderly fashion by zone. People pay no attention to this, of course, and there's all this pressure to get, you know, past the gate agent, down the jetway, get your carry-on baggage in a bin, and so forth. People are under all kinds of tension trying to, you know, get on these planes. And you have, in most cases, a single individual who is scanning the boarding cards, either physical or on people's phones. So, should there be another step there? Probably. Right. Delta is moving toward facial recognition on many flights. I've had this experience and in some cases, actual physical barriers, which probably would be a good idea, because I think one individual who's there with this scrum of passengers trying to push forward, paying no attention to the zones and is trying to make announcements simultaneously. There's plenty of opportunities for people to get by if they're determined, unfortunately. So, again, the layers of this ultimately caught the individual before this aircraft took off for Hawaii.

The airlines are, you know, obviously a profit-driven business, and they like to keep it as lean as possible, but maybe more individuals there to watch, or maybe technology can help with either facial recognition and actual physical barriers to the jetway door so that people have to be, you know, checked in and screened before even a door opens. So, things like that can help, but these are clearly weak spots in the system. And the system is, you know, blinking red here saying, hey, there are problems here.

Can you break down what this newly discovered mutation means? And also, the CDC said that the risk to the general public has not changed and remains low. Do you agree with that? DR. ANDREW PAVIA, PEDIATRIC INFECTIOUS DISEASE DOCTOR AT THE UNIVERSITY OF UTAH: I think the question is whether or not the risk today has changed, because I don't think it has. I think the question is whether or not the risk today has changed, because I don't think it has. But we're getting yet another really serious reminder about just how much we can't underestimate this virus. So, these changes probably occurred in the patient as it continued to replicate. As the patient was sick, these changes allowed the virus to attach more effectively to human cells, and that's probably why this patient became so ill. It's one of the factors that the virus hasn't yet developed but that it's a real possibility that we keep watching for. So, I think everyone is too busy trying to tell us that the average person isn't at risk for getting bird flu today, which is absolutely true.

CDC changed its recommendations back in November to widen the testing net to include testing asymptomatic people with high-risk exposure to avian flu. The statement goes on to say more than 70,000 specimens have been tested looking for novel flu viruses more than 10,000 people exposed to avian flu have been monitored for symptoms and 540 people have been tested specifically for H5N1.

The studies that were done to look for asymptomatic infection were relatively small. 540 people have had an H5N1 test specifically, and yet we know that farm workers are being exposed. We've got more than 900 farms throughout the U.S., dairy farms alone, that have had H5N1.And of course, there's infection in other animals that may be just as important. You've seen the outbreak in cats, recently at a shelter for wild felids, we've seen the contamination of pet food. What we really need is to be testing very broadly among animals to understand the extent, which we're just beginning to do. And we need much more testing of people who are at risk, which would include farm workers. Now, what CDC doesn't say, and I have great respect for CDC, I used to work there, is that it's very difficult to do this. Farm workers don't always have great access to medical care. They often don't want to complain that they're sick because they have no benefits. Testing depends on local states and local health departments to be able to do it. So, there are a lot of barriers, but I think overall we're not doing enough surveillance among animals and we're not doing enough surveillance among people.",

That will mean bigger paychecks for more than 9.2 million workers.But millions more live in states that are not increasing minimum wages, and even with the increases, many workers still won't make enough to reach a living wage. That means that they are not paid enough to afford a family's basic needs, including housing, food, health care, child support and transportation, and there is no indication that Congress will raise the federal minimum wage anytime soon. It's been $7.25 an hour since 2009. Joining me now to talk about all of this is Yannet Lathrop, a senior researcher and policy analyst with the National Employment Law Project. Yannet, thank you so much for joining us. We appreciate your time. Let me ask you this. We have seen these raises happening for several years across other cities and states. What have you learned from those areas that raised the minimum wage? What were the immediate impacts to workers?",

So, there is time for employers to be able to adjust the minimum wage without really shedding jobs or cutting hours.And if you're running a business, you need your employers. You can't just decide that you're going to lay off or cut hours. That will impact the quality of the services that you provide and the businesses that will suffer.
