There are staff members who are talking about price. They're talking now about how much we'll be caught. The state of play, as I understand it right now is that the Republicans are insisting on cuts, other than Defense and Veterans benefits. And so they want 8 percent cuts, while the White House wants to increase spending by about 5 percent. So 8 percent cuts on one side, 5 percent growth on the other side, they're going to arrive somewhere down the middle, and there's going to be a lot of pain and a lot of controversy in between. One other part of this, though, Victor, that's worth keeping in mind is they're also now discussing whether or not this is going to last beyond the presidential election, meaning is this whatever agonizing compromise comes out of this will it last one year, or will it last two, so that we don't have to be back at the table talking about this all over again.

And you may remember that name, he's the prime suspect in the 2005 disappearance of Natalie Holloway, remember that in Aruba?Well, van der Sloot has been serving time in Peru for the murder of a different woman, a Peruvian woman. He is now going to be extradited to the U.S. to face extortion and wire fraud charges, these federal charges. Talk to us more about these charges, because it does have to do with Natalie Holloway ways disappearance.",

Because you would recall that years ago, right, we know that he, as you noted, is in jail for the 2010 killing and the 2012 conviction where he got 28 years of Stephanie Flores. That's a Peruvian woman.And so there was a debate around about that time, but he also did is we look at him there is he called the mother Beth Holloway, Natalie Holloway's Mother, hey, I know where your daughter is. Oh, do you really? Yes. And if you give me 20 -- $250,000 I will let you know exactly where her body is. And so what Beth Holloway, Natalie Holloway's mom did is contacted the FBI rightfully, sent him $100 initially, sent him another $15,000 which she wired to the Netherlands, as we look there, and Natalie Holloway. And then subsequent to that gave him another 10,000 in person. We of course know that he led her attorney to where he said the body was that ended up being a lie. That's what we call extortion. That's what we call fraud. Last point. What happened was is it was felt or believed that he would serve his full prison sentence in Peru which would end around to 2 --2,040, 2,038 until he could face those fraud charges. No. There was an agreement reached for his extradition such that he will be brought to the United States be held accountable for these charges and after that's adjudicated, he will be brought back. So Beth Holloway certainly is very pleased at the fact that he will face accountability here and now",

And it's important to catch these cancers early. That gives a better chance of survival. Now, meanwhile, this update does not change recommendations for women at high risks of getting breast cancer. Those women should continue to keep in contact with their doctors for what's best for them.
