We of course, begin our coverage there. Israel has formed an emergency government and war management cabinet. Former Defense Minister Benny Gantz will join Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and the Current Defense Minister. So far the opposition leader European has not joined in. The government will not pass any laws or make decisions unrelated to the war. This announcement coming as Israel's military says they're taking steps to ensure a Hamas attack inside Israel never happens, again 300,000 Israeli military reservists, now amassing near the Gaza border. Israeli airstrikes are leveling buildings in Gaza. The IDF says Hamas militants are hiding inside them, a spokesperson calling the militants cowards. Electricity is out in Gaza and Israel is enacting a complete blockade. Palestinian health officials say hospitals will run out of fuel to operate generators by tomorrow. We are seeing the gruesome aftermath of the carnage that Hamas left behind as it rated villages along the border, dead bodies and horrifying reports of the slaughter of Israeli civilians. Here's what the Israeli Prime Minister had to say about it in a phone call with President Biden. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

The Israeli Prime Minister's Office has now been saying that Hamas is ISIS. Because they're acquainting you know what we've seen ISIS do in the past, it's hard, honestly, to stomach for me as a mother as somebody who's pregnant right now to just imagine what had happened down there.

But the other problem that you have is that all of these areas, probably booby trapped, or at least in some way, you know, made difficult to enter. And what they can expect, are probably some of the most gruesome tactics that Hamas would bring to bear on the Israeli soldier. So they have to be prepared for that. In essence, it's a give no quarter kind of war, which is Oregon's back to medieval times, you know, Genghis Khan, and those kinds of things. And it is a nothing can bring together a population more than to see the other side, brutalize your own people. And when that happens, I, then all bets are off as to what comes next, because the Israelis are furious at this, and rightly so. But there's a long history here. And there are going to be a lot of different aspects to this, that where the Israelis will have to be careful with how they do this.

So that is the kind of heightened state of alert that we are under. In fact, it was only about 20 minutes, half hour ago at most that we had rocket fire coming from Gaza. We actually saw the rockets before those sirens went off. And then from another direction, we saw the Iron Dome missile heading to intercept those rockets. The interception happens behind the cloud. But you could we could tell from where we were, that it was happening really right over head. And again, this is kind of the tempo that we are seeing of life in Southern Israel right now. This is certainly a country that is on a war footing all around us. We have been watching this massive mobilization effort beginning to take place more than 300,000 reservists have been called up.

Her colleague, Cori Bush said, \"As part of achieving adjusting lasting peace, we must do our part to stop this violence and trauma by ending the government support for U.S. for Israeli military occupation, and apartheid\". And I think that's the part I want to underscore ending U.S. government support for Israeli military occupation.

So I'm going to start here, and then I'm going to show a couple of different perspectives. But, Kate, I'm putting you on the spot here, I realized, but this is something you know, the White House is going to have to grapple with this. The president gave an extraordinarily forceful speech yesterday where he said that the United States stands behind Israel unequivocally. But you're going to see these comments in campaign ads, and you're going to see some recriminations, even from I mean, I know there's a lot of really hard feelings inside the party.

But it's how and when the majorities inside both parties, Democrats and Republicans who support Israel, speak with clarity, unity, and do so relentlessly. And so I think there's going to be a debate inside the party about where funding comes from, and you know, they're going to Ukraine issue is going to get drawn into this, unfortunately, and it's going to get muddled. But the folks who stand with Israel, and Democrats and Republicans across the aisle who believe in speaking on this issue with unity and clarity, and having a united American policy on this are going to have to come up with a political plan for that, or are going are going to have to come up with a communications plan for that. And they're going to have to do it methodically and relentlessly. That's really the core thing. That's really the, that's the hardest thing to do right now in today's politics, which is break through all of the clutter and achieve that. And I think that's what I'm hoping that leaders with in my part within my party are able to achieve over the next couple of weeks because we have all this other stuff going on right now that's distracting it.",

It is a very complicated process. This is something that can go through many rounds of balloting. Last time it took 15 rounds before Kevin McCarthy got the top job back in January. Although we should note that that was on the floor of the house, this particular process that's going on behind closed doors right now is one that can also take a lot of time, but it's not as embarrassing because it doesn't play out in public. They're trying to avoid exactly what we saw last time. CNN's Lauren Fox is at the U.S. Capitol. Lauren, my understanding is their members coming out.

We have Kate Bedingfield, CNN Political Commentator, and, of course, the former White House Communications Director for President Biden and of course, Margaret Talev, Senior Contributor at Axios. Thank you all for being back with us. And Kevin Madden, I promised I would come to you on this because you are a Republican. And as such, you have to answer for all of this nuttiness now, I'm kidding. But you know, you and I met, first met covering when I covered the 2012 Romney campaign, and this was a very different Republican Party. Talk a little bit about the forces inside this conference right now, because I would have thought that this Israel situation would have lit more of a fire underneath these people. Because we were talking last week when this all unfolded about the potential implications and there was no crisis. But everyone looked around and said, if there is a crisis, the U.S. government can act. Well, here we are. And yet it still seems that they are in exactly the same place that they were, they are divided. And there is no clear path to naming a speaker even before the end of the week, potentially.",

Well, one of the things that's, you know that that's one of the splits within inside the Republican Party on the House of Representatives is that you have a governing conference, and then you have a performative conference. And there's a bunch of folks out there who are more interested in sort of driving outrage amongst their base. They're more interested in sort of getting clicks and going on cable TV and talk radio, and saying that they're in Washington fighting against the establishment. And it's that part of the Republican conference right now, that's really, I think, crucial to answering the question whether or not we ever reach 218. There are a large majority of folks that want to govern, and they want to move on, and they want to select the speaker, and they recognize the moment that we're in right now. And that it should motivate folks to come together and make a decision about a speaker and get back to the role of governing.

I mean, when Obama was President, he was vice president, he was the one up on Capitol Hill negotiating with Mitch McConnell to try and figure out how to handle those crises. I mean, it's increasingly felt covering Capitol Hill like it is, we are lurching as a government from crisis to crisis to crisis.
