We took the latest Marquette Law School poll which came, I think just this morning here, and the way we broke it down is Donald Trump's at 56 percent in this poll. The second through sixth place candidates combined are at 29 percent, undecided or other are 15 percent.And the reason I wanted to show this is it gives you a sense, you know, there's so much talk about these debates without Trump and who's in second, who's in third place. But if the numbers look like this, none of that matters.",

The same story is being told which is Donald Trump has such a formidable lead that something out of the ordinary is going to need to happen here to upend the trajectory. I'm not saying that can't happen but it would be out of the ordinary at this point given what a lead he's built up.You are right to note, when you are at 56 percent, John, you can add up everything else, you're not going to overtake that. That's a pretty significant majority.",

This is just in, the Trump campaign is now saying, David -- and this is, sort of, a double troll here, that they are now going to turn their focus to Nikki Haley because it is their feeling that they've already knocked out Ron DeSantis. That is the word for the Trump campaign there. It is not a very settle -- subtle message, I should say, but what do you see is going on there?",

So, rhetorically, they may want to act like they've already taken care of him, but let's watch carefully what they are doing in the last three months of the race.But obviously, Nikki Haley is another Republican candidate who has been gaining some traction in that battle for second place that you've been describing. She's had two widely positively reviewed debate performances. We've seen her numbers come up, most recently in our New Hampshire poll with the University of New Hampshire. We saw her in a battle tied for second place. So, she has some traction here. But again, traction to what? So, the Trump campaign understands nobody is voted yet. So, nobody is knocked out of this until we actually begin the voting process, and this is still a little bit more than 100 days away. Let's just see in those early state where the voters are a bit more engaged than what we see nationally, if there is an ability for one of these candidates to coalesce that non-Trump support and actually make a run at Trump to emerge, John, into a more one-on-one race. Every Republican strategist I talked to says, if there were a one-on- one race, this dynamic would look different. I am sure that that's true, but as you noted, it still does not mean that that second-place person would be leading Donald Trump at this point.",

And, you know, what you have to do is you have to ensure that in that operating environment, which again is anomalous for a normal dog that it's trained very, very well. You brought up a really good point about the Obama's dog. One thing that was different that we're not seeing here is that I spent a lot of time watching the first family, you know, train Sunny and Bo directly on the White House grounds.

What they are doing though is they're altering their patterns to try to avoid Commander.Now, does that have a measured impact on the, you know, total operations? It may, I'm not saying it does. But again, why do you actually have to be in that environment?

But the fact that it got here is significant. Remember, his conviction was vacated but it was also reinstated by the Court of Appeals. But the facts are that when Marilyn Mosby who was the district attorney in Baltimore asked the court to vacate the conviction, it was based on that exculpatory evidence had not been given to the defense, and that there were two potential suspects that the defense had never been told about.And so, the court did vacate the conviction. The issue is the family wasn't consulted. The victim's family was never notified until, according to legal documents, the evening before this was going to happen. And the representative was in California. He couldn't get there in time. He was allowed to watch it on Zoom, but he wanted to know what's the basis for this. Let us know what is the evidence you have? Why is this being done? Because they had lived for so many years believing that it had been solved. Because of that, that spun into constitutional issues and rights of the victim and the victim's family, and that is what led to the Court of Appeals to reinstate the conviction. So, now you have this going on. And I heard the judge this morning say, don't we need to look a bit into the merits of all of this, you know, within the issue of the family not being notified? So, there could be huge ramifications here. Could he end up back in prison, I think anything is --",
