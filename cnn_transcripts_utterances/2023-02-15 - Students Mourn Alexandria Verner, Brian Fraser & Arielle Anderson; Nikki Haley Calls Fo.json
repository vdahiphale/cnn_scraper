Police said a note was discovered in the shooter's pocket threatening to target two other schools in New Jersey. Investigators say the 43-year-old shooter did have ties to New Jersey.

So, we're learning that U.S. Intel officials are closely scrutinizing the possibility that this balloon was in fact diverted off of its original course by the weather. And this is important because if in fact it is proven or shown or intelligent suggests that this path towards the continental United States from China where it was originally launched was, in fact, unintentional, then this could go a pretty long way in easing tensions between the U.S. and China.But just to take you back a minute. The U.S. did track this balloon from the moment that it took off from China. And originally, based on the flight path that it kind of settled into, the U.S. believed that it was going to travel eastward over Guam potentially to surveil sensitive military installations there. But instead, it took a pretty dramatic northern turn and it went off course, up to Alaska across towards Canada and then down towards Montana where of course it did settle ultimately over yet another sensitive military installation there. But the U.S. officials that we speak to now saying that there is a possibility that the weather patterns and strong winds particularly over Alaska and Canada did in fact cause that balloon to divert south and that it was possibly not intentional. Now, it is important to note that this balloon can still maneuver, but it's very limited. So, the fact that it did loiter kind of over those sensitive sites in Montana is proof to the United States that the Chinese did want at least to take advantage of its position there and continue to gather intelligence. But ultimately, this is the intention behind the balloon. And its path is going to be really critical in determining of course, whether the U.S. and China can get past this really dramatic diplomatic period of tension, guys.",

They're belligerence in the South China Sea, a million Uyghurs in concentration camps in the 21st century, and so much more. So, I think we should be taking on China in a much more you know robust way than we are right now.",

And it is alarming to hear our defense establishment say that, in fact, they picked up the phone and called and there was no answer at the other end. That cannot be between two nations, especially nations that may be on a potential collision course at some point in time in the future. And so, we want to avoid that. So, in order to do that, you have to have somebody to talk to. And in that respect, I think on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference, which I'll be at, I think it makes sense to at least establish those lines of communication to deconflict and avoid such conflict.",
