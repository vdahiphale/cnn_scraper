It should be a good time. It always is. So, from current stars to future stars. Round one of the NHL draft held in Nashville last night went pretty much according to script. The Chicago Blackhawks selecting elite 17-year-old prospect Connor Bedard with their first overall pick. The Canadian center, the most talked about prospect since Edmonton's Connor McDavid, who was drafted back in 2015, and he is expected to make an immediate impact. With so many people talking about the Bedard, though, it's easy to forget there were other players to draft. Even Montreal Canadiens goalie Carey Price seemed to forget while announcing his team's selection. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Twenty-seven up, 27 down for the Yankees ace who wrote his name into the record books last night throwing only the 24th perfect game in Major League history. This is a league that's been around for well over 100 years, so this is truly a rare feat. German struck out nine and retired all 27 batters to become the first to do it since 2012. He said after the game that accomplishing something like this is something that he's going to remember forever being a part of this history. And Christine, the last inning, he said it was so different. He felt a tremendous amount of pressure that he's never felt before and the key was just to not overthrow it. But he's been dealing with so much. He lost a very close family member to start the week. He's had a very rough couple of outings. And so last night after the game it was really interesting to hear him tell the reporter, Meredith Marakovits, that his uncle was very much on his mind and this game was for him. And he felt that even early on -- three, four innings on -- that this might be something that could be possible for him, which I don't think a lot of people predicted.
