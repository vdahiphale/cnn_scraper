[06:05: These numbers the plaintiffs put forward are just that. They're numbers that plaintiffs put forward. There's no guarantee Dominion would have won a trial, and even if they had, there's no guarantee they would have gotten anything close to $787.5 million. Now, let's put it in some meaningful context. Poppy, as you just said, this is an unprecedented payout. If we look at some of the recent high-profile defamation, settlements and judgments, we are seeing dollar amounts in the $222 million, $177 million, $274 million, $33 million dollars. The only higher figure came in the Alex Jones case, where a jury awarded $1.4 billion. However, that needs to be split between about 20 different plaintiffs. And realistically, Alex Jones is not going to pay that money. FOX is going to have to pay all $787.5 million. It's also important to keep in mind exactly what Dominion Voting Systems is. It's a modest-sized company. They're privately held. They have about 250 employees. The current total valuation of the entire company is under $100 million.

We were looking at the very realistic possibility of seeing Hannity, Tucker Carlson and other prominent hosts have to take the stand. And also, maybe even more importantly, some of FOX's top executives are now spared having to take the stand and get cross-examined, including most importantly, Rupert Murdoch, the CEO of the entire FOX News Corporation.

Lawmakers huddled yesterday for Republican conference meeting, andthere was a lot of concern from conservatives that the spending cuts included in the proposal were not steep enough. And the argument that McCarthy was making to his conference was, this is about showing the president, showing Senate Democrats that we are united in an effort to get back to the negotiating table to talk about the debt ceiling. So this is really part of a multi-pronged approach for Kevin McCarthy. And he has to succeed here if he is going to get back to the negotiating table with the White House. He knows that. His conference knows that. Is that enough to put him over the edge? That's the major question at this moment. And we expect that they could vote on this as soon as next week.

It's been a parking lot since the Fifties, and this is not uncommon around here. A lot of these buildings are very old. So what we don't know yet is whether that played a factor in this collapse. You can see behind it is Pace University, a dormitory, which had to be evacuated following that collapse. And you can see in the video that cars have just been swallowed up by the building after the floors just pancaked right on top of each other.
