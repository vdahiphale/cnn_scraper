      "sentences": "Yes. And it's really interesting here, because the IDF is saying this is not a shift in policy, it's merely a continuation of what they've been doing, these humanitarian corridors that they've had. They started off towards the end of last week just a couple of hours a day telling civilians to walk down this certain highway to get from the north of Gaza to the south of Gaza. And they've kind of built that out a little bit made it a couple of hours longer each day and 50 000 people went down that route yesterday, 80 000 again according to the Israelis went down that route today.You can probably still hear the explosions coming from the - from - roughly around Gaza City. And I think that tells us what is useful to understand about the humanitarian corridor and these humanitarian pauses. They're humanitarian pauses. They're small in a specific location at a specific time to allow people or medical aid to move along certain roads, to move around certain neighborhoods they don't stop the overall fighting. And this, of course, is the Israeli position, absolutely no overall ceasefire until the hostages are released so the IDF can continue with their activities looking for Hamas, taking out Hamas, destroying the tunnels, all of that it goes on in parallel with these humanitarian pauses. But I think it's kind of interesting that we heard from President Biden about this today saying getting to this point and I think this gets back to the tensions between the White House and the Netanyahu administration over this he said uh that it had taken a little longer than he had hoped. In fact, he said he'd been pushing for humanitarian pauses that were three days or more. The Israeli is still talking about a couple of hours. They are determined that the IDF can keep up going after Hamas in parallel and not just have to let up completely for a period of days.",

There have been four additional attacks on U.S. and coalition bases in Iraq and Syria since just last night when the U.S. conducted those airstrikes against a weapons storage facility that they said was being used by Iran and its proxy groups in eastern Syria.And this raises a lot of questions, of course, about whether those airstrikes that the U.S. has been conducting against these weapons storage facilities in eastern Syria, yesterday was the second time in two weeks that they have done so, are actually acting as a deterrent against these proxy groups. The U.S.'s argument is that these strikes are not only a matter of retaliation for these attacks, but also an attempt to degrade Iran and its proxy groups' infrastructure and destroy their weaponry so that they can no longer carry out these attacks. But it does not appear at this point to be working, at least not yet. And the U.S. says that, look, these attacks that they are launching on these forces, they are using cheap drones, they are using rockets. They don't often create much damage or many casualties. But at the same time, more than 25 U.S. service members have already suffered traumatic brain injuries as a result of these attacks. And more than 56 at this point, or at least 56, have suffered injuries, according to the deputy Pentagon press secretary who spoke to us today. And so this is obviously a very serious issue that the Pentagon wants to address. But at the same time, they're striking a difficult balance here because they don't want to escalate the conflict any further than it has to be. And so they're trying at this point to conduct these strikes in limited self-defense, these precision airstrikes. But at the same time, of course, it doesn't seem to be working deterring these groups. So what happens next remains to be seen, Boris.",

In his retirement video, he said that he would travel the country, see if there's a movement that he can galvanize to bring the two sides together. What exactly does that mean? He has toyed with the possibility of running as a third party, as independent candidate, maybe on the no labels ticket, perhaps. All those things would be very difficult for him to pull off at this key moment. But is that what he means? Unclear. Joe Manchin is on his way back to West Virginia, this is - this end of the week in the Senate, so will he answer those questions about his own political future? That remains to be seen.

Let's assume for the moment this seat is going Republican. In fact, the Cook Political Report that does all these ratings, as soon as this announcement came out, they moved the contest to solid Republican in their rating system. So now you're dealing with if Jon Tester, as Manu mentioned, in Montana or Sherrod Brown in Ohio were to lose, that's the ballgame. You need these Democrats in red states to win and the Democrats would still need to win the White House to maintain control of the Senate in a 50-50 universe. Never mind battleground states like Michigan or Nevada or other tough states for Democrats that will be up this cycle as well and as Manu noted, with very little offensive opportunities.

Now, we do not yet know exactly what that warrant details, but authorities are saying that he is wanted in connection to the January 6th attack on the U.S. Capitol. What's also interesting here, Boris, is that USA Today reports that they previously actually had an opportunity to speak to this individual in connection to analysis that that outlet performed of some information that was released by the FBI. As we know, since the attacks on that day, federal authorities have been releasing batches of information, including photographs and advisories, hoping to track down individuals suspected of playing a role in the attacks on the U.S. Capitol. Now, at the time, Yetman told USA Today that though he was at the Capitol, he did not commit any crimes.

One of the latest incidents at Houston Hobby, that was not a close call, that was a crash. In that case, two private jets collided on intersecting runways. The NTSB just released the air traffic control transcripts, and the tower told the crew of that Hawker jet there to line up and wait for takeoff. The pilots acknowledged being told to line up and wait on the runway, but instead they took off anyway and that is what set up this collision course of this plane on a collision course with a landing Cessna Citation on an intersecting runway.
