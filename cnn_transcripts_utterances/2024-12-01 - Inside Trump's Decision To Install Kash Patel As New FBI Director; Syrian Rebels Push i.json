      "sentences": "Right. Well, Jessica, we've learned that essentially in the final days, it really came down to two people. Donald Trump knew that he wanted to get rid of FBI director Christopher Wray once he takes office but it was a question of who he wanted to install at the helm of the bureau. And he was really wavering between, I'm told, two people in particular, Kash Patel who we know of course he eventually named, but also the Missouri attorney general, Andrew Bailey.And I know as well that Bailey is someone Donald Trump had thought of for other roles in the past as well. He was on his list to potentially be attorney general, but essentially, I'm told that Donald Trump, he interviewed both Bailey and Patel earlier this month in person at Mar- a-Lago and Donald Trump was unimpressed with him, I'm told. He felt like Bailey did not have the personality traits or fit the mold that he wanted for the FBI, which was really someone who will be like- minded, who will carry out his agenda,, but will also disrupt the agency and try to root out the bias that Donald Trump has long argued has been permeating the FBI. I'm going to read for you what one Trump adviser told me who's been involved in some of these conversations. They said, quote, \"It came down to a matter of what Trump wants and what he was looking for in terms of an FBI director, and Bailey didn't fit that mold. He didn't have the personality.\" Now, I will say these conversations have been going on for a long time now about what Donald Trump wanted to do with the FBI. Again, it was clear that he wanted to make big changes, but it was not clear who he wanted to be the one kind of running the show there. Now, I'm told that some people close to the president-elect had some skepticism about Kash Patel, particularly given some of the controversial comments he has made in the past, and fears that he would not have an easy Senate confirmation battle, fears that are particular I would argue became even bigger after what happened with his first attorney general pick, Matt Gaetz. Now, however, there are people, though, that are very close to Donald Trump who have his ear. The people that my sources argue are the closest to him and who Donald Trump talks, or I should say trusts the most. And that includes his sons, Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr., but also Stephen Miller, his incoming deputy chief of staff for policy. I'm told that they were pushing Patel on Donald Trump arguing that really they believe that he was the only person that could reform the FBI and change the FBI in the eyes of Donald Trump, and really be in lockstep with him in the ways that they know that Donald Trump wants to do. And so, a lot of behind the scenes discussion about this. I know this was a decision that Donald Trump, I'm told, was wavering for a bit and really wanted to make sure he found the right fit. And he believes that that is Kash Patel -- Jess.",

And look, I deal with the bureau a lot and, you know, it's a pretty conservative organization. There's -- I would probably guess that most people at the FBI most likely voted for Donald Trump. They tend to be on the conservative side politically.And so what the quarrel that conservatives have and that Trump has about the FBI or really about the investigations over the last few years. [19:05:05] They see that as bias and they see it as directed from the White House, which is not really what certainly the evidence that we've seen shows. And so the danger that could emanate from this is that, you know, if you start using the FBI essentially to just carry out political vendettas, then when the next party takes office, that's exactly what could happen. And so we have to, you know, I think one of the things that will be a challenge for the nomination, for Kash Patel, will be to test some of the things that he has said publicly, some of the things that you have reported on previously as to whether he sticks by those sentiments about the use of the FBI to go after Trump's enemies.",

So they'll pick one, maybe two, but then the rest they won't have the courage to say no to this, too. I don't think that Kash Patel is a guarantee, but I think the more that there are bad picks out there, the more likely it is that some of them get through simply because resisting all of Donald Trump's picks, especially in an election year for some of these people, is pretty difficult to do.",

But Assad met with the Iranian foreign minister today. The Iranian foreign minister said he was in the country showing support for Iran's neighbor. They are a huge backer of Bashar al-Assad, have been for many, many years, and Assad himself saying that he was going to take the fight to the terrorists and turf them out. But it does appear as if these groups want to push further south. There's big cities between them and the capital Damascus. Hama would be a big one, significant. Homs would be big and significant and it does appear as if the rebels may be on their way there.

So, look, it would be extremely, extremely unusual if Patel, in fact did not get confirmed.

He said several months ago in June, when he was still seeking reelection, that he would not pardon Hunter Biden. But now we are learning he is.And let's just read through the statement quickly together, he said. \"Today, I signed a pardon for my son, Hunter. From the day I took office. I said I would not interfere with the Justice Department's decision making, and I kept my word even as I watched my son being selectively and unfairly prosecuted.\" So, this is a fairly long statement about four or five paragraphs from President Biden. But really going through why he is making this decision. He also goes on to say this. He said, \"No reasonable person who looks at the facts of Hunter's cases can reach any other conclusion than Hunter was singled out because he is my son and that is wrong.\" He goes on to say, 'There has been an effort to break Hunter, who has been five-and-a-half years sober even in the face of unrelenting attacks and selective prosecution.\" So, of course, Jessica, let's take a step back. You obviously covered the Biden campaign along with me, and this is something that Hunter Biden has been dealing with. This is a tax case, a gun case. He went through his trial in Delaware. There was another case in Los Angeles. But this is really the culmination of President Biden really making the decision tonight to sign a pardon for his son, Hunter, not just a commutation of a possible sentence, but a pardon which certainly will be part of President Biden's legacy going forward.",

Certainly something he did not want. He hoped to run for reelection. He obviously stepped away from that months ago, but clearly there was pressure inside the family. We were told really in recent weeks that Dr. Jill Biden, First Lady Jill Biden was very supportive of the president doing something like this. The president was not sure, but we clearly have seen now he has come to this decision to pardon his son, Hunter.",

And so we've been watching and seeing what the president of the United States would do. I think as you and Jeff were just talking about, I think you know, we'll see what the American public arrives at but I think it's really remarkable to sort of step back and just read some of what President Biden is saying in here. Keep in mind, he took office in 2021, promising to sort of restore the institutions and try to restore faith in those institutions, including the system of justice obviously, the justice department, those are among the big priorities with him. That's why he chose Merrick Garland, a former judge, to be Attorney General. And then, if you look now where we are what the president of the United States is saying is that essentially there are problems, there are political problems with the prosecutions that are being brought by his own Justice Department and, you know, I think that's going to be a very, very tough pill for people to swallow on this issue because obviously it is a thing that we keep hearing from Donald Trump. And it's the thing that animates the Trump team over the next four years. You're already hearing from them that they want to destroy some of those institutions that they believe are stacked against them. And so, to see President Biden sort of go to the same territory is kind of a remarkable turn to watch.",

Walk us through kind of his thought process, how he thinks about these things. We know per our reporting, that this was happening over -- a lot of it over the weekend. But tell us more about kind of how you think he arrived at this decision.EDWARD-ISAAC DOVERE, CNN SENIOR REPORTER: Yes, this is something that has been a great pain to Joe Biden for many years and was weighing on him as he decided whether to run for reelection and then was deciding whether to stay in the race earlier in the year. He believes that Hunter Biden was being prosecuted for these crimes because he put the spotlight on the Biden family by running for president. He put the spotlight on his son. He believes that there are things that Hunter has dealt with and in some ways, some of the issues that he's had over the years that Biden wasn't there in the same way that he might have been as a father, that some of the pressures that came on him from being in the limelight because of who his father was. And so, Joe Biden has struggled with this but look, there's really no disputing the change in position here from the clip you played to the decision that's been made tonight. That said, one of the things that is definitely on the minds of people around the Biden family in these weeks now is Donald Trump prepares to take over as president again is that there may be more selective prosecutions and there was a feeling among a number of Biden allies that Hunter Biden would be an easy target for a Trump Justice Department looking to make a point. So, that is to protect his son, the decision that's been made here. Of course, as Evan was noting, this is the Joe Biden who's tried to say that there is a standard of justice here that he has been loyal to and he has believed in and that Donald Trump is after other things. It will make it probably politically more difficult for there to be an argument against whatever pardons Donald Trump may make as president for his own political allies and his own family members, if it comes to that, or obviously, for himself, if he decides to pardon himself, given that Joe Biden has made this decision.",

And it's part of what we've seen over the last year, certainly during the trials in Delaware, where a lot of the ugliest days of his life you know, his struggle with drug addiction, all of those were laid to bare in front of a jury during that trial and we've seen a lot of that in this statement now that he has just issued.I'll read just what he's saying here. He says, \"I've admitted and taken responsibility for my mistakes during the darkest days of my addiction, mistakes that have been exploited to publicly humiliate and shame me and my family for political support. Despite all of this, I have maintained my sobriety for more than five years because of my deep faith and the unwavering love and support of my family and friends.\" He goes on to say that you know, while he has squandered many opportunities, he says, \"I will never take the clemency that I've been given today for granted and will devote the life that I have rebuilt to helping those who are still sick and still suffering.\" And that's again what Hunter Biden has to say now that his father has given him this pardon, that finally resolves these legal problems that have been hanging over him now for more than five years. Jessica, I will point out that this was a theme that Hunter Biden returned to a lot during that trial. I mean, one of the aspects of this was, you know, sitting there watching him look at videos and look at some of the pictures of paraphernalia, some of the stories that were being told by witnesses. His mother sitting there, his family members sitting there right behind him. You know watching all of this get displayed in public view. That had to be one of the most difficult things that anyone has ever done and one of the big concerns inside the Biden family, as I understand it, from talking to people, is that there was a lot of concern that because of going through this, that Hunter Biden might relapse, that he might go back to using drug, that has not happened, Hunter has said. And so, here we are. And so, it appears that with this resolution, he can try to move on and rebuild his life, that is, of course if the next administration allows that, because they very much could continue to make this a theme of the political theater in Washington.",

He said once he made this decision, this weekend, there was no sense in delaying it further. He goes on to say that he hopes Americans will understand why a father and a president would come to this decision. I want to go now to our senior legal analyst, Elie Honig, who is standing by. Elie, help us zoom out for a minute and understand both the legal implications of this. There's the political parts of it and the legal parts of it and we've heard a little bit about both. Help us understand the legal ramifications of this, and especially this idea that we've been hearing from all of our correspondents.

Charged somebody who possessed a firearm for 11 days, never used it never brandished it, never fired it. It was disposed of, to go back in time and charge that, to me is unheard of.The tax charges are a little harder to sort of figure out because sometimes tax charges are just handled through civil processes. Someone pays it back. Maybe there's a lawsuit. But other times tax cases are handled through criminal charges and that can vary based on the specifics. I do think it's important to remember here, Jessica, though, there was a moment last summer where David Weiss, the special counsel, and his DOJ team walked into court with Hunter Biden's team and they had an agreement in place to let this case go for basically nothing. They were going to give him a deferred disposition, meaning just sort of dismiss the gun case, essentially and they were going to let him plead to misdemeanors on the tax case, which would have meant probation only. But then DOJ sort of changed its mind mid proceeding. Hunter Biden's team has said that DOJ reneged on the case and given my experience, it is suspicious the way that DOJ tried to suddenly back out of that case in the face of some political pressure. So, I do think there is some merit to the view that Hunter Biden was treated differently here because of his last name.",

He really leaned on his son, Hunter, particularly as you point out in Beau's absence. Beau, of course, died a number of years ago. This is somebody that has been in the room for these kinds of important moments, somebody that the president has really leaned on. And again, I think that is why it's important for us to talk about this decision, having been made by President Biden as he is in office in his remaining months in office, but also, again as a father, he believed that this was the right thing to do as a father. One sentence that stood out to me, and this is something a White House official just told me as well, there's a line in the statement from the president that says he is hopeful that the American people will understand why he made this decision. I think, in that sentence, there is sort of a suggestion that he understands this could be controversial, that not everyone is going to understand this or agree with this decision, particularly because again, keep in mind, over the past few months, we have repeatedly heard either the president or various White House officials when asked this question whether he is going to make this decision of potentially pardoning his son, they had repeatedly said that he would not.",

I think it made sense for President Biden to do it here on a sleepy Sunday night after Thanksgiving. It will explode tomorrow in the media of all kinds -- it is already. But nothing here is surprising. The thought that Joe Biden was going to leave office and have his son in prison seemed remote at best. And so, it's more than a family story of Joe Biden and Beau and Hunter, but the laptop of Hunter Biden became part of the political landscape for years now. You know, with \"The New York Post\" story that it was a cover up of that by the mainstream media, that it really should have been reported sooner to the fact that there was accusations that it was Russian disinformation to the fact now, all that noise about Hunter Biden, alas, it comes to rest. He's going to go on live his life. Joe Biden will leave the White House and this will become part of our political history and folklore.",
