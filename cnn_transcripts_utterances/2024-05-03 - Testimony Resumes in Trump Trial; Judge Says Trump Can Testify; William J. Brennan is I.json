A witness that we saw yesterday still in the middle of their testimony when court ended. Soon again Trump will be part of that captive audience that is going to be listening to the prosecution's version of a Trump tale, a sexual encounter with the adult film star that the former president allegedly tried to keep hidden from American voters.Yesterday, for the first time, the jury actually got to hear Trump's voice in that secretly recorded audio tape.

And minutes from now testimony resumes and zeros in on Trump's former fixer, Michael Cohen. We expect the district attorney's forensic expert who combed through Cohen's devices to head back to the stand. The question now, are there more surreptitiously recorded conversations - we heard some of that yesterday, that the prosecution plans to play for the jury. And will they again feature Donald Trump in his own words. Of course, we heard some of that yesterday when Michael Cohen brought up the issue of payments and Trump talked about cash and Michael Cohen said, no, no, no, no, no. There is also a lingering question about whom the jury will hear from next. Hope Hicks, the former president's long time communications director and aid always by his side, she could be taking the stand today. She is expected to testify at some point. We're waiting for that. It also could be Stormy Daniels. That is somebody else we are watching for. The adult film star at the center of this case. And, of course, CNN's covering this trial from all angles. Our reporters are inside the courtroom giving us a minute by minute update of every word said by witnesses, prosecutors, and the former president's defense team. And let's go to Elie Honig, who has more on everything we should be watching for today. Elie, what should we be looking for?",

And prosecutors are using this witness as a way to introduce documents and recordings to the jury, including two crucial recordings.Now, the first one of these tapes was made secretly by Michael Cohen in September 2016, when he was the lawyer for Donald Trump. Michael Cohen had a conversation with Trump about the payouts to Karen McDougal, and he recorded this conversation. Let's take a quick listen to some of the excerpts. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Prosecutors will argue this tape shows Donald Trump absolutely knew about those payouts and approved of them. That defense will argue, first of all, why was Michael Cohen secretly recording his own client? Second of all, they'll argue it shows that Michael Cohen was the one who handled the financing, the structuring of these payments, and that's the heart of the crime.Now, we heard a second conversation, a second recording, between Michael Cohen and Keith Davidson. Keith Davidson was the lawyer for Karen McDougal and Stormy Daniels. Here's another recording that the jury heard yesterday. Let's take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

He also found that Michael Cohen had 39,000 plus people in his contacts. That's a bizarre number. That's enough to fill Madison Square Garden twice over. Not sure if there's any significance to that. I suppose we'll find out. And, of course, he introduced to the jury that recorded call that we just heard between Michael Cohen and Donald Trump. Now, earlier in the day we heard from Keith Davidson. We just heard him on the recording with Michael Cohen. He represented both Karen McDougal and Stormy Daniels. He brokered on Stormy Daniels' behalf the deal with Michael Cohen, where Michael Cohen paid them $130,000 as a hush money payment. Keith Davidson didn't like that characterization. He said, well, it was just - it was just compensation for a contract. It's hush money. Keith Davidson testified about that. He also testified that the reason for this payment, in his understanding, was that these payments, to keep these women quiet, was - it was intended in some way to assist the presidential campaign of Donald Trump. Finally, on cross-examination, the defense brought out a couple things about Davidson's testimony. He never had any direct contact with Donald Trump, only with Michael Cohen. They brought out the fact that Michael Cohen was disappointed. He was hoping he would become attorney general under Donald Trump and therefore had some motivation. And Davidson also admitted that he used, quote/unquote, leverage in order to get this money for his clients. So, that's a summary of what we saw yesterday. When we get back into court today, Douglas Daus will be back on the stand. He's being cross- examined. We'll see what the defense has in mind. And, Kaitlan, let's throw it back to you in New York to bring us up to speed what's happening there.",

Something really important just happened as Elie was laying all of that out for us, which is that as soon as Donald Trump and his attorneys got in the courtroom, the judge corrected what Donald Trump falsely asserted yesterday when he left the courtroom, which is that because of the gag order that's in place it prevents him from testifying. Something that Todd Blanche. Trump's attorney, shook his head in affirmation at as Trump said that. And when Trump entered the courtroom this morning, the judge said, no, it doesn't.

You remember there was a hearing called the Sandoval hearing that took place a few weeks ago at this point now where the judge was saying, here are the parameters of what people might be able to asked you if you do take the stand. Now, the Sandoval hearing is a way of saying, here you're on noticed, defendant, if you want to testify, there are things we might be able to bring in that are not necessary charged conduct but prior bad acts. And these might be used to what they call impeach you. In other words, point out inconsistencies or give the jury an insight and some kind of MO. The judge would not have done that, would not have gone through the process if he intended to actually limit the ability of a defendant to testify. And, of course, the whole reason he's doing this is because he knows it's a court of public opinion. That's not these 18 jurors. If he wants to testify, it's well within his rights. Now, whether he will every - I mean I'm almost salivating right now as a former prosecutor thinking about a defendant taking the stand because you can bring out so many things. It's pandoras box. And once that door is open, it really cannot be closed. They have to be really, really careful. That's why he wants to get ahead of it. He wants to appear deferential and yet not do it. And we're seeing right now these an argument that - from Todd Blanche, a tweet from \"The Washington Post\" should not be admitted because it includes a photo of Trump, Billy Bush, and one of the women in the \"Access Hollywood\" video, which, of course, they cannot show, it's to prejudicial.",

A gag would suggest you can't talk at all. He can say almost anything he wants, he just has to lay off a witnesses, jurors, court staff, and families. I mean we hear him going on rants almost nightly. He did this morning, he did last night about the judge, about the DA, about the indictment. That's all totally fine.

I'm Kaitlan Collins here in New York. The former president, we are told by reporters inside the room, was just sitting at the defense table, has his eyes closed, as he has made a habit of his over the last three weeks, as his attorneys are sorting through important legal jockeying with the judge. But now the jury is out to make their entrance into the courtroom. Joining us now is criminal defense attorney Bill Brennan, who represented Donald Trump's payroll corporation in a tax fraud trial, and Trump himself in his second impeachment trial, and he joins us again now. And, Bill, right now Trump's attorney, Emil Bove, is continuing his cross-examination. This witness on the stand is not someone that anyone at home knows, or even most people who've been covering this trial very closely. But the importance of having these witnesses come on to verify the authenticity and the data that they extracted from Michael Cohen's phone. Why is that something that's important for them to do in front of the jury? WILLIAM J. BRENNAN, FORMER TRUMP PAYROLL CORP. ATTORNEY: Well, good morning, Kaitlan, and thanks for having me. I think, in this case, it appears that the prosecution and defense were unable to agree on stipulations, which is common in most trials in - with the innocuous type witness like this. Most times that testimony is presented by agreement or stipulation. Sometimes though not. And that's apparently the case here. So, the defense is putting the prosecution to its burden of proving the case. And these meat and potato types of witnesses are important because it shows the jurors how the case is built, and it shows, frankly, where flaws might come in and, you know, cracks in the ice. So, it's - it's a little bit of a snoozer compared to say Cohen or Pecker or Davidson, but important nonetheless.",

      "sentences": "Yes, and, obviously, there's been wide speculation about what the next high-profile witness that could be called and who that could be.There was some haggling this morning inside the courtroom over for the \"Access Hollywood\" tape, which the judge previously ruled before this trial even started that the prosecution couldn't actually show the tape to the jury, but they could read the transcript. And they were arguing over whether or not they could show basically a screenshot of that video that includes Donald Trump, Billy Bush, and the woman who was involved in that - in that tape and in that conversation. It seems to be suggesting that Hope Hicks could be one of the witnesses that we see soon. Obviously she was closely involved in monitoring the fallout of that situation during the final days of the campaign. What impact do you think she would have on the witness stand?",
