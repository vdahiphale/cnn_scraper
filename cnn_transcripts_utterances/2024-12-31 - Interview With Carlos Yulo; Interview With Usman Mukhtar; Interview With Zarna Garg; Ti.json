We will continue to countdown the new year in each region around the world until everyone has celebrated everywhere. Now, Bangkok, you're up next, ringing in the new year about 30 minutes from now.

It is going to be dropped by the thousands of pounds, hand-dropped from buildings all over Times Square. And in that confetti, there are actually going to be little wishes that people have written about what they want, of course, no doubt wishes for health and happiness and love.

I got to tell you, Brianna, like, usually, there's a ton of peoplehere, but for security reasons, this year, they are pushing back that time when all of those revelers are going to be allowed to come into Times Square. So, right now on the ground, this is what we get. We get just open rein of Times Square, which is actually kind of fun. I'm not going to lie to you. But, yes, we're seeing all the preparations under way for all the productions that are going to be going on all through the evening. And then, hey, Jimmy, look. Oh, we just missed it. There was a giant happy new year behind us because that is the main event right there. That is where that ball drops. That is what everybody will have their eyes on as we get closer to that midnight clock. Now, listen, right now, we're also seeing a lot of preparations for security reasons, of course. I have already seen some NYPD drones up. We know that there are barricades all around this area extending into avenues to our east and our west to make sure there are no mishaps, nothing goes wrong, so all of these people who come in here tonight can enjoy it, including us, Brianna.

And that was the dazzling display here in Hong Kong less than an hour ago and a little bit earlier. OK, Australia, you win. You knocked it out of the park with those famous fireworks launched from the Sydney Harbor Bridge, the Opera House and other landmarks, a real and true stunner. And, next, we're going to bring you the light show, the pyrotechnics, the party in Bangkok, as CNN takes you around the world celebrating 2025 in style until everyone everywhere rings in a new year. Now, Bangkok, that is where Will Ripley is standing by. And the excitement is building. We are just three minutes away from midnight. And, Will, when the clock strikes midnight, what exactly is going to happen? What are you looking out for?",

So pardon me if I keep glancing over my shoulder because I want to make sure I don't miss the countdown itself.It's so loud here, I'm not really sure what's happening around me. This is crazy. There's like tens of thousands of people. We just saw Lisa perform live. And at -- as the clock strikes midnight, we're two minutes and 25 seconds away, we're going to see a spectacular fireworks show, actually, two fireworks shows that are going to be happening. They have these barges that are aligning the Chao Phraya River for more than a kilometer, like a kilometer-and-a-half. There's going to be six minutes of fireworks here. There's also going to be fireworks in front of the Temple of Dawn, which is where we were live in front of last year. So we're going to actually kind of do a split screen moment and show you all of the action, both here at ICONSIAM and also at the Temple of Dawn as well. Bangkok just is really an extraordinary place to ring in the new year. I have done it at Times Square in New York. I have done it there in Hong Kong. I rang it in Taipei a few years ago, but I have done it now two years in a row here in Bangkok. I have been lucky enough, Kristie, with one minute and 38 seconds left until we countdown to 2025. And we're excited. I can feel the energy here. How's it doing there? You guys already had your fireworks in Hong Kong.",
