And there are no casualties in the city of Caesarea, where the residence is located. Meanwhile, U.S. and Israeli leaders are starting to see a long shot opportunity following Israel's killing of the top Hamas leader. Israeli sources tell CNN that returning Sinwar's remains to Gaza could be used as a bargaining chip to free the hostages still held there. Israel's president and prime minister say there's a significant window of opportunity to bring the hostages back and eliminate Hamas for good. But the group's top negotiator says there will be no release of hostages until the fighting stops and Israeli troops pull out. Israel's military says, it's clear what Hamas should do now. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MAJ. DORON SPIELMAN, IDF SPOKESPERSON:  There's no question that Sinwar's elimination destabilizes Hamas and it depends how that's going to be leveraged. If we can leverage it to defeat Hamas and the prime minister has already said that anyone who notifies and brings in a hostage will happen immunity, if that is able to be moved forward, then that last remaining group can raise their hands, raise the white flag and carry out three things. Stop shelling Israel, returning our hostages and disbanding. This can end tomorrow. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

FiveThirtyEight has the odds of Trump or Harris winning Michigan as dead even. So, Oakland County and I'll add to that, Kent County, are really two places to watch.Oakland County, that includes suburban Detroit; Kent County includes Grand Rapids. Both have really been trending blue in recent elections. But some polls show that Trump is making some inroads there. I think both Oakland and Kent Counties could really be leading indicators for the rest of Michigan. In 2020, Joe Biden won those counties by combined 130,000 votes and his statewide margin was about 154,000. So Trump doesn't have to win these counties. He just needs to improve his performance by maybe 10,000 or 20,000 votes, perform a bit better than he did four years ago in Michigan's rural counties. If he does, I think he could crack Michigan. On the flip side, Harris can actually cede Biden's margin in some of these counties, Trump will have a significantly harder time outside winning.",

These are by-and-large single issue Democrats who likely won't vote for Trump. They just might not vote at all.And they're taking a very uncompromising line, that basically if a candidate doesn't meet the threshold to what they consider acceptable on Israel-Palestine, that they're just going to abstain from voting. I do think that that ignores trade-offs that sometimes you have to attack the middle to reach a second best outcome. During the Michigan primary back in February, there were more than 100,000 Democrats who voted uncommitted when Biden was the nominee. That makes up about two-thirds of the vote disparity by which Biden beat Trump in 2020. And it's not just Michigan, Kim. North Carolina as well had more than 80,000 votes come in uncommitted during the primaries in Gaza. So this is a real concern for the Harris campaign and one that they are taking very seriously. BRUNHUBER:  Yes and, you know, Gaza is one issue that she's tried to kind of distinguish herself from President Biden, although the distinction is quite slim. And it's something that keeps coming up.

Of course, she's also tethered to all of the policies of Joe Biden. I think she needs a clear, snappy response to that question. It's such an obvious one.

Kamala Harris can make this case all that she wants but she really needs to focus on policy. I just don't understand why she's getting into these games with Donald Trump about personality and kind of ad hominem criticisms. It's not reaching out to any swing voters. It's only appealing to the base of people that believe that Donald Trump is washed up, that he's tired, that he's fatigued, that he's crazy, that he's senile.

Now we just want I'll warn you, some images in this story are disturbing.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) KATIE POLGLASE, CNN INVESTIGATIVE RESEARCHER (voice-over):  Yahya Sinwar, the leader of Hamas, has been killed. But how? We looked through what the footage from the scene tells us so far. We geolocated the house where his body was found to here in the Tel al- Sultan neighborhood in Rafah, right in the south of Gaza. It's unclear clear how long Sinwar had been in the house or even this area. Back in August, the area had less destruction. You can see here some houses still standing. But during September, you can see more tank tracks through the area as the destruction grows. By October 16, the morning before he died, IDF tanks were 250 meters away. You can see them here in this satellite image surrounding the place Sinwar spent his final moments. The IDF later said they were not aware he was in the area but spotted a man fleeing from another house in the area and sent a drone to follow the fleeing man up to his new location. This video is likely the last footage where we see Sinwar alive, staring into the drone's camera from the second floor of a rubble- strewn building. Back down on street level, this IDF video shows a tank firing at the building where Sinwar is inside. We don't have any images of what happens after that. But in the next images we do have, Sinwar is dead. In this photo, visibly taken in the same location, we can see Sinwar's body surrounded by IDF soldiers. But we noticed a change in some videos we assume were taken later that reveal some details about what happened to his body. Take a closer look here at Sinwar's hand and watch. In this next video the watch has gone and one finger is missing. The pathologist who conducted the autopsy on his body told CNN his finger was taken to Israel to identify it was Sinwar. The IDF are yet to confirm this. You can also see a serious head injury in this photo. We're blurring it because it's so graphic which would fit with what the pathologist said, that it was a gunshot wound to the head that was the cause of his death. Again, the IDF are yet to confirm. For now these photos and videos are our main clues as to how this operation unfolded as the world waits to see the political consequences of his death -- Katie Polglase, CNN, London.

Federal prosecutors in California alleged that Wedding actually was the head of a massive cocaine smuggling and distribution organization that bears his name. According to investigators, large quantities of cocaine would often be smuggled into the U.S. from Mexico, often be stored in various stash houses in Los Angeles before eventually being transported to Canada, using what federal investigators describe as long-haul semi-trucks. In addition to various drug-related charges, Wedding also accused of several murder charges as well. Investigators alleging that he ordered the killing of two people in 2023 in retaliation for a stolen drug shipment and another person in May of this year to settle a drug debt. And becoming this alleged drug lord, Wedding was representing, at least represented Canada in the 2002 Olympic Winter Games in the snowboarding category in Salt Lake City. Wedding, a Canadian citizen, however, according to authorities, he last resided in Mexico. So authorities are offering currently a $50,000 reward for any information leading up to his arrest. He actually went to prison for cocaine distribution for a conviction there in 2010 but believed to have resumed trafficking under the protection of the infamous Sinaloa cartel.

And now he remains a fugitive\" -- Polo Sandoval, CNN, New York. (END VIDEOTAPE) (MUSIC PLAYING)",

It's about the size of a few grains of rice, with each side measuring just five millimeters.But yes, it actually works.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator):  I wanted to show the world the beauty of Japanese miniatures. The technology that is packed into these small things. But assembling them is the trickiest part because it has to be rotatable. If you make it too tight with no gaps, it won't move. So you need a minimum amount of space.",
