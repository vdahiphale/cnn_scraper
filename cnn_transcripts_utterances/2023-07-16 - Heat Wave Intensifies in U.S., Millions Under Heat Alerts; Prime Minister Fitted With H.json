Because we did hear from his office that he spent Friday at the Sea of Galilee which is under -- which has been under a heat advisory. There's a heatwave across this region. It's been incredibly hot. They say that on Saturday, though, he began to experience dizziness and went to the emergency room at the Sheba Medical Center which is in a suburb just east of Tel Aviv.And there they were running tests on him, they kept him overnight. They've -- he's still there right now. They've been running tests on him. They say all of the tests have turned out to be normal. However, we did just receive the statement from the head of the cardiology unit at Sheba Medical Center, saying that although they found no arrhythmia or anything like that, in his heart, and with all his heart tests are normal, they did decide to implant him with a heart monitor. I read that statement, they say, \"In order to continue routine monitoring, we decided to use a subcutaneous Holter as is customary, to allow the close medical professional team of the Prime Minister to continue regular monitoring.\" Now, what this is, as it's been described to us by the hospital spokesperson, this is a small about inch, inch and a half long, kind of looks like a -- a -- a tube of some kind that is placed just under the skin just over the heart to be able to provide continuous monitoring for an extended period of time of the heart. But as we are hearing from the Prime Minister's Office, and now from the hospital that the reason for hospitalization was dehydration, but in the course of the monitoring, in the course of the test, they did decide to insert this hot heart monitor. Now, Benjamin Netanyahu has no, no major health issues. He is 73 years old, though. This is not the first time he's been admitted to hospital for not feeling well. And now we have these really.

But expectations are low, as you say, as so many ceasefire violations have happened. The U.S. and Saudi Arabia have previously mediated this talks but they were suspended last month because the both sides agreed to ceasefire by ending to ceasefire. But in the same breath, they violate them. And then they blame each other, leading to this kind of frustrating, merry-go-round. Now, you know, fighting continues. Four people have died. We're hearing after drones hit a medical center in the city of Omdurman. And the U.N. is warning that the situation is desperate. U.N.

And so the agency and many experts in this space hope that making birth control more accessible in this way, can contribute to fewer unintended pregnancies.Now, the Opill is the same version of a daily contraceptive pill that's one that's been on the market since 1973. Although the maker stopped marketing it in recent years due to business considerations. But this one now is the same one that was approved, only now it doesn't require a prescription. It's a progestin only pill, also sometimes called the minipill, so it just includes a one hormone. It's been found to be 98% effective when used perfectly, you lose a few percentage points of that efficacy if you don't use it perfectly, i.e. not exactly at the same time every day, but still more than 90% effective. There's no age restriction on the FDA approval here. And experts tell me that's very important because it's often younger people that have trouble getting prescriptions for contraception, and so having no age restriction, could enable more people who really could benefit from this to be able to get it. The one group for whom it's contraindicated, it's not recommended to be used as people who have breast cancer or who are who have had breast cancer because this is a hormone and that can affect breast cancer risk. And one really important unanswered question right now is the price. The company has not yet announced what it will cost. It is expected to hit the market at the beginning of 2024. The company Perrigo does say, \"they're committed to ensuring that Opill is affordable and accessible to people who need it.\" Now, doctors I've spoken with, say they hope that this will be priced in an accessible way. And they point out, you know, Walmart has an option available for a prescription contraceptive that costs about $9 a month cash pay. And so they hope that perhaps this will be in the same ballpark. But we just don't know yet. You know, Perrigo has also said, it is going to seek insurance coverage for this product. But, you know, experts say this has been a 30-year quest to making contraception available over the counter. And they really hope this can make a dent in the number of unintended pregnancies in the U.S. every year. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Thanks so much for being here with me, Doctor. So we just heard there about the impact this might have. I mean, for you, how big of a deal is this?DR. DANIEL GROSSMAN, PROF. OF OBSTETRICS AND GYNECOLOGY, UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA: First of all, thanks so much for the invitation. Honestly, it's a huge deal. You know, as -- as was said, this has been decades in the making. It's really long overdue. These medications are so safe and effective. It's -- it really just makes total sense for them to be available over the counter. We know that requiring people to get a prescription can put a medically unnecessary obstacle in their way of getting effective birth control. It's hard for people to start birth control. It's hard when they run out of birth control. It's hard to get resupplied. So this is really -- it's a huge deal.",

But a recent survey found that 10% of women wouldn't be able -- or wouldn't be willing to pay any out-of-pocket costs for this type of contraception. So -- so cost is obviously a huge issue here?",

      "sentences": "Yeah, it really is. In fact, I've done research, also looking at this and found that, on average, people who are interested in using this kind of over-the-counter birth control, for adults, the most that they're willing to pay is about $15 per month. And for teens who are interested the most is about $10 per month. And once the cost goes, you know, up much beyond that, interest really falls off.So it's going to be important that Perrigo makes us available at an accessible cost. I understand that they're planning to make it -- also they're going to have a consumer assistance program for low-income people. So they'll be able to access at no cost. But really the key piece of this is also going to be insurance coverage. There are about eight states now including California that require insurance companies to cover over the counter contraceptives. And I'm hoping that that's going to just, you know, grow as -- as this gets rolled out.",

You know, as we also heard, the only condition that's, you know, really considered, like a dangerous condition for someone to take the pill is breast cancer and breast cancer is really pretty much unheard of among teenagers. So it's really safe for this population. And it's just so needed. We know that teens often have problems accessing birth control, they may have difficulty getting to a clinic, they may not want to use their parent's insurance. It's very common that they -- when they first start using birth control that they use over the counter methods. So this adds a new over the counter method that is so much more effective than the currently available over the counter methods.One other thing, I just want to point --",
