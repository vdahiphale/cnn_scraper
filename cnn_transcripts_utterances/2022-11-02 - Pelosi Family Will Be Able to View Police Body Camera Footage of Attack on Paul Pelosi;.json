The court's order said that the questioning, which was allowed by lower courts, can be limited. The grand jury, of course, is investigating efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential vote in Georgia.So, joining us now to talk about this is Georgia's Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger. He's the author of \"Integrity Counts\". He is running for reelection. And, Mr. Raffensperger, obviously, the reason that the district attorney wants to talk to Lindsey Graham is because of calls that he made to you. And so, I wonder when Senator Graham was calling you, what did you believe was the purpose behind that phone call? BRAD RAFFENSPERGER (R-GA), SECRETARY OF STATE:  He was calling about the process he had for accepting absentee ballots. Back in 2020, people wanted to make sure that that was actually being done, and there are questions about that process. I think post-2020, a lot of people are probably, you know, weren't as well-versed in election security, you know, were then starting to take a look at things and asking questions.",

Democratic gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams, though, says this is happening in spite of Georgia's new-ish voting law, SB-202, not because of, right?

We modeled it after Minnesota law which they've been using photo ID for absentee now voting for 10 years. And that really helps you identify with -- you know, enhanced security and confidence in the process. And so, we're seeing that people really feel that we have safe, secure and honest elections. And look at the numbers, we're having record turnout for early voting. People are seeing that the lines are moving quickly. We're not receiving any major issues of any -- in any area. All 159 counties are doing their job, making sure the people will have a smooth process. And we're just expecting that to continue. We've been recognized by the Center for Election Innovation researchers on the left side of the aisle and then we've also been recognized by Heritage on the right side of the aisle for having strong, accurate and elections with integrity. And that -- I think that's successful and also having the right, appropriate guardrails in place so we can identify voters. LEMON:  But just because -- listen, I've got to -- just because people are voting in record numbers, it doesn't mean there still aren't suppressive efforts and you look at what happened with the drop boxes, the number of drop boxes being reduced in certain areas, especially in Black and Brown areas, and where they can be located, and the hours that they can be located. Why isn't it important? Because it worked during the pandemic, it worked during COVID. Why isn't it important to open up as many places as possible to make it as easy possible, as many days as possible for people to be able to get out and vote?",
