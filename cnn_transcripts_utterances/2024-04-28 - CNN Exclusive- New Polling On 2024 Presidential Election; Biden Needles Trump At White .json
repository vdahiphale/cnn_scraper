I'm Manu Raju. And we begin with breaking news, a new CNN national poll released for the first time here on INSIDE POLITICS SUNDAY reveals the challenges President Biden faces as he asks voters for a second term. Even as former President Trump has been stuck in a New York courtroom fending off criminal charges and with three other criminal cases looming. Our new poll which was conducted by SSRS, finds Trump is leading Biden, who has ample work to do with his base and with independent voters, were breaking to his GOP rival. In a head-to-head race, 49 percent of voters say they'd pick Trump for president compared to 43 percent for Biden. That's a nine-point Trump advantage with independent voters. And add in third-party candidates and Trump's lead jumps even more. He has 42 percent to Biden's 33 percent. And Robert F. Kennedy Jr. gets 16 percent of the vote. Our poll also underscores the challenges of incumbency and that voters, four years later, have a better view of Trump's presidency compared to Biden's. Fifty-five percent say Trump's time in office was success, with only 39 percent saying the same about Biden's presidency. And look, for a party breakdown, more people are calling Trump's presidency is success. The now, then in January of 2021, and that was in the wake of the Capitol attack by a mob of Trump's supporters. The number of independents there going up by 7 percent. Now, Biden's team believes the numbers will change when voters begin to zero in more on the two candidates, a contrast he was more than eager to highlight that last night's White House Correspondents' Dinner.

But this is what we dive a little deeper in here about the problems with Biden in his base, Democrats, 56 percent of Democratic voters are dissatisfied with the presidential candidates there. As you look at party breakdown, that is different than Republicans, 63 percent of Republicans are satisfied, just 37 percent dissatisfies. That's the base issue. Then you talk about the number of Democrats versus Republicans, how they view the item versus Trump presidency. Seventy-three percent of Democrats view that Biden's presidency has been a success, sure. I guess that sounds good. But then you compare that to Trump's presidency. [08:05:00] More Republicans view Trump's presidency is a success. It really highlights the dual challenges that Biden faces as he has since November.",

And when you look at these numbers, Democrats view Biden worse than Republicans view Trump, which I don't think there's a surprising when you listen to what Republicans who have been saying they stand behind Donald Trump when it comes to almost anything.But the question is, how does that hurt Biden's momentum going into November? What does that look like out in the campaign trail? I do think part of it is Biden is office right now and its easier to judge someone who is president at this time. I think people always have a fonder look at a past president and how his presidency went, because whether Biden's or whether Trump's presidency was a success and how people are viewing that now is quite high. When you look at what the poll was right after January 6, truly days before Trump left office, it was much worse, much worse of an evaluation. So, it also makes me think of what's being trotted out, what's in the public domain, what are we talking about Trump's trial related to trying to overturn the election is likely not going to go to trial before the election. How does that affect what voters are thinking of?",

In particular, immigration and crime right up there as well as other issues to his gun policy, health can abortion with 42 percent of voters view that is the most important issue for them. But this is the challenge for Biden because then when you ask about how is he handling these? Big issues, he's underwater on all these main issues, and that is obviously one thing that's driving his challenges here in one of the things to, of course, is the economy as we drill down even further, inflation is still, sure, it's getting better, but people are still concerned about it. Just nine -- 29 percent of voters approve of his handling of inflation, that has not changed really since last year.",

I just got back from Wisconsin where we were on a reporting trip that we are out of the Walmart actually, which is shutting down and we were talking to people about their sense of the economy and who they blame for this economic malaise as we were kind of hearing around a lot of it was a sense that prices are higher and that that kind of tangible impact on folks pocketbooks mattered a lot more than the job increases that we have seen, that even trickled down in places like Wisconsin.And so when you're in these kind of battleground states where in places like Milwaukee, there is what 7, 8, 10 -- out of ten folks are Democrats. The questions about motivation really, but that is its really a tampering that down because people don't feel as if they've seen a real tangible benefit on the issue that matters most when we come to this, I think that attention gap is a really important thing here because oftentimes when we look at these old by them will do better among people who are most enthusiastic, most likely to vote. But when you expand the electorate out, that's where Trump actually does the best, too. And so, Biden's hope is that as that information gets out there, as they are able to target those messages, some of these people come back around, the issue is, I think some of that attention got might persist further and further through this year as people are tuning this out, Republicans had an active primary effort, right? They've re-elected, they re-nominated Trump more active simply than Democrats did. And I think for a lot of Democrats, there is a sense that this was kind a coordinated thing that they has been forced upon them and they tune some of that out, at least that's what we hear when we're on the road.",

I'm a grown man and I'm running it against a six-year-old, that is kind of how they're trying to frame it.And I should note, Trump's -- some people from Trump's campaign were in the room as these comments are being. I didn't see them laughing at this. But I do think it speaks to what this dynamic is going to look like, and how Biden is choosing to go after Trump. The Stormy Daniels comment was interesting to me. Yes, it's a joke, but Biden campaign has taken a basically a vow of silence on the Trump trial that is underway right now in Manhattan. And so, it is interesting to see him kind of allude to it in a certain way, because obviously, Trump has been trying to claim that Biden is leading these investigations, it's obviously not.

That's just presidential campaign spending in the last month and a half or so.And then when you get down to Biden's versus Trump's challenges, this is not you guys. Biden has problems with these polls, but Trump has problems with polls, too, in some of these key areas. You look at the breakdown between college grad and non-college grad in this poll, Biden -- this has been consistent all along about how Biden has an advantage with college graduates. But then you get zoom in even further about the results. How voters are voting in these primaries dates, particularly in suburban areas with some of the more educated voters. Haley's primary, Nikki Haley, his rival, she dropped out of this its race 16 percent in the last week's Pennsylvania primary, including in many suburban areas, still voted for Nikki Haley.

Donald Trump's -- the impact of Donald Trump in these trials should not be minimized. I think for some reason, there's a sense that they haven't actually heard him, but they've actually been baked into his unpopularity.For years now, he struggles with these independency struggles with these moderates. And that's cost him the last election. And it very well could cost them the next election. It is only such that because Biden has these kind of base problems, there's allowing him to steal further appallingly, but also Trump's problems have been in money, an organization, the impacts of these trials have stopped the RNC from really building out a campaign or organization. And we look at Biden's possibilities. There are issues down-ballot that they think they can still propel them. We think about the abortion referendum in Nebraska, in Arizona or new possibilities in Wisconsin, there could be a reason that the bottom of that get fuels Biden at the top, even though that lack of enthusiasm is certainly a maintaining storyline.",

He's commented on the jury itself, which is not allowed. Obviously, we saw weeks ago when he was going after the judge's daughter herself.And so, that is kind of been the big question of how the judge is going to handle that. We may get an answer this week, he held a hearing last week and some judges, former judges, retired judges, had speculated that he was writing it, you know, last week in the evenings, we never saw the decision there. They have another hearing on other violations and Trump was talking about Michael Cohen in an interview that he recorded on his way to his gag order hearing about whether or not he had violated it by talking about Michael Cohen. I mean, his disregard for it is pretty obvious and we saw how Trump's attorney struggled to defend it. But I think big picture, the campaign and how they're looking at this. I mean, look at what Bill Barr told me the other night. He is one of the biggest Donald Trump critics. He watched him as he was trying to overturn the election results and left the White House in the middle of that.
