So they do not agree to dismiss this case, but while that question is being litigated, they understand that the sentencing has to be paused.So President-elect Trump will not be sentenced next week, and the next step is the two parties will litigate this issue.

      "sentences": "Yeah, it raises all sorts of complicated legal issues, having the President-elect facing a conviction in state court and then a potential sentencing by the judge, and add on top of that the Supreme Court's decision on immunity. So those are all the factors that the prosecutors say they have taken into consideration. I mean, they say in here that they deeply respect the office of the president, that they're mindful of the demands and obligations, but they say they also deeply respect a jury's verdict.And it was 12 New Yorkers who delivered that guilty verdict for Donald Trump in May, finding him guilty on 34 counts of falsifying business records. So prosecutors are saying that they are still going to fight to maintain this conviction. So Donald Trump's team, they're saying they're OK with postponing the sentencing, so Trump's team can file their motion to dismiss, and they said they are going to oppose that. They are still asking the judge to move fairly quickly here, saying that they want to file their response to this motion on December 9th, because they are expecting this case to be appealed, no matter what the decision is, that Trump's team, if they lose, will continue to fight it through appellate courts. And so that is another reason why the District Attorney's office says that they don't oppose postponing the sentencing, because they think that would inevitably happen anyway based on how this litigation is expected to play out. So for now, Trump's sentencing is expected to be adjourned. We are still waiting for the judge to actually sign off on that. He is the one that's ultimately in control of that. It's possible Trump's team will file a response to this letter indicating if they agree with this timeline or if they're asking for how much time they should have to file this expected motion to dismiss. So we may hear from them or we may hear from the judge setting a briefing schedule in this case. But it is still the judge's call on whether to adjourn this sentencing. But with the District Attorney agreeing now for the third time that they're OK with postponing it, it is likely that the judge will agree with that as well. Guys?",

We've never had a situation anything like this.But to your question, I see two major takeaways from this filing we just got from the DA. First of all, the DA is OK with adjourning this sentencing indefinitely, which means it will not happen before he takes office, if the judge agrees. Kara makes a very important point. This is just the DA's position. Ultimately, it's up to the judge. But the second thing that really jumps out at me is the DA in this letter says what you just said, Boris, about immunity, that it doesn't necessarily cover post-trial proceedings. And so the DA floats the possibility in their letter. They say we want to look into various options, including possibly having his sentencing happen in 2029, when he's done his second term as president. To me, that is a preposterous suggestion just as a practical matter. You can't put off sentence four-plus years. I think Donald Trump would have a very strong argument when this day comes, when he's 82 years old and finishing up his second term, that that's just too long to wait. But again, this is all unknown. This is all brand new. But I found that really interesting to see that the DA is actually floating the possibility of pushing sentencing until January 21st, I guess, of 2029.",

So they believe that in some ways they have actually won this round.Now, of course, again, I am only talking about how they feel specifically, not exactly what is being said. And this is the statement that they put out. They said -- and this comes from Steven Cheung, the spokesperson for Donald Trump -- \"This is a total and definitive victory for President Trump and the American people who elected him in the landslide. The Manhattan DA has conceded that this witch hunt cannot continue. The lawless case is now stayed, and President Trump's legal team is moving to get it dismissed once and for all.\" Now, there are some things in there that are not true, but one thing that is true is that they are going to move to dismiss this case, and again, this is all part of what they saw as an overall tactic, not just with this case, but a number of cases. They wanted to delay everything past the election, and that included that sentencing. Remember, the original sentencing was supposed to be before the election. They wanted everything to be delayed because they thought that if he could win, which, of course, we now know he did, that it would be a lot easier to get rid of, to dismiss these various cases, whether it be through running the Department of Justice or through now these concerns and questions about sentencing a President-elect, and after inauguration, the president of the United States. So they believe they have a strong case now to actually dismiss this, and they will be moving forward with that. Of course, as we've been reporting, this is all going to be in the hands of the judge. This is just the first action. However, Donald Trump's team feels very good right now.",

And I know that can be frustrating for people. How can somebody who's been convicted of one crime and indicted four times face no consequences while the clock ran out? And if you want to apportion blame for why the clock ran out, let's remember when these cases were indicted. It took two and a half years, over two and a half years, for DOJ to get these things indicted. And by that point, I wrote well in advance of that, the clock's already run out. Merrick Garland just doesn't realize it yet. Well, here we are, and the clock's run out. So this is our system in progress. It's highly imperfect. And as Carrie was saying, we like to say no person is above the law in this country. But the fact is, one person largely is, and that's the president, because of the immunity ruling and because of the DOJ policy that Paula and Carrie were just talking about.

Congresswoman, thank you so much for being with us.Let's start with this pick to lead the Department of Justice, Matt Gaetz. This is a pick that you've celebrated and defended, even against criticism from fellow Republicans. I want to get your response to this attorney for the two women who testified before the House Ethics Committee saying that Gaetz paid them for sex over ten times during a two-year period. One of them alleging that Gaetz unknowingly had sex with an underage woman at one point. All allegations that he has denied. Have you been able to review their testimony? How much of it have you seen? REP. ANNA PAULINA LUNA (R-FL): I've been able to get first-hand knowledge from the Department of Justice and FBI once they came out and acquitted Gaetz and actually dropped their investigation into him because they found that all those allegations, as you had just stated, were actually unfounded. You know, I really would appreciate it if networks would cover the fact that this was also tied to a $25 million extortion scheme against Matt Gaetz and his father. And to furthermore, you know, I find it interesting that these actual allegations come out at peculiar timing. While he's being nominated to be the Attorney General, to be clear, I do think Matt Gaetz is going to be an incredible Attorney General. I think this baseless smear campaign, frankly, is abhorrent that it's happening to someone like Matt Gaetz who's done so much to fight the government corruption.

I had a reporter come up to me and ask me how many members of Congress I had had sex with, also alleging that I had a relationship with Matt Gaetz, which was categorically false.
