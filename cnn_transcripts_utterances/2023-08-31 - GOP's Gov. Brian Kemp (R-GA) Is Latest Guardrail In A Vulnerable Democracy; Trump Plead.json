Tonight, I will speak with a former Proud Boy who knew the two extremists who were just sentenced more than a decade behind bars today for sedition on January 6th. And don't miss this conversation. But, first, we have another extraordinary example of the guardrails holding up in a vulnerable democracy. We've seen the examples in recent years, the military refusing to use force after the election, the courts refusing to accept bogus arguments without evidence, the election workers who quietly and heroically ensured the integrity of those ballots and the voters who showed up in massive numbers to speak their voices, finally, the states where many in both parties did reject efforts to undo the will of those very voters, and that includes the state of Georgia, where Republicans fought off attempts to undermine democracy. And today it happened again, Republican Governor Brian Kemp rejecting efforts in his state to impeach Fani Willis. That's the prosecutor who's charged Donald Trump in 18 of his allies. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV. BRIAN KEMP (R-GA):  Up to this point, I have not seen any evidence that D.A. Willis' actions or lack thereof weren't actioned by the prosecuting attorney oversight commission. In my mind, a special session of the General Assembly to end, run around this law is not feasible and may ultimately prove to be unconstitutional. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

She's the president of Restoring Integrity and Trust in Elections. May, Judge Chutkan in the election interference case did say that the former president's lawyers should have been prepared for this moment. That was the federal case.

It is a notice that Fani Welles filed yesterday saying, hey, FYI, when you ask for a speedy trial, it means that defendants are not given the rights that they normally would as far as given evidence in advance, being able to bring witnesses at the last moment. So, there are all these procedural protections that defendants don't get. And Trump basically says it's not fair for that to apply to me because I'm not requesting a speedy trial.

And I think that's very understandable.But how does that change what Trump presents? I don't think it helps in a good way. I think all of a sudden now we are re-litigating all of the flaws, minor and major, in Georgia, rather than focusing on, for example, the elements of a RICO crime, the elements of what it requires to have knowledge in false statements, that sort of thing, so it changes the legal argument re-litigating the election.",

They stood before a judge. They begged for mercy, both of them military veterans. One cried saying he was seduced by the crowd and he's not a terrorist and that he wants to walk his daughter to school. Another, also emotional, said he's done with politics. He's done peddling these lies for other people and he apologized for his actions. And in turn, the judge admonished them, calling those actions a national disgrace, calling their testimony utterly inconceivable and saying they dishonored the very uniform that they once wore and the rights that people around the world would give anything for. That judge sentenced Proud Boy leader Joe Biggs to 17 years in prison and former Marine Zach Rehl to 15 years. And my next guest is very familiar with both of them. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And when the Republicans make their nomination in Milwaukee, he's then going to be compared to the alternative. And that's not going to look very good. So, I'll make a couple of comments.First, I think Biden's done a really good job as president, whether you like him or not. And I don't know him particularly well. This is the first president I haven't known quite well for a long time on the Democratic side. And even on the Republican side, I knew George W. pretty well. But -- so, I'd say Biden's done a really good job, if you judge him just on his merits. Secondly, I think the suggestion of a ticket, this ticket is fantastic for 2028. I mean, I'm a huge fan of Gretchen Whitmer. I think it's a long past time to have a woman president in this country, and she'd be one of my most leading candidates.

He's been divorced for 14 years when he decided to run in 1992.But some aren't too keen on Senator Scott being a bachelor in this cycle. Axios is reporting that some Republican donors want some more details about his single status before they decide how much to support him in this race. The 57-year-old remain pretty quiet about his love life and he's previously referenced a girlfriend but he's kept her identity private. Now, an advisor says that he plans to address concerns around his single status in the coming weeks. I want to bring in the \"The Root\" Senior Reporter Jessica Washington along with Pollster Lee Carter. Ladies, Senator Scott has talked about this girlfriend, he's kept it private. Apparently, that's not enough, even for his own donors. And I do wonder, Lee, I mean, do you think this is an issue more for Republican voters?
