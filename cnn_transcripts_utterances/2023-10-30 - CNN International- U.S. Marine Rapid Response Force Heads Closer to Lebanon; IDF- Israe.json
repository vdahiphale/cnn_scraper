      "sentences": "We have been watching very closely as the U.S. has sent considerable forces to the Middle East, to U.S. Central Command. That includes not only the land forces, nearly 1,000 troops, as well as patriot battalions and a THAAD battery -- those are air defense systems. But of course the Naval troops as well. One carrier strike group with the Gerald R. Ford Aircraft Carrier is already in the Eastern Med. Another carrier strike group passed to the Strait of Gibraltar a couple days ago and it's on its way in that direction.We've also been watching an amphibious ready group, the USS Bataan, which is an amphibious assault ship And a Marine rapid response force, The 26th Marine Expeditionary Unit, or MEW for short. Over the course of the past several weeks, they've been operating in the waters of the Middle East, but according to two U.S. officials, they're now in the Red Sea on their way to the Eastern Med. First, that it's a tremendous show of U.S. power in the waters off the coast of Israel and Lebanon. A clear message to Iran and Iranian proxies not to get involved. And that message we've seen said explicitly from President Joe Biden on down -- in the U.S. national security chain essentially. But the MEW, that Marine Rapid Response Force also serves another purpose. It is special operations capable, which is certainly notable and worth remembering, but it's also a critical force in a non combatant evacuation operation or a NEO. That's one of its mission essential tasks. Now the U.S. said last week that there was no indication or execution for a NEO, an evacuation right now, but John Kirby, the National Security Council's spokesperson, said it would be irresponsible and imprudent not to plan for contingency operations, including an evacuation. Since he said that the U.S. has said the risk of this conflict spreading wider in the region is growing and remains a serious consideration for the U.S. Meanwhile, the U.S. State Department, the embassy in Beirut has advised Americans to leave now before a crisis has begun there. There has been some contact between Israel and Hezbollah along the Israel Lebanese border. It has not escalated too much, but any contact, any exchange of fire on that border -- which is already volatile as is -- is certainly noteworthy. And that's what the U.S. is watching to see if that escalates. If it does, those are the situations in which things can quickly get out of hand and where the conflict in Gaza, which the U.S. is trying to keep separate, can quickly and violently spread to the rest of the region. So that perhaps one of the reasons that Marine Rapid Response Force is there in case the U.S. looks at the situation and looks at the possibility of the necessity for an evacuation. If the situation deteriorates. Oren Liebermann, CNN, at the Pentagon. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Thanks so much for joining us this morning -- this evening where you are, Sir, I'd like to start by discussing what you think now, the risk of horizontal escalation is, especially as we've been hearing from the IDF about, according to them, Israel striking targets of military infrastructure in Syria now, as well as Lebanon.",

I think if Hezbollah intervenes in a significant level beyond what it's doing now, then I think it's almost unavoidable to see the war spread geographically beyond what is currently the focus on Gaza. You would see then northern Israel come into play. You would see Iran come into play and Iranian controlled militias and terrorist organizations across the region come into play. So we go very quickly from a war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza to aregional Middle Eastern war that potentially would then bring in the United States directly on the ground.",

To make it clear to Tehran that any intervention by Hezbollah or by their -- the Iranians sponsor controlled militias and terrorist organizations would be unacceptable and bring about a devastating response.And then it really gets down to the calculations of the government in Tehran as to are they prepared to risk that wider war. They talk about an axis of resistance. Well, are they really prepared to go to war with the United States, with Israel, potentially with other U.S. allies and probably see the end of their regime. Or are they prepared to back down and avoid such a conflict? So it really does come down then to what the regime in Tehran decides.",

In your view as a counter terrorism strategy in terms of eradicating this group, how effective is Israel's retaliation? Because I'm constantly reminded of that analogy. The Hydra head in terms of the anatomy of terrorism. You know, you get rid of certain terrorists and then that just generates more in their place because of anger and tragedy and frustration.",

      "sentences": "Yes, look, from a purely military perspective, Israel can certainly do immense damage to Hamas. They can destroy their fighting forces on the ground, which are limited in numbers. They can attack their leadership and their command and control. They can attack their logistics. So they can rip apart Hamas as an organization. But if they in doing so, if they then inflict heavy civilian casualties amongst the Palestinian population, that's only going to radicalize the Palestinian people and you could see the, the, the emergence of new heads in that Hydra.So I think that essentially what the Israelis have to do is somehow defeat Hamas. Deter Iran and deter Hezbollah and at the same time engage with the Palestinian people at a humanitarian level to try and ensure that a son of Hamas or a son of Islamic State doesn't reemerge. That's going to be almost impossible to do given the circumstances. I can't see any path really to achieve that goal. So sadly, I think that even if Israel is successful against Hamas, they don't necessarily win the peace.",

He seems to be referring to Turkey's past in the Ottoman Empire and seems to be seeking a return to those days in the same way. For example, that Putin seeks a return to the glory of the former Russian Empire.So if Turkey has, you know, see an imperialist opportunity here, they need to think twice. Because any move by Turkey to support Hamas -- and by definition, extension Iran -- could seriously destabilize NATO's southern plank at a really crucial point in terms of Ukraine.

His body is now with the LA County Medical Examiner's office and an autopsy is pending. But normally a complete autopsy and toxicology report takes several weeks. Now Perrys family released a statement to \"People\" magazine saying they're heartbroken by the tragic loss of a beloved son and brother. They went on to say that he brought joy to the world as an actor and also as a friend. Matthew Perry wanted to be remembered as someone who helped people, and it's part of the reason why he shared his addiction struggles in his memoir that was released in November of 2022. He said he wanted to help people individually or as a group and shared this in many interviews that he'd done. He also said that he wanted to be remembered as someone who lived well and someone who loved well, someone who was a seeker. But many of course remember him by his acting career. He started with small roles and then landed more prominent roles. But it was really, his role as Chandler that made him famous. It was that funny, very sarcastic character that many are remembering today. The cast of Friends very close on and off the screen. And many here in Hollywood remembering him and reacting saying they are devastated, that they are heartbroken and that they are in shock. And many saying this is a big loss for Hollywood, but also for his fans. Camila Bernal, CNN, Los Angeles. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
