      "sentences": "Yes. So the capitol physician said that McConnell underwent a comprehensive neurology assessment, which included multiple rounds of tests.Our Manu Raju reported that McConnell saw four different neurologists and physicians concluded that McConnell did not suffer a stroke or a seizure. I want to read you a key line from his letter to McConnell. He said, \"There is no evidence that you have a seizure disorder or that you experienced a stroke, TIA or movement disorder such as Parkinson's disease. There are no changes recommended in treatment protocols as you continue recovery from your March 2023 fall.\" This letter comes on top of another one that McConnell's office released last week saying that he was medically cleared to return to work. Clearly, his team trying to be more transparent about his health and end all the speculation about his health and his political future. Of course, he is also trying to put on a front of business as usual and carry on with his normal routine. We are expected to hear from him. He will deliver his weekly remarks here on the Senate floor. He will also have some leadership meetings later tonight. And then tomorrow, he is going to face the press and reporters once again at his weekly press conference. And perhaps, most critically, he is going to face his own members for the first time since that freezing episode behind closed doors at their weekly party luncheon. So I'm sure this topic will come up. We'll see he also addresses it publicly. I'm sure he will be asked about it at the press conference. But it remains to be seen whether this is going to be enough to really quell the questions and concerns about his health and about his ability to lead -- Boris?",

A federal court has struck down Alabama's latest attempt at a congressional redirecting map.In fact, the panel of three judges not only rejected that map, but rebuked those behind it for flat-out ignoring what has been ordered by higher courts. The judges, two of whom were appointed by Donald Trump. So the new map did not create a second majority black district as, we should note, the Supreme Court had ordered earlier this year. Remember, this battle and ones in other states could determines who controls the House, which, right now, Republicans have under a very thin majority. But a whole host of other legal effects here. CNN senior Supreme Court analyst, Joan Biskupic, joins us now. Joan, the Supreme Court already said months ago you have to re-write this map. They refused to do it.",

The reason these three judges were so angry today because the state of Alabama has defied not only this three-judge panel, which originally ruled that the state had deluded the voting power of blacks in the state, but also it defied the Supreme Court.This all started about two years ago when Alabama drew a map that a lower court found deluded the black voting power of people in the state. The voters challenged the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court let that map take effect for the 2022 elections, but then came back in June of this year and said it agreed with that three-judge panel and ordered it to go back and draw a new map. Well, the state didn't. It still has one black majority district out of seven in a state that is 27 percent black. And here's what -- let me tell you what -- (CROSSTALK)",

And this is the attorney general, Steve Marshall. \"While we are disappointed in today's decision, we strongly believe the legislature's map complies with the Voting Rights Act and the recent decision of the U.S. Supreme Court. \"We intend to promptly seek review from the Supreme Court to ensure that the state can use its lawful congressional district's map in 2024 and beyond.\" You know what the lower court has done here?

But the Osage county sheriff wanted to solve unsolved crimes in his area. He believed Dennis Rader could have played that role. So he obtained that journal. And we began talking, and he released exclusively to CNN these pictures of these girls in barns. As you can see, they are bound. We released it Friday night on Anderson Cooper's show, an extensive visual piece over the weekend. And over the weekend, they got many calls, many tips. And they do now believe that they are able to identify the girl that is, as you can see, in green. No more information at this time. It will be a busy week for them. But they believe these are real victims because of the detail in the faces. Just like you said, Brianna, because of the clothing and the color of the clothing. And they also believe there are ornate aspects to these barns, and they are asking anyone in the Oklahoma/Kansas state line area, look at the barns you have. Maybe the barns have been torn down. Now Kerri Rawson, she is the daughter of Dennis Rader, BTK. She has stepped forward currently to Osage County, Oklahoma, to volunteer her services because she knew her father better than anyone.

SANCHEZ: Now to some of the other headlines we're watching this afternoon. Some schools in the northeast set to begin their first day back today are closed or dismissing students early as extreme heat bakes the region. Some areas around Baltimore and Washington could reach around 100 degrees for the first time in several years. And the near record- breaking temperatures are set to linger for the rest of the week. Right now, more than 50 million people are under heat alerts across much of the central and eastern U.S. Meantime, overseas, Hong Kong's high court ordered the city's government to set up a new framework to legally recognize the rights of same-sex couples. It is a partial victory for LGBTQ activists because it stops short of their demands for full marriage equality. Hong Kong does not allow or grant same-sex marriage or unions. Even though homosexuality has been decriminalized in the city since 1991. The government now has two years to comply with the court's ruling. And in Europe, a 22-year-old German tourist has been detained in Italy for allegedly damaging a 16th century statue of Neptune. You're watching the incident caught on security footage. If you can make it out, investigators say the man climbed over a barrier and stood on the statue to pose for pictures taken by friends. When he tried to get down, a piece of marble broke off the statue. Officials are now saying the man will face charges. A bone headed move there. Jim?",
