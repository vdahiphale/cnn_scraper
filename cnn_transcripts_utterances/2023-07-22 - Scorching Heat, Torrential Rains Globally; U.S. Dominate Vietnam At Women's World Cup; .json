The group called Love for the Missing and Tamaulipas Collective says they made the discovery after receiving an anonymous tip through its Facebook page. The mass graves were located on a private property in the city of Reynosa near the Texas border town of Hidalgo. The Mexican attorney general's office announced originally that it was 27 bodies, later adding one more victim to the count. It has launched an investigation. And while forensic experts are working to identify the bodies as horrible and gruesome as it sounds, the Mexican state of Tamaulipas has a long history of cartel violence. As you may remember, this is the same state where four Americans were kidnapped at gunpoint then marched with two of them dying in the attack. Several mass graves have also been found in the border state over the years. In 2010, 72 migrants from Central and South America were massacred by a cartel in San Fernando a few hours from Tamaulipas border. It's not unusual for relatives and friends of those missing to take matters into their own hands and try to find their loved ones by themselves because many feel authorities aren't doing enough.

So that's another possibility. He has been saying that he wants the country to go forward, not backward to the conservative policies. The economy is looking good in the macro terms. The inflation is down, employment is up. But even the socialist admits that the -- many of the average Spaniards are not feeling that in their pocketbooks right at home.

But the United States team was the heavy favorite here.They started the tournament with a solid win. A little bit to improve on but, overall, a good effort. They did possess the ball for the majority of the 3-0 win. It certainly didn't take Sophia Smith long to make an impact in her World Cup debut, driving the ball into back of the net to open up the scoring in just the 14th minute. She did strike again deep in stoppage time at the end of the first half for her second goal of the game. It was tight score-wise at that point. She's just shy of 23. She became the second youngest player in U.S. Women's team history to score multiple goals in a World Cup game. Megan Rapinoe came in as a substitute in the 61st minute for Team U.S., becoming the first 14th player to reach a milestone for her nation. And captain Lindsey Horan added a goal of her own. This was a sigh of relief, a little breathing room in the 77th minute, to officially put the game away. The U.S. will next face the Netherlands on Wednesday night here stateside in their second group E game. That's a rematch of the 2019 World Cup finals. So it gets more challenging from here. But while much of the focus was on the United States, there are a lot of other games being played at the Women's World Cup, of course. England in action now against Haiti. Another team making their tournament debut. The Lionesses are one of favorites, looking to follow up last summer's Euros triumph with another big win here. Right now at 0-0. Things underway in the first half of that game. Earlier, 2011 Women's World Cup champions, Japan, taking care of business against Zambia. Japan rolling to a 5-0 win over the lowest ranked team to ever qualify for the tournament at number 77 in the world. Japan has been on a roll as of late, now winning four of their last five games, including against Olympic champion Canada in February, she believes, cup (ph). So a lot to look forward to.",

I mean, his profitability, the fandom, everything has pointed to this.And seven months after winning the men's World Cup, the seven-time FIFA player of the year delivers one of these signature magical Messi moments. He curls in the free kick strike from outside the box in the 94th minute. That's what the crowd wanted to see. More than 20,000 going absolutely wild. And that would turn out to be the game winner in this 2-1 victory over Mexico's Cruz Azul. After the game, he said, he saw the goal, he knew he had to score and he felt an intensity. Everybody was waiting for that. I loved David Beckham just shaking their head, like that's what we brought him for.",

He championed songwriters who might otherwise have remained unknown to many millions of music fans.\"Elton John said, quote, \"So sad to hear of Tony's passing. Without doubt, the classiest singer, man and performer you will ever see. He is irreplaceable. I loved and adored him. Condolences to Susan, Danny and the family.\" Tony Bennett made a big impact on fellow singers as well. Harry Connick Jr. and Michael Buble spoke to CNN about what they'll remember about their friend. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) HARRY CONNICK JR., SINGER AND ACTOR: I've known Tony for years, probably since I was a teenager. I think when he came through New Orleans was the first time I met him. And I just remember him aside from -- we could talk for hours about what an unbelievable musical talent he was but he was so nice to me, always so kind; his arms were always open. And I just have a lot of laughs when I think about it, because he was the kind of guy -- I would love to have him come on stage and sing with me. But you also had to be careful because you knew who was going to get the most applause and it wasn't going to be me. (END VIDEO CLIP) MICHAEL BUBLE, GRAMMY AWARD-WINNING SINGER: He has changed the face of music and it's not just in the beautiful country of America or even North America, including Canada; it is worldwide. I mean, listen, I toured nearly 50 countries this year and there's not a place -- there's not a language spoken that doesn't love him and that won't love him forever. He'll become part of all our lives in wonderful moments, when we get married or when we fall in love, to difficult moments, you know, when we're saying goodbye to one another. He's just become a part of culture. (END VIDEO CLIP)",
