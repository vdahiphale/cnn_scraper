MOSQUERA (voice-over): Destruction is everywhere. Even though it has been more than a week since all this area got flooded, we can still see piles of cars, debris all around, and collapsed bridges. GONZALEZ (through translator): Approximately 20 people were rescued with this helicopter, a number that gets bigger if we keep in mind the work done by other five helicopters that have participated in search- and-rescue operations. So, the volume of people rescued is significant. MOSQUERA (voice-over): Nevertheless, it's been days since the last person they rescued alive. Nowadays, they are focusing on the mouth of the Turia (ph) River and Valencia's lagoon to check if any of those missing were swept out to sea. GONZALEZ (through translator): If the mud has buried them, we cannot see them anymore. So, what we do is wait for ground teams to notify us any finding. Then, we take them out with the crane. MOSQUERA (voice-over): The search is intense, but there's nothing new in the area. So after an hour hovering around, we get back to the airport base. This will be it for now, but in a matter of hours, they will get back to the skies until, as they say, every single missing person has been found. Pau Mosquera, CNN, Manises, Spain.

HOLMES: Prosecutors say three people are facing preliminary, but so far not formal, charges in the death of the beloved singer Liam Payne. A hotel employee and a suspected drug dealer are among those being investigated for abandonment before death and supplying narcotics. As tributes continue for the former member of the band One Direction, tests suggest he may have been semi-conscious or unconscious when he fell from that hotel balcony in Argentina. He did have alcohol, cocaine, and an antidepressant in his system. Now, amid slowing inflation and a cooling job market, the U.S. economy is set to face a new direction under a new administration. The U.S. Federal Reserve is cutting interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point, the new rate, now between 4.5 and 4.75 percent. This coming as the Federal Reserve chair says he will serve the rest of his term, even if the president-elect has other plans. CNN's Julia Chatterley, with more on that. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",
