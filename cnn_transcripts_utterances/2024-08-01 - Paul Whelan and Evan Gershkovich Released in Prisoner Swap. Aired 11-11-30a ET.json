      "sentences": "And good morning. I'm Erin Burnett in New York.And we do have breaking news today, significant news and incredible news for some American families. Let's just show you live images of an airport in Ankara, Turkey, where the story centers this morning, afternoon there. The president's office in Turkey confirms that they are mediating a massive prisoner exchange, an historic day involving 26 people from seven countries, the U.S. and Russia obviously chief among them. We are told that two of those prisoners are children. This would be the largest prisoner swap between the United States and Russia since the end of the Cold War, a day in history. And we have just moments ago also learned from Turkey that two of the best-known Americans held in Russia have been exchanged already as part of this ongoing, fraught moment that we are all witnessing, \"The Wall Street Journal\" reporter Evan Gershkovich, who was detained more than 15 months ago and just last month in Russia sentenced to 16 years in a penal colony. Also freed today, Marine veteran Paul Whelan. He has been held the longest, we believe, of the prisoners involved today, more than five- and-a-half years in a penal colony eight hours outside of Moscow. The U.S, of course, has denounced the convictions of both Whelan and Gershkovich. Far from espionage, they are political prisoners. CNN crews are in place across the world, working their sources, bringing you the latest details as this is happening as we are speaking. I want to go straight to Alex Marquardt. And, Alex, you have been breaking so many of the details today, and I know you have some new information at this moment about the CIA's involvement. What are you learning?",

      "sentences": "Yes, Erin, this was obviously a multipronged effort by the Biden administration to get these Americans home, but leading the charge, I'm told, at least in a very big way, was the CIA and the CIA director, Bill Burns.Years ago they established what they're calling an intelligence channel between U.S. intelligence and Russian intelligence, and this is the channel through which these negotiations happened. This is according to a U.S. official. Now, sometimes that could take place physically in person, meetings between U.S. and Russian intelligence officers. That could also take place on the phone. I'm told that for what we're seeing unfold today that, in late June, there was a meeting in a third country that this U.S. official declined to tell me, and that meeting was between Russian and U.S. intelligence officials, at which point the U.S. put forward this latest proposal. It was accepted a few days later in early July. That was on a phone call between Russian intelligence and the CIA director, Bill Burns. It was accepted in principle, I should say, and then it was formally accepted in mid-July through that same channel. Now, we don't exactly know who's on the other side of those meetings on the Russian side, but you can certainly assume that it would be a counterpart or several counterparts of Bill Burns and his top deputies from the Russian security services. So, the CIA playing a pivotal role in all of this. One of your previous guests also mentioned Roger Carstens. He is the top State Department official in charge of hostage negotiations. So when the U.S. declares that Americans around the world have been wrongfully detained, he and his team leap into action and jump-start the negotiations. But because so much of the U.S. and Russian relationship is based in the security world, U.S. intelligence did take a leading role when it came to the negotiations about these prisoners and the release today, Erin.",

I will say, an enormous amount of relief, I'm told by someone who's with the families, right now, an enormous amount of joy, annihilation, anticipation, but also nervousness right up to the final moment, because these are families who have been victim to really the unjust detention of their loved ones for months, in some cases years, but also repeated disappointments, right, when they thought that there might be a deal that was closed, and then they were disappointed. Or, in the case of some families, Paul Whelan, for instance, they thought they would be part of a previous exchange and were not part of that exchange when you go back to, for instance, the Brittney Griner exchange. So, elation, but also nervousness mixed in with that, as they await to see the pictures of their loved ones and speak to their loved ones on the phone and then get the moment to sit down with the president as well.",

And that moment, we anticipate, will happen as those families, we understand, will have time with the president of the United States today, and he may address all of this.Matthew Chance is in London. Matthew, when you think about how all this happened -- and I referenced some changes at the FSB's Fifth Service. You also have as so central to this, we know Vladimir Putin wanted the return of an assassin who was serving a life sentence in Germany, the name Krasikov, and that there were some in the German government who did not want to do this. And all these pieces and players had to come into place at the right time with the right conversations for this to happen. But yet, ultimately, Matthew, Vladimir Putin had to say yes. And why do you think he said yes now?",

      "sentences": "I think this is a great deal for Vladimir Putin.He has managed to basically get back a Kremlin assassin, a colonel in the FSB who killed in broad daylight a Chechen dissident in the center of the German capital, in exchange -- as well as a lot of other people as well who Russia is interested in and may have information that Russia wants to keep to itself and not be disclosed to its rivals, in exchange for a group of individuals who, for all intents and purposes, did nothing wrong. People like Evan Gershkovich, who was doing his job as a journalist. He was accused and convicted of espionage of spying for the CIA, but he categorically denied it, as did the U.S. government. Paul Whelan as well, this former Marine who's been in a Russian jail for the best part of the past six years, he was in Moscow attending a wedding, and he was accused and convicted and sentenced to 16 years of spying as well. So, yes, this is a big tactical victory on the part of the United States. They're bringing these people home, but, strategically, this is a vindication, I think, for Vladimir Putin of his strategy of taking bargaining chips and using them to extract as big a concession as possible from the United States and from the West at large. And so this is an important day, it's an emotional day, but it's also a day that has involved a substantial amount of moral compromise on the part of the West to get these people back.",

      "sentences": "Yes, no doubt about it, Erin. I mean, this was a quite sophisticated operation.I'm told by a source familiar with the matter that Ismail Haniyeh was assassinated in Tehran early yesterday morning using a bomb that was covertly hidden in the guest house where he was staying. But this bomb, I'm told, was actually covertly planted inside that guest house about two months ago, and it was only remotely detonated once it was clear that Ismail Haniyeh, Hamas' political leader, was actually inside his room inside of that guest house. When that bomb was detonated, he was killed, alongside his bodyguard, who was also there. Now, we should note that Israel has still neither confirmed nor denied its involvement in this. Iranian officials and Hamas have said that Israel was behind this attack. I'm also told that Israel -- Israeli officials actually briefed U.S. officials on this operation, but only after it took place, only after we learned that Ismail Haniyeh had been killed in this. What's also interesting here is that this guest house was actually under the control of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. And so this represents a stunning breach of security for them, a very big embarrassment for the IRGC. And we have reached out to Iranian officials for comments on this, but we know, of course, that we heard yesterday from Iran's supreme leader, vowing revenge, saying that Israel has -- quote -- \"paved the way for your harsh punishment.\" This assassination has put this region a knife's edge, in addition, of course, to the Israeli strike in Beirut, just hours before this that took out a senior Hezbollah commander. There are now threats of retaliation, not only from Iran, but also from Hezbollah and Hamas, putting this region and this area where I am right now in Northern Israel very much on edge as the possibility of retaliation now looms -- Erin.",

But I think one clear failure of security here is the fact that this guest house, the reason why this bomb was planted there is because it was a guest house where Ismail Haniyeh was known to have stayed. And so this indicates that Haniyeh was a repeat guest in this same location, which is obviously a security -- a major security vulnerability that the Israelis appear to have exploited here. And so we don't know exactly how this happened, but there's no question that there will be major questions asked within the IRGC, within Iran's top political and military echelons about how this could have possibly happened. And I also think it's notable that, yesterday, Iranian state media was reporting that this was a rocket that was fired from outside into this guest house that actually killed Haniyeh. But the fact that it was actually something that was planted in the guest house suggests even additional layers of failure.",

So let's just say it in black and white. That means a human being is involved who's in Tehran who actually gets access to this guest house and plants something. At some point, there is a human being infiltration, which is different than what Jeremy's saying they had originally been put out there about a rocket or a drone, right, which could be completely done remotely. That shows actual physical human involvement, Colonel.",

And it's really a classic case of, in essence, a clandestine operation.These are the kinds of operations you would have seen the British conduct in World War II with a special operations executive in Europe. You would have seen the OSS, the forerunner of the CIA, doing stuff like this also in that conflict. And the Mossad has a history of doing things of this type in various countries around the world. And, of course, Iran is a prime target. We know a lot about the -- many of the nuclear scientists who have been killed in Iran ostensibly by the Israelis. That kind of operation and the fact that these things are continuing and that there's such a significant penetration of IRGC security at a guest house that is frequented by people like Haniyeh, that really shows that, as Jeremy said, there's a significant weakness in their security apparatus, and they really didn't take care of things.",
