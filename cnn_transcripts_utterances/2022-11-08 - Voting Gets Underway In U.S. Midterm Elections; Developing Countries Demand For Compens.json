Tonight is election day herein the United States and President Biden's political agenda hangs in the balance. We are live on the ground for you as the nation takes to the poll. Then, demands for compensations at COP27 grow louder. Developing nations say the richer countries should pay the price for the damage caused by climate change. Plus, colder temperatures in Ukraine mean more emergency blackouts. We'll explain why energy companies there are having to make tough choices. Just hours from now, polls will begin to close in the United States where voters are casting ballots that will have consequences for several years to come. So much is at stake in this critical midterm elections, including the balance of power in Washington. Control of Congress is also at play, and the outcome will affect both domestic and foreign policy. Historically in the U.S. midterms, the president's party loses ground to the opposition. If Republicans do make big gains here, they could completely paralyze Joe Biden's political agenda. The election is seen as a referendum of sorts on his government. Though not all voters share the top concerns. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

President Bill Clinton and President Barack Obama. So they don't feel like this is a definitive determination on whether or not the president can actually move forward. One thing, though, Zain, that I would say is that they recognize that this is going to have a major impact on the president's agenda going forward.

That burst of enthusiasm has started to wane over the course of the last several months. And to some degree, that underscores just the sheer force of the primary headwind Democrats have been facing. Inflation. When inflation is at a four-decade high, Americans see it. When they go to the grocery store, when they go to the gas station, every single day, it's in front of their face. Very few things are able to overcome that. And while abortion is certainly an issue Democrats will be voting on, it's certainly an issue that's motivated Democratic voters.

Some of them, they're telling us, really are almost disoriented, is how they describe it. That they are not aware that they're actually on a battlefield, they're over-flown by drones and they don't know how to respond to the drones. So, they see these new recruits as, you know, very - - having a very high casualty rate. They're the ones in the frontlines shooting at them.

It is an unheard of attrition rate, and it's -- as I say, that case is not alone.

And the African Americans are going to point out, listen, were it not for the Black vote back two years ago, you would not be president. And you need us to get -- the whole party needs us to have a Black person there. So if it's not Joe Biden, it really ought to be Kamala Harris. That's going to be a view from a lot of the Black community and has a lot of legitimacy to it. However, there are a lot of people, Black and white, who are familiar with Kamala Harris, know her and do not think she's the right candidate for the job. They like her, they respect her but they feel that she doesn't bring quite the gravitas and the seriousness that they think is necessary for that.",

I think those two early on. But really, over time, over the next 24, 48, you know, we are going to have to wait two or three days to know how some of these states go. But I'm going to be looking more and more for the outliers. Nobody thought North Carolina was going to be in play, when a black woman (ph)  -- if things go well in Georgia, in the Black community, she could very easily pull it off. It could really be an upset. There are a number of people around like that that I think make this one of the wilder and least predictable races I can remember. And yet it's so consequential. It's a very consequential election and it will determine probably who the nominee, if not the nominees will be in two years. But it also is going to determine, can Joe Biden, if he has two years left with the House gone and maybe the Senate, can he govern? And are we going to have more disruptions coming from the Trump people? One scary thought is this:  the people have figured out that they can possibly have it both ways are the Trump people. If Trump does badly in this election, they are going to say, we were ahead, look at all the polls and it got stolen. And that just revs people up even more on their side. On the other hand, if Trump does well, then they're going to be claiming with some legitimacy, hey, our hard nosed, tough tactics people don't like are paying off. We are now, you know, we are in the lead here. If we went back to the House and Senate as conservatives with Trump at the top of the ticket, that's a big, big win for Trump. But it also is hugely determinative. The rest of the world will look at that and say, oh my God, I really thought you guys wouldn't do that. The rest of the world will be caught, you know, is the U.S. still a well anchored country or not? But people are going to be looking closely at these results because they have so much -- so many consequences for the years ahead.",

We've had two organizations that have been covering the protestsover the past couple of months now very extensively, really, reporting that their staff members are facing very serious threats from the Revolutionary Guard Corps and from the Iranian regime. As you mentioned, Iran International, this is a 24-hour news channel based in London. And they say that two of their British Iranian journalists have been notified by the Metropolitan Police of threats they say that represent a credible, significant and imminent danger to their lives and the lives of their families. Now Iran International has said that they have been warned over the past few weeks. There have been warnings issued by the IRGC for the channel's coverage. We also know that the regime has been singling out and accusing Iran International of trying to push forward foreign agendas, accusing them of really representing the Saudi agenda, saying that they're funded by Saudi. We know there have been reports in the past that the network is Saudi funded, something that Iran International has denied. And at the same time, Zain, we're hearing from hangout network for human rights, organization for human rights, who I know you've interviewed their staff members in the past. They've been doing really important and critical work over the past few weeks, reporting on the protests and documenting the crackdowns, especially in the Kurdish region of Iran. They say that two of their staff members, who are based in northern Iraq, in the Kurdish region there, have been facing increasing and serious risks, threats by the IRGC. And they're calling on Iraq's Kurdish and Kurdistan regional government to protect these employees. Zain, this is nothing new. We have, in the past, had these reports of threats and plots by the Iranian regime, targeting journalists, dissidents and activists outside of the country. But of course, this is coming at a time where they're trying to crush dissent in the country, where they're trying to silence journalists with dozens who have been arrested since the protests began. And now it seems that the regime is trying to intimidate and threaten journalists and activists far beyond its borders. We have to mention that the regime has not commented yet on these reports.",
