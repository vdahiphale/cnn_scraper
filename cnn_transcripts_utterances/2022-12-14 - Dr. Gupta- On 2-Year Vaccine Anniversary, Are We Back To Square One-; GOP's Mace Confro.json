Yes, you're more likely to die from COVID if you're older -- we know that. Yes, you're more likely to have been vaccinated against COVID-19 if you're older. That does not mean that vaccination is more likely to lead to death. That's the Simpson's paradox.

Since women don't have their rights, these justices should never have a peaceful moment in public again.\" I know something about being accosted. The night of January 5, I was physically accosted on the streets of D.C. in the Navy Yard by a constituent of mine. I fervently blamed rhetoric on social media, rhetoric at public events -- for being physically accosted. I carry a gun everywhere I go when I am in my district and I'm at home because I know personally that rhetoric has consequences. I have had my car keyed. I have had my house spray-painted. I had someone trespass in my house as recently as August. I've been doxed on social media about where I live.

It was much more challenging but yet, I learned more in the private school. The class sizes were smaller. You had more individual attention from the teachers. We sat down as a family and discussed it and I had suggested a private school just for the benefit of a smaller class size and a better education. And my son just didn't want to do that. He wanted to be in his public school in our area -- which is a very good school, I might add. He wanted the option of more sports, clubs, and the diversity that goes along with being in a public school.
