Ukraine's highly anticipated counteroffensive may not be officiallyunderway, but the momentum already appears to be shifting in Kyiv's favor following a growing series of attacks on Russian territory that has Moscow on the defensive. The governor of Belgorod says eight people were injured Thursday in quote uninterrupted shelling. One group of anti-Putin nationalists aligned with the Russian, Ukrainian army rather posted these images claiming they hit military targets across the border and they're vowing to advance inside Russia soon. CNN cannot verify this video. Another distant group says it's already fighting on Russian soil but claims they're not harming civilians. Meantime in Kyiv, three people were killed overnight in Russian missile strikes. Moments ago, Volodymyr Zelenskyy spoke at a European summit in Moldova where he said he received strong support from Western allies. The Ukrainian President again made the case for his country's membership into NATO and says he asked dozens of European leaders attending the meeting to make a decision on whether to admit Kyiv into the alliance. At a separate summit, this one in Oslo, the German Foreign Minister said NATO can't accept new members while they are in the middle of a war. So much to talk about. Let's bring in CNN's Fred Pleitgen, he's joining us live now from Kyiv. Let's talk about these attacks in the border areas of Moscow including Belgorod, of course. Just walk us through what attempts Russia is making to stave off some of these incursions spread.",

In fact, the Russian general command said earlier at a press conference today that they had thwarted an attempt by, as they put it, Ukrainian forces. But of course, we know that it's anti-Putin Russian fighters who are saying they were behind all this. They had thwarted an attempt by those fighters to come across the border and that no one has, they had put it, had violated the border of the Russian Federation. However, from the Ukrainian side, we're certainly hearing different things. They say, as you've already noted that they took out a lot of Russian military equipment and later today we heard that a drone also seems to have crashed in the city of Belgorod, as well. And all of these, Zain, are extremely significant developments because some of these villages that are on the border usually do have a significant amount of Russian military in them. And of course, as we know, Zain, Belgorod itself is really one of the main staging points for Russia's invasion of Ukraine in that sector towards the Kharkiv sector. So, certainly, this is something that is very troublesome to the Russians because they are under pressure in large parts of that border area and of course in the Russian capital, as well.

Multiple sources tell CNN that federal prosecutors have an audio tape that undercuts Trump's defense in his handling of classified documents after leaving the White House. The recording features Trump talking about classified documents in his possession that detail a potential attack on Iran. On the tape, Trump admits that he does not have the power to declassify the documents. CNN's sources say the tape is an important piece of evidence in potential charges against the former president. Here's our Senior Legal Affairs Correspondent Paula Reid with more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) PAULA REID, SENIOR LEGAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Federal prosecutors have obtained a recording of Former President Donald Trump acknowledging he held on to a classified document about a potential attack on Iran after he left the White House, according to multiple sources. The recording is of a meeting at Trump's Bedminster golf course in July 2021. Among those in attendance were Trump aides and two people working on an autobiography of Former White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows. Meadows was not in attendance, but at this time, Trump was having aides record conversations with writers and journalists, so he was aware he was being taped. CNN has not listened to the recording, but multiple sources have described it and say it indicates Trump stood. He retained classified material after leaving the White House, despite what he has said publicly. DONALD TRUMP, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT: I have no classified documents. And by the way, they become automatically declassified when I took them. If you're the President of the United States, you can declassify just by saying it's declassified even by thinking about it.",

The remarks appearedto be in response to this New Yorker article published days before the meeting, claiming that the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, General Mark Milley, was concerned Trump might set in motion a full-scale conflict that was not justified with Iran. Trump appeared to be angered by this report and said he had in his possession a document that showed Milley's plan to attack. CNN is told that the document was not produced by Milley. His spokesman declined a comment to CNN. It is also unclear if Trump actually showed the document during the recording. Trump's former national security advisor says he absolutely should not have had that document. JOHN BOLTON, FORMER U.S. NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER, TRUMP ADMINISTRATION: I have very little faith in Donald Trump's credibility. He could have had a rolled up carry out menu in his hand waving it around saying it was Iran draft war plan. REID (voice-over): The recording is a key piece of evidence for Special Counsel Jack Smith. His investigators have questioned witnesses about it, including General Milley himself. Trump's attorney, Jim Trusty, was asked multiple times whether there was any evidence that Trump had declassified this document. He would not answer. JIM TRUSTY, COUNSEL FOR FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: The President, under the Presidential Records Act, has unfettered authority to do what he wants with documents that he's taken from the White House while President.

We are told from Republican and Democratic leaders that they hope that they could lock this in as soon as today, potentially pushing this vote into tomorrow. But before the weekend is the hope, again, the key word here is hope. Because any one senator, if they don't agree with moving along with this process quickly, can delay this, pushing them right up into that Monday deadline.

So, Scott, just in terms of what's happening on the ground there today, I understand that the protests have largely been peaceful, but there's still a lot of concerns, especially among Serbs, over these mayors' legitimacy.

And so, you had voter turnout of about 3.4 percent overall. One of the local mayors was elected with only 141 votes and so that's where things started and that's ethnic Serb protesters tried to block those mayors from taking their offices. Kosovo police were sent in to forcibly get those mayors into the building so that they could enter and then things only snowballed from there and the violence that we saw on Monday. For the moment things are calm. Yesterday, we saw a peaceful protest on the ethnic Serb side of northern Kosovo. Today, we saw protests, as you can see there, on the ethnically Albanian side of northern Kosovo. Those municipalities are now being divided by NATO peacekeepers to try to keep things calm. Now, the United States is undoubtedly one of Kosovo's most important backers, and it has called for the Kosovo Prime Minister to take steps to de-escalate the situation. Specifically, it wants those mayors to work from alternate locations, not the town halls, and it wants the police to be withdrawn from the town halls -- the Kosovo police to be withdrawn. The U.S. has already sanctioned Kosovo, canceling their participation in military drills taking place right now in Romania and it's threatening to go further. But today, the Kosovo Prime Minister, Albin Kurti, made clear that he has no plans to take the U.S. advice and those mayors will work from their offices. Listen.

You'll remember the Occupy Nigeria movement -- protest in 2012 when Goodluck Jonathan tried to remove the subsidies and that caused widespread protests across the country. It has to be done and managed in an effective way. It has to be phased out. That's what people are saying. You can't abruptly say it's gone. And this appears to have been an off the cuff, adlibbed moment from the president in his inaugural speech. We read the speech that he was supposed to present, and that phrase was not in that speech. So, his words had a severe and immediate ripple effect, Zain, and people suddenly stormed petrol stations, tried to stock up because they knew prices would go up. And then some petrol stations just stopped selling altogether because they wanted to maximize their profit. So -- and now, the state petroleum -- owned -- company, an NPC says that it has raised its prices, released a statement, but we don't even know the price that is because it appears to be different across the country. Now, this comes just after months after Nigerians were queuing Zain. You remember, to get their hands on their own cash and now across the country there's queues everywhere people waiting in long lines for several hours just to buy petrol in an oil-producing country and many Nigerians feel that they have such little perks from being in an oil producing country that a subsidy is one thing that they really could count on. And now that it's gone, or as the president said it will be going by the end of this month, but the prices appear to have spiked anyway ahead of that.

Whether that will happen quick enough for people remains to be seen. The unions appear willing to dialogue again. They came out of earlier meetings without any clear path forward. But what I think will also happen in the long term is that over time, prices will adjust as the markets become more competitive. It's also worth bearing in mind that it's mostly cars that use petrol. The majority of public transportation, as well as the bigger trucks that transport goods and services, use diesel or AGO, which is already a deregulated market. So, the issue about who benefits most for subsidies, it's always been felt that it's the middle class and the more rich-elite, the well-to-do elite. So, I think we should all be patient. There is clearly economic hardship, but this government has also inherited a problem that had started long before it came into office. And Nigeria is just struggling to manage that. The NNP, so the state-owned oil company, is also clearly struggling in terms of revenues that have dipped from crude oil exports. We haven't been able to take advantage of higher crude oil prices due to the production challenges we face. So, there's no clear easy path going forward.

If the whole life cycle approach is seen in adifferent economic model, that's not really an impact to the industry. The problem is its effects, it's not only the economy that's gained is also expanded in some ways, or it's a burden to the public, and it's a burden to countries, especially developing countries. The gain is somewhere, and the expense is somewhere. So, this should be balanced. What does economics mean? Is it economics to one part, as you say, to the 20, for example, multinational companies, or to the world? That is the question. So, the economic interests should be balanced with the health aspect and also with the non-monetized impacts that are created in the environment and in human health worldwide.",

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) IVAN WATSON, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): A rare confrontation between law enforcement and the faithful. Chinese Muslims clash with police outside a mosque in southwestern China. For two days last weekend, residents of the village of Najiaying tried to protect their mosque from a Chinese government reconstruction plan. They want to demolish the roof of our mosque, an emotional local protester tells CNN, speaking on condition of anonymity. This is our last bit of dignity, the protestor says. It's like someone going to your house and demolishing it. CNN reached out to Chinese authorities for comment, but the only official acknowledgement of the incident comes from this local government statement urging protesters to turn themselves in after disrupting social order and causing severe adverse impact.",
