Another super- sized show for you this Wednesday, we'll explore the future of FOX after its jumbo Dominion settlement fee.Netflix subscription growth, not really investor's cup of tea, plus an optimistic view of the AI phenomenon ChatGPT. Coming up, LinkedIn Co- Founder and Venture Capitalist Reid Hoffman tell us why he believes artificial intelligence will benefit humanity. He's also against a very high profile now appeal to pause development. His new must read book \"In prompt you\" amplifying our humanity through AI with even co-written with the latest iteration of the language model ChatGPT-4. We wanted a ChatGPT ask for a royalty fee. I'm looking forward to that. Now on global markets in the interim a negative read. U.S. stocks set to pull back in early trade Europe as you can see a touch softer too. New inflation numbers in the United Kingdom show inflation still above 10 percent that's the highest rate across Western Europe. Food prices in fact spiked by almost 20 percent -- and earnings new shares of Morgan Stanley heading lower too after reporting a weak Q1 investment banking segment result but key regional bank Western Alliance surging premarket. Take a look at that up 22 percent saying deposits are recovering a sign that the worst of the banking terminal may indeed be over we'll continue to watch those smaller banks. A busy show you can certainly bank on that. Let's get right to our top story, the FOX Dominion aftermath. $787.5 million that's how much FOX News agreed to pay Dominion voting systems to prevent Dominion's lawsuit from going to trial it's the largest known defamation settlement involving a media company in U.S. history. Marshall Cohen joins us now. Marshall, we can make this story about many things, American democracy, you name it, but actually at its core, it's a business story. And what happened here was Dominion won big relative to its business and FOX decided to settle with a monster sum to avoid that trial.",

      "sentences": "That's right, Julia, good morning here from Wilmington, Delaware! Dominion voting systems very few people actuallyheard of them unless you were an election official or a local County Administrator before the 2020 election. But they're world famous now for the historic settlement that they clinched right here in Wilmington, getting $787 million from FOX News, which of course, is the cable giant. Dominion their valuation a few years ago was only around 80 million. So compare the numbers, they're worth about 80 million, they're going to be taking in almost 800 million. Of course, some of that will go away with attorney's fees and other things like that, but a monster settlement. What they didn't get in the settlement, however, was a public apology from FOX News, a public admission from FOX News that they live. FOX, however, did issue a very what sounded like a very lawyer and careful statement after the settlement saying simply that they acknowledge the court's previous rulings that some of the things they said on air were false. So they kind of gave a little bit on that surely not as much as Dominion was hoping. But now this case is over. Everyone's going to move on. But Julia Dominion has additional lawsuits against other people that promoted these lies about the 2020 election. And FOX for its part is also facing another serious lawsuit from another voting technology company. So we're done here in Delaware, but the big fight over 2020 accountability is not over.",

Now we knew this was going to come. We thought it would happen during the Q1. Netflix, of course, did not roll that out. And they announced on the call last night that this will be rolling out during Q2, not just in the U.S., but in many, many countries. In fact, most countries globally, you know, in an in a matter of days, weeks, certainly within the next couple of months. The reason this is so important is Netflix has previously said that there are around 100 million users of Netflix around the world and 30 million in the U.S. and Canada of that 100 million who are basically using the service for free, you know, sharing a password from the parents or from friends or roommates. So now Netflix will be cracking down on that practice. And they will force those users to either ask the account owner in the household to add them as a subscriber, or give them the option to add on to the advertising tier that Netflix launched about six months ago. In either case, you've got up to 100 million users that will be now forced to pay for Netflix for the first time.",

And your point is that people are probably going to be embarrassed to go to the person that they're borrowing from and say, hey,can you just pay a bit more, and I'll continue to borrow your password? The likelihood is they look at their options. And they end up signing for themselves. I mean, you've done scenarios, that 30 million people decide, OK, I'm going to sign on 20 million, say, fine, I'm going to sign on in 10 million, which I know is your sort of most likely probability. Just walk us through those options and what it means in monetary terms because the money, actually and the cash flow production in this quarter was important too. And I want to get to that as well.",

      "sentences": "Sure, yes. So as a quick preamble to that keep in mind, Netflix stopped giving subscriber number of guidance as of last quarter. So thesupposed subscriber miss this quarter was just a miss versus what analysts like me were guessing. But we didn't have any guidance to go on for that. What matters much more is revenue, and of course, revenue, translating into earnings. So what Netflix has been doing is been rolling out an advertising tear, which is basically, you know, charging less for the subscription price. But a very interesting piece of news last night from the earnings call was that Netflix is now making more money on ad tear subscribers, than they do not on the basic plan, but on the standard plan. So think about it this way. For 699, you're paying a subscription fee to Netflix, Netflix is making something north of $15.50 per subscriber, given the amount of money they're making on the advertising on top of that subscription. So the way we view it, this is the first step toward trying to make more money out of out of users by kind of a win-win, giving a user a lower price, making more money for Netflix. The page sharing plan, the work that we've done is tried to assess how much more money Netflix can make from this? We think the page sharing plan is basically a way to sort of kick users into doing one or the other. The ad tear we think could be more lucrative for Netflix. But in the scenarios that we came up with, it's just to say, look, in the U.S. and Canada 30 million subscribers are using Netflix for free. What if all of them were to take on either the paid sharing or the advertising tear? We estimate that's an extra $3.5 billion worth of Netflix on a full year run rate basis. Now, that's probably overly optimistic. And then it can work every single user. If they only convert a third of those users that are using Netflix for free. We estimate that's about an extra $1 billion of revenue to Netflix again, in a full four year run rate scenario. That's around 8 percent incremental revenue to Netflix. And that's only in the U.S. and Canada, if that all rolls out smoothly. So apply that globally. You know, you're talking two or $3 billion incremental revenue to Netflix, I think at a minimum.",

But we can say the ceasefirefailed, because it didn't really take off in the first few minutes after 6 pm local when the guns should have fallen silent, and the bombing and the bombardment that was still attacks and gunfights. So this was predicted because like you mentioned, there are people who think these two generals don't have control over their forces. This powerful paramilitary force, the rapid support forces that's fighting the Sudanese army they're estimated to number about 100,000, all across the nation. And CNN has learned that the leader of that paramilitary force, General Muhammad Hamdan Dagalo or Hemetti has been commanding his forces very close to the General Command Headquarters. That's where the army is based. And he's witnessed some of these most fierce fighting in recent days. I interviewed him on Sunday; he did not want to be on camera on video because he didn't want to reveal any clues that might pinpoint his exact location. But this has degenerated into the nightmare scenario for so many people who are terrified in their homes, some of them receiving stray projectiles and gunfire hunkering down running out of food and water. The hospitals are inundated by the wounded. Half of the hospitals in Khartoum are out of action. According to the agency, \"Doctors without Borders\" they've been shared, they've been bombarded. And sometimes the staff cannot make it there because it's not safe. And yet so far 270 people are dead, but that's most likely an undercount. When the guns fall silent in the full account is done, that number could rise. Here's one voice from Sudan who spoke to CNN terrified. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And a song using AI generated vocals, replicating the voices of Drake and the weekend was just poured from several streaming platforms raising questions, among others about copyright laws. So we're at a time of heightened confusion and calls from some industry leaders to pause AI development. The question really is what's best for our society at large? And how do we learn and utilize this technology better? Well, our next guest knows a thing or two about AI. He's even co-written a book with ChatGPT-4 impromptu amplifying our humanity through AI. Reid Hoffman asked the question, among many others, what are the ways we can use GPT-4 to make progress in the world? Author, Venture Capitalists, Podcaster, Co-Founder of LinkedIn, I could keep leaving Reid Hoffman joins us now. Reid, always a pleasure to have you on the show! And first and foremost, I can't call it a book and neither do you. Because you said if you called it a book, it would be outdated by the time it was published. So it's a travel log. First and foremost, what do you want people to read this book and walk away thinking? REID HOFFMAN, CO-FOUNDER, LINKEDIN: Well, I want people to understand because you know, the general dialogue is so much concern, which it's important to be attentive to those concerns, to see what the opportunities are, to see how they can be amplified that as opposed to artificial intelligence. Think of it as amplification intelligence. And I thought that one of the ways to do that was to show how I would be amplified, writing a book, like it wasn't just, you know, talking to other people, it was, you know, like reading my own book, but it was actually in fact, doing it. And, you know, think about having a smart phone doctor or tutor, you know, assistant in your pocket that helps you whether it's life, things, work things, et cetera.

And it says, look, I'm just gathering data points. And that's my analysis. You describe it as a very sophisticated prediction machine.

And I think that the central thing in terms of looking at this and say, well, regulation, can be very good on big harms. But the way that we adopt technology, just like I was using the car thing is by getting that out there and seeing it versus imagining all the things in the future. Like if I had said, hey, I'm going to create a two ton hunk of metal that you might die in that you might run over someone else in, you know, it's like, oh, we should pause before we do it and we should really talk about it before make it. You just -- you'll just never get it on the road. So the thing that you need to do is say, well, let's, get on the road, let's drive carefully. Let's be paying a lot of attention. And let's be iterating to it. And it doesn't mean that there isn't a role for regulation. But the role of regulation is to say, hey, let's be studying it. And then let's really get crisp about which outcomes we want to avoid, which are important and which outcomes we want to get. And that's the right place for the dialogue. So for example, when you said, well, we're looking at this AI stuff, well, which things would -- we wouldn't want to say? Well, let's really make sure we avoid this, let's make sure that we avoid having tools that could increase cyber hacking or phishing. Let's try to steer on misinformation the right way. Now that we have a whole political issue about because what counts is misinformation, we have an intense set of disagreements in our society about and that's one of the problems we need to solve. But like, let's define those things. And then in defining those things, in that dialogue, that could lead to regulation. And by the way, people always say regulation is what not to do. There's like down regulation, there's also kind of up regulation about like, what things to do. And I think that's the important thing that we get them do, like when we started creating hospitals we didn't say, let's regulate them first. It is let's go into the practice and see what happens. And then we go, ah, well, let's see, let's regulate use of anesthetic this way, as opposed to let's try to predict how anesthetic is going to work, which we're not particularly good at doing without getting the experience of doing it.",
