      "sentences": "Yes, John, that police update you just mentioned came from Jilin City in Northeastern China. As you said, the suspect was caught by the police and now in custody. The police describing him as a 55-year-old local residents with a surname of Tway (ph).Now, they also added a bit more details in terms of what happened, saying this suspect, quote/unquote, collided with one of the Americans in the park and then somehow decided to use a knife to attack that American and three companions, as well as a local Chinese citizen trying to stop this attack. Now, the police statement added that none of the injuries were life threatening, and all of the injured people have received prompt and proper medical care. Now, this is the local authorities breaking their silence more than 24 hours after this horrific incident. Earlier, we have heard we had heard from the Chinese foreign ministry echoing a lot of what the police just said, but also they use the word isolated incident to describe this case. That's obviously the key message from the government to the outside world. But it is worth pointing out that this kind of violence against foreigner is rare in this country because China is generally considered a safe place to visit with a heavy security police presence, not to mention their massive surveillance technologies being deployed nationwide. But because it's almost impossible to get hold of a gun for most ordinary Chinese people, stabbing incidents like this have happened in recent years, targeting people ranging from doctors to schoolchildren. But, again, violence against foreigner is rare. That's why this case is receiving so much attention, not to mention the timing of this attack couldn't have come at a worse time for the Chinese government because their leader, Xi Jinping, has been personally promoting the resumption and expansion of the so-called people to people exchanges between the two countries after the two governments finally somewhat stabilized their fragile relationship. Xi Jinping, while in San Francisco last November, personally said China was ready to host 50,000 young Americans in the coming five years for study and exchange programs. Just last year -- just last week, actually, excuse me, Xi Jinping wrote a letter to a New Jersey college stressing the importance of this kind of exchanges. So, if this incident somehow ends up dampening American's interest and enthusiasm in coming back to China, I think that would be considered quite a major setback for the Chinese leader. John, Kate?",

      "sentences": "Yes, Kate. What you're going to see in just a couple of hours is the House Rules Committee will convene to consider these two resolutions to hold Garland in contempt. Now, what this does is it is the first step to get it to the House floor. We do expect that that action could happen later this week.One of the question marks since these two resolutions passed in the Judiciary and Oversight Committees was whether or not House Republican leadership had the votes to actually advance them on the floor. Obviously, they're feeling very confident about that, or they wouldn't be moving this through the Rules Committee today. But, again, House Speaker Mike Johnson can only afford to lose two Republicans and still get this across the finish line. What this would ultimately do is these resolutions would instruct the House speaker to refer Garland for potential questions criminal charges from the attorney in Washington, D.C. Again, it is very unlikely that that would happen, but this is not without some precedents. If you remember, House Republicans actually held Eric Holder in contempt of Congress. Democrats held William Barr in contempt of Congress. Nothing ultimately came of that. But that just shows you that there is a record and there is a history of the opposing party holding the president's attorney general in contempt of Congress. And we should just note this all stems over a dispute over whether or not the attorney general should release the special counsel's audio interview with President Joe Biden. Those transcripts have been released, but House Republicans say that they want the audio of the interview to continue their investigation into Joe Biden. Kate?",

But in reality, they're just getting started, because there's all of these hidden costs of home ownership, and it can really add up. Bankrate found that, on average, Americans are spending $18,000 a year to own and maintain their home. That is obviously a lot of money. When you think about it, it's almost like the cost of buying a used car a year. This is 26 percent more than in 2020. And, of course, this is all on top of your mortgage payment, right? We're talking about the cost of energy, the cost of property taxes. And the biggest drivers, according to Bankrate, are the fact that it's gotten more expensive to maintain a home and also the cost of home insurance.Now, we've seen premiums spike right for two reasons. One, it's the fact that the climate crisis has made it more likely that there's these disasters, right? We've seen wildfires and hurricanes and flooding. Then the cost of living, labor, materials, that's all gone up. So, it's more expensive to repair when this happens. I spoke to a woman in California yesterday who told me that her home insurance rate doubled with no notice because of concerns about wildfires. On top of that, they have to spend $10,000 to repair the plumbing. Now, she's taking on extra hours to try to make ends meet, and she's not alone, Kate?",

Of course, all of these states, high cost of living, also high property taxes. California and Hawaii, two very expensive places to live, it's costing almost everything $30,000 a year.Now, we've also seen a big surge in the cost of owning and maintaining a home in Hawaii, up by almost 40 percent, but also big increases since 2020 in Idaho and Utah as well. These are the three states with the prices going -- the expense is going up the most. Now, on the opposite end of the spectrum, some states has actually become more affordable to own and maintain a home. Arkansas, Kentucky, Mississippi, three of the more affordable places to live. There, we've seen expenses go up at a slower pace. But, listen, I think at the end of the day, no matter where you live, the message here is that you've got to budget for the unexpected, right, the burst pipe, the home insurance spike, because when it happens, it can be really painful.",

      "sentences": "That's right. So, I mean, most Americans are sitting on a nice cushion of equity because home prices have gone up. But there is an increase in some people who are seriously underwater. That means that they owe 25 percent more than the home is worth. It's never a good sign. We've seen this is a particular problem in Louisiana, Wyoming, Kentucky, Mississippi and Oklahoma. And this reflects the fact that, in some of these areas, home prices have actually gone down since the peak. And some people, they bought at the peak. They bought at the top. So, now they owe more than what the home is actually worth.I think big picture, nationally, this does not seem to be a major problem. Only about 2.7 percent of all mortgages are seriously underwater. That's pretty low. Back during the Great Recession, it's around one in four homes that were underwater. But we do need to keep an eye on this, and I do think it's another reminder that, whether we're talking about expenses or fluctuating home prices, home ownership, it's not without risk, Kate.",
