      "sentences": "Yes, Becky. Just breaking in the last hour, we have learned that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, will,within this hour, address the country from his residence and will announce that he is stepping down as Liberal Party leader, not so far as prime minister. He will give time to his party to elect a new party leader, but it is definitely an end of an era here in Canada, Becky. This has been a man who has been in office for more than nine years, elected three times, and was generally touted with having a fairly good outcome after the pandemic, and that includes the economy. But, especially, in the last year, Becky, polls for his popularity and his party's popularity have plummeted based largely on the effects of inflation, certainly an affordable housing crisis, but also legal immigration. What's been so chaotic though in the last few months Becky is that even though members of his own party -- members of Parliament from his own party have told him that you cannot win an election, which is supposed to be held by the end of the year. Justin Trudeau was fairly stubborn, believing that he could hang on. That has changed in the last few weeks. Lightly, all of this set in motion as well by the resignation of his finance minister, his deputy prime minister, his right hand for so many years. Chrystia Freeland, who, in a scathing resignation letter, wrote that she could no longer really back his so-called political gimmicks, and that she felt Canada needed, you know, a better fiscal outlook going into what are threats from President-elect Donald Trump to impose 25 percent tariffs on all Canadian imports. OK. So, what happens in the next hour, Becky, he will resign as party leader. As I said, he will stay as prime minister for a few months. But here is what's interesting, he must go to the governor general, and perhaps, he will ask that Parliament continue to be suspended. It's not sitting now to the end of the month. He will want to try and give his liberal party as much time as possible to elect and have a good race to elect a new party leader, but also to be able to take on the Conservatives, and Pierre Poilievre, as I said, have been leading in the polls -- polling averages by as much as 20 percent.

The massive irony, of course, is that the beneficiary will be Donald Trump, who did so much to threaten democracy four years ago in an attempt to stay in power in a very unconstitutional manner. I think we have to wait and see how Trump behaves once he's in office. History tells us that he will test the Constitution and the rule of law to its absolute limits, we will have a Senate and a House that controlled by Republicans. So, for the next two years, at least until the midterm elections, there's very little chance, I think, that Trump will be constrained by his own party, but political gravity will also reassert itself. He's going to have a lot of trouble getting his program through a tiny House majority. We saw that last week with the election of Mike Johnson by the razor thin margin. So, politics will happen. The Democrats will have to regroup to the midterm elections. I think we're in for a very rocky time in the United States over the next two years, because that's the way Trump behaves and the way he set out his political stall. But for today, at least, the will of the voters is being honored in a way that Trump tried to prevent it being four years ago.",

If you look back on that day where Donald Trump was certainly at the lowest point -- at the lowest point, you know, you have Donald Trump there being assailed by fellow Republicans. And if you're prosecutors, you probably believe that there is a lot of political will for this prosecution. Of course, all of that changes. On part of what we discovered in doing our story, which was published today on cnn.com is we found that in early 2021, probably around June, they received a tip that Donald Trump had met with members of the Proud Boys, some of the people who were behind the worst violence that day. In the end, they spent about a year going through down, trying to find evidence to support this idea. They didn't find that. They also couldn't find anything to link him to some of the financial efforts to bring those rioters to Washington. They looked into the now infamous Willard room, where a number of people were trying to find ways to overturn the election. And you saw -- you know, in the end, what in our story we describe, a lost year, essentially, of this effort to prosecute Donald Trump, and which, in the end, ended up dooming the effort because they ran out of time. Simply ran out of time before the -- he was re-elected as president of the United States in November. And so, for the Justice Department, they view it as not necessarily a lost year, they say they had to go down all of these places. They ended up chasing a lot of ghosts, looking for more direct evidence to tie Donald Trump to that violence, and they ended up not finding it despite four years of effort. Becky.",

The judge there, Juan Merchan has upheld his verdict on these 34 counts that Donald Trump was found guilty of, of concealing business records in that hush money case. And today, his lawyers -- Donald Trump's lawyers, are asking the courts to delay that sentencing, which is right now set for Friday. They are saying that, obviously, given the fact that there's a constitutional effort, he is the incoming president of the United States, they also say that it interferes with his constitutional duties, and that they want to obviously pursue an appeal of that conviction. And so, that's the reason why they're asking for a delay. We don't know what -- whether the judge will go for this, and whether additional courts may, in the end, Becky, weigh in to try to stop this from happening on Friday. But one of the important parts of this, obviously, is that when Donald Trump takes office on January 20th, it is very likely that he will be, at least, by purposes of this -- of this conviction, he will be a convicted felon under New York State law when he takes office, and takes the oath of office on January 20th, no matter what is happening behind the scenes.",

Some Israeli soldiers have documented their own actions in Gaza. Images, blowing up mosques, looting homes, and in some, rejoicing at the outcome. But those videos posted on social media, it seems at least now, are coming back to haunt them that the weekend, a former Israeli soldier who served in Gaza was vacationing in Brazil and fled the country suddenly after a case was brought, alleging he was responsible for war crimes based on videos that he posted online. Now, the Israeli embassy in Brazil said it had ensured his, \"swift and safe\" departure from Brazil. But that didn't quiet the alarm bells in Tel Aviv. This is just the latest in a series of similar lawsuits brought by groups that are tracking the soldiers' activities in Gaza. The main NGO tracking these cases, and specifically, the Brazil case, is the Hind Rajab Foundation. The lawyer who brought the case on behalf of the foundation was quoted in Brazilian media, saying, as Brazil is a signatory to the Rome Statute, it is obliged to ensure that the crimes provided for in the statute, war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide, are investigated and punished.

He will remainPrime Minister until a new leader is chosen. Now, Mr. Trudeau is facing a mounting set of crises, from threats by Donald Trump to slap tariffs on Canadian goods to a steep slump in his poll ratings. We are expecting to hear from Justin Trudeau any moment now. Paula Newton joining us from Ottawa. Paula?",

And we are looking at images of his residentwhere we are expecting to see Justin Trudeau any moment now. We're expecting, as you say, to see him resign today, but stay on until his liberal party picks a replacement. You and I have been discussing in this sort of hour or so since we've known that this was likely to take place that there has been little Donald Trump effect, perhaps in all of this questions about whether the threats of huge tariffs against Canada from Donald Trump might have had an impact on what we are expecting to see today. Can you explain just how those threats landed across the country and whether or not that impact really did play a part in what is happening today?",

      "sentences": "Well, they didn't land calling Justin Trudeau a governor in a 51st state, regardless of your political persuasion here in Canada does not goover well. I like to say it stiffens the spine of Canadians that they really want to be in charge of their own economy. Pierre Poilievre, the Conservative leader, even posted saying that, look, Canada would never be the first 51st state. Having said that the President-elect certainly by trolling Justin Trudeau gave Canadians second and third thoughts that they were already having some reservations about whether or not Justin Trudeau could go into his next term and, quite frankly, a second Donald Trump term as the best negotiator for Canada. So, it certainly inserted some doubts into that. You know, Becky, I want to remind our viewers, when he first came into office in 2015 and then as Donald Trump had his first term, he was certainly seen as a brand that was complete -- a political brand that was completely opposite from Donald Trump. Progressive views, certainly on so many issues globally, not just here in Canada. But then he did sit down and negotiate a landmark trade agreement with the first Trump administration, something that was good for Canada, and many say was also good for the United States. It's not necessarily that he was proven not to be a good negotiator, but as we have been saying so much in the past few weeks, Becky, Trump 2.0 will not be like his first term. And I think many Canadians having already soured on where Canada was going, especially when it came to the economy, did not trust him to really do the right thing the second time around. I want to point out as well, he was the first leader, major leader, to go to Mar-a-Lago, G7 leader to go and sit down with him. He tried to get him to convince to take the tariff threat off the table. That did not happen. Canadian government officials, being very blunt, that even if they brought a package of border measures, stricter border measures, to Donald Trump, it's worth about a million U.S. dollars right now, Becky. And still, that was not enough. Many people still expecting that the President-elect will levy those tariffs. And then the trolling certainly showed a level of dismissiveness of the Prime Minister that Canadians while they didn't appreciate also thought, is it really shrewd of us? This is also a situation, Becky, where Trudeau was -- how do you say convinced in order that he had to resign by his own party members?",
