Thirteen women and children being held hostage are set to be released. I'll give you the details and the time scale of that's going to happen. And a shocking victory in the Netherlands. The far-right party has got the most number of seats. And now, the battle of whether the controversial Gerd Wilders can put together a coalition and become Prime Minister. That speeding car, the Bentley that launched into the air, crashed. We know it wasn't terrorism. What was it all about? And the terrifying moments when it happened. A very good day to you live from New York. I'm Richard Quest. Zain and Bianna are off today. It's Thanksgiving in the United States. This is ONE WORLD. A day later than initially hoped, Qatar now says 12 hours from now, a four- day truce between Israel and Hamas will go into effect. The country's foreign ministry spokesman described the pause in fighting to begin at 7 A.M. Israel Standard Time, that's on Friday morning. To put that in perspective for where you are, that's 12 hours from now. And then approximately nine hours after that, the first group of hostages, which is 13 women and children, are going to be released. Palestinian prisoners can comment on will be freed during the 4 P.M. hour. How many? These are details that we just don't have at the moment. The Qatari spokesman is expressing cautious optimism that things will go well. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MAJED, AL-ANSARI, DOCTOR, QATARI SPOKESMAN:  We are hopeful. I don't know if I should say confident, but we are very hopeful. And as I said, the commitment we have seen from both sides leads us to be very positive, to deal with this very positively. We are seeing a good level of commitment over the agreement itself, the details, hashed out. The first, you know, glimmer of light at the end of the tunnel of this crisis, and this is why we needed to succeed and we are hoping and working towards it. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

But for now, all of the parties, Israel, Hamas, as well as the mediators in Qatar have confirmed that this truce is set to go into effect at 7 A.M. And what we also heard from the spokesman for the Qatari Foreign Ministry was hope that this initial release of 50 hostages over four days, that this could be a testing ground effectively to perhaps get more hostages out, to see that truce between Israel and Hamas extended, and perhaps even to lead to some kind of a more permanent diplomatic solution to this conflict.",

And just moments ago, President Biden was actually out and aboutin Nantucket visiting a local firehouse, and he projected optimism about the first wave of hostages being released tomorrow. He told reporters that he was finger -- keeping his fingers crossed that would happen. And it comes as the U. S has been closely involved in monitoring the developments in this hostage release with a keen focus being on the potential release of Americans. There are potentially three Americans that U.S. officials believe could be released in this larger deal of these 50 women and children who will be released by Hamas. It's unclear at this moment whether they will be part of that first wave that would be released tomorrow, but U.S. officials say that they plan on contacting the families of the Americans if they are in that batch, once they get confirmation that they've departed Gaza. Essentially, there will need to be an American official or a trusted third-party source who has set eyes on these Americans and then they would be able to notify the families. What's important to note though, is that some of these hostages do have that dual citizenship. So, there is a possibility that if Americans are in that first batch, that they could also be notified by the Israelis first. Now, it's expected that the three Americans include that three-year-old girl, Abigail Idan. There are also two other women. And the White House has been focused not just on trying to get them out, but also the other Americans -- there's roughly 10 unaccounted for that they believe could be held hostage. Now, this comes as the administration has expressed confidence that this deal is on track. They are hopeful that the implementation will start tomorrow. The implementation has been a key focus for President Biden. He even held some calls yesterday with the emir of Qatar talking about ensuring that this deal is implemented the way it should be. I'll also note President Biden today was also asked about those Americans being held in Russia -- Paul Whelan and Evan Gershkovich, he said that the U.S. is working around the clock trying to get them home, as well.",

Slight softening, though, of the outgoing Conservative Party and also a centrist party. With those, they would get 81 seats, so that would be a majority in parliament, so that is possible. But these negotiations will likely take months and there will have to be a serious negotiation with Geert Wilders, particularly over some of his stances, for instance, on the E.U. because he is very anti-E.U., he would even like to see a referendum. So, I think those negotiations will be tricky and could really water down those policies that so many people perhaps have voted for. In Brussels, this is the -- this is the nightmare, isn't it?
