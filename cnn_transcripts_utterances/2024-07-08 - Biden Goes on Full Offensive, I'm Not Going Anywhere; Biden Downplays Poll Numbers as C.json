As support among his fellow Democrats is slipping, the president has fired off a letter to members of his party in Congress vowing to stay in the race. Biden just appeared on a morning talk show a few moments ago, attacking former President Donald Trump, accusing him of hiding out at Mar-a-Lago. Sources tell CNN that six ranking members in the House now want Biden to drop his re-election bid that came during a call yesterday with Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries. And five House Democrats are publicly calling for the President to withdraw from the race. There is deep concern that among Democrats that Biden could cost tight races and is damaging their hopes of winning the House in November. But the president insists, as we said, just a few moments ago, he will stay in the race. One big test gets underway tomorrow when he hosts dozens of world leaders at the NATO summit this week.

I'm going to be the Democratic nominee.He also gave a full-throated rebuke of his Democratic colleagues expressing frustration with the widespread leaks in the party of their handwringing and their own frustration with where his campaign has gone in the last week since that disastrous debate.

The question of how to move forward has been well aired for over a week now, and it's time for it to end. We have one job, and that is to beat Donald Trump. He says there are 42 days before the Democratic National Convention, 119 days before Election Day, he says there is not a path to nominate someone else and that he has already secured the hearts and minds of voters, and that should not be discounted, Jim. But whether that message lands on deaf ears within the Democratic Party is what is going to be tested this week with Senate Democrats convening tomorrow, as well as House Democrats who have all privately raised some concerns about whether they believe an alternative should be explored.

I just want to go back through history and say, okay, who outperformed their July national polls, and we'll talk about the midterms first, and then we'll talk about the presidential cycle, right? This is midterms, the House elections. This is a generic congressional ballot. Who outperformed their July polls? In fact, in 2022, the Republicans actually outperformed their July national polls by a point. They were actually ahead by two points in the national popular vote polls, they ended up winning by three.How about July 2018? Democrats did outperform, but just by a point. Basically, those midterm national polls that we're looking at, you know, in terms of the presidential race right now, those were pretty spot on in the midterms. Look at that. Even in July. How about the presidential race? It wasn't Joe Biden who outperformed his July polls. It was actually Donald Trump in 2020 by five points. He outperformed by five points. How about 2016, the exact same situation? Donald Trump outperformed his July polls, come the time of the election, by three points. So, the fact is, this idea that you're seeing that Joe Biden's putting out there, that perhaps some Democrats are putting out there, that somehow the polls are underestimating Democrats. Maybe it's true, but at least when it comes to the national polls and past election cycles in July, whether it be the presidential or the midterms, it's simply put, Mr. Acosta, has not held water.",

Even in 2004, when John Kerry, of course, lost the election to George W. Bush, he was ahead in the polls at this point. You have to go all the way to this side of the screen.And George W. Bush, back in 2000, when you actually find a Republican ahead, it is very unusual, at least during a lot of, at least my lifetime, to see a Republican ahead in the presidential polls, nationally speaking at this point.

This is Beryl. And it looks like some of the strongest part of the storm that is still, by the way, a Category 1 hurricane is bringing the powerful winds. In fact, National Weather Service out of Houston tweeted that an elevated weather reporting station about 200 feet in the sky, so roughly 20 storeys up on a building reported a wind gust of 81 miles per hour. So, they're warning residents that to stay away from their balconies, stay away from windows, if you live in one of the high rises downtown Houston. We don't have to go back that far in history. Just a few weeks ago, when straight line winds crashed through some of the windows of the high rise buildings with similar type wind gusts. Now, Hurricane Beryl has lost its energy source, that being the warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico, which, by the way, are directly behind me. We're at Port Lavaca, along the South Central Texas coastline, but that means that the storm should be weakening. But, look, it's still a formidable hurricane. You can see a defined eye on the satellite and radar and the eastern eye wall. What's left of it is now moving through Houston. That's why they're getting such bad weather at this moment in time. And people are really just being bunkering down to make its way through. So, let's look at some of the wind gusts because they have been significant. Look at that, 85 miles per hour in Brazoria, Galveston, 75 miles per hour, Houston Hobby International Airport, 71 miles per hour. That is nearly hurricane force, and that's what's toppled trees, taking down power lines. And that is why our current customers without power right now is well over 1 million, 1.5 million, and many of those customers in and around Houston all the way to the coastline. Flash flood warning still in effect, tornado threat continues through this morning. We've got it all here across Southeast Texas as the first hurricane of the 2024 season makes landfall here in the U.S. Jim?",

President Biden on the offensive this morning, talking to a morning television show just a short while ago defending his right to run for a second term, even challenging members of his own party to a convention floor fight.Let's bring in Vanity Fair Special Correspondent Brian Stelter. He's with us right now. Brian I'm guessing as a as a studious observer of morning television, that's an understatement on your part, you probably saw what the president said just a short while ago. How stunned are you that Joe Biden is saying to these nervous Democrats out there, hey, if you've got a problem, challenge me at the convention?",

And I think that is an accurate assessment of this incredible moment we're in, Jim. It does make a lot of sense, though, to have Biden working the phone, doing more interviews. This is what people were calling for a week ago. They were saying, why isn't he working the phones? Why isn't he calling into television and radio shows?That NBC interview last Friday night, it was relatively low rated. It did not, you know, change the calculus, did not change the dynamic of this race or the situation for Biden, so he's being more aggressive today with this letter, with this phone call, maybe with other interviews in the coming hours, trying to change the dynamics.",
