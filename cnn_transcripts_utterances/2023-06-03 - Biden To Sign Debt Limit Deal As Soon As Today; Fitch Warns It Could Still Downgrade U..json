But at the same time, there's still a lot more to determine, underneath in terms of how government funding is allocated. And it's certainly another opportunity for that back and forth. You know, in addition, President Biden talked about wanting deficit reduction through, you know, raising taxes on people making over $400,000 per year closing what he described as tax loopholes.

Investigators say not only do they have evidence that Meza committed those two murders, they also suspect he might be connected to another eight to 10 murders that they say have evidence and circumstances that are very similar to these other cases that they're working. So, that's why they're describing this as a potential serial killer situation. But what is even more troubling is when you look at the criminal history of Raul Meza. In 1982, he was convicted for the murder of an 8-year-old girl in the Austin area and served about 11 years in prison before he was released. He's been in and out of the prison system ever since. And in that conversation with the detective that was recorded, he says, that he was last released in 2016 and then started committing murders once again. And what investigators say is even more chilling is when they arrested him and took him into custody. Five days after calling the Austin Police Department. He was found with holding a bag that had duct tape, zip ties and a gun and he apparently told investigators that he was ready and willing to carry out more murders. One other detail that was released in this arrest warrant affidavit is that apparently, there was DNA evidence that came out a year after the murder of Gloria Lofton back in May of 2019. And according that DNA evidence, it pointed to Raul Meza as the possible suspect in that case, but it's not clear why it wasn't until three years later that investigators were able to track down Meza and arrest him for his involvement in these in these murders.

So, as a result of that, when we do take these statistics, and we see 75 percent of support for that community, a lot of that is probably weighted to the lesbian and gay community and people are probably responding differently to the transgender community.

Now, the study aims to assess these unexplained phenomena and whether they pose any public safety risk. Joining us now is Hakeem Oluseyi. He is an astrophysicist and visiting professor at George Mason University. Professor, good to have you on the show. Let's start with the big question. OK? Everybody wants to know if this -- these things other worldly -- what we've learned from this panel is maybe two to five percent of the 100 or so 50 to 100 reports that come in each month are really unexplained.

Well, if something enters our solar system from elsewhere, you know, the laws of physics makes it almost -- it's not exactly the same. But as if it fell here, from that amazingly far distance, right? And again, that's what makes this sort of interstellar travel so difficult. Because if you do go to another star system, right? If we were to do it, if some other alien species that's technologically advanced, were to do it. When you get to your destination, you're going to be moving so fast, that it's going to be difficult to slow down and go into orbit around the planet. That's why when you see a mission, like New Horizons that went to Pluto, it didn't stop at Pluto and go into orbit it, you know, kept on going, it just did a pass by. So, you know, there are, you know, short of that, right? What else could there possibly be, right? You have to basically capture the thing and analyze it and see that it's not of earthly origin.

And cameras, in particular, can really fool you, because light can come in from various directions, bounce around, there could be dust inside the camera, there could be artifacts on your detector.There is so many ways you can be fooled. And in many cases, you have a moving camera, you're on a moving platform observing a moving object, right? So, unless you do a very rigorous detailed analysis, you can be fooled. And you know, I'm happy to see that David Spergel, the cosmologist, I've known him for 20 years. He is, you know, he studies very subtle phenomena about the universe. And so, for us, astrophysicist, you know, we've been doing this for a long time. We've been observing the universe with cameras and telescopes, and taking, you know, making these detailed measurements from them. And what we see is that, yes, what you think you see with your eye is not necessarily what you're going to find once you do your rigorous analysis. So, the key thing to me about this is that, you know, up to now, it's been about the past, this meeting has been about the future. Just like with the Chinese balloon, we do need better eyes, on our skies and in our airspace, and it has to be designed to do the job that we're asking it to do.
