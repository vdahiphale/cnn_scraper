We'll bring you the details of how that will happen. Meanwhile, Qatar says aid will begin to flow into Gaza once a truce comes into effect. We'll have the very latest on the humanitarian situation there. Plus, a surprise landslide victory for the far-right in the Netherlands. We'll have all the reaction to Geert Wilders' shock victory. But first, the agonizing wait for the families of hostages being held by Hamas continues until Friday. A truce between Israel and Hamas is now expected to begin Friday at 7:00 a.m. in Israel, 7:00 a.m. local time there and Gaza. That's midnight eastern. The first 13 civilian hostages will be released, about nine hours later. Those details announced by a Qatari Foreign Ministry spokesman who says both sides appear ready to move forward. Have a listen to this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MAJED AL-ANSARI, SPOKESPERSON, FOREIGN AFFAIRS MINISTRY, QATAR:  We are hoping that we don't see any delays, and I think we've reached a point now where everything is in place, and we are ready to go on the ground. So, we are hopeful that, as I told you, by 7:00 a.m. tomorrow, everything will stop. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And over the course of the past 24 hours, we have seen another delay. We thought this would all move forward today, and it seems that that's how the Israeli government was prepping for it with a viewing area for the transfers for the video that they could share with media. But in the end, that fell apart and was delayed by about 24 hours or so, because of the final details, the final logistics that had to be hammered out and the troubleshoot over different scenarios that can happen here. That made it even more difficult for the families, and now it's not just a list of the first 50 that will come out, the list is broken up day-by-day. So, only 13 families get to find out today. Another 12 or 13 or so tomorrow, and it will be day after day of this, obviously, for the first four days of this pause in the fighting, but then if there is an extension, it continues at that slow, frankly, very cruel, difficult pace for these families --",

But Hossein Abdollahian; who is the Iranian Foreign Minister who is here not just meeting with Hezbollah, with Nasrallah, but with other Lebanese officials as well. He told the \"Mayadeen\" television station here in Beirut that if the truce does not hold, in his words, the scope of the war will expand. Now, Mr. Abdollahian has sort of gone hot and cold since the beginning of this war. Perhaps his bark is louder than his bite, but certainly, what we're seeing today has been some of the most intense exchanges of fire between Hezbollah and Israel. We count well over 20 strikes by Hezbollah on the Israeli positions. Now, you mentioned they fired 48 Katyusha missiles at one Israeli base, but there is a variety of other strikes as well. In fact, I just got word right just a few minutes ago, another volley of missiles fired into Israel. The Israelis say they are hitting back, hitting what they call infrastructure as well as the launch sites. Now, this was all set off when yesterday evening, there was an Israeli strike on a house about 7.5 kilometers inside Lebanon. There were five Hezbollah fighters inside.

Those people have been in Israeli jails for a very long time, some for years and some for months. This exchange is very useful. It breaks a lot of Israeli government taboos. They said there will be no ceasefire whatsoever, in reality, they accepted a ceasefire for four days. Hopefully it would be extended further. Second, they said they will not accept any exchange of prisoners. Now, they have to accept exchange of prisoners. As much as Israeli children and women have to be released, also Palestinian children and women have to be released. And third, they said they will uproot Hamas and they will not talk to them, but actually they are negotiating with them and making even a deal with them. So, all in all, it's a positive development. The most important thing is maybe to prolong this ceasefire because the atrocities on the Palestinian sides are beyond any tolerance. We are talking about 15,000 Palestinians almost killed, so far, including 6,150 children.

I mean, they are still -- it's true that their tanks are in Gaza City, but they are not in control and they couldn't break the Palestinian resistance. So, that is an additional factor. That third factor is definitely the United States and Mr. Biden's administration. I think President Biden supported this operation thinking it will help him get reelected. But I think he's now discovering that the majority of the American public are against his policy regarding this war. And there is -- I would say, a world revolution everywhere from peoples of the world against the continuation of this aggression on the Palestinian people against the fact that Palestinian children and women and innocent civilians are slaughtered every day by Israeli airstrikes and Israeli bombardment.
