And so he's attacking President Biden.Secondary thing he's doing, which is part of his personality, he's referencing the former first lady going to the funeral, you know, so he's trying to tell people that he's going to fix things. He's an avatar for their anger, but there's some compassion in the family. I mean, that's basically all of the symbolism in that speech. Now you're disgusted by it and probably won't admit that you're disgusted by it because you're an objective journalist, but I'm disgusted by it. And the problem is --",

We're now an economically desperation America. And so he represents us.And so he says things that are out of sorts and he says things that, you know, you or I, Jim, wouldn't say, uh, but they let them get away with it. And he plays to them and he understands them. And I think this is the real risk for the Biden campaign. They really have to wake up on this. They have to understand what he's doing so that he can parry it because this really is going to be a battle for the democracy, this one. He's going to expand executive power. He's going to make things rougher for people. He has already said he's going after his adversaries using the Department of Justice. And so for all of these reasons, you know, we got to help the Democrats here if he's eventually the nominee. And I'll be working very hard on that because as your fellow CNN colleagues have pointed out when they interview people like John Kelly or General Barr, turn to General Barr. Anybody that's worked for him that knows him, that isn't tied to him politically is telling the truth about him. And we'll have to do that and work even harder in 2024 than we did in 2020.",

And so anything that they say or anything that they're doing, stuff that he's saying about the former, you know, Mayor Giuliani, all this sort of stuff, nothing is shocking anymore.He'll pull any trick or any stunt, but I think he's really up against it, frankly, because remember, his talking point is that it's liberals trying to prevent him from re-rising to the presidency. But you got people like Mark Meadows in there who used to run the Freedom Caucus in the House and was his former chief of staff as the chief witness in the insurrection case. So, we'll have to see what happens. Obviously, we have the Supreme Court case related to whether or not he can be on or off the ballot as a result of the 14th Amendment. I think that's going to be a mission critical case as well. But you know, he'll pull any stunt, he'll do anything. And obviously the attention is very, very important to Mr. Trump. And so stuff like that gets some attention. It gets you scratching your head, other scratch their head. I don't scratch my head anymore because, you know, I'm sort of immune to it.

But remember, if the Supreme Court says, and I believe it's in February or March, they rule that he can't be on the ballot, guess what? A lot of states are gonna take him off the ballot, or maybe all of the states will.And so there's a couple of things, deus ex machina, that could happen here that knocks Trump out of the game. I'd like to believe, although the wheels of justice turned slowly, I'd like to believe this is still a fair system and I think the evidence is overwhelming and hopefully it's such that it'll knock him out of the race. And I would just say to Governor Haley or Governor DeSantis, if you lose in Iowa, lose in New Hampshire, I wouldn't be dropping out of that race anytime soon.

Let's dig deeper now with my next guest, Larry Sabato, who's the director for the Center of Politics at the University of Virginia.Larry, what was your response to this Des Moines Register poll? As we all know, this is the gold standard. It comes out on the eve of every Iowa caucus. And, you know, we all look to it as political junkies to see what it shows.

While you should never rely on a single poll, it has the best record and it has been very reliable, although as we know, four years ago, there was a terrible glitch and we never got to see the results. That was for the Democratic side.But look, I think it's basically accurate. If you can find anybody who wants to bet you that Trump won't win the Iowa caucus, take the bet. Definitely take the bet. He's going to win. He's going to win it handily. As to who finishes second, yeah, I'm torn about that because Haley has popped up in the Des Moines Register Poll and other polls and not just in Iowa. So that suggests that she does have some lift. But her supporters are remarkably unenthusiastic. They're not terribly dedicated to her. They're picking her because they don't like the other candidates, and that's fine. That's how a lot of people vote. But when you're facing, what, wind chill of 35 degrees and snow, minus 35 and snow, probably, if you're not very enthusiastic, you might decide to stay warm.

In fact, he does it purposefully because it helps him, at least for the nomination, not necessarily in the fall. But as far as Republicans agreeing to it, Jim, in my lifetime, I have never seen a party change the way that Republican Party has changed, really over the last 25 or 30 years, but it accelerated with Trump's arrival on the national scene.It's not just that they're conservative. There's nothing wrong with being conservative, and we need a liberal party and a conservative party to compete. This is often a very nasty, vicious party. And Trump's rhetoric appeals to the large share of Republicans who identify with what he says, no matter how mean, how vitriolic.

That's -- not quite. They don't win unless they can continue to harass and go after U.S. and international shipping. That's their standard. They set that as their goal. We're going to take that away from them, I think, if they attempt to do something now. We do have the means to do that largely even though \"New York Times\" and others have said most of the targets, we didn't hit, it's true, but we do have extremely good intelligence coverage of that area, we have a lot of experience with it.
