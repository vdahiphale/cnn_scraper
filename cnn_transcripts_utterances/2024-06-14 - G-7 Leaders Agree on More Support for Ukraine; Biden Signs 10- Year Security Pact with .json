For the first time, frozen Russian assets will be used to help pay for part of Ukraine's reconstruction, with approval by the G-7 for a $50 billion loan to Kyiv, secured by earnings from Russian bonds, securities, gold, cash, and other assets being held mostly in European banks.

And that is, in an open society, you see how the sausage is made.

But that is not necessary to be confused with a lack of -- a lack of intention, I suppose is the best way to put it, to do as much as the West can for Ukraine. So again, I think Zelenskyy is right. He knows that the majority of Americans, if you believe the polls, do support Ukraine. Indeed, many Republicans actually support Ukraine.

Dozens have been detained with the security ministry anticipating more arrests as more demonstrators are identified. The Argentinian Senate narrowly approved Milei's key reform bill and fiscal package on Wednesday, but not without significant concessions.

BRUEN: Well, look, this is a challenging situation, because we've had instances including here in Washington, where protesters have turned violent, where they have tried to upset legislative processes and procedures. And yet at the same time, John, as you know, this is a well-trodden path when it comes to authoritarian -- quasi-authoritarian leaders who try to crack down on dissent. I think the key thing here is that we didn't see the peaceful protests that really are the hallmark of that dissent in a democratic fashion. It's going to be important, if there is opposition, continued opposition to some of this legislation, that it stays within the boundaries of peace and civil disagreements, rather than resorting to some of those violent measures that we saw in the images today.",

So I think it's important at this stage that Argentinians are able to continue, whether it's in the press, in the protests to exercise their rights, and that Milei is given a lesson in how you govern democratically.
