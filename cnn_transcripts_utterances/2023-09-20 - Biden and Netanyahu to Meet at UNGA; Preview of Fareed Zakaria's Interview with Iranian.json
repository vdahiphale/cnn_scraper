He will sit down with the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, on the sidelines of the General Assembly. It is their first meeting since Mr. Netanyahu returned to office, leading the most right-wing government in Israel's history. Amongst other, things they're expected to discuss a possible deal to normalize ties between his country, Israel, and Saudi Arabia. CNN's Hadas Gold is following what is, Hadas, a high stakes meeting. You are in Jerusalem. Senior politics reporter Stephen Collinson is in Washington. Let's start with you, Hadas. The perspective from where you are on what is a sort of non meeting as it were. Certainly Netanyahu has not been offered an official invite to the White House at this point. This is a meeting on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly. Your sense of what we might expect?",

      "sentences": "Well, as Hadas was, saying I think the optics speak volumes. President Biden is deeply fond ofIsrael, much less so these days of the prime minister. Both of these politicians are speaking to different domestic audiences a lot of the time. Netanyahu's shift to the hard, right the judicial reforms really alienated the Biden administration, not least because they contradict, in the U.S. view at least, with one of Biden's top global priorities, which is the protection of democracy all over the world. American officials see these reforms as denuding Israel's democracy. There is also resentment, I think, among many Democrats about the way that Prime Minister Netanyahu played in U.S. elections, aligned himself very closely with former president Donald Trump. And we have an election, really starting to gather pace in the United States. There's a chance that Donald Trump could come back to the White House. So that is clearly sensitive. But at the end of the day, Biden and Netanyahu, historically, have been somewhat transactional politicians. And there is a bigger game here and I think there's a reason why the U.S. is willing to reengage with him, if not at the White House state dinner summit level. That's because of this attempt to try and get a normalization agreement between Saudi Arabia and Israel. That, although there are very big risks inherent in that, would be a huge foreign policy win for the United States. Biden's playing a much bigger game than just with Israel. He's seeking to draw nations like Saudi Arabia out of the advances of nations like China and Russia. This is a big geopolitical game going on in the Middle East and elsewhere. If Biden can get something out of Netanyahu on those lines, that could be a victory for him going forward. And that's why this meeting is important from his point of view.",

While the RCMP tells Canada that, of course -- pardon me -- tells CNN that this investigation is a priority for them, there've not been any arrests.
