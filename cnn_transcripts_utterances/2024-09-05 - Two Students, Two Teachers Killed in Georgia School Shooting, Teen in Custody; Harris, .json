Well CNN's John King dives into the poll numbers and looks at how either candidate can secure enough electoral votes to win. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JOHN KING, CNN CHIEF U.S. NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: This is where we are right now. The yellow states are our toss-up states. They include North Carolina. We did not poll in North Carolina this time. I'm going to lean it red. Democrats will get mad at me, but I'm going to lean that one red until I see data that proves otherwise, because it has gotten red in every election since 2008. When Obama won it, it was Republican before that. Here's our new polling. Harris ahead in Wisconsin, outside the margin. Harris ahead in Michigan, just outside the margin. That gets her to 250. Donald Trump ahead in Arizona, outside the margin. Let me make that red. That would move him up to 246. Pretty close, right? And then you mentioned these other states are too close to call. Pennsylvania, a genuine tie. Let's just say Harris is really plus one in Georgia and plus one in Nevada. This is just one poll. This is a hypothetical here. That alone, though, if she could hold that, would get her to 272, and she could win the presidency without Pennsylvania. But, again, she's plus one in the polling. It's just as plausible, and we've seen other data, that Donald Trump could win Georgia and Donald Trump could win Nevada as well. That would get him to 268. So what happens then? You're looking at Pennsylvania, right? Let's assume Harris ekes it out. It's a tie right now. If Trump won it, he'd be president of the United States. If Harris won it under this scenario, and again, it's a scenario, that gets you to 269, 268, and it all comes down to Nebraska's second congressional district. Either a tie or it puts Harris over the top at 270. I'm not saying that's going to happen. What I'm saying is if you look at this data, here's where we start today.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MERRICK GARLAND, U.S. ATTORNEY GENERAL: As RT itself has boasted, the government of Russia continue to use RT to direct disinformation and propaganda. In the wake of Russia's brutal invasion of Ukraine, RT's editor-in-chief said the company had built, quote, an entire empire of covert projects designed to shape public opinion in Western audiences.

So a broad effort, but it's pretty clear they don't think that this is going to solve the problem completely and that exposure is not enough.So what we have, of course, with these criminal indictments is they're accusing two RT employees of having run this alleged scheme to set up this company in Tennessee. They apparently funded almost -- they've funneled almost $10 million into this company. Now, it's not a news company as such, Tenet Media. It's more a sort of collection of influencers that they brought together. And in terms of the metrics, the Justice Department says that they had put up some 2,000 videos since the company officially sort of went public last November, with 16 million views at least. So we don't know if that changed any minds, of course, but it seems that they were successful in getting quite a lot of eyes on these videos. And, of course, the content seems to be sort of promoting pro- Russian sort of narratives and trying to weaken support for Ukraine, which I think is critical. Like, this fits a pattern, obviously, of Russian efforts that we've seen, hybrid efforts, everything from sort of more crude arson attacks, jamming GPS signals now into these sort of disinformation campaigns that really have stepped up as Russia tries to weaken support for Ukraine.
