They're still not expected to open until Wednesday. It is just an absolute disaster that officials there are only beginning to grapple with. The ability to clear those roads, there are still a no drive zone in Buffalo in many surrounding communities around it, thousands of people still without power. And the governor of New York says it is not over yet. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV. KATHY HOCHUL (D-NY):  The storm is coming back. We're expecting another 6 to 12 inches, and in the south towns, the southern part of Erie County, a little bit south of here, they had 30 to 40 inches of snow overnight. So, anyone who declares victory and says it's over, it is way too early to say this is at its completion. Maybe the severity is downplaying now and right now it's not as bad as it has been in the last couple days but it is still a dangerous situation to be out. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

National Grid is approximately 10,000, a little less than that right now with the majority of those in the city of Buffalo. Part of the biggest problem that National Grid has been dealing with is it's just not power lines that were down. Substations were buried under snow and were frozen. And they have to thaw out the substation to determine what damage was caused and then repair the equipment. They were able to restore more than 10,000 people in the last 24 hours but the damage was so severe to some of these substations, they basically have to rip them apart and rebuild them and then, hopefully, within the next 24 hours, they'll have the power on.

Rosa, as we await a U.S. Supreme Court decision on the Trump-era Title 42 immigration policy, I understand you have some new reporting on the backlog of current U.S. asylum applications now at an all-time high. ROSA FLORES, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  You know, Wolf, you're absolutely right. The asylum cases are at an all-time high. Let me tell you about it as I show you where I am here in El Paso. Now, as the sun is starting to set here and temperatures are starting to drop, you can see around me that there are migrants who are beginning to select their little area within this sidewalk in case that the church that is nearby is not able to accommodate them for the night. I spoke to the pastor there. He says that they're taking about 100 families, mostly women and children. And you'll see around here that there is a lot of children, Wolf. I talked to some of the parents who say that a lot of the times what they do is take their jackets, their blankets, whatever they have and they hug their children hoping that they can keep them warm overnight because the temperatures dip so much. Now, the people that you see around me, there's a mixture of individuals who turned themselves into authorities and others who started entering the country illegally. Why? From talking to some of them, they tell me that they are tired of waiting in Mexico or they have been returned to Mexico multiple times under Title 42. And that's why they decided to take their chances and go ahead and get into the United States. But back to the point about the asylum cases, what a lot of these individuals don't realize is that the asylum backlog is of historic proportions right now here in the United States. According to a group at Syracuse University, Wolf, there are nearly 1.6 million cases in the backlog and the wait for simply a hearing, the wait is more than four years. So, Wolf, as you might imagine, a lot of these people don't even realize the wait that they're starting to enter if they qualify for asylum in the United States. Wolf?",

And it's creating an environment that is more chaotic than it needs to be and it's really just to send a message to the White House. On the other hand, there is not much practical effort on the part of lawmakers and political figures in Washington or elsewhere to actually legislate on this issue.

It is definitely a serious challenge. It is incredibly complicated and I think all the more exacerbated by exactly precisely these kinds of images that we have been seeing for days and weeks. You know, we are seeing clearly an influx of migrants and asylum seekers at these U.S. border cities and areas and it's clear that resources are overwhelmed, that border personnel are stretched really thin. And that is why we have heard various figures really across the country criticizing and raising questions about administration's preparedness and particularly since they have known for awhile the possibility of Title 42 eventually going away. And I think it's important to note that this is not just a humanitarian issue, though, it certainly is a serious one, it is clearly a political issue just in that the White House and this administration and Democrats are being pounced on by Republicans in particular who are pretty eager to sort of point the finger and say it is because of Democrats that this situation is so out of control.",

Kevin McCarthy is already under enormous pressure to impeach Mayorkas. That is something that up until recently he really resisted.

That just doesn't happen.This number is going to go up. It will be over 50 when we get the new numbers in from Buffalo. Look at Watertown though, 41.1. They're picking up most of the snow. Good news is the winds are lightening and it's starting to dwindle, and that's good news. We want that. This total is going to go up, as well, 98.9. We'll see it probably over 90.

Watertown and surrounding counties still under a warning. That's the only one we have. Buffalo area, in this region, is under advisory. So, when you look at the radar, it's promising. The winds are lightening. Of course, they have been shooting straight up through Lake Erie and that creates that lake effect. It picks up these warmer waters and the same thing with Lake Ontario. But, again, once the great lake waters freeze this winter, that shuts that system down but this was about the winds, incredible amount of winds. A low pressure drop to a category 2 strength, so it broadened out. Look, we have another little clip. We've got icy roads in Middle Tennessee, Northern Mississippi and Alabama, that's going to move through quickly. But the amount of snow that this is dropping is going to be here awhile.

We do know though at least three Russian servicemen died on Monday. Meanwhile, President Putin raising eyebrows here in Kyiv with his offer that they believe is disingenuous to negotiate for peace in Ukraine. Of course, the Ukrainians say the only peace deal must include Russia pulling out of Crimea, which Putin has occupied, his forces have occupied for nearly nine years now since 2014, that illegal annexation. Putin saying, though, that he wants to talk about acceptable solutions to end the war in Ukraine, even though he continues to call it a special military operation with notable exception when he -- U.S. officials believe had a bit of a slip of the tongue, calling it a war. President Zelenskyy's advisor meanwhile saying that, and this is a quote here, Moscow doesn't want negotiations but just wants to avoid responsibility as it continues to attack civilian infrastructure. And the blackouts have been across Ukraine. There was a brief respite from the power outage on Christmas day, a kind of Christmas gift, if you will, to the people of Ukraine. But then those controlled blackouts started once again on Boxing Day. The reason is simple. They just don't have enough power supply for all the people here in Ukraine, especially with winter temperatures plummeting day-by-day. The Ukrainian embassy, the foreign minister specifically is calling on Russia to be removed from the United Nation Security Council and the U.N., saying that their behavior here in Ukraine does not warrant them being a permanent member of the U.N. Security Council. A veto power, of course, Wolf, as you know, the problem is, there is actually no mechanism written into the U.N. charter to remove a permanent member of the U.N. Security Council, which means that Russia can pretty much veto any action against it. Wolf?",

What does this tell you about Ukraine's strategy at this critical stage of the war? EVELYN FARKAS, FORMER DEPUTY ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF DEFENSE FOR RUSSIA/UKRAINE/EURASIA:  Well, Wolf, it tells me that the Ukrainians are going to go after legitimate Russian military targets inside of Russia, which they should do. And they're not going to be essentially deterred, self-deterred or detoured by Russia's bombastic language or references to nuclear forces.

He will try to deflect attention from the suffering of the Russian people, of the Russian military, of their poor performance. And, of course, in Ukraine, they will continue to do everything they can to keep their spirits up and to keep the Ukrainian people safe. One last thing I want to say is that Vladimir Putin really would love nothing more than a refugee crisis again in Europe.
