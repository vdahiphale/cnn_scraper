We're going to be bringing that to you live when it happens.And also first on CNN, investigators now say new video shows the attack inside the Louisville bank lasted only about one minute. This is according to a review of the Instagram video that the gunman livestreamed as he carried out the shooting. Officials also say you can hear on the video a woman greeting the gunman and he telling her, quote, \"You need to get out of here.\" And then he shoots her. We have more details coming in. Let's get over to CNN's Omar Jimenez in Louisville for that. Omar, what more are you picking up? OMAR JIMENEZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  So we know this video was livestreamed and we're now learning what investigators were seeing on that livestream video before it was taken down, according to an official. So the shooter, as you mentioned, tells a worker to \"get out of here\" with a clearly visible a AR-15 rifle. And then, as she tries to do so, he then turns to try and shoot her in the back. But the safety was on and the gun had yet to be -- wasn't loaded, according to this official. So then he loaded the gun and then proceeds to shoot her in the back. Her condition is unknown. Then proceeds to continue firing on at other bank employees, who are trying to run as he continues shooting. As you mentioned, the shooting lasted in total just about a minute. But in that time, five people were killed and eight others injured. After the shooting was done, again, according to the officials, describing what investigators were seeing, the shooter sat down in the lobby of the building just behind me, waited, looking out onto Main Street, which is the street behind me, until police arrived. And then, as we know from police, that's when a gun battle began and then the shooter ended up dead. Here this morning, we see the bank behind me. The windows are boarded up. There's a disaster recovery team here as well, likely cleaning up a lot of -- I can only imagine -- just unspeakable carnage inside. As for the shooter himself, we know from a law enforcement source that he wrote a note to his parents and friends, saying he was going to shoot up the bank because he believed -- there are separately -- he believed he was going to be fired. And that's all part of the investigation into what may have motivated the shooting. We know that five are killed, eight others injured, four have now been discharged from the hospital. Three are in stable and fair condition but one remains in critical condition. We do know one of the responding police officers, 26 year old Nickolas Wilt, was shot in the head while responding. He was put in critical condition. So obviously a lot of people waiting with bated breath to see what his recovery process is going to look like. But of course, we're awaiting now new details, with the press conference set to get going in just about 30 minutes, with the mayor, interim police chief, hospital officials and more, who -- we're expected to not just get more details about this but also a planned vigil later on, as this community tries to process what's happened and what is still happening, as many of them are still dealing with the aftermath of this.",

But here's what it really means. In this particular case, you have a shooter, who leaves a note at home for Mom and Dad and a friend. You know, think just back to the Nashville shooting, where she reaches out to a friend and, you know, contacts that person. This is the kind of \"I'm sorry about what I'm going to do and it's not your fault but I want you to understand\" note. The video is something completely different. That's a more aggressive posture, which is, \"I am broadcasting my taking of revenge against those who I feel wronged me. And I also want the world to see me as this strong figure.\"",

They are set upon immediately. The police don't get to choreographic it. They get to train for it but they always walk in, in the middle.It's a necessary fact in the active shooter dynamic. It's the shooter who gets to choreograph it. And his choreography is I'm livestreaming, I'm broadcasting; first, I'm taking revenge on those who I feel who wronged me. There's a conference room with the senior leadership of the bank that's firing me. And I'm taking that out on them. Now there's the pause. I'm waiting for the police. This is almost certainly classic suicide by cop. I'm going to wait for them to come. I'm going to engage. I'm going to shoot at them. They're going to shoot at me.

The harm and the fear of harm is real for so many people. That survey really pointing that out.What more can you tell us about the survey? DR. SANJAY GUPTA, CNN CHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, I think you're absolutely right, Sara. I mean, this sort of gives us an idea of the psyche of the citizens of this country around the issue of gun violence. As you well know, first of all, guns kill more children and teenagers than anything else in this country. It's hard to believe, more than car accidents. These kids and young people are dying from gun violence. So it's a real concern. What they tried to get at obviously in this survey was, what is the impact on the psychology, really? How often are people consumed or thinking about this? And as you point out, that the -- how much we've actually witnessed is a big part of this. Now 17 percent of people have seen someone get shot. Think about that, Sara. One in five people have seen someone get shot. It's really horrific; 19 percent saw a family member killed by a gun, suicide or homicide, and 21 percent threatened by a gun. And then the next question they ask is, so how often are you fearful of this issue then? Sometimes 40 percent, all the way to every day; 8 percent of people every day think about this issue for themselves. So it's sort of a snapshot into what is a pretty uniquely American phenomenon.",

That 17 percent really hits you in the gut, that 70 percent of people have this experience.Let me ask you about the 41 percent of the survey says, household, live with a gun. The survey saying that, it doesn't surprise me. I grew up in a rural part of this country, where they were prolific. People had them. Gun racks were still a thing. But this is a big number. We know there are more guns than there are human beings in the United States. What does it say about how these guns, though, are stored?",

There are more people who are acquiring these guns.But you're right. This isn't about ownership. This is about storage. That's what they tried to get out in this particular survey. And they were just trying to say, look, are we storing these safely? Because so many of these stories that you've covered, that I've covered, are about these guns that were acquired, sometimes in the own home but weren't stored correctly. So 36 percent of the time, more than a third of the time, they were stored loaded -- not supposed to happen; 44 percent, they're stored unlocked and 52 percent of the time they were stored with ammunition. Those are all basic sort of no-nos when it comes to storage. And this was, again, I think that the survey tried to get at, if we're not talking about owning guns, are we at least storing them in a safe manner? And the answer more than not is no.",

Sometimes worried about a 38 percent all the way to every day thinking about this issue; 12 percent of people. And again, these are surveys. It may be even higher than that in the wake of a shooting, Sara, as you might guess, for a period of time and in a difference in time. But for a period of time, I think every parent in the country is worried about school shootings. So it waxes and it wanes but it's increasingly, trend wise, becoming a problem.",

Independently, we are learning, though, that it does appear to be part of a broader set of documents that have been leaked online over the last month or so. And they appear consistent with the kind of intelligence that has been leaked in recent days here -- or at least, I should say, have surfaced in recent days. But look, this document, if true, if there were these conversations going on for Egypt to provide lethal aid to Russia at this moment, it would be potentially explosive, of course, because Egypt is one of the U.S.' closest allies in the Middle East. And it would suggest that Egypt now is getting closer to the Russians, when, in fact, publicly, they have tried to maintain a more neutral position when it comes to the war in Ukraine. Now it would also be kind of a slap in the face to the U.S. government, of course, because secretary of state Antony Blinken was actually just in Egypt at the end of January, talking about the U.S.- Egyptian partnership and how important it is for them to stand together in the phase of Russian aggression in Ukraine. Obviously, this would be a very -- this would cause a big fracture in the relationship if Egypt did move forward with this kind of production.
