Not because it's going to be easy to prove, I don't think that it will be, but just because of the weight and the scale of the charges. It goes to the worst thing Trump did in office, these destabilizing lies, an effort to shatter one of the bedrock principles of American democracy, of course, the peaceful transfer of power. And overall provoking an event on January 6 where violence was a predictable implication of stoking his base.It's really easy to get desensitized to Trump's behavior. He's innocent until proven guilty. Obviously, and this is going to be an adversarial process in court. But basically the indictment says that Trump has every right to spread mistruths. He has every right to complain about electoral integrity. But once that digresses into a conspiracy and one aimed at impeding the certification of ballots, then it becomes criminal and especially so because it was all predicated-on fraud and deceit.",

And what is there is this focus on the procedural steps Trump took to overturn the 2020 election. What's not there or only in the background is detail about Trump's actual role in whipping up a mob at the U.S. Capitol.And I think that was a strategic choice by special counsel Jack Smith. He wanted to keep the attention on the facts that he is actually thought were provable, maintain a sort of surgical precision in that way and not get lost in some of these legally dicey mazes that consumed I think much of Trump's second impeachment trial and much of the House select committee into January 6. Jack Smith's audience is, you know, a court of law and not the court of public opinion. So the kinds of conduct that he thinks he can prove at a very high threshold of guilt, they are a lot different than Trump's critics generally would use to make a political argument about his malfeasance or abuse of power.",

Because Trump's legal team is going to frame their defense essentially by saying that there was lack of reckless intent to commit the crime. That Trump was generally under the impression that the 2020 election was stolen and so he was just voicing his opinion without any clear malice.I think the problem for Trump though is that there's just so much evidence indicating that he was repeatedly told that there was no widespread election rigging, that he was informed this by high-ranking members of his own administration and his inner circle. Including Attorney General Bill Barr and yet he continued to make false statements. [04:10:00] So to me what's really the most striking about the indictment is just the relentless focus it places by the DOJ on this one point. You know, establishing that Trump has been acting out of willful bad faith and not just out of ignorance. It's a subjective point, but it's one that prosecutors are going to need to demonstrate beyond a reasonable doubt if they're going to secure a conviction.",

There goes the rain that's been cooling off the desert Southwest just a little bit.

But the rain does eventually make its way over that ridge and gets to St. Louis. I'll show you that in a bit. 31 days in a row, high temperatures 110 degrees or greater. That is a new record for Phoenix. Not the kind of record you want to break. And then for today we get to that 110 and we're back breaking a new record. It's broken so we have to start all over. Let's not do that. Temperatures all the way to 116 on your Sunday. So well above normal. Something else that's going to happen to all above normal, is all of this rainfall is going to come over the top of this ridge, over Nebraska and then back down across parts of St. Louis. This is the area Missouri, Illinois, that could pick up significant number of storms in a row. We call that training. One storm leaves and another storm comes right in the same place. And that training can cause significant flash flooding. We see one storm for Thursday, another one for Friday. It's just going to keep going in the same places.
