Concerns over President Joe Biden's commencement address at historically black Morehouse College in Atlanta as he tries to court an important group of voters. How will his views on the Israel-Hamas War play into the trip? And there is no body camera video available of the arrest of pro golfer Scottie Scheffler, but police are saying about why. With the Israeli military now fighting in parts of Gaza they previously cleared and ceasefire negotiations stalled, Benjamin Netanyahu is facing a new problem. A key member of his war cabinet has delivered an ultimatum. Benny Gantz says he will quit the war cabinet if Netanyahu doesn't lay out a plan to get the hostages back, establish a post-war government in Gaza and normalize relations with Saudi Arabia.

Not only would we not be seeing those scenes if enough aid were getting in, but you wouldn't need this $320 million floating pier that the U.S. has built and financed in the first place. And so you do have these scenes of people boarding, moving trucks, endangering their own lives just to get hold of some food. And I suppose at the same time, it couldn't have come at a more urgent time, because after Israel took control of the crossing between Rafah and Egypt, no more aid trucks have been going through what was the primary conduit for humanitarian aid to get into the Gaza Strip.Egypt says that with Israeli forces there, they cannot guarantee the safety of humanitarian aid deliveries because Hamas may attack Israeli forces there, as they have done at other Israeli crossings, such as Kerem Shalom, where four Israeli soldiers were killed the other week. So, you've got less aid getting through than was getting through beforehand after it was ramping up due to U.S. pressure on Israel. And so although this pier, the U.S. says that it plans to deliver 500 tons of aid every day, that still isn't enough. Most aid can get through it over land. And that aid is simply not getting through primarily now because of the Rafah crossing being closed between Gaza and Egypt. Kim?",

The event is meant to celebrate the graduating seniors, but it has come with a dose of controversy as some faculty and students have expressed frustration with President Biden's handling of the conflict in Gaza. That is an issue that has been of key concern to many young voters.The White House dispatched a senior official just last week to Morehouse College to meet with a small group of faculty and students. That meeting lasted a little over two hours, and I'm told that about half of it focused specifically on the issue of Gaza. But President Biden will face a very delicate balancing act as he gives his remarks on Sunday. One, there is the potential for possible protest due to his support for Israel in its war against Hamas, but then also the president is trying to navigate shoring up support among black voters, including young black men, black voters comprised a core part of Biden's constituency and coalition back in 2020 that sent him to the White House. But recent polling has shown some lagging support from that group. Now, President Biden stopped to meet with some black voters, supporters at a restaurant here in Atlanta, Georgia, on Saturday and talked about the accomplishments of his administration, but also warned the threat that Trump could pose if he's re-elected. President Biden also took a bit of a swipe at his rival. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN, U.S. PRESIDENT:  The fact is that this election, lots at stake, lots at stake. It's not about me. It's about the alternative as well. You know, I think it's fair to say I won't use the exact phrase I'd use if I was still playing ball, but my opponent is not a good loser. But he is a loser.

I spent some time in Morehouse the other day to take the temperature for a piece that I was working on for The Root, in which I shared some thoughts on what I, what I think the president should talk about during his commencement address. What I heard from students is that largely, Kim, a lot of the graduates were actually worried that their ceremony would be disrupted by protesters. I think a lot of these graduates came, as you can imagine, have been working hard for the past four years, including during the pandemic they've worked hard to walk across the stage later today, I guess it is, Kim. And so most of the students I talked to were sort of more ambivalent around the broader politics, which we might get to in a minute, versus on the issue of what's going on in the Middle East.

Things do seem different this time around. Trump leads in the polls. The state has passed voting restrictions. Democratic strategists don't like to hear it, but polls show black support for Trump is growing. And, again, Georgia could make all the difference. So compare it to the last election.

And as a proud Georgian, I think that's pretty cool.Look, I think, We're obviously not in a pandemic right now, the same way we were four years ago. So, it certainly feels very different in that respect. I think it's important to emphasize that President Biden's support among black voters is very solid and President Trump's support among black voters is abysmal. I don't think we're going to see a defection in mass of black voters from President Biden to former President Trump. I think what we could see, you know, in a state like Georgia is perhaps some of the younger black voters staying home. And so I think it's important, it's imperative that the Biden campaign make up that enthusiasm gap, because we know on the other side, President Trump's base is ready to come out. And so I think we're seeing the Biden campaign, especially in Georgia, recognize the opportunity that they have. You know, we're seeing a multimillion dollar ad spend among younger voters, among black voters. And a lot of that will be targeted, you know, in states like Georgia, in crucial swing states. We've seen the vice president, Vice President Harris, launch her economic opportunity tour. And where did she kick that off? Right here in Atlanta. So, I believe that the campaign recognizes what they have to do in putting the money and putting the time in finding the local voices, the trusted voices in the communities here in Georgia to deliver this election. I think we're seeing them do that between now and November. It's important to continue to do that. And I think we will see that.",

Authorities in Los Angeles are responding to a video obtained exclusively by CNN showing Sean Diddy Combs shoving, kicking, and dragging his then-girlfriend during a 2016 altercation in a hotel. Now despite the disturbing images, it seems unlikely the singer will be charged for the assault. CNN's Veronica Miracle has details.",

The city of Houston says the hurricane-like conditions and widespread power outages led to the spillage of more than 100,000 gallons of sanitary sewage but officials assure residents the city's drinking water remains safe. At least seven people died in the Houston area as a result of the storms.So, as authorities in Houston scramble to restore power amid climbing temperatures and humidity, millions across the central plains are now under severe weather threat.

Now, officials are saying that the power could stay out a couple of days, maybe even weeks in spots because of the way some of the transmitters were hit.This could be a problem as heat starts to build this weekend going into early next week. We'll find temperatures in the middle 90s, but that could feel even hotter than that once you factor in some of the humidity. Look at the heat index values approaching 100 to 105 from Brownsville, Texas, up near 100 in Corpus Christi. Heat index values in the middle 90s in Houston. Again, without power and air conditioning, this could pose a little bit more of a risk, so be careful to take breaks as you're cleaning up some of that damage. That heat builds in the south as another storm system develops there in the Rockies, and that's going to pose our next severe threat in the plains by Sunday and Monday. We're looking at a couple of round of storms with damaging winds, large hail and maybe some tornadoes possible, so we'll need to stay weather aware. You can see the storms are starting to fire up late on Sunday, especially across parts of Kentucky. Kansas going into Nebraska, and we'll have that front slowly start to work its way into the rest of the Midwest as we go into Monday with that continued storm threat. So, for Omaha, you're looking at temperatures above average before that front, with highs in the 80s and showers and storms roll through as we start out the work week, and those temperatures do get back closer to average with highs in the middle 70s.",

That's the question researchers are trying to answer because this reduced risk was seen across all groups in the study, even people who may not have lost as much weight as others. And as far as side effects go, the study didn't uncover any new safety concerns outside of side effects we already know about, like nausea, vomiting or diarrhea. But watching the long term effects of these drugs is so important because at least 25,000 people in the U.S. start a semaglutide each week. That number is more than the capacity at Madison Square Garden, which holds about 19,500 people. And as these drugs become more popular, lawmakers are worried about costs. A new Senate committee report this week, led by Senator Bernie Sanders, says, quote, the outrageously high prices of these drugs have the potential to bankrupt our entire health care system. Now, according to the report, Wegovy costs about more than $1,000 a month here in the United States, but it can be purchased for less in Europe at around $137 in Germany and about $92 in the United Kingdom. And there are so many reasons why different medications may cost more here in the United States than other places, but when it comes to semaglutides, these costs are getting a lot of attention right now. And tension is brewing between lawmakers and drug makers around this. Back to you.",
