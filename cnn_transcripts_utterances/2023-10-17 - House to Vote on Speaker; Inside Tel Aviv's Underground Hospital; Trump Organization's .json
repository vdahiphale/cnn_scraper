And, again, getting back to the messaging theme, there's clearly a message here to Iran not to unleash their surrogates, Hezbollah, in an all-out attack on the northern regions of Israel so that Israel doesn't -- isn't confronting a two-front war, which would be very daunting for them.So, again, that's what -- why the trip, as risky as it is, as pretty high stakes, and lots of messaging here. I'd also mention, I think this is implicitly a message of support to the loved ones of all the hostages, whether American or any other nationality. So, I think the president's conveying a lot of important messages here.",

And by CNN's count, Congressman Jim Jordan is still short of the 217 votes he needs to win the gavel.Let's get right to Capitol Hill. CNN's Lauren Fox is there.

      "sentences": "Yes, let's put this in perspective, John. He has made progress. Over the course of the last several days, he picked up some big endorsements from Mike Rogers, from Ann Wagner, people who on Friday were saying that they would never vote for Jim Jordan. Now, however, he still is short the votes he needs when he goes to the floor this afternoon.By CNN's tally, which has been kept meticulously by Haley Talbot, our House producer, one thing has become clear, there are nine members who are either leaning no or a hard no against Jim Jordan, and there are dozens more who have not made clear yet how they will vote on the floor of the House this afternoon. When the House opens at noon today, we expect that it will take about a half hour to 45 minutes before they will begin that first balloting of voting. And one thing to keep an eye on is, we don't expect that this will only go one round. One of the things that Jordan allies have been making clear to us is that they believe that even if they are short in that first round of votes, that they can continue to move and pick up support on the House floor if they go round after round. Now, the question becomes, how patient is the Republican majority with Jim Jordan? Are they going to be as patient as they were with Kevin McCarthy, giving him 15 opportunities to lock down the votes he needs? Another thing to keep an eye on, does he come to the floor with at least 200 votes? That was the floor that McCarthy had back in January and he never dipped below that. So, those are two things that I'm going to keep an eye on when Jim Jordan comes to the floor at noon. John.",

He can only lose - actually this first vote he can only lose three because he has one supporter who won't be there for the first vote. But three or four max he can lose. Five definitely not. So, if you are expect -- your expectation should be that Jim Jordan, if this chart is right, will not win on the first ballot. It could be a long afternoon.Lauren Fox, thank you very much.

      "sentences": "Yes, Kate, let me first start with what we're not expecting to happen, and that is a face-off between the former president and his former personal attorney fixer, turned foe, Michael Cohen. He actually was supposed to testify in this civil fraud trial today, heading into this week, but he had a medical issue, got a doctor's note, and now he is no longer testifying. There was some speculation as to why not, knowing that the former president was going to be here for that testimony. He went on Twitter saying he's not bowing out, he's not nervous about it and that he is going to testify. We do expect that to happen sometime next week.Keep in mind, the bigger picture here, Michael Cohen is the person -- part of the reason, a major reason, as to why this entire civil trial even started because his 2019 testimony to lawmakers said that the former president did inflate his assets. And that is why the New York attorney general eventually sued in this trial. So, we do expect that testimony to happen, just not today. Testimony we do expect to happen will be continuing from Trump Organization members talking about the bookkeeping, talking about getting to the nitty-gritty details of how assets were determined, how everything is sort of figured out inside the Trump Organization. So, the former president is inside the courtroom. We wonder if he is going to say anything, as he did when he first came to this trial in the - in the first days of it, if he's going to say anything outside the courtroom doors. So we'll be expecting to wait for that. But we will continue to follow the updates inside that courtroom, Kate. [09:50:02] BOLDUAN: Absolutely. Brynn, thank you so much for being there. John.",
