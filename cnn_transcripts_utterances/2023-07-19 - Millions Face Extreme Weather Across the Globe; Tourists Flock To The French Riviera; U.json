Here in Paris, a little bit cooler than where you are tonight, Richard, but still nine regions ofFrance that remain on high alert because they fear that tomorrow, the temperatures will rise higher still. Already yesterday was nine different towns that saw all-time records, they simply hadn't seen those temperatures before, rather than like what we've seen in parts of Italy and of Greece. The fear is that it's going to get worse in part, so Spain is likely to see a little respite, but those very high temperatures you mentioned in Italy, and Greece, specifically, where they're simply not getting those fires under control, likely to rise still further. And I think, Richard, that's the point. It's not just that these are very high temperatures in particular localities of different parts of the European continent, it is the sustained nature of these heatwaves that have just gone on for so long, and the meteorologists predict that over the next weeks, we're likely to continue to see sustained, abnormally high temperatures, and that of course, has a huge impact on life itself, on tourism, for now, not being felt but likely to be felt in the future -- Richard.",

Once the soil,the ground was parched, those wildfires you will remember spreading as far as London. The fear is now that although we're seeing them for the time being in Greece, a few in Switzerland as well, unusually, that over the next few weeks, as that parched land continues to bake, you're going to see that spread much more. In fact, the European Union is now having to have a fleet of Canadair, those planes they can send to European countries to try to get the fires on control, they now have that within the control of Brussels since last year, because, Richard, this is likely to continue. What Europe is having to do now is deal summer after summer with prolonged periods of heat, all of that brings with it with fires in parts of the country that we simply hadn't seen before. So many of those planes now in Greece trying to help them there. The fear is that that could happen, of course, elsewhere. No respite in sight, and of course for the tourists, at this season, when you have a huge majority of the tourism to Europe, people come in July and August, many of those tourists simply weren't expecting the kind of scenes they saw the Colosseum in Rome closing, the Acropolis in Athens. It's simply too hot to function. And remember, this is a continent, we simply don't do air conditioning. It's a tiny proportion of homes that are equipped. So for the tourists, it's getting difficult and for Europe, it's about thinking how they're going to function completely different to how they have so far -- Richard.",

Adanian Labs is just one example of local tech success here, founded in Kenya and active across several African countries, Adanian is on a mission to cultivate startups in the technology field. IRENE KIWIA, CO-FOUNDER, ADANIAN LABS: So we're a technology company, a Pan-African technology company, and what has really founded as was our mission to actuate the tech revolution on the continent, by making sure that Africans are an active and proactive participants in the Fourth Industrial Revolution. I mean, the good thing about Africa, Kenya, and you know, Sub Sahara Africa is a young continent, right? So there's a lot of vibrant young people, and they're all looking to create value for themselves, create wealth for themselves. Unfortunately, Africa as a continent has so many things that are a challenge, but that's where the opportunity is. So technology allows us to leapfrog things in a way that we're not able to do before. If you look at the African history, we've missed the Industrial Revolution, we've missed a couple of things.
