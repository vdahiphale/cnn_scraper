And as you said, listen, in recent years we have seen a very public feud between Michael Cohen and Donald Trump whether it be on social media, in interviews, but this is going to be the first time that they are in the same room together.And much of Cohen's testimony is going to focus on when he was in the room with his boss at the time talking about financial statements, talking about Donald Trump's net worth and the discussions they had according to the attorney general about how the Trumps inflated their net worth to get business loans. So, it's going to be interesting testimony. Certainly something that everyone will be very clued in on essentially -- for Donald Trump especially, rather, because he has been very, you know, into the testimony that he's listening to, but this is certainly one of a different level. We are also expecting to hear from one other witness before Michael Cohen takes the stand today, but we're waiting to hear what he has to say before he leaves his New York apartment. I'm sure we'll hear from the former president because he always talks before he heads into that New York courtroom. So, we'll hear what they have to say about each other. But it will be a dramatic day here definitely at the New York courthouse when Cohen does eventually take the stand later this morning.",

JOSH BARRO, WRITER, \"VERY SERIOUS\" NEWSLETTER: Well, the problem with Michael Cohen as a witness is that he's a convicted felon. Convicted of crimes including perjury. And so what I would expect the attorney general will be doing with his testimony is bringing him on to talk about things that they can also then provide documentary evidence to back up, whether that's emails or text messages or that sort of thing. He was in these rooms, and it makes sense that you would want him there to talk about what was said in the rooms. But there's - I - I - there's going to have to be a trust but verify thing about it because the Trump team, not unreasonably, will say Cohen is a convicted liar and you can't just take his word all by itself.",

      "sentences": "Well, it was really moving because, like many of you, I'd spoken to her daughter. She came into the studio here just a few days ago. And she spoke so movingly about her elderly parents, how they were really peaceniks, how her father had, you know, gone to the border and given rides to Palestinians who were trying to get jobs inside Israel over the - over the past few years. So, it was very moving to see that her mother has been released. And there she is, Sharone, sitting with her.The details about the tunnel complex, about the health care, about the food, about where they were, we understand in the south of Gaza, which, as you know, is where the Israelis have told Palestinians to move to from northern Gaza. So, interesting that the Hamas captors kept at least her and her group of hostages in the south, potentially thinking that that was a more security part. It sort of dovetails a little bit with what I've been speaking to by phone to some Hamas spokespeople. I asked them, from the beginning, how they're treating, what they're doing with the hostages, when they would let them go, et cetera. And from the beginning they said they were treating them well. And that kind of makes sense because she - she, you know, she made that clear that they were treated well because, as cynical as it sounds, they are also, you know, currency. They need to be treated well in order for them to be released and for Hamas, if they think they can negotiate, to get anybody back. So, I found that very interesting. And, clearly, the network of tunnels, very interesting. The difference between how she was treated compared to how roughly she was man handled when - when the, you know, terrorist attack took place on their kibbutz. She described how she had been taken and essentially slammed onto the back of a motorbike. And she's elderly. She's 85 years old. And - and sort of had to kind of lie down on the side of this motorbike. But, yes, it was a really - you know, the - a first description of what - of what - of what's going on inside Gaza, certainly for her group of hostages.",

As we couple that with Netanyahu saying, look, a very long wars is ahead. The IDF saying, we're ready to go by air, land and sea.From all your reporting over so many years in the region, do you think Israel pauses, waits and hopes for a big group of hostages to come out?",
