The Prime Minister has reportedly suggested that the Palestinian Authority wants to destroy Israel in stages, unlike Hamas. A senior administration official for the U.S. said just last night that the Palestinian Authority needs to be revamped and revitalized. So given that, do you believe Abbas is best positioned to lead the Palestinian Authority into whatever happens next in Gaza into whatever happens next in the region?And then secondly, I know you've had some conversations about what's happening more broadly regionally. Do you have any indication or any concern that the Prime Minister is poised to launch a bigger campaign against Hezbollah in the north?",

      "sentences": "So, taking your second question first, as I have said and others in our government have said, we believe that ultimately the citizens of Israel who have been evacuated from the north have to be able to return to their homes and have to be able to do so with a true sense of security. And that means dealing with the threat that comes from the other side of the border.But we also believe that that threat can be dealt with through diplomacy and does not require the launching of a new war. Now it requires not just diplomacy, but as I said in my opening deterrents as well, because we need to send a clear message that we will not tolerate the kinds of threats and terrorist activity that we have seen from Hezbollah and from the territory of Lebanon. But in our view, and I reaffirmed this yesterday, the best way to do this is to come up with a negotiated outcome -- excuse me -- in which those Israeli citizens in those communities up on the northern border can know that they are not going to be subject to an attack that would take their lives or destroy their communities. We'll continue to work at that. And I believe that we can accomplish that. And that is going to be a significant priority for the United States. When it comes to the Palestinian Authority, I am not going to characterize personalities. What I'm going to say is at a basic level, we do believe that the Palestinian Authority needs to be revamped and revitalized, needs to be updated in terms of its method of governance, its representation of the Palestinian people. And that will require a lot of work by everybody who is engaged in the Palestinian Authority. Starting with the president. Mahmoud Abbas, who I will go see. And ultimately, it's going to be up to the Palestinian people to work through their representation, and it will be up to those leaders of the Palestinian Authority to work through the types of steps that they need to take to reform and update the Authority for the situation we face today. The United States will be a partner in that, with them, respectfully, you know, and we will be there to try to support their efforts to ultimately deliver a vision in which Israelis and Palestinians live side by side in peace and security.

      "sentences": "Look, I think we have to take a step back and put in context what has happened since October 7th. On October 7th you had a terrorist group, Hamas, come across the border from Gaza into Israel and massacre 1,200 people in a brutal and savage way. They then turned around and went back into Gaza and hid behind a civilian population, using civilians as human shields, using protected sites like hospitals and schools for military purposes. Embedding themselves among the innocent Palestinian people and continuing to fire rockets at Israeli cities and continuing to go out on the airwaves and say we're going to commit October 7th again and again and again. And go out and state we're in a permanent state of war with Israel. And go out and state, we would like to see Israel's right to exist eliminated.So that is the reality that the IDF is contending with when it goes in. It doesn't have the opportunity to meet Hamas on a field of battle in a way in which civilians are off to one side and the terrorists are off to the other side. The terrorists chose to embed themselves among civilians. And that creates an incredible burden on the IDF. A burden that is unusual for a military in today's day and age. Now, that burden does not lessen the IDF's responsibility to act in a way that distinguishes between terrorist targets and innocent people, and to take every precaution to protect civilians and minimize the loss of life. It also doesn't lessen the burden, by the way, to ensure that humanitarian assistance flows in sufficient quantities that the Palestinian people have access to the food, water, medicine, sanitation that they don't just need that they deserve as a basic matter of dignity, of human beings. And so, those are messages that we have conveyed quite clearly to the Israeli people. But what I think has been lost a little bit in this whole debate is the responsibility that sits with Hamas. Who not only is doing all the things I just described to put the Palestinian people in a terrible position, but is also holding more than 100 hostages still to this day, men, women, children in tunnels, in circumstances that are dire and deteriorating. So, our position from the very first day of this conflict has been that Israel has the right to go after Hamas in these difficult circumstances, and also has the responsibility to do so in a way that comports with our values, with international humanitarian law, and with the strategic necessity to see that fundamental difference between innocent Palestinian people and these evil terrorists of Hamas. And that is a position that we have stated publicly. It is a message we drive in very granular terms privately in the conduct of these operations and we will continue to do so as we go forward. I'll take one last question from Roy. Why not? Oh, channel. OK, no problem.",

      "sentences": "So first on the Houthis, as I said last night on, I think your network. The Houthis represent material threat to freedom of navigation to commercial shipping, to lawful commerce, and they're doing so in a vital artery there at the Bab-el-Mandeb and into the Red Sea. And the United States is working with the international community with partners from the region and from all over the world to deal with this threat. We are building a coalition. We are working to ensure that -- and rally the nations of the world, all of whom have an interest in seeing this stop.This is not about the United States and Israel. This is about the entire international community. And we will continue to take every step that we deem necessary and appropriate to deal with the threat that the Houthis pose. And to your question, also deal with the fact that while the Houthis are pulling the trigger, so to speak, they're being handed the gun by Iran and Iran has a responsibility to take steps themselves to cease these attacks. Because these attacks, as I said before, are a fundamental threat to international law and to international peace and security. And we will continue to consult about the best way forward, the best means of response. Secretary Austin will be in the region in just a couple of days, not just here in Israel, but in Manama as well to continue to work on what the most appropriate response is. That response in our view shouldn't just be the United States. It should be a broader coalition of countries working together in concert and that is what we intend. With respect to the hostages, I can't speak specifically to German intelligence and their role. What I will say is from our perspective, the more ideas, energy and efforts that can be pursued, including with good partners like Germany, bring it on. I mean, that -- it would be good to be able to work with them in all of this. But the main effort to date in terms of the first round of hostage releases and the continuing discussions involve Israel, the United States, Qatar, Egypt and we will look to other partners for their ideas and their thoughts on this as we go forward. And I think you asked another question, but I may have forgotten it. Maybe that's it. Oh, is Israel? Yeah. Yes. I believe it is a priority of the government to bring everyone home. I heard that in stereo yesterday in my conversations. It is a paramount priority of the United States, for our citizens, but also for all of the rest of the hostages, and I found it to be a priority for every member of the government. And then as I said, something that the director of the Mossad is working intensively at the direction of the government in a way that, frankly, I find it admirable in his personal efforts. And we will continue our work on this and we'll continue to work closely with the Israeli Government. Thank you guys.",

That's what Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan told his U.S. counterpart Joe Biden during a phone call. And that's according to a readout from the Turkish government. President Erdogan said the way to do that is to use American support for Israel as leverage. Let's turn to Scott McLean, who's live in Istanbul.

      "sentences": "That's right, Max. Turkey, of course, is a NATO ally, but Joe Biden and Recep Erdogan have not had a direct conversation. At least one that's publicly known, since the conflict in Gaza began. Erdogan has been one of the most outspoken critics of Israel, and obviously Biden has been one of its closest allies. And when you compare the readouts from each respective country on how this call went, it is really, really remarkable to see how little crossover there actually is. There's no indication, at least on my reading of it, that they really agreed on anything at all.Of course, you have Biden saying that the U.S. supports Israel's right to defend itself, and then Erdogan's side is saying that, look, the U.S. should withdraw its unconditional support for Israel in order to get a ceasefire. And the fundamental problem here is that. Turkey and the United States see this conflict, they see Israel. They see Hamas fundamentally differently. Turkey views Israel as the terrorist state -- in Erdogan's word. And does not view Hamas as a terror group. And I had a conversation this week with Erdogan's chief adviser on foreign policy and security, and I asked him about a few things, but one of them was unconfirmed reports that the Hamas leader was actually in Turkey on October the 7th. I also asked him about the fact that Hamas leaders are able to come and go freely from this country, here's part of the conversation. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MCLEAN: A lot of people in the West will wonder why Turkey has agreed to host Hamas members at all. AKIF CAGATAY KILIC, TURKISH PRESIDENT'S CHIEF ADVISOR ON FOREIGN POLICY AND SECURITY: Well, you see, they're asking that question today. But the issue is we have been trying to resolve the Palestinian, Palestinian/Israeli conflict for a long time now. And whether people like it or not, the fact is that Fatah and Hamas are part of this. They are part of the Palestinian people and they are part of this process.",

Germany's federal prosecutor says authorities arrested three people in Germany and one in the Netherlands. They are accused of being long standing members of Hamas. Authorities say the suspects allegedly started searching for a, quote, underground weapons cash in Europe for Hamas earlier this year. And in what appears to be a separate incident, three people were arrested in Denmark and one in the Netherlands for terrorism offences. Israeli authorities say the suspects were, quote, acting on behalf of the Hamas terrorist organization, but didn't provide any further information.

Yesterday, people were expecting the summit that was due to end Friday afternoon to stretch all the way through until Sunday, that it would be incredibly difficult and marathon set of meetings. But then, unexpectedly, Viktor Orban essentially abstain from the vote to allow Ukraine to continue on its path towards European Union membership and officially start those negotiations.Now it's taken quite a few hours, but we've got a good sense of what happened now and it really was a surprise. So apparently Olaf Scholz, Emmanuel Macron had tried to argue with Viktor Orban and say that your issues with Ukraine taking this next step don't hold up. And also a lot of diplomats saying it's quite rich, given that Hungary has its own issues with the rule of law. So that Olaf Scholz had suggested to Viktor Orban, why don't you just grab a coffee outside, i.e., leave the room so that we can get on. Do this vote without you and under unanimous voting they could. No one we've spoken to knows if that's ever happened before, but it was definitely a surprise turn of events. But then Viktor Orban blocked this 50 billion euro package, which was intended to give Ukraine support for its economy through next year, and the next four years. That is likely to be discussed in January. Leaders are optimistic about it, but it's probably the case that Viktor Orban can't concede two things at this summit. So he's allowed Ukraine to continue with these discussions to become an EU member, but he probably can't countenance domestically giving the green light to that 50 billion euro fund. So that may still come. But President Zelenskyy acknowledged that this next step, becoming a member of the European Union, will be a difficult process and probably a long time in coming. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT (through translator): Today we have the decision to start negotiations on joining the EU. After this step, there will be further ones. It's a big job to integrate the state, all institutions, all norms, all this to the European Union, but we'll do it. Ukraine has proven more than once what it's capable of. There will be another victorious decision. There will be a time when we can celebrate Ukraine's accession to the EU. Now in Ukraine, many people are in high spirits and this is important. It is motivation. (END VIDEO CLIP)",
