Plus, pressure grows on the Democratic U.S. Senator under indictment, accused of taking gold bars and many other expensive glittery things as bribes.And new this morning, the big breakthrough in Hollywood. Writers just reached a tentative deal with studios to end their strike. Good day to our viewers here in the United States and around the world, I'm Kasie Hunt, it is Monday, September 25th, shortly after 5:00 a.m. here in Washington, where a government shutdown just five days away, it's 2:00 a.m. out west, where Republican candidates already starting to camp out ahead of Wednesday's presidential debate at the Reagan presidential library. And President Biden and former President Trump both preparing to head to Detroit, where workers are on strike against the big three automakers. And we haven't even gotten to the senator who was busted with wads of ill-gotten cash and gold bars in his monogrammed jacket pockets. It's a long way of saying, this is going to be an incredibly consequential week for our country. Let's dig in. This morning, agencies across the government and Americans across the country are bracing for a shutdown that would furlough millions of workers, contribute to travel delays, likely hurt border security and even disrupt paychecks for U.S. troops if it continues long enough. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. MARK KELLY (D-AZ):  I'm really concerned about next week of the government shutting down. If there's a government shutdown, border patrol agents are not going to get paid. This is going to -- I mean, if we think it's bad today, just think about what that looks like.",

With this shutdown looming, obviously, this is really all about infighting in the GOP. They just can't get it together.But the reality is, there are really devastating consequences if this shutdown indeed happens, and honestly, all my sources are telling me that it seems inevitable at this point.

You saw the Transportation Secretary, Pete Buttigieg talk a little bit about how this might affect flight delays.I know, I've certainly dealt with this in my life. I think a lot of Americans have experienced those issues, they're likely to get worse here. I mean, we saw during the last prolonged shutdown, yes, they wanted TSA agents to show up, but a lot of them called out sick because they weren't getting paid, they were going -- you know, some of them talked about, I remember, driving Uber and other things to try to make ends meet, just because they were forced to.

This people just want to bring the house down. All right, let's switch gears, I want to talk about Senator Bob Menendez; the New Jersey Democrat obviously under pressure.More and more of his state's congressional delegations are calling on him to resign after he was indicted for this. And to any of you who, you know, turned off the TV on Friday, didn't watch over the weekend, if you haven't seen these pictures, they really speak for themselves, and they're worth looking at, even if you didn't see them before, you can see wads of cash, gold bars, those jackets they got senators. The senator's monogram plastered across them, that's a convertible that they bought for his wife. The allegations are that he took these bribes in exchange for using his powerful role as chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee to help Egyptian-American business associates, who according to the filing also purchased that car for his wife, and they paid her for a job that required little to no work. His fellow Democratic senators seemed to squirm when they were asked about it over the weekend. Take a look. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. DICK DURBIN (D-IL):  This is a very serious charge, there's no question about it. In terms of resignation, that's a decision to be made by Senator Menendez and the people of New Jersey. SEN. KELLY (D-AZ):  These are serious and shocking charges, bribery, corruption. I've never seen anything like this. I think Senator Menendez is going to have to think long and hard about the cloud that's going to hang over his service in the United States Senate. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

The allegation, but it doesn't seem like that's the case so far. And his wife's liars have also said that they have not -- you know, that she's innocent. So, I think they're going to deal with her on this, because he's done that before. You know, he's really fought through these allegations and succeeded.

I speak to Indian journalists quite regularly and they can't get access to Modi.They feel suppressed by Modi, there's lots of values that India doesn't share with the United States. I think it is a big challenge. But economically, India is growing. It could -- it's set to become the third largest economy in the world. America needs another economy to work with, it also needs a diplomatic ally, a conduit between China and the U.S. For example, I just think they're all sitting there in Washington right now, trying to work out how to handle this. They don't want to upset India. They don't want to upset Canada. And what they're saying is really important for Canada to investigate this.
