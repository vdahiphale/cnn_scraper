Cheung pointed to a report published earlier this week from Microsoft. He said in a statement, these documents were obtained illegally from foreign sources hostile to the United States, intended to interfere with the 2024 election and sow chaos throughout the democratic process. On Friday, a new report from Microsoft found that Iranian hackers broke into the account of a high-ranking official on a U.S. presidential campaign in June 2024, which coincides with the close timing of President Trump's selection of a vice-presidential nominee. Now, this Microsoft report which was released earlier this week, it said that a hacking group associated with Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, they attempted to break into the account of a high- ranking campaign official in June. They did not say which campaign it was or if it was successful. So it's not yet clear that it was a Iran that was behind this hacking, Jessica.",

Now we get some swing state polling showing something very similar. All right. These are in the Great Lakes battleground states. We're talking about Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Michigan. You go back to May, what you see, you saw that -- a pretty tight race between Joe Biden and Donald Trump. But you see more red than blue on the screen. Of course, all three of these states were states that Joe Biden carried last time around. [17:04:51] ENTEN: You saw a three-point lead for Trump in Pennsylvania, one well within the margin of error in Wisconsin, and then a one-point lead for Biden in Michigan. But look at where we are now. This is the type of movement the Harris campaign has been looking for. Look in Pennsylvania, a four-point advantage; Wisconsin, a four-point advantage; Michigan, a four-point advantage. And in all three of these states, we see clear movement towards the Democratic nominee. I will point out we're still in no-clear-leader land in this particular instance. But the Harris campaign has to love this movement: seven points in Pennsylvania, five points to Wisconsin, and three points in the great state of Michigan. All moving towards Kamala Harris and she has the advantage in all three, although again, no clear leader within the margin of error.",

This is an aggregate, of course, across Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. You go back to June, what do you see? You saw Trump on average up by two points, very similar to what we saw in the \"New York Times\"/Siena College poll. Look at where we are now -- the August margin between Harris and Trump. And look at what we see here. We see Harris up by two points. Again, no clear leader, but that four-point movement, very similar to what we saw in the \"New York Times\"/Siena College poll. And this is what we're seeing across the polling data. It's not just one poll, it's not just one pollster. It's across pollsters. It's across polls. And of course, in these Great Lakes battleground states, they're going to be so important. We're seeing this four-point move with, instead of seeing a small Republican lead, were seeing a small Democratic Party lead. And in this particular case, a small Kamala Harris lead over Donald Trump, the reverse of what we were just seeing just two months ago.",

We're talking about Wisconsin, we're talking Michigan, we're talking Pennsylvania.If we give those three states to Kamala Harris, even if she loses in Nevada, Arizona and Georgia, which are far from guaranteed. These, of course were three states that Joe Biden carried last time around, but in which the Democrats were falling a little bit short of their 2020 numbers, at least in recent data, at least when Joe Biden was in the race. But if we give Harris Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania -- look at that. She doesn't even need these Sun Belt battleground states. She gets to exactly 270 electoral votes. So the fact is, when you see those polls in those Great Lakes battleground states, and you see that Harris has turned the tide around from basically, you know, Donald Trump being slightly ahead to now Harris being slightly ahead, that could be the entire ball game. Even if she loses down south, if she wins up north, that's enough. That gets her to exactly 270 electoral votes.

And the reason I say that is because how far off were the polls on August 10 compared to the final margin in Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin on average in 2016?The average from the polls at this point to the final margin nine points across those three states. How about in 2020? Look at that. The average movement from the final poll -- from the polls at this point to the final margin. Look at that. Five points. So the fact is, yes, Kamala Harris may be slightly ahead right now. Again, though, a race which -- in which there's no clear leader within the margin of error, but that could easily turn around in the final, let's say, a little bit less than three months to go. There's still a lot of campaign to go. We've got a Democratic National Convention to go. We probably have at least one more debate to go. So still a lot can change. But at the end of the day, Jessica, if you're the Democratic Party and you were looking at the polls to three months ago and you compare it where you look now, I think for no doubt they'd rather look at this picture in August than the picture they were looking at in May. It's a much more rosy picture for the Democratic Party. But still a lot of campaign ago, Jessica.",

You're not hearing that out of this Trump campaign, at least not yet. Now, there was a really fantastic report in \"The New York Times\" this morning and it jives with some of the things I knew, although they've got a lot of news in there. You should read it, where Trump is angry. He's not handling this well. And even prior to this, I think it was on CNN on Thursday on \"OUT FRONT\" on Erin Burnett's show. I guess Erica Hill was there, of course. And one of the things that I made clear there was that even though Trump is not admitting that he was losing, and that doesn't mean he's lost, his body language is communicating that he is. He's acting in such a way where you can just tell that he's nervous, he's unsettled and \"The New York Times\" reported quite clearly that he's told people, he's told donors, look I'm angry. They want him to get on message. They want him to be clearer and more concise. He's not doing it. So they're in a bit of a troubling death spiral at the moment. Maybe death spiral is a little too strong, people can misconstrue that. They're in a negative feedback loop. With positive -- or positive feedback loop with negative consequences.

Rescue workers arrived on the scene. And really the video we've been looking through all day, Wolf, it looks like a scene from a horror movie, honestly. Very, very gruesome indeed. Now we have heard -- an English statement has come out from IDF spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari, where he acknowledges that they understand that the schools, while they're not in session, they are de facto shelters. According to the Gaza civil defense 6,000 people -- people were sheltering in this specific location. Hagari says that -- and we've heard this many times before -- that Hamas is using these types of shelters as command-and-control centers. And he goes on to say that this specific type of munition that the IDF used for this strike could not create those casualties, could not create that level of damage. Now, we actually found some footage of one of the munitions used. It's called the GBU-39 small diameter bomb. It's U.S. made, produced by Boeing. We spoke to two different weapons experts, one of them a former U.S. army bomb technician, who said that if the room was crowded with a lot of people, that even smaller munitions like that can cause very high casualty rates. Again, the Gaza Civil Defense is saying that there were 200 people roughly who were gathered in that room for that prayer. So we're not on the ground Gaza, we don't have eyes exactly to say how many people were killed but we are seeing international condemnation coming flooding in and judging from those pictures that I have been wading through all day, Wolf, it was a very gruesome and horrific scene.",

Israel Defense Forces say a top Islamic jihad commander was likely at the school that was struck today in Gaza.A warning, the video you're about to see may be disturbing. At least 93 Palestinians were killed and more injured, according to Gaza officials. The Israeli military says it's not clear yet if that commander was at the location at the time of the airstrike. But it says there is a high probability that Ashraf Juda was at the school that was targeted. That's coming in from the IDF chief spokesman, retired Admiral Daniel Hagari. Israel is telling CNN that they took steps to mitigate civilian casualties and that Hamas terrorists we're operating a base in that area. All this comes as both Israel and Hamas were set to resume ceasefire talks this coming week, this coming Thursday. I want to discuss what's going on, the latest developments in those ceasefire and hostage negotiations with Ruby Chen. His son, Itay Chen, an IDF soldier who was killed on October 7th. Ruby Chen has been advocating ever since to bring home all the hostages, alive and dead, including his son's remains. Ruby Chen is joining us right now. Ruby, what's your thoughts right now? This Israeli attack on this mosque and the school, resulting in casualties. How's that going to impact the opportunity potentially to bring home all the remaining Israel hostages? RUBY CHEN, FATHER OF ITAY CHEN, IDF SOLDIER KILLED ON OCT 7: Yes, so at least what I think, Wolf, is that there's a time, especially now, that we all kind of like at that two-minute warning before getting in. We need to think what is strategic and not strategic to help us get that hostage deal. And I would question and ask, you know, is this attack helpful to get us to that finish line or not? Yes, of course, they feel unfortunate that these things happen. We did not enjoy seeing these things happen. We do not like to see people, innocent people killed. It's time after 10 months put this to rest.",

And we urge Mr. Sullivant to say that if these talks do not consume to a deal, then maybe that template that was built to at least the U.S. hostages with Russia, where Mr. Biden made a very tough decision. But it was leadership. And he took that tough decision to get these U.S. hostages out. And we urged Mr. Sullivan to think again, if this week is not going to where we are planning to go.

People are so excited. Tell us how they did it. PATRICK SNELL, CNN \"WORLD SPORT\" HOST: Yes, another gold medal, Jessica, for Team USA. They just dominate this competition, don't they? Over the years, it's been really one-sided. Only three other countries have ever interrupted that dominance. Those nation on this occasion, France, led by Victor Wembanyama, the latest to try and stop the Americans. The young phenom with 26 points. But it wasn't enough. A balanced American can attack, led by those superstars, as you mentioned. LeBron James, Steph Curry leading the way for team USA, beating France 98 points to 87. That's a fifth straight, yes, a fifth- straight gold for the American team. And a developing story off the field. This is highly significant. The American gymnasts, Jordan Chiles, may soon have to return the bronze medal she won on the floor exercise earlier in the week after a ruling from the Court of Arbitration for Sport. Remember the bronze medal was originally awarded to Romanian teen, Ana Barbosu. Chiles had finished fifth originally. But then successfully challenged, she thought, the difficulty score, which added 0.1 to a tally. The American was then moved up to third behind compatriot, Simone Biles, and Brazil's Rebeca Andrade, who won gold. But earlier, on this Saturday, the Court of Arbitration for Sport ruling the initial inquiry made by the USA was filed after the one- minute deadline. Now we're learning the International Gymnastics Federation saying it, too, would restore third place position to Barbosu, the 18-year-old. Following that cast decision. But said it would now be up to the International Olympic Committee, the IOC, to restore the actual medal itself. This is very much, Jessica, a developing story, and we are following it every step of the way. Back to you.",
