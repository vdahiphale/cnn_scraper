Why do you think Xi is so stubbornly clinging onto this policy? DALYimmunologists have said that if China had an America-like regime, that would result in 1.5 million Chinese deaths and Xi has said that he is not willing to do that, but he is willing to harm the economy to save lives.

The American consumers probably can't do it. And we have to be a little careful. The more support Americans show for the protests, which again may already have ended, we don't know yet. The more support we show, the more credibility we give to China's leaders who will say this has all been orchestrated by outsiders and there's a color revolution fomented by the United States, which is what they say about Hong Kong, what they've said about other places within China. And so, we don't want to give credibility to that. Phil Mattingly just mentioned the caution of the White House.

A village in southern Ukraine torn to shreds, and until now abandoned to this war. (Inaudible) told me he's lived here 51 years, and after evacuating for eight months, his home to stay, even amid this wreckage. It's like a stone weighing on my soul, he says.

A short distance away in newly liberated Kherson, a pool of blood where Russia is attacking the city it just left behind. Four were killed when this grocery store was hit, now one desperate resident picks through the debris, looting scraps of food and toilet paper. Is everything so bad, we asked. It's not good, he responds. (On camera):  All right, well, getting basic supplies in Kherson has become a massive risk. We've come to the seaport, well, it's the riverport really, right on the Dnipro Liver, with this woman here, Tatiana (ph) from Kherson, to collect water so she can do her washing up and wash her clothes and go to the toilet and things like that. The water supplies have been completely cut off by the Russians. This is the only way -- and you can hear the artillery shells going off in the background -- this is the only way she can get water for her house.

Democracy, you love to see it. Can you -- is there anything to be seen into who is voting and where they're voting as to how this might go? TIA MITCHELL, WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT, THE ATLANTA JOURNAL- CONSTITUTION:  Well, we know over the weekend it looked like because voting was optional in the counties and all the lawsuits and everything over that Saturday voting, most of the counties were Democratic leaning, those larger heavily Democratic counties. The Republican counties tend to be smaller. So, going into the statewide early voting, you would think that Warnock had a little bit of an edge, but now that we see every county, all 159, there's robust turnout statewide, which you would expect because it's such a condensed period. So, instead of having two weeks of early voting in multiple weekends, you've got one. And so, it's clear that this is an option that voters enjoy.",

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) HADAS GOLD, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): These have become frequent images this year across Israel and the Palestinian territories. Funerals last week in Nablus for 16-year-old Ahmad Amjad Shehada and to Jerusalem for 15-year-old Canadian Israeli Aryeh Schupak, both killed on Wednesday on their way to school. In another world, they might have been classmates. But here, they are the latest victims of a decades old conflict that is rearing its head to new heights. With a month left to go, 2022 is already the deadliest year for Palestinians and Israelis across Israel in the West Bank since the early 2000s, according to a CNN analysis of official numbers from both Israel and the Palestinian authority, setting up alarm across the world. UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translation): I hope that Israeli and Palestinian authorities take this search for dialogue to heart in a greater way, building reciprocal trust, without which there will never be a solution for peace in the Holy Land. GOLD (voice-over): 150 Palestinian combatants and civilians have been killed so far this year in the occupied West Bank in Israel, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health. Well, Israel says most of the Palestinians killed were militants or engaging violently with their soldiers. Human rights groups say dozens of unarmed civilians have been caught up as well. The Israeli government says 31 Israelis and foreigners have been killed in Palestinian attacks, a number that includes soldiers and civilians during shootings, stabbings and ramblings. And then last Wednesday, twin bombings killed two in Jerusalem, a type of attack not seen in years. The U.N.'s Middle East envoy warning that the situation is running out of control.",
