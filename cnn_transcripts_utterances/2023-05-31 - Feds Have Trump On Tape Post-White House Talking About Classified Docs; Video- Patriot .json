Plus, a new message from the head of the Russian private army, the Wagner Group, and this is directly to CNN. We are learning new details about just how paranoid Putin has become about other Russians. And we've got that for you this hour. Plus, a court clearing the way for a Manson family member to be granted parole. Will the Manson follower now in her 70s go free? Let's go \"OUTFRONT. And good evening. I'm Erin Burnett. OUTFRONT tonight, Trump on tape. Federal prosecutors now have Trump's own words as key evidence in its classified documents investigation. According to sources, Trump is heard on tape acknowledging that he held onto a classified document about plans for a potential attack in Iran. So that is significant in and of itself, right, admitting that he held onto that. And then, secondarily admitting there are limits to his actual ability to declassify documents, which undercuts the main defense we've heard from again and again, which is that any document he wanted declassified was just, poof, declassified. And we've heard this ever since the FBI's search of Trump's Mar-a-Lago back in August of last year. Here is someone from Trump's inner circle just days after that search. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

That's when they sent those 15 boxes, it was around December, January. This was back in the summer of 2021.He's not at Mar-a-Lago. He's at Bedminster, his club there in New Jersey. And he's angry. He's in this meeting where people who are writing an autobiography for his former chief of Mark Meadows are. He's angry about this \"New Yorker' story that's been published. It's focusing on General Milley and how basically, General Milley who is the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, one of the highest-ranking officials in the national security realm for Trump, was worried he would try to take military action in Iran as he was in those waning days the presidency, disputing the election results, of course, lashing out at many people around him. And what's notable of this recording, which we haven't heard, but people have described to us is he's indicating that he's got this document that he says will undermine what Milley is saying. The point of this is he's indicating he can't share it with the people in the room with him because he's aware of the fact that he has a limited ability in his post-president period to declassify documents, despite what he is claiming publicly. He says something to the effect of, if I could show you this, but he can't actually show it to them. You can even hear him --",

So, OUTFRONT now, let's go to former Trump White Houselawyer Ty Cobb. So, Ty, you know, when we've talked about this so many times. You have told me the special counsel has an open and shut obstruction case in the classified documents probe. You've been clear about that for a long time. But now, we know the special counsel has this tape of Trump admitting there are limits on his ability to declassify documents. Let's just start with that one very specific point. What does that mean for possible charges here?",

      "sentences": "Well, it could mean two things. One, it further enhances the obstruction case because it eviscerates the two defenses that Trump has put forward, the first being that merely by taking documents, he declassifies them, or that he has the authority if he is playing with the ducks in the hot tub to declassify them in his own mind.Those are out the door now because he's admitted that he understood there were restraints on what he could do with documents. As we know from the 16 agency letters that were disclosed two weeks ago and the multiple people who advised him to that effect from the White House counsel's office upon his departure. So that's a compelling fact. This makes it easier to prove. But it wasn't -- it's not in real dispute. On the other hand, it does show that he's been deceptive in his own statements. The second is it could put additional pressure on Jack Smith to tie the obstruction case to the actual possession in use or dissemination of the classified documents. Now, whether he will or not is, of course, for him to decide. It's a strategic decision. You know, my own view is he doesn't -- he doesn't need to, you know, extend or compromise the obstruction case by taking on the burden of the classified documents case because he gets the full benefit of the classified documents, evidence anyway in through statements like this. So I think this makes the obstruction case more compelling. It could add the two cases, the obstruction and the possession and use of the classified information together. But that would delay things. And I don't think -- I don't see any eagerness on the part of Jack Smith and his team to slow down. I think they have -- I think they have their foot on his neck. I noticed that Trump, as he did three days before he was indicted by Alvin Bragg, was raising money today on the alleged coming indictment by Jack Smith. So I think Trump and his own team believe this is going to come quickly.",

So, Alyssa, let me just start with you to respond to what Ty is saying here.

There were many things that he was interested in declassifying that never were, in fact, put out. Can I note one thing on this? Because the legal side, Ryan knows much better than me, as does Ty Cobb, but the national security and homeland security implications of this document existing at a country club in New Jersey, military options to take a strike on Iran -- I mean, we've had our former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, Mark Esper, Robert O'Brien, still travel with security details because the threats from the Iranian regime, after the Soleimani strike, that we would just willy-nilly have this document laying around?",

And it seems like the motivation was simply to defame Mark Milley, or to try to say that he was going to -- he wanted to be more aggressive toward Iran, which by the way I worked for General Milley as well, I would always believe him over Mark Meadows or Donald Trump in terms of his intentions.

There are mechanisms you can go through, but it is -- it would be difficult to use them as exhibits because there are crown jewels, we are not going to share that with the world. But I would be telling Trump that he's dead. He needs to -- he needs to see you what he can work out, you know, what might be a reasonable resolution with certain admissions by him. I know for a fact that will never happen. Trump is not capable of being accountable. His narcissism cripples him in that way, he will not admit guilt. He wants this to delay as long as possible, with the hope that he'll be in the presidency before this gets to a jury. That he can then pardon himself under his own theory, and he's already shown the willingness to burn the country down. This is not an obstacle in his head. He believes he can win. And he will never, ever admit guilt. So there will be a lot of people telling him that, at least three of the prosecutors involved, all good lawyers -- Todd Blanche, John Rowley, Jim Trusty -- experienced Department of Justice officials, I'm sure will be trying to explain that to him.
