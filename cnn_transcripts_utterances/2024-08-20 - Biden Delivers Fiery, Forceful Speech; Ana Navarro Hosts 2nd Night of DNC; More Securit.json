What we'll show you is this extra layer of security that they're adding as a result of breaching that fence. So, if you come over here, we're just outside the United Center. We're about a block-and-a-half away from where the breach happened, Kate. And what you can see is down the street here, they're adding an extra layer of fencing. So now instead of two layers of fence, there is three layers. And this is, you know, just an example of the way that law enforcement is trying to fortify this area after the breach. And a couple other things that we're seeing, the fence, that's different this morning is these bolts here that are securing these in place. And then, in addition, this extra layer here, Kate, it stopped at the top of this panel. And then what we saw this morning is this extra panel going up. And what protesters were able to do, Kate, is they - they sort of got together and they came from the bottom and lifted it up and went up and over, and that's how they were able to breach the fence. So, law enforcement and these crews have been working all night trying to fortify this area. Superintendent Larry Snelling was on scene. He has made very clear in multiple briefings for months that we have been at, Kate, saying he wants to protect the First Amendment right to protest, but will not tolerate any criminal activity. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SUPT. LARRY SNELLING, CHICAGO POLICE: Our job here is to make sure that we keep the DNC safe, keep our city safe, and keep our people safe. We have no idea what they would have done if they'd gotten on to the other side. But as I said before, we're not going to tolerate anyone who is going to vandalize things in our city. We're not going to tolerate anyone who are going to commit acts of violence. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

That includes CNN's senior political commentator, and former Illinois congressman, Adam Kinzinger, and Geoff Duncan, the former lieutenant governor of Georgia. Can these Republicans rally red state voters around Kamala Harris is the big question.Here now to discuss is Steve Bullock, the former Democratic governor, to be clear, of Montana. You, as a Democrat, you've won three state races in a deeply, deeply red state. So, what does Kamala Harris and what do the speakers have to do to try and bring some independents over, bring some of those who are - who are Republicans but don't like their candidate? STEVE BULLOCK (D), FORMER MONTANA GOVERNOR: No. And, look, when we say deeply red state, those are always states that are 55-45. Or, you know, so there's already 45 percent of people that are going to be there. And I think what you have to do is talk about the issues that matter. Like, you think about what Tim Walz has done with free lunches for kids. Now that doesn't have any necessarily, you know, gradation when it comes to incomes.
