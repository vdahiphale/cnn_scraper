I'm Jake Tapper.This hour, three acts of violence against one synagogue within 12 hours, police are investigating incidents of arson and vandalism and attempted burglary, and now they're asking for the public's help in figuring out who's responsible in a historic synagogue. Plus, we're spotlighting one of the biggest Senate races of this election. Republicans hope they could flip a seat by running the state's popular former Governor Larry Hogan, but with just 12 days to go, what are his chances? I'll ask former Governor Hogan live in minutes. And leading this hour, two huge campaign events are about to get underway. Former President Donald Trump set to take the stage in moments for a rally in the crucial battleground of Arizona. And Vice President Kamala Harris is gearing up for an event in another key battleground, Georgia, where she will be joined by former President Barack Obama. Joining us now to discuss Susan Rice, former director of the U.S. Domestic Policy Council under President Biden, a former ambassador. Madam Ambassador, good to see you. So tonight, we're going to see President Obama with Vice President Harris, also the boss, Bruce Springsteen in Georgia. Tomorrow in Houston, we're going to see Beyonce, Willie Nelson joining Vice President Harris. We saw this in 2016, two stars coming out for Hillary Clinton, I wonder if you have any concern about the celebrities joining, because I just want to play this from one of the undecided Pennsylvania voters in last night's town hall.

RICEIt's all about turning the military against the so called enemy within, which is all of those of us who may differ with his policies and approaches, rather than concrete plans to benefit the American people, and to the extent that he's outlined any plan related to the economy, it's all about tariffs. And the analysis could not be starker. You saw, you know, scores of Nobel laureates come out today and say that they support Kamala Harris over Donald Trump because her policies will benefit the economy as opposed to his. For tariffs, he is proposing to up to 20 percent tariff on all imported goods from all countries, which will cost the average American family an additional $4,000 a year, increased cost. That's his plan. Will also tank the economy and take what is in macroeconomic terms, the strongest economy in the world today and in decades and turn it into a mess.",

And I agree with what we were saying. I mean, I've just been at the International Monetary Fund meetings, and policy makers, their heads are exploding over the tariff plan. They think it will be bad for America, it will be bad for the world, it will mean higher prices in the United States. They like the economy now. They're very fearful, quietly over the two directions as it goes in. And I have to say, though, the messages, as far as Harris policy is concerned, they think it will be a continuation of Biden. So she's not making that connection, I think, that this will be change. But for most of those guys, they think Trump, not all, but most of his policies are head explosive, bad for Americans.",

Police in Tempe, which is also in Maricopa County, have arrested a man who allegedly attacked the Democratic National Committee office three times over the last six weeks, shooting at the building, leaving political signs with bags of white powder attached. The suspect, 60-year-old, Michael Jeffrey -- Michael Kelly, seen here during his first court appearance. Police say they found more than 120 guns and 250,000 rounds of ammunition at his home, raising fears of a mash -- mass casualty event. Investigators say they believe he may have been on his way to commit another crime since he did not have his cell phone with him during the attacks, suggesting he was trying to avoid being tracked. That's according to a prosecutor from the Maricopa attorney's office. He's being held on a fifth $500,000 cash bond and faces multiple felony counts.

They gave it to her. And she was last. She was the first one out. And she came in out of the top 13 contenders. She came in last. And they gave her the -- she had no votes. He got 14 million, whether you like this guy or not. And not too many people are thrilled. And, you know, if you remember, we had a debate and debate. He didn't do great in the debate.

One of the things he said today is a very frequent claim.Four years ago, we had the strongest, safest -- safest border with the lowest level of immigration ever. That was the day I left office. That's the chart that he often talks about on the day that the first assassination attempt. He said he turned his head to look at that chart and he loves that chart accordingly. Unfortunately, that's not what this chart actually shows. What it points to is April of 2020, when he still had eight months left in his term, that was when global migration had slowed to a trickle, but that was also because COVID-19 was really setting in to make that happen. It wasn't Trump policies. They may have had some effect, but the COVID pandemic is really what drove it home. That was after hitting roughly a three-year low, three-year low, which was not an all-time low in April of 2020. And during the -- the last few months of Trump's term, immigration was actually going up during all of those times. So that was one of his claims that he made here. He -- he went on to say many other things about immigration, saying Kamala Harris was the border czar. She was not. She had a role. She wasn't. She dismantled it. She wants an open border. Not true. Cities overrun with criminals taken over from jails, mental institutions, all simply not true. Jake?",
