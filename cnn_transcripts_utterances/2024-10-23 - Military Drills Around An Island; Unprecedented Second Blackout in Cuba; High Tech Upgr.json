This was the first full encirclement of Taiwan by China`s Coast Guard, Taipei says, including using a 12,000-ton vessel, one of 17 vessels that Taipei says it detected around its territorial waters during the drills. They also say China`s Coast Guard intruded into restricted waters near Taiwan`s outlying Matsu Islands. Now, this is not the first time this year that China`s Coast Guard has been accused by Taipei of playing an increasingly large role in intimidating the island. It was back in February when China`s Coast Guard actually boarded a Taiwanese tourist boat, checked everyone`s ID and detained them, giving people quite a scare and sparking an online frenzy here about the role of China`s Coast Guard, something that Taipei has long referred to as a gray zone tactic, non-military but nonetheless coercive and intimidating force sanctioned by Beijing. In addition to the Coast Guard activities near Taiwan, they posted a propaganda image showing the track of the vessels that encircled this self- governing democracy that appeared to be in the shape of a heart. In fact, Chinese propaganda even referred to Taiwan as sweetheart, seen as creepy by some locals. It`s not just happening in Taiwan. There have also been confrontations between China`s Coast Guard and other Coast Guards, particularly in the Philippines, over disputed shoals there. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

This is the world`s broadesttree, the Great Banyan, located in a botanical garden near Kolkata, India. It takes up about five acres of land and it`s believed to be more than 250 years old. Great Banyan trees have a unique root system, aerial roots. They drop down from branches to the ground, becoming trunk-like, allowing the tree to continuously walk, if you will, growing wider and wider. We head now to Cuba, where people are still reeling after having to deal with nationwide blackouts, then the arrival of Category 1 hurricane Oscar this week. Cuba`s aging power grid collapsed multiple times before Oscar made landfall, hindering preparations for the storm. Strong winds, heavy rains, and dangerous flooding took the lives of six people. CNN`s Patrick Oppmann is on the ground in Havana with an update on how people are coping after days without electricity. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) PATRICK OPPMANN, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Near empty streets in Havana, devoid of light and life. On the third night of an island-wide blackout in Cuba, residents of this neighborhood play dominoes to pass the time and distract them from the worsening situation. Children are sleeping in the street, she says, because there`s no food, no water, no electricity in this country. Tensions are running high as Cubans increasingly are taking to the streets to beat pots and pans and protest the government`s failure to keep the lights on for more than a few hours. (On camera): Already four times the Cuban government has been in the process of restoring power and had it all come crashing down and a complete loss of power on this island. So that is what worries people, is that the longer this goes on, we already know that school is going to be canceled here for several days. Life really can`t return to normal until the power gets on. (Voice-over): The Cuban government blames U.S. economic sanctions for the crisis, but has made little investment in the aging jerry-rigged power grid that has been fading for years. Officials say more than 52,000 workers are on the job 24-7 trying to restore power and that they understand the growing anger. Without electricity, there`s no water, he says, no medicine production, no food distribution. Electricity affects everything and it frustrates everyone. In 2021, power outages sparked the largest ever protests against Cuba`s communist-run government. Hundreds of people were arrested and given lengthy prison sentences following mass trials. Cuba`s president on Sunday warned people not to take to the streets. We are not going to allow acts of vandalism and much less alter the tranquility of our people, he says. That`s a conviction, a principle of our revolution. A stern warning, but one that likely falls on deaf ears for the millions of Cubans still in the dark. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Your answer here is Volvo, which first used the familiar three-point seatbelt in 1959. The first law requiring seatbelts in U.S. cars wasn`t passed until 1968. Today`s story getting a 10 out of 10, talk about a throwback to the future, a Volkswagen that became an ebullient symbol for peace and love and flower child counterculture in the 1960s and 70s got a major glow up. In kilowatts, that is, it`s now all electric. For decades, it`s been called everything from a bus to a microbus, a van, a tin can. But now it`s making his debut as the ID. Buzz. CNN`s Peter Valdes-Dapena takes us for a ride. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) PETER VALDES-DAPENA, CNN SENIOR WRITER: This is the Volkswagen ID. Buzz, a new all electric take on a classic. The Volkswagen microbus. With 60 years of progress, this is a big improvement over the old bus. And I should know, I spent time riding around in one when I was a little kid.",

Why do I have to sit in the back seat? VALDES-DAPENA: Volkswagen`s been trying forever to break through in the U.S. market again, the way it did back in the day with the Beetle. Nobody else has the microbus in its history. So Volkswagen`s hoping that emotional attachment is going to bring them a lot of new buyers. Cruising about 70 miles an hour, going down the interstate, complete silence. All I can hear is the wind. Big difference from the old version with an air-cooled four-cylinder engine outback. My only real pet peeve with it is too much reliance on screens for some of the controls. But honestly, that`s true of a lot of new electric vehicles these days. I have to warn you, the ID. Buzz might be cute, but it`s not going to come cheap. One equipped like this is going to be more like $65,000. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
