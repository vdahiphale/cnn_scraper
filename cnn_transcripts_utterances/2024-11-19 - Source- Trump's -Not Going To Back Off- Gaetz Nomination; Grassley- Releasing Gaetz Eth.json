We're following new pressure on the House Ethics Committee to release its report on Matt Gaetz, says Donald Trump makes it clear, he's prioritizing his attorney general pick over everything else.Plus, it's on him. Democrats are now looking to Congressman Hakeem Jeffries to navigate its party through situation right now, not being in the White House and being in the minority in Congress. And we have new reporting on how he now may be the most important Democrat in Washington. And it was just six months ago that Donald Trump was convicted of 34 felonies in the Stormy Daniel hush money case. A lot has happened since then, to say the least. And today, we are waiting for the judge in that case to tell us what Trump's election win means for that sentencing. I'm Dana Bash. Let's go behind the headlines at Inside Politics. First up, Donald Trump made another cabinet choice. CNN has learned that the president-elect is expected to nominate Howard Lutnick as secretary of commerce. Lutnick is a Wall Street veteran, CEO of Cantor Fitzgerald, a long time Trump ally, and he is currently the transition chief for Donald Trump. It is well known that Lutnick wanted to be treasury secretary, so commerce seems to be a bit of a consolation prize. But the real drama inside the Trump transition right now remains his pick for attorney general. We're told, confirming Matt Gaetz is the president-elect's number one priority, even as he is personally calling Republican senators to get them on board. CNN's Kristen Holmes is in West Palm Beach, working her sources. What are you hearing, Kristen?",

      "sentences": "Yeah, Dana. Donald Trump has told everyone around him that number one choice he needs to get Matt Gaetz confirmed. That that is the absolute end of the line here for Donald Trump. And he's doing everything he can to make that happen. We reported last night that he was personally calling up senators, trying to get them on board to support Gaetz, or at least ask them what they thought.Now, Donald Trump, privately in conversations has admitted that it is possible that he does not have the votes right now to Gaetz confirm, but that goes to show you why exactly he is taking this personally and may taking these extra steps to try and work the process. Now this also comes as Republican senators themselves, they are asking to see that ethics report. They think that it is crucial for a confirmation process. I've talked to a number of people close to Donald Trump about what happens if this ethics report is released? What happens if we get details? Are there any world in which Donald Trump backs away from Matt Gaetz? And I'm told overall, likely, no. And the reasoning being that Donald Trump feels personally invested in Matt Gaetz, that he feels that he made that choice himself, and it's one he wants to see through. Remember, Dana, one of the things we've reported. He believes that attorney general is likely the most important position in his cabinet, and clearly, he is working that angle to get Gaetz confirmed.",

He is veteran senator from Iowa. He is also the incoming Senate judiciary chair. And he just talked to our colleague, Manu Raju, about this ethics report in the House. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. CHUCK GRASSLEY (R-IA): I would suggest, if they want a speedy consideration of this, because you've heard my colleagues, especially on the Republican side, say that they have some questions, not only considering what you're asking me about, but it goes beyond that, to the FBI.

If this ethics report is damning, if, and if it comes out, it might give Republican senators cover to vote, no. LEIGH ANN CALDWELL, CO-AUTHOR, THE WASHINGTON POST \"EARLY BRIEF\": It could. We'll see bad behavior has never been -- this has recent not been a disqualifier for Republicans in office. So, look at the president, president-elect. I will say though, that there is this interesting campaign that's happening behind the scenes. Matt Gaetz, individually, is calling people himself, especially Republican members of the Judiciary Committee, asking members to give him a fair shot in this confirmation process. I'm told that Donald Trump and people close to Donald Trump are calling individual senators. And at this point, he's gaging if Matt Gaetz and actually other nominees as well would have the votes to pass. He's doing kind of an inquiry on this, but Donald Trump has shown no signs that he is going to back down. And once Donald Trump is all in. He usually is all in. And we have not yet seen the wrath of Trump and his allies and his grassroots and online supporters that could be unleashed if anyone -- if they are determined to get Gaetz over the finish line.",

Matt Gaetz knows that in order to get through -- if he has any shot, he has to win over people. And so, he's like talking to people, as well as people around Trump are trying to talk to senators to win over these votes. But Matt Gaetz has spent his time in Washington as Jeff and Leigh Ann know, not necessarily making friends. The years that he's been here, he's been a thorn in any kind of mainstream Republican side. He has, you know, not really built that many relationships other than other -- with other hardline Republicans. And so, there aren't that many Republican senators that necessarily start off wanting to vote for him. But of course, to your earlier question, Dana, about political cover.
