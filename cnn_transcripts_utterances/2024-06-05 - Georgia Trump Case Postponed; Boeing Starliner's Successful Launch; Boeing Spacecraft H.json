Georgia's election conspiracy case against Donald Trump now indefinitely postponed pending appeal. Starliner to the stars, two NASA astronauts blasting off to the International Space Station, the maiden voyage of Boeing's spacecraft. Military might. The U.S. flies long-range bombers over the Korean Peninsula and practices dropping live munitions for the first time in seven years. And a highway to climate hell. That was the warning from the U.N. today after a year of record-breaking temperatures. However, we're speaking today to the head of COP28, whose new fund is looking to fight the fire with billions of dollars in financing. All that and plenty more, coming up. But first, a Georgia appeals court has hit pause on the election interference case against Donald Trump. That's until a panel of judges' rules on whether the district attorney involved should be removed. Now, if you remember, a mini trial was held back in March after revelations that D.A. Fani Willis had a relationship with the prosecutor she hired to lead the case. Ultimately, the prosecutor, Nathan Wade, was forced to step down, though Fani Willis was allowed to stay. Trump and his co-defendants then appealed that decision. And today's order means yet another delay. And just keep your mind on this case. I just want to remind viewers of one of the key pieces of evidence in this case, that infamous phone call from Donald Trump to Georgia's secretary of state. Just listen in. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT AND REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  So, look, all I want to do is this, I just want to find 11,780 votes, which is one more than we have because we won the state.

We're talking about the mini trial, the trial within the trial, as to whether or not Fani Willis is disqualified from participating in this case.

So, the key is that, like we said, and as you said, we need to go much further. We need all of the above. And I think that one has characterized the climate conversation in the past, was rather than saying, we welcome all solutions and we embrace them and we're going to empower people to deliver the solutions that work for them in their situation, we've always talked about the things that we can't do and what we should exclude and what we shouldn't include. And I think that what's changed with COP28 and what we've certainly been saying is let's change the narrative. Let's focus on how we can deliver the outcomes that we want to see and get us back on track to those goals that we want to achieve those Paris goals of 1.5 degrees.",

And that includes things like this, limiting the spread of deep fakes, labeling A.I. content, protecting data from being used to train A.I. models where necessary, and funding A.I. literacy education.

At the same time, we obviously are in different issue streams, working on different causes, and I think that there is hopefully room in public consciousness for multiple young women working on important issues.

A couple of years prior to that, I actually came across an investigation that found that pretty similar algorithms can besuper racially biased, and there were already use cases in counties in Florida, for example, where there were error rates that were twice as high for black defendants. And so, when I saw that technology was going to be implemented all across my home state of California, I wanted to obviously get involved and began campaigning against the ballot measure by rallying my peers. And together, we you know, created informational content and hosted town halls and personally called voters and really partnered with community organizations all across California. That was our first foray into advocacy. That was quite frankly, my first foray into advocacy. I didn't know how all the ropes worked up until that point. I was kind of just learning as I went along and we were actually successful. We defeated the ballot measure by around a 13 percent margin. At that point, I realized, you know, we have this incredible community of young people who are fired up about A.I. And they're coming from all over the world, not just California. And there are so many more issues for us to take aim at, even beyond the scope of California or beyond the scope of criminal justice. And so, at that point, we became and Encode Justice. And we've been focusing on all sorts of challenges that are raised in the age of A.I. ever since then, ranging from disinformation to labor displacement, to bias surveillance, to potential catastrophic risk from these technologies.

So, actually, coming out of my experience attending the World Economic Forum in Davos, obviously, one ofthe most elite global convenings, if not the most elite global convening, it was incredible opportunity. And they have the access to top A.I. experts and people who are really shaping this dialogue. And while I was there, I spoke to people like Stuart Russell, who is the author of the world's leading A.I. textbook and one of the top academics in the space, and really had the chance to speak to them and figure out, you know, where their attention is lying and what policy priorities should be centering. At that point, I realized there is this growing division between experts who are thinking about the near-term challenges posed by A.I., like bias, and the longer-term, potentially catastrophic, but still unrealized potential of this technology. And that divide, in my opinion, is frankly counterproductive and does not need to exist. And so, my intuition there was, we should have a youth authored agenda that is able to obviously outline a set of our core policy priorities, but also help bridge the divide between experts on both sides of this conversation and also rally support from the people who hold power influence in our world. And so, at that point, we began this project, devising 22 policy recommendations across five main core areas. And we developed the sketch for A.I. 2030, which is our generation's platform for global A.I. action by the year 2030. And as you mentioned, Julia, we have been honored to receive support from some super high-profile people that I never imagined would sign on or even take a look at the things I was sending them. But we have signed on to the people like Yoshua Bengio, who is considered the godfather of A.I. and is the most cited computer scientists in the world. People like Mary Robinson, the former president of Ireland and former U.N. high commissioner for human rights. The actor Joseph Gordon-Levitt. I'm really excited about that because I'm a huge fan. People like Audrey Tang, former minister of Taiwan. So, the list just goes on and on. And it's really, really exciting to see that we --",

Obviously, that wasn't the case. Universally, I did have some great dialogue with people I really respect, but I've encountered that kind of, I think, bias and that kind of dismissiveness overall in the work that I do. I think also it's not just because of age, but there are so many people in this space that are deeply tied to commercial interest and just want to keep raising to deploy these increasingly powerful models. You know, we're seeing the power to really change our shared future concentrated in the hands of a couple of CEOs right now. And these people are earning tons of profits along the way. I think there were also people out there who believe that technology is going to usher in this utopian future. And it's, you know, foolish to try to implement any safeguards because then we're just standing in the way of that progress. You know, in my opinion, I totally agree that, you know, A.I. can be a force for so much good in our world. And I'm really excited about those uses, but we need to make sure we're doing it safely and we're doing it carefully.
