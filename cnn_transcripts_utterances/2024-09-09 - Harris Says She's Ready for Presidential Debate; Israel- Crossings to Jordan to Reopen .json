A \"New York Times\"/Siena College poll shows no clear leader. But a similar theme found in a new CNN poll of polls, which shows Harris at 49 percent, Trump at 47 percent.

The U.S. vice president is set to travel to Philadelphia in the hours ahead. And on Sunday, she had this message on how she feels headed into Tuesday's debate. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

George H.W. Bush checking his watch against Bill Clinton in '92 and seeming to validate the idea that he was kind of out of energy and out of time. Much of what Harris has to do, I think, is portray -- you know, convey energy, optimism, competence. But I think she also has an additional hurdle here, which is she does have to give voters a better sense of what her priorities would be as president. It is notable that tonight, just hours before this first debate, they have finally put up a policy section on their -- on their website.

He wants to basically be saying -- and I think he may even reprise the famous Ronald Reagan question from 1980. Are you better off than you were four years ago?He wants to make the case that, you know, people had more money in their pocket at the end of the week; the border was under control; the world wasn't as chaotic when he was president, kind of, you know, memory-holing the 2020 experience with COVID. Harris, like Biden before her, really wants voters more to be looking forward. I mean, she wants them not so much to be treating this as a referendum on whether they think the Biden years or the Trump years were better for them personally. She wants them to be focused on what the next four years would bring. And that's kind of the turning the page and a new way forward. Project 2025. And not only that, but what, you know, Trump calls Agenda 47, the videos that he's put out himself on his own website, which overlap a tremendous degree with Project 2025, provides plenty of targets for her. Economists, for example, will say, you know, multiple economists have said that looking forward, Trump's agenda of tariffs and mass deportation is a greater risk of inflation going forward, than Harris's agenda is. The challenge, of course, is that a lot of voters -- you know, getting voters to kind of orient that way, as opposed to kind of casting a ballot on their immediate circumstances, particularly if you're talking about that last seven or eight, 10 percent that participate in a presidential election, but not in the midterm. That's not an easy task. But I am guessing that an early cue for tomorrow -- for Tuesday night will be Harris will be trying to get voters to look forward, talking about things like Project 2025. Trump will be trying to get them to look back, talking about things like the cumulative increase in grocery prices or gas prices under Biden.",

And he will be welcomed by the country's president.It's the third leg of his journey after leaving Papua New Guinea early Monday. The pontiff's trip marks a significant shift for the Vatican as it places renewed focus on his congregations across Asia. Well, CNN's Kristie Lu Stout joins us now, live from Hong Kong. Good to see you, Kristie. So, Pope Francis left Papua New Guinea this morning for East Timor, which is of course, one of the world's newest and predominantly Catholic nations. Just what's on the agenda and what's at stake with this visit? KRISTIE LU STOUT, CNN INTERNATIONAL ANCHOR/CORRESPONDENT: Yes, Lynda, the pope is continuing this marathon tour around Asia now with a visit to East Timor, a deeply Catholic nation. In fact, 97 percent of its population identifies as Catholic. That's the highest proportion outside of Vatican City. And across East Timor, we know that security is tight. And there's also a festive mood, with banners and billboards filling the streets now. We understand that, at this moment, the pope is en route to Dili, the capital of East Timor. He will, when he touches down shortly afterwards, attend a welcome ceremony outside the presidential palace and meet with local officials. And a huge turnout is expected, especially given the church's ties to East Timor's independence in 2000. Its prime minister, the independence hero, Xanana Gusmao, in fact called the Catholic Church, quote, \"the backbone of the resistance.\" Now, East Timor has had a very dramatic history, including decades of brutal and bloody occupation before its independence over two decades ago, as well as church sexual abuse scandals, including a bishop who won the Nobel Peace Prize in the mid-90s. Two years ago, the Vatican said it secretly disciplined Carlos Jimenez Bello in 2020. It responded to allegations that he sexually abused boys in East Timor decades ago. And it is not clear whether or not Pope Francis will address the scandal. There's also something else hanging over this visit: the price tag. There's been criticism and eyebrows raised about the $12 million budgeted and paid for this papal visit. Now, East Timor is one of the world's most poor countries. It has struggled to diversify its economy, and many residents there do live below the poverty line. Now, on Sunday, pope was in Papua New Guinea, and he visited a remote town there, where thousands of people turned out to see him. And there, he delivered medical supplies and aid. And he also delivered a critical message for the region. I want you to listen to this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) POPE FRANCIS, LEADER OF CATHOLIC CHURCH (through translator): Peace. Peace for the nations and also for creation. No to rearmament and exploitation of our common home. Yes to the encounter between peoples and cultures. Yes to the harmony of men and women with creatures. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And many of them are resisting.So, for example, one of the problems that the one-child policy met when it swift moved to a two- and three-child policy, is now that there's workplace discrimination against women of a childbearing age, because many employers don't want to give, you know, two or three lots of maternity leave and maternity benefits. So, any women say that they're being asked to, you know, promise, which is illegal, but it's common, that they won't have more children. They're not being promoted under a suspicion that they might have more children. So, the -- the sad fact is, whether or not -- you know, the women were punished in a one-child policy for having more children. And now they're being punished under a suspicion that they might have more children. In any case, the end results are not great. And of course, the other part of it, just a very practical matter, is because of the one-child policy and the fact that it forced many families to limit the sizes, they -- there grew up to be a huge shortage of women. So, there's something like 30 million surplus bachelors in China.

Officials say more than 600 firefighters are struggling to get control of the fire, which was not contained at all as of Sunday morning.
