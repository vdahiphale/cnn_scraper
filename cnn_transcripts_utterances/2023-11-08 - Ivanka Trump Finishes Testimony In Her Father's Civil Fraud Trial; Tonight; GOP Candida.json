And the question is really focused on technical aspects, questions about deals that she worked on when she was at the Trump Organization. And it did elicit what could be some helpful information for the state's case. For example, they talked about negotiating loan terms for the Trump Doral Golf course and spa, she was involved in that.And the bank said look in order to get these favorable loan terms you have to maintain a net worth of $3 billion. Well, they presented an e- mail where she suggested lowering that threshold to $2 billion. They agreed on 2.5. But the question is, why would you make that suggestion because at the time her father on his financial statements said his net worth was over $4 billion gets to the heart of the case. They also presented evidence that the government had questions about their financial statements when they were trying to win the old post office project here in Washington, D.C., saying the way they were calculating things deviated from standard procedures. They also had questions for her about a penthouse apartment she had in one of her dad's buildings, there was a purchase option for 8.5 million, but on her father's financial documents said that same apartment was valued at over $20 million. All of these things they seem in the weeds are very technical, but they get to the heart of the case about whether they were fraudulently representing the net worth of the former president.",

She was very quick with the I don't recall, I don't remember, that was so long ago. For me the big takeaway today it was actually a normal day in court. She functioned as a normal witness. She engaged the prosecutor's question. She smiled at the judge. She behaved as witnesses normally do in our system of civil justice, which is unusual in pretty much any Trump related litigation, that there were no thunderbolts, no denunciations of the justice system, no press conferences on the courthouse steps. So somewhat of a humdrum day in court that I don't think the state's attorneys really drew blood today.",

They need to number one, build an evidentiary record that will position them well to appeal what I'm sure is going to be an adverse decision.I think they also can make this point that they have been already about this was ostensibly a victimless crime, that the bankers love dealing with the Trump's, no one was hurt, so why are we even here?

Challengers argued that Trump should be disqualified under the 14th Amendment, which says lawmakers who, quote, \"Engaged in insurrection,\" unquote cannot hold future office. The court did say the challengers can try again to remove Trump from the general election ballot if he becomes the Republican nominee. Similar efforts are underway in Colorado and Michigan.There is so much more to discuss in our 2024 lead. Cue the music. Nice. Three hundred and sixty-three days away from the 2024 presidential election. Last night proved contrasting pictures of what Election Day could look like on the one hand, Democrats winning major valid victories in Kentucky, Ohio, Virginia. On the other hand, new polls show President Biden losing for Republican candidates and key matchups, getting clobbered by the way, by Nikki Haley. Clobbered. Apparently that doesn't mean anything to Republican voters, but clobbered. So, anyway, let me start, Doug, with you. Let's start with the debate in Miami. Trump for the third straight debate choosing to skip it. And I have to say, we were talking about this in our staff meeting today, the degree to which the public is not really seeing Trump, the full Trump, the Trump that we got for five, six years is really remarkable. And I have to wonder how much that is related to his strength in the polls. The fact that people are not getting the full Trump and all that means, yes, they get little drips and drabs in the courtroom coverage, but he's not on the court -- he's not on the stage berating Ron DeSantis, berating Tim Scott, berating Nikki Haley, we're not covering his rallies anymore of the way we used to, he's not in the White House, obviously, and I wonder if you think that's part of the reason why he's doing better in the polls.",
