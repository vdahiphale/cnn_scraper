At the same time, it can make it really hard to contain disruptions in particular regions.The other big carriers use what's called hub-and-spoke. You've heard that a lot this week, right? Well, that means more layovers, yes, but bigger hubs with more planes there, more crew, more pilots to jump in if needed. As Southwest faces the possibility of enormous fines from the federal government, there are real questions this morning about how the airline chose to spend its money in recent years. This morning, The Washington Post editorial board writes this. Quote, \"What's particularly egregious is the fact that Southwest had the money to upgrade systems but chose to hand it to shareholders instead. The airline recently announced it would pay a dividend again that amounts to $428 million a year.\" Southwest did get more than $7 billion from the U.S. federal government to help shore up its operations during the pandemic. It paid a quarter divided for years before the COVID crisis, signaling to Wall Street that the airline had cash to spare. \"In other words, given a choice, Southwest puts its investors ahead of its customers and crew.\" And we took a look at the 2019 annual shareholder letter in which Southwest wrote this. Quote, \"During 2019, the company continued to return value to its shareholders. The company returned $2.4 billion to shareholders through $372 million in dividend payments and $2 billion through four separate accelerated share repurchase programs.\" Those are the facts. Let's bring in Claire Taitte. She's a former manager at Southwest Airlines. She worked for years directing and planning scheduling of crews. Also, she was in charge of updating the technology that handled some of these scheduling systems. I do want to note she was bound by an NDA while a manager at the airlines, so she can't get into all the deep specifics. But she does have a lot of knowledge about this. So, Claire, thank you very much for joining us this morning. CLAIRE TAITTE, FORMER MANAGER, SOUTHWEST AIRLINES, AVIATION CONSULTANT (via Webex by Cisco):  Thank you, Poppy. Thank you for having me.",

Crew scheduling handles the 24/7 operation of those schedules.And I saw huge technology investments during my career there. I spent 20 years in that area of the airline before I left in late 2020. And a lot of the technology upgrades and investments were things that customers and even crews don't see. For example -- and this is something that's publicly available -- Southwest made a huge investment to move the crew systems to the cloud with AWS in the more recent years.

Crew scheduling is a really complex job that takes about a year to learn to do the hardest parts, and it's kind of still an entry-level job -- and this is worldwide. I lead a -- I co-lead a LinkedIn group of airline crew and professionals called the Airline Crewing Enigma. And we call it the Enigma because no one really knows outside of those who do the job how it works. I think it's something that airlines really need to invest in the technology to do. Southwest, I agree, is a more difficult problem to solve being point-to-point. So, an airline who has more of a hub-and-spoke operation -- for example, one of our Southwest competitors -- if they cancel DFW to LaGuardia and back, that's a pretty easy crew problem to solve. But if a crew is scheduled to go from Oakland to Boise, to Denver, to Albuquerque on day one, and then fly to other cities on days two and three, that makes it really hard when flight two cancels, and then you have all these leftover pieces. So I think it's technology, it's training, and it's really having those operational plans.",
