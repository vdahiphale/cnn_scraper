Well, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is vowing to exact a heavy price on Hamas over the killing of six hostages in Gaza as he faces mounting pressure and major protests at home to secure a ceasefire deal, to bring the remaining hostages home. Organizers say hundreds of thousands of protesters returned to the streets across Israel for a second straight day as a general strike Monday brought the country to a near standstill.All of it fueled by anger over the hostage deaths and the failure to secure a deal. Protesters outside one of Mr. Netanyahu private residences lit fires, chanting, you are the leader, you are guilty. Despite the growing pressure, Netanyahu says he won't make any concessions. Meanwhile, Hamas is warning any further rescue attempts by the Israeli military will lead to more hostages being killed. Netanyahu is also facing criticism from Israel's closest ally with U.S. President Joe Biden, flatly saying the Israeli leader has not done enough to secure the hostages release. On Monday, Mr. Biden and vice president Kamala Harris huddled with U.S. officials who have been working to secure a deal. The U.S. President says he is close to presenting a final deal to negotiators. CNN's Nic Robertson has more now from Tel Aviv. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) NIC ROBERTSON, CNN INTERNATIONAL DIPLOMATIC EDITOR (voice-over): In the face of growing demands to get all the hostages home, Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu doubling down on his defiance.",

We're dependent right now on President Biden to put a deal on the table that he said is going to be ticket or leave it. And my words of advice to Joe Biden are that that deal better be a good deal, because the deal they've been trying to negotiate for three months is a bad deal.There was a deal that would bring us a ceasefire for 42 days and release 32 hostages, and no one knows what happens beyond that. There needs to be a deal that, in three weeks, ends the war, brings home all the hostages. Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and there will be an agreed upon release of Palestinian prisoners. I've discussed this with Hamas leaders. I've discussed it with senior Israelis. I've appeared on the Israeli media and spoke about it. This is a deal that can be done. It needs the backing of the United States of America to make this deal happen, because Netanyahu will not do it again on his own, and Netanyahu is acting like a dictator, as if he's the sole decision maker in the country of Israel today, while the majority of Israelis want a deal to be done, and the public doesn't know how to force Netanyahu to do it.",

And that's important that pressure be put on both sides. But we're at a point where this deal has to be done in the United States has leverage over Israel has to be done. Usually, the American president is thinking about the next elections. But let's face it, President Biden is free from those considerations right now. It's his decision. He's a free agent. He can use American pressure. Israel is completely dependent on the United States for its wellbeing, its defense, its intelligence cooperation in the region, the military support that the United States gives Israel is essential for Israel's survival.And that needs to be on the table when President Biden puts a new deal on the table, that again, has to be a better deal than been there before, and the pressure has to be maximum. We have to save Israel. This is not a deal against Israel and it's not a deal against Netanyahu. It's a deal to save the country of Israel. It's also a deal to save the millions of people still in Gaza who are homeless and suffering and thousands who have been killed and don't have homes anymore. This war needs to end. It is too dangerous for us. It's too dangerous for the Palestinians. It's too dangerous for the region, and it is, in fact, too dangerous for the United States to allow it to continue.",

And now for the first time, CNN has obtained exclusive video showing how the Ukrainians first penetrated Russia's border. Elite mine clearing teams secretly infiltrated and blew up minefields in the heavily fortified border area clearing a path for the troops to get through.
