His campaign now says it has raised $7 million since he was federally indicted last week.With us now, we have CNN National Correspondent Kristen Holmes and CNN Chief Legal Analyst Laura Coates. Kristen, to, you first on this. I mean, this is huge money that he's raking in here. KRISTEN HOLMES, CNN U.S. NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: It is. And when you look at it, most of it is actually coming from digital fundraising, which is usually those small dollar donors. Of course, as we've been reporting, he's seen some major defections in those high dollar donors this campaign cycle. But they've always said that they were going to get that money from small dollar donors. That's what he does. And this is significant for a number of reasons. They did get a huge boost after that Manhattan arraignment and after the Manhattan indictment. When I was talking to someone about this potential federal indictment, I actually had someone say to me on the campaign, well, I hope it comes before the fourth quarter, meaning that they were hoping that they could get that fundraising boost again if there was a federal indictment. And now we see that they actually have. And I'm told that they were a little bit concerned about it, that there had been a lag in those fundraising numbers and they weren't sure, is there going to be some kind of fatigue. He's already been indicted, is the shock, is the surprise gone? The outrage gone? But clearly it's not. Now, whether or not this is a sustainable model to have a lagging fundraising in the middle and then have an indictment, which his team does believe more indictments are coming, obviously has yet to be seen, like most things with Donald Trump.",

The judge assigned -- the federal judge assigned here to Trump's case, Aileen Cannon, she has come under scrutiny in the past for rulings that she made that were favorable to Trump that were overturned. Now, she's coming under scrutiny for lack of experience when it comes to criminal trials and presiding over them. There's a New York times review that shows she's only overseen four criminal case trials, that those cases added up to just 14 trial days.She is currently overseeing a rather extensive trial that pertains to health care, where there are a lot of issues coming up that may come up in something like Trump's case, though. So I wonder what you make of all of this criticism?",

Once the person is now confirmed to be an article three judge and is currently a lifetime tenure judge, you have to look ahead to what their responsibilities will be.Certainly, a limited amount of trial experience in terms of presiding over those cases, not actually trying them, might disadvantage her law clerks who are going to have to help her get up to speed and also make the DOJ and the defense counsel have to be that much more verbose in terms of laying out the law, et cetera. You might see more in actual trial courtroom experience. The idea of having to explain one's objections more fulsomely. Normally you would say things like, objection, the judge could anticipate what you're talking about, what hearsay objection you have, what evidentiary basis for it. You might have to be more verbose, but you're going to do that anyway in a case involving this level of stature. And so I won't discount completely the lack of presiding evidence, presiding experience. But her being turned -- overturned was not just because she got a couple of things wrong. And the 11th Circuit really obliterated her in this instance. But having said that, the fact that she's a Trump appointee, I've heard oftentimes critique from judges who will often go against the media and say it really undermines the credibility of the entire bench when we say things like the Trump appointed or the conservative justice or et cetera. Now, judges don't do any favor by being they're not totally apolitical, it seems, at times. But I am willing to reserve some judgment based on her handling of this new venture. But the shadow of the Special Master decision will loom very large. I doubt she will recuse in any event. This will be a thoroughly tried case.",

They used a flaw in that software to burrow into various organizations, and it's taken a while for the dust to settle and for us to figure out who are victims. And this morning, CNN got confirmation from the DHS Cyber Agency that there are a number of U.S. Federal agencies that are victims of this software exploit.Now, we haven't confirmed if it was the Russian ransomware hackers themselves that did this or someone else who had managed to take that vulnerability and use it against government agencies. However, this is very much a fluid situation. There are potentially hundreds of victims all over the world. We've just in the last 24 hours confirmed victims at Johns Hopkins University in the hospital system, as well as the University of Georgia. So we're learning by the hour of who has been hit by this attack. And it's really an opportunistic move by these hackers. They're known to extort organizations, ask for millions of dollars in ransom. So they operate a victim shaming website on the dark web where they post details. So we're very much waiting to see how many other victims are going to come forward and what the government can do to sort of stem the flow of stolen data that is out there from these victims.
