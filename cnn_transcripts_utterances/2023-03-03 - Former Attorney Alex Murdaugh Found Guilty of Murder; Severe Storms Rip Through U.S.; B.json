So much testimony, but certainly a couple things to doubt and both of them coming from Paul Murdaugh's cell phone.One was the kennel video, which put his father, Alex Murdaugh, at the time of the murders at those dog kennels on the property known as Moselle. For many, many months, Alex Murdaugh said that he was not there earlier in the night with his family and only found them there dead at the kennels, and that's when he called 9-1-1. But at least 10 witnesses say they heard his voice on that video. And finally, he took to the stand and admit that he being there. There was also the video, the Snapchat video, that Paul Murdaugh said to friends on Snapchat at 7:56 p.m. and that showed him wearing -- showed Alex Murdaugh wearing long pants and a blue shirt. Later, when he saw investigators, he was wearing shorts and a white t-shirt. So, of course, the state said that he had washed up and changed clothes after allegedly killing his family at the time.

When the prosecution put on almost 10 or so witnesses that testified that they could identify Alex Murdaugh's voice in that video, that was taken or, you know, produced just moments before the cellphone of his son, Paul, went dead, that was a big problem for Alex, because he had told the police for months that he was not at that kennel before his wife and son were killed. And now, you have 10 witnesses coming forward for the prosecution, saying, yes, that's his voice. He was there just moments before the murders occurred.

So, it was a calculated risk on his part. When defendants take the witness stand, on their own behalf, oftentimes it doesn't go well and this is one of those cases. He was drilled by that, you know, prosecutor and the prosecutor over and over and over again, during the cross-examination, said you lied, you know, when you said you didn't take money. In this case, he put through just a litany of lies that Alex Murdaugh had told to others and basically got to the conclusion that if you lied in those situations, then, how is it that you expect a jury to believe you in this situation?

The vast majority of them in states like Oklahoma, as well as Texas, and that includes tornadoes damaging, winds and the potential for large hail. And that threat is going to continue as we push through the remainder of the day, Friday.But we just noticed that the threat area begins to shift further to the east. Now, you're talking about focal points like Cincinnati, Nashville, even down towards Atlanta, Georgia, and Mobile, Alabama. But the threats themselves remain the same. So, here's a look at the focus for the storm into the early portion of the day, Friday. The system will gradually make its way off to the northeast. As it pushes into the Great Lakes and northeastern portion of the country, you have a lot of colder air in place. So a lot of that rain is going to transition back over into a rain, snow mix. And in some cases, even some ice and snow filtering back in. Overall, the heaviest rain is going to be along the Mississippi River valley, not out of the question to have a two, three, even four inches total, and the heaviest snow is really going to be across portions of New England where even in excess of a foot is likely across some of those areas. Widespread flash flooding, however, is still possible, states like Arkansas, areas of southeast Missouri, and along the Ohio River valley as well. You're talking a very tremendous amount of rain in a short period of time. Another very widespread concern is actually going to be the wind. And the key thing here is that it's not just while the storms are occurring. Even after that line of storms moves through, a lot of the states are going to continue with some pretty significant wind gusts up around 50, maybe even high as 60 miles per hour. Yes, even after the storms exit the region. For a state like Georgia, for example, the wind advisories will linger all the way into 7.00 p.m. in the evening on Friday. But the main focus again for Friday is still going to be that lingering low pressure system. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

And so, while the Ukrainian will be getting tanks, which will surely help them in places like Bakhmut and all along the front lines, they've asked for fighter jets.

Instead, it was a commitment for the U.S. to go out and broker new contracts to have ammunition produced on behalf of the Ukrainians and then shipped at a much longer time scale that we're talking about. The German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, suggested last month that, look, the West needs to reconsider how it produces ammunition and that this should be an ongoing process, whether there is war or not. Scholz will be in Washington today, his very first trip to the U.S. to meet with President Biden since the invasion actually began. And so, so much has changed for Germany in the course of the year. You'll remember that Germany was ridiculed in some corners for its initial response to the war and its commitments -- some pretty modest commitments at first to actually help in Ukraine on the battlefield in terms of weapons and equipment. They have since come around, committing tanks to Ukraine, a deal that they brokered impart with the U.S. But Scholz and Biden have also some common ground and that it seems there are limits and what they're able to send and that limit appears to be a reached for the time being when it comes to fighter jets.
