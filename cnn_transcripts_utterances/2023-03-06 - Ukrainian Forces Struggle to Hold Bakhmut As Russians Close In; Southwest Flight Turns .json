We begin with Ukrainian forces struggling to hold on in the eastern city of Bakhmut, as Russian troops close in from three sides. Ukrainian officials say the situation in Bakhmut has grown much tougher.They say their forces may need to retreat to avoid being trapped by encircling Russians. CNN's Scott McLean is tracking this story for us from London. And Scott, what are the chances the Ukrainians will be able to turn this around? And if they can't, does that mean Russia is back on the offensive.",

      "sentences": "So, Christine, good morning. It really depends on who you ask, because last week, there were plenty of indications that the Ukrainians may in fact be forced to withdraw from that area. A drone reconnaissance unit had been ordered to retreat from the area. You also had a key bridge that was taken out by the Russians, cutting off one of the Ukrainians' final supply routes in and out.And now, you also have a Russian war correspondent claiming that of the 10,000 or 12,000 Ukrainian troops he believes are inside of Bakhmut right now. He says that some of them are already starting to withdraw. But the Ukrainians right now are painting a much different picture. One, first off, that bridge that was taken out last week, it's being replaced by a temporary replacement. You also have Ukrainian commander describing hellish conditions on the ground, yes, but he also says that things have stabilized, and not only are the Ukrainians not withdrawing, they're actually sending in more troops to stabilize the frontline as it stands right now. Meanwhile, in Zaporizhzhia, local officials there have declared today as a day of mourning, four days after a Russian rocket hit an apartment building, killing at least, 13 people, amongst them men, women and even a small child. There are still five people unaccounted for there, they have been working day and night in the time since to try to see if there were any survivors. Nine people were pulled out, including a pregnant woman. It is not clear what if any military target was actually in the area that the Russians may have been aiming at. And one of the things to mention, and that is that the Russian Minister of Defense, Sergei Shoigu made a very rare appearance on Ukrainian soil. It's not clear precisely when this trip was made, but the Ministry of Defense released video showing him handing out medals to Russian troops, apparently in the Donbas area and also visiting Mariupol, arriving at the airport by helicopter. And then visiting a medical clinic, a newly built apparently, medical clinic there. Mariupol, of course, was heavily fought over in the early months of the war before the Russians eventually took it in this trip, appears to be a way to showcase what the -- well, what the Russians have done there since, Christine.",

But the one figure has attracted -- that has attracted most attention, of course, is the economic growth target for 2023, announced by the outgoing premier to be quote-unquote, \"around 5 percent\". That is a modest number by Chinese standards. Remember, last year, the number was set to be around 5.5 percent, but of course, the actual growth was only 3 percent. The worse in decades, because of that disastrous zero COVID policy you mentioned, wreaking havoc on the economy. But after that initial chaotic and deadly exit from that policy in December, we have seen a strong rebound with much of the disruption to industries and supply chains faded away by late January. So many analysts were expecting the government to set a slightly higher goal, something closer to 6 percent. So, this relatively modest figure seems to be a reflection of their hesitancy in terms of how sustainable this rebound is, as well as their realization of the strong winds they continue to face both domestically and internationally, Christine.",

And therefore able to protect those crucial supply lines to the Ukrainian defenders still doing all they can to hold the town that has been at the center of the siege now for seven months. We've been speaking to the deputy mayor of the town who says that the heavy artillery fire and mortar fire has only gotten worse with Russian forces really throwing everything they have at Bakhmut, explaining also, that it is only about fighting ten civilians that they're managing to evacuate right now compared to 6 to 500, at the height of the evacuation at the end of February. It is 4,500 civilians, of course, still trapped inside that town. And yet, according to Ukrainian commanders, a possibility that they have managed to hold the center and will continue to do so.

So that shows you the kind of tension and stress that this campaign to take this one, not necessarily, though strategically-placed significant city is having on the Russian military, and that is by design, by Ukraine.   But the fact of the matter is, even though Russia might not have the troops and the equipment in country right now to re-double its efforts and have a larger Spring offensive, because it's wasting so much on Bakhmut, Russia does in the long run have many more troops available, just because the country is four times the size of the population of --",
