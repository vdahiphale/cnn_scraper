And we've seen other countries, Australia for instance, in the wake of mass shootings, banned certain kinds of weapons, and that has had an effect in terms of the number of shootings and deaths from shootings.

There are a number of handguns that have been used. We know shotguns are used often. But I mean, as you mentioned the data doesn't lie. There was clearly some level of efficacy to having a policy on the books that was, by all accounts, bipartisan. And we see the results now that it has been allowed to lapse.So, it's difficult not to question how much it was worth and whether or not we need a new one. But unfortunately, as we know, these conversations just end up being very cyclical, very, you know, strained. And we don't see a lot of progress, unfortunately, on the policy or more holistic side.",

And we know that they had Michael Cohen on call that day in case they wanted to put him in to rebut, the attack that Costello was mounting on Cohen's credibility. So, timeline wise, it sounds like perhaps they wanted pecker to go in to rebut some of that. And we can assume that some of the points Castello was making was that the real purpose of the money paid to Stormy Daniels wasn't to interfere with the campaign at all, but rather for some other purpose, like just trying to protect Trumps privacy.So, certainly Pecker would be in a position to know that. I think the question is, you know, did they really need to rebut that because, as a former prosecutor who worked in a lot of grand juries, I tend to be a bit of a minimalist.

So, the potential novel idea is whether or not they would tie it to a federal campaign violation. Now, they could go with the number of state violations, including a state election violation, or perhaps some of the tax fraud that had been previously charged against the Trump organization.But the discussion we've been hearing about it being novel, really centers around the idea of trying to use the federal campaign, finance violation as that sort of bump up and that, you know, that is novel.

The Justice Department ones, those are much more at factually complex or very sprawling. I think it will take quite some time for those to really reach the point where they make a charging decision.

This is an organized demonstration, in other words, one called by the unions, part of the widespread mass action in terms of strike action that they have called for across France in protest against these economic reforms, the raising of the pensionable age from 62 to 64.But it also goes beyond that, because the reality is that here in France, in terms of the legislative process, the reforms are basically a done deal. What the unions now want is dialogue. Now, the government has offered dialogue but not any kind of concession, and it's certainly not an agreement in advance of any kind of concession on that change to the pensionable age being at 64. Now, the Interior Ministry have deployed 13,000 extra police around the country -- those are aerosol cans and other fireworks going off in the background, Jim. They deployed 13,000 extra police, 5,500 extra police in gendarmes here in Paris, the French capital. And that is because, over the weekend, environmental protests, unconnected directly with it turned very, very nasty. There was a lot of injury. A lot of injury, both of protesters and of the police. And there are deep concerns that as night begins to fall here, that things could get a lot more violent, a lot worse here in Paris. We saw quite a lot of violence last Thursday. There have been a number of demonstrations with 5,000 to 6,000 people.

The City of Philadelphia said that up until tomorrow evening, Wednesday night, at 11But I want to take us back, this all started, as you said, on Friday actually, with that chemical spill that happened near the Delaware River, it seeped into the Delaware, it happened about 20 miles north of here. And the Delaware is, of course, one of the main water suppliers for the City of Philadelphia. So then, on Sunday, the city sent out that first flash (ph) alert recommending folks drink bottled water out of an abundance of caution, but that sent everyone in the city basically to grocery stores. They cleaned out shelves buying water, and then only a few hours later the city sent out another alert, saying, actually, the water is absolutely fine to drink. Well, we wanted to ask the city directly about those mixed messaging on Sunday that sent folks into a bit of a panic running to the stores.
