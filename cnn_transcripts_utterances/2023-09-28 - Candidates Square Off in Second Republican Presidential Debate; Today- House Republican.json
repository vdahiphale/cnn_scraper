Let's bring in now: Alice Stewart, CNN political commentator and Republican strategist; Doug Heye, a Republican strategist and former RNC communications director; Margaret Talev, senior contributor at \"Axios\" and the director of Syracuse University's Democracy, Journalism and Citizenship Institute; and also Shelby Talcott, she's a politics reporter from \"Semafor\" and joins us from out in California, where she was in the spin room covering the debate throughout the night. First of all, I want to thank all of you. It's been a late night for all of us quite frankly. There's probably some folks watching who never actually went to sleep. And, Shelby, let me start with you, because it is the middle of the night out there. I want -- I want you to kind of give us a sense of what the takeaways were once those candidates got off the stage. You started hearing from their surrogates in the spin room about how the night went. I think we saw some interesting dynamics playing out on the stage. Vivek Ramaswamy who really came into a little bit of a pile-on. So I'm interested kind of in the nitty-gritty of that and then also the big picture. How did these folks feel about the fact that there was no Donald Trump on the stage and they still are so far behind him in polls, whether or not any of this actually matters at the end of the day?",

But I think she walked out of the night with a lot of sort of breakthrough moments like that.

That's what people will be talking about.And that is how you go about making a good policy contrast with these candidates. But you have to do so in a very practiced and rehearsed way so you do have the takeaway line. And she has been able to not just attack Vivek, but she also able to lob some attacks on Donald Trump on his debt and on abortion.

So they go after Trump here and there, but they're not really doing anything to launch solid hits on Donald Trump regardless of whether or not we saw real life from Tim Scott last night, or Nikki Haley had some strong moments.

He did that in the general election, the last two.But ultimately I think that Donald Trump raises a point here, is if you look at these candidates last night, why are they running? Are they running to beat Donald Trump or are they running for something else? With Vivek, we're going to see book sales or a TV show on Newsmax or something like this. With the other candidates, we could see a secretary of state or something. And here's why that's important. If these candidates are running against Donald Trump, it appears that they are running against him in theory than in practice. Donald Trump is 30 points ahead in the polls and including a lot of the state polls. The nomination goes through Donalds Trump, not -- not around him. And, Kasie, I know you're a Star Wars fan. We learned in Star Wars, Darth Vader had to be confronted by Luke Skywalker. Luke Skywalker couldn't sit back and hope that Hans Solo or the force would take care of things for him. And that's what we've seen thus far from most of these Republican candidates. Even last night as they inch a little more to go after Donald Trump, they still don't go after him all day every day, especially on the indictments that they would in any other race against any other candidate. They treat Donald Trump differently and reinforce his messaging constantly. HUNT:  Well, and, Alice, it does seem like all these candidates are afraid like Luke Skywalker did of losing a hand, right?

And they understand that if they are going to broaden the electorate and bring on -- win in this primary, they have to make the case against Donald Trump and show the voters why they are a better general election candidate. But the only way they do that is by getting some of the disaffected Trump voters on their side without them feeling as though they are attacking their guy. And they are attacking Donald Trump.And that is specifically why we did not hear any of them talk about the indictments against Donald Trump, because that would also further the narrative that he is putting out there, that he is a victim of the weaponization of the DOJ. That is one issue that they did not want to attack him on. They were fine with what he did with the debt, and what he is doing with abortion, and what he is doing with avoiding the debate stage, but they would not go after him on these indictments.",

Also, just wanted to say that when you have a tight, head on shot of Donald Trump at a rally at a non-union plant, talking about unions for Trump, just because someone is holding a sign that says, union worker for Trump, does not mean they are in the union. It does not mean they are in the UAW. The whole thing was just a perfectly orchestrated show that allowed him to ride completely above the fray of all the people who were supposedly trying to knock him out of the way to become the nominee, and staying away benefited him completely last night.

By the way, if you strong thunderstorms possible once again today, across Kentucky and into the Tennessee River Valley. Here is a look at those temperatures. We will see the average highs reached the 80- degree mark as far north as the U.S. and Canadian border for the weekend.

We should be about 75 for Omaha, so we are running 15-20 degrees above average for this time of year. But check out where the heat goes.
