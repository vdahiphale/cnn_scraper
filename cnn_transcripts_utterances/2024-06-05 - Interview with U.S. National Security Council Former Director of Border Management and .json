It got worse under President Trump. And it's continued to be an upward trend in migration. So, there's no question that policy action is actually needed here, but it's a question of which policies actually have the evidence behind them to fix the problem, right? So, we're not arguing that he should not address the border crisis or talk about the importance of border security or really short vulnerabilities on this issue, but why isn't he talking about his own policy? So, he created pearl options for some of the highest sort of nationalities that were crossing the border. So, let's take Venezuela. For example, 8 million people are displaced right now from Venezuela. That's a huge number and it's why we're seeing such a high number of border crossings these past three years from Venezuelans. He created an option for them. Instead of having to use a smuggler, instead of them having to come up to the border, he created a pathway that allowed them to apply for temporary legal status in the United States, come with an American sponsor and, you know, fly into the U.S. And those -- that was a much better option, say, than just simply restricting them from coming to the border and seek asylum. And what you saw when that policy went into place, and he expanded it to three other nationalities, that also decreased unauthorized crossings. So, we're living in an outdated place on sort of border security policy and tools. Asylum bans have failed the last 10 years, and so many of us are just asking for him to take a better evidence-based approach to solving the border crisis.",

It is much easier for them to goback to Mexico, to go back to some Central American countries like Guatemala and Honduras who already have people provisions in place to take them back. That's not necessarily the case, though, as you mentioned with Venezuela. And now, we're seeing many coming from far away countries, Africa, for example, where there is no deal on the table. It's very difficult in reality to send these migrants back to their home countries. There's just news today that Mexico and the United States are nearing an agreement for non-Mexican migrants to be deported directly to their home countries other than Mexico.

So, for example, if Congress, as I point out in the piece I wrote, they have not meaningfully changed who actually gets to come to the U.S. since 1990. So, we are going on decades of not updating visa categories for employers, for families, for people seeking, you know, protection, whether through asylum or the refugee program. So, we are using an outdated system. And there's no -- it's no wonder why we're seeing people from around the world who can't get a visa, who -- there's no line for them to join. You see them now using the asylum system at our border. That's a bad outdated situation. But the problem with the current order policy conversation is just that we keep talking only about ending asylum. We're not talking about building out the pathways that we actually want as a country because we want immigrants for labor shortages, to reverse population decline. We have real national needs here.

It is popular to help the undocumented family members of American citizens, because let's consider the alternative. In this election, he can really draw a contrast and say, I, as president right now, will protect your family and I will give them a more stable status, and I will protect them against, you know, political candidates like Donald Trump whose sole goal is to, you know, take -- there's 4 million American citizen children who have undocumented parents right now.

Now, maybe that should be changed and I think Democrats should consider, you know, the ways we operationalize the asylum system and to make it far more orderly than we've seen it. But if we are saying, you know, you support the rule of law, you cannot just ignore a whole statute that lays out the fact that people are permitted to seek asylum regardless of how they enter.

All of these things in another era would have been disqualifying to be -- frankly, to be convicted of -- on 34 counts of felony offenses, we would have thought that would be completely disqualifying. So, all of the norms have really been disrupted by Donald Trump and the MAGA movement. And that is what has been so confounding in terms of watching how gender plays out in all of this, because I think there was the assumption always that, well, he would lose women. I'm not sure he cares anymore about picking up and expanding his base, right? He is happy with his base. You know, the fact that after all of this, where was he seen after the trial? He was seen at a wrestling match with a lot of, you know, bros, frankly cheering him on, and I think he's comfortable with that as his base.",

So, there are college educated white women who are more likely to vote Democratic. There are non-college educated white women who are more likely to vote Republican. There are single white women who have leaned more towards the Democratic Party. Economics has something to do with this, college education has something to do with this.

That's why, particularly for women voters, speaking to these issues around reproductive health care are critical and important, also for young women, critically important. But there -- we know that those top issues for voters or the economy and immigration, when the most recent polling that I've seen, still has those two issues at the very top, and abortion coming in as a third top issue. It has definitely moved up in the hierarchy. This used to be something that was -- when it was settled and people thought this was safe, they didn't go there. That wasn't on the top of their agenda. It has definitely moved up. But there has to be a case made to those voters that this administration has done things that benefit them. And it has to make a case that the plans for the future also include them. And this is a challenge, I think, that the Democratic Party has had, which is taking groups of voters for granted. You know, black women voters have been the backbone of the Democratic Party. They have been the group that has been most consistent, most there for the Democratic Party and gotten candidates elected across the board. But black women voters are demanding, as they should, to see actual benefit from that vote. You know, what is it that you have done for us? And that's what the campaign has to be about.",

We see that women overall are more likely to support the Democratic candidate than men, less likely to support the Republican candidate than men. And even within the support that Donald Trump gets, it is less than -- it is more from men than from women. So, there is still gender gap. And we still have seen women outvoting men. In the last election, you know, 10 million more women voted than did men. So, at the end of the day, even in all the chaos, even in all the upside- downness of the world, we are still seeing that pattern of women voting differently than men and seeing women out voting men.",

One of the things that Donald Trump did do by getting elected was he energized women, right? We saw women running at record numbers in 2018. We're not seeing that this time. We're not seeing women running, but we're not breaking records. We're -- we saw women engaging in activism in ways that we had not seen in a long time. You know, women who, I think, felt like they didn't have to be involved in politics suddenly felt like they needed to be involved in politics. But I think there's a certain level of exhaustion from politics. I think there's watching. Congress looks broken, looking like this system doesn't work and they're tired and they're just tired of it. And so, making sure that they're tapping into some issues that are really key, and again, making voters feel like they have a real stake in the outcome that it matters to their lives what the outcome of this election is. Regardless of, you know, your position about Donald Trump and the issues he cares about, he has made his voters believe that their futures are dependent on him getting elected, that their lives and their livelihoods and their futures hinge on his election. And in some way, the Biden administration has to -- the Biden campaign has to -- and the Democrats have to make Democratic voters and independent voters believe that about electing Democrats.",

And I think for a lot of women who are -- who may have been thinking about running, you know, they're looking, again, at Congress as a place that's broken. But state legislatures have a real impact on people's lives, particularly around these issues around reproductive health, right? We're also looking now in ways that we haven't in the past, looking at women as donors to candidates and also the money that flows into women -- women's candidacies and really trying to do some deep dive analysis and understanding about women as donors, who are they?
