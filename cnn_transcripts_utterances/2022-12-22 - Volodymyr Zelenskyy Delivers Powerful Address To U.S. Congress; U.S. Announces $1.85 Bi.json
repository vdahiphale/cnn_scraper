[00:05:04] In that seven to eight hours, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy spent going from the White House meeting with President Biden up to Capitol Hill speaking to a joint session of Congress all through the lens of a conflict that shows no signs of ending anytime soon. And that was one of the primary takeaways from his sprint through Washington D.C., his first trip out of Ukraine since Russia invaded at the end of February. The reality that as long as Vladimir Putin, as long as Russia continues to mount the invasion that they've had ongoing now for nearly 10 months, there are no compromises to make. In the words of Zelenskyy, there is no change. There's no shift. And this is not just a battle between two countries, an invader and the Ukrainian people. This is a battle, really, to some degree, at least in the framing of Zelenskyy, for democracy, for many of the Western values that President Biden has made clear are essential in this moment in time. And that is why this visit when you talk to White House officials was so critically important given the scale of the U.S. assistance over the course of the last nine or 10 months, given the fact that while Zelenskyy was here, Biden announced another $1.8 billion in security assistance, including the most substantial addition of weapons capability in the Patriot Missile Defense System that has ever been put on the table, something that Zelenskyy made clear he wants more of. They need lawmakers to continue to support that, they need the American public to continue to support that and Zelenskyy made clear that was in part why he was here and had a very, very clear message, take a listen.",

So, there are no clear moves towards some type of peace pathway, that is simply not on the table so long as Vladimir Putin and the Russian military continue the pathway they've pursued.But they all seem to agree that next year, starting in just a couple of days, is a turning point, a critical year, and a moment where the Ukrainian forces plan to make some type of breakthrough. How they're going to do that, though, remains somewhat unclear. We talked to U.S. officials, they see this now more as a stalemate when it comes to the battle space than any type of progression forward on one side or the other. And that underscores another critical component, Zelenskyy making clear they would be asking for more assistance pretty much daily from here on out, underscoring that while the U.S. is by far given the most money, weapons, economic support up to this point, much more will be needed in the months and perhaps longer ahead.

One shows the former president paid no federal income tax in 2020, his last year in the White House. It also shows he had a pattern of losing money caring for tens of millions of dollars of losses that helped reduce his tax bill.The House Ways and Means Committee is expected to make public six years of Trump's tax returns within the next few days. The lines of migrants are growing longer by the day at the U.S.-Mexico border with the Trump era immigration policy known as Title 42, still in limbo. That policy which allows border officials to quickly expel migrants to slow the spread of COVID was due to expire Wednesday, before the Supreme Court's Chief Justice stepped in to put its termination on hold. Border cities as well as the Biden administration are still preparing as if Title 42 will end sooner than later. But until it does, uncertainty looms over the thousands of migrants trying to seek asylum. And some of the migrants who are tired of waiting are crossing into the U.S. illegally arriving daily in border cities. Now, as a major arctic front sweeps across the country, officials are worried asylum seekers will be left unprotected on the streets in the bitter cold.

Some in the crowd provide commentary saying they're tired of the long wait and that U.S. immigration authorities are watching it all happen. I'm in Brownsville, Texas. The river is right behind me, our drone cameras capturing a similar scene. A large group of migrants on the Mexican side, a large law enforcement presence on the U.S. side and our cameras were rolling as a group of migrants including a child crossed into the United States and turn themselves into authorities. All this contributing to what one law enforcement source says it's up to 1,200 migrants turning themselves into border authorities every day in this part of South Texas. Border Patrol is dropping off hundreds of them in respite centers say advocates. Most of them travel out the same day.

Ironically, as we speak, the Senate is voting on an omnibus bill overnight and into -- likely into the morning, as well, that will authorize $45 billion in additional funding. All eyes, though, on a small contingent of House GOP members who have been very vocal that they do not support Ukrainian funding in the same way that we have seen coming out of Congress in the past year or so. We did speak with House GOP leader Kevin McCarthy, who says that he does support Ukraine, but he does not support what he calls a blank check. There were other members of his caucus, including Matt Gaetz, who said he attended out of respect but not agreement. Why this is important is because, of course, Republicans will be taking over the House in January for the new Congress. And any sort of additional funding that Ukraine may hope to get is going to have to clear both chambers of Congress. The question is, what will House Republicans do about this?
