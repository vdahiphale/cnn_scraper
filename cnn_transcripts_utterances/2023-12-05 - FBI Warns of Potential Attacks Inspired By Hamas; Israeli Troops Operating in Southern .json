We are just six weeks out from the Iowa caucuses, and his GOP rivals are doing what we usually see at this point in a campaign. They are barnstorming the state of Iowa. They are trying to woo last- minute voters. They are preparing for that debate, trying to make lasting impressions ahead of the Iowa caucuses. Trump himself is not. He's doing a town hall in Iowa, but then he is flying back to Florida for a fund-raiser, instead of going to the debate. And, as you noted, he will be back in court to listen to testimony in the New York civil fraud trial on Thursday. And he's actually expected to testify himself on Monday. But despite all of this, he is still leading in the polls in the GOP primary, not only just in the state of Iowa, but nationwide, and it's likely because of that you have started to hear these amplified focus on what a Trump second term would look like when it comes to democracy. And one of the loudest critics has been former Republican Congresswoman Liz Cheney. As you mentioned, she has been -- essentially not ruled out a third-party run. She has pledged to do anything that it takes to make sure that Donald Trump doesn't make it back into the White House. Here's what she said about the state of the Republican Party. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) FMR. REP. LIZ CHENEY (R-WY):  I don't know if our party can be saved. It may be that we need to build a new party. But I think those issues have to come after this 2024 cycle, because the focus has to be just completely right now on making sure we don't return Donald Trump to the White House. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

But it's going to come to Republicans, good Republicans, to stand up as Liz Cheney has. And too many of them have been drummed out of the party in primaries. And too many of them are, frankly, cowed by cowardice and careerism to try to go along and rationalize the rise of Donald Trump because it's good for their careers, because it's good short-term politics. But that's bad term -- bad not only for the Republican Party, but for the republic itself. And that's what I think we need. Liz Cheney's calling for broader coalitions to stand up and be counted.

He's talking about more than 2,700 domestic terrorists -- terrorism cases that the FBI is investigating. A lot of those people are, of course, people who are anti-government, but also there's now people who may be trying to heed the call by those terrorist groups to carry out possible attacks here in the United States. But a big portion of his testimony today is trying to urge members of Congress to renew a surveillance law known as 702, which is due to expire in the next few weeks, and which he says it's very, very important to keeping an eye on those terrorist groups, again, that try to pose a threat to the United States, as well as Iran and China. What he says is, if you don't renew this authority, it would be a form of unilateral disarmament. That's something he just talked about in his testimony. John, you know, of course, that it is a congressional hearing, so these members can go anywhere they want, and a few of them have brought up some of the investigations, including ones related to the Biden family, Hunter Biden, and, of course, investigations related to Donald Trump.
