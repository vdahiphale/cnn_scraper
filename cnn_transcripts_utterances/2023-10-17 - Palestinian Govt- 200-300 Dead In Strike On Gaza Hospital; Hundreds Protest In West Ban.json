These are images that are disturbing that you're seeing right here. They are showing a hospital that was hit in Gaza a short time ago.The Palestinian Health Ministry says at least 200 people were killed by an Israeli airstrike. Israel is not confirming that this was a strike by its military. It says that it is looking into this. Let's get you on the ground now with CNN's Clarissa Ward, who is in Ashkelon, Israel, which is about 10 miles north of Gaza. Jeremy Diamond is in Jerusalem for us. Clarissa, what can you tell us about what happened at this hospital?",

Thousands of people were using it as a place of refuge, as a place that they thought would be safe. This is very common in times when there is intensive bombardment in Gaza.People go to hotels. They go to hospitals. They go to any place they can where they believe they will not face heavy bombardment. We are hearing, as you mentioned, from Palestinian health officials, that at least 200 to 300 people have been killed as a result of this strike. We are also hearing outrage and condemnation from all around the region. The Secretary General of the Arab League saying, \"A mind from hell is the one who deliberately bombs a hospital with its defenseless patients and calling upon the West to actively put an end to the mayhem.\" Well over 3,000 Palestinians now dead. The Palestinian authority in the West Bank calling for three days of mourning and just a sense of tremendous pain, horror and anguish from people inside Gaza, many of whom have had to flee their homes, some 600,000 according to the UN, who have pushed out of their homes in northern Gaza into the southern part of Gaza. And I should add there were strikes there too today. Earlier this morning strikes in Khan Yunis, also near the Rafah Border Crossing. It's becoming increasingly clear that there is absolutely no safe space inside Gaza where people can find some form of refuge, not to mention the fact that the humanitarian situation has become completely untenable, with the U.N. calling it an unprecedented humanitarian catastrophe and all the while diplomatic efforts to try to open up that Rafah Border Crossing remain hamstrung.

I was able to speak briefly with an IDF spokesman who simply did not have any information one way or the other saying that they are looking into this and that this is certainly something that they take very, very seriously. We will see. But certainly, striking a hospital directly like that, causing hundreds of casualties is something that would be a very, very dark mark on the Israeli military if indeed that is the case.But as of yet, we are still waiting to confirm exactly the circumstances behind the strike and how exactly this came to be. But if it was carried out by the Israeli military, that is certainly not something that President Biden is going to want to see before he is set to arrive here tomorrow.",

      "sentences": "Yes, undoubtedly. I mean, President Biden is coming here tomorrow with two main goals in mind. One - on the one hand, the symbolic aspect of showing U.S. support for Israel, showing that there is no daylight between Israel and the United States, a deterrent factor there as he tries to prevent this conflict between Israel and Hamas from becoming a wider regional war. But then, of course, there are the practical impacts.And our White House team is reporting that the president received an explicit commitment from the Israeli prime minister that he would allow humanitarian aid to flow through before the President indeed agreed to make this pretty dramatic wartime visit to Israel. And so it's very clear that as President Biden comes here, he doesn't just want to come here for that symbolic aspect. He wants to actually be able to leave with something concrete having been accomplished. And it appears that at least one of those things will be some kind of plan, some kind of agreement by the Israelis to allow humanitarian aid to begin flowing back into the Gaza Strip. We know that U.S. officials have also been very focused on trying to get American citizens out of the Gaza Strip and into Egypt via that Rafah Crossing. It has been now four days since American citizens were told to head south to that Rafah Crossing, telling them, U.S. officials telling them that they believe that crossing would open. And yet it has been four days that that crossing has not opened. So you can expect that those will be some of the agenda items as the President comes to Tel Aviv tomorrow, but then as he also then goes to Jordan to meet with the Palestinian, Egyptian and Jordanian leaders there as well, the humanitarian situation in Gaza, very much a focus there, as well as the broader regional dynamics.",

It is certainly possible that that happened here. It is also certainly possible that this was indeed an Israeli airstrike that inadvertently hit this hospital. I can tell you as someone who is somewhat familiar with the mechanics of how this works internally, Israel does not target hospitals. So if this happened, it was obviously an accident. That, of course, doesn't at all diminish the very real human tragedy that we see unfolding. If it's true that several hundred people have been killed, that is obviously horrifically tragic and I'm sure that that's something that all Israelis share.",

They are scattered throughout the Gaza Strip, often, in fact, in residential areas. But even though they are there and that makes them legitimate targets, Israel will often refrain from hitting those targets because it knows that it will draw civilian casualties.So, again, I would view it as extremely unlikely. I would say, in fact, virtually impossible that the hospital itself was indeed a target.

MAYERAt the same time, there's a great deal of determination in Israel to ensure that Hamas is dealt a devastating blow and it never ever has the capacity to carry out a massacre like it did last weekend, killing 1,400 Israelis, including men, women, children, the elderly and babies.",

I do think that some of the holdouts, this was an initial vote of protest, whether against Jim Jordan or more possibly for Steve Scalise and the people they voted for, and perhaps maybe a vote against what's been going on in our conference, this disarray, this disunity, if you will. We've got to restore that unity. I firmly believe that Jim Jordan is a person to do that. This is a football game, and we had the first down just an hour or so ago.
