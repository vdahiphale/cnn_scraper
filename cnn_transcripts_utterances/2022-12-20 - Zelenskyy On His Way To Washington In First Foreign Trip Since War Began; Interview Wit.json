Then again, so was his visit today to Bakhmut on the frontline to award combat medals to the troops. And to say his expected visit to the White House and address to Congress tomorrow will be moments of the highest significance and drama is no understatement. It certainly has echoes of Winston Churchill's Christmas Time visit to Washington in 1941 just two weeks after Japan's Attack on Pearl Harbor, and America's entry into the Second World War. He made that crossing of the Royal Navy Battleship Duke of York, the crossing took 10 days. President Zelenskyy's journey will be a lot shorter, but the stakes could not be higher.

Now, there are two elements of this. One is the actual interactions between President Biden and Zelenskyy and their two teams. There are expected, according to sources, to be significant and substantive interactions between the two on how things should be moving forward, going forward. But there's also the critical element and that is the new addition of a new defense A., that is going to be coming Ukraine's way with the President expected to announce an additional $1.8 billion in US assistance. That's on top of the 20 billion that's already been put in place. And President Zelenskyy is also tentatively scheduled to give a joint address to Congress.

It is something that for months, the Biden administration was not willing to consider given concerns about escalation or just the pure scale of time it takes to train up on those systems, that will now change. It has been a process over the course of the last several weeks, President Biden will make that announcement, that $1.8 billion includes Patriot Missile Systems. It's become critical over the course of the last several weeks, something President Zelenskyy said personally to President Biden via phone just a couple of weeks ago, given the Russian ramping up of those attacks on civilian infrastructure. President Biden now willing to go that route, also will include precision bomb kits to add as well. $1.8 billion, the number is big. The scale overall of US assistance has been enormous, but the scale of what this specific weapon system actually brings to the table, it simply has no precedent up to this point -- John.",

So Congressman, I have to say, when we all first heard the news of Zelenskyy, coming here to the United States, I sat up straight. This is a big deal for a guy who hasn't stepped foot outside his country since the Russian invasion. What's the significance in your mind? REP. RUBEN GALLEGO (D-AZ):         Well, the significance in my mind is that what he is trying to do is draw a direct correlation between our support and the survival and support and victory -- the future victory of Ukraine. We have been very, very tactical and smart in how we provide weapons to Ukraine. It has been extremely helpful. It clearly has been put to their advantage. They have put Russia on its back heels, but there needs to be more done. When I was there just about a week and a half ago, what I heard from the Ukrainian military, Ukrainian civil government, is that, you know, they can defeat Russia on the battlefield and Russia knows that. So now what Russia is trying to do is trying to punish the economy trying to punish everyday Ukrainian citizens to try to basically destroy their will to fight, and destroy their ability to even arm themselves, you know, through actually economic activity. And that's the next step that we need to do is give them the weaponry to number one defend their energy grid and water grid. And number two, give him the capability to really reach out and touch the Russians, to the point where it makes them very vulnerable, especially if they're trying to do a counteroffensive, which is something we've been hearing about.",

WESLEY CLARK (RET), CNN MILITARY ANALYST: Well, I think it's going to be a very quick trip for President Zelenskyy, and I think the risk is actually minimal. He has got a battle tested chain of command there. He's got really hard fighting troops. They are doing their best. This is a window of opportunity for Ukraine and a window of danger as well, because Russia is weak, Russia will be stronger. This is a period where the United States needs to pour in the support, and I'm really pleased about the Patriots and the JDAMs and the other things, but Ukraine also needs more artillery and ammunition at least, longer range systems. They have to be able to win the counter battery fire. They are not winning that right now. There's a lot of needs, and this is the window. President Zelenskyy knows it. We're never going to -- he is going to defeat with US support the Russian aggression in Ukraine. He has got to have that support over the next 90 days.

What is beyond question, though, is when it comes to voluntarily releasing his taxes the way every President and most presidential candidates have done since Richard Nixon, Donald Trump gave voters in the 2016 campaign the bait and switch, a kind of a modified version, because even as he was promising to release his taxes, he still managed to sprinkle in a few escape clauses here and there. In addition, some of his promises to release the returns overlapped with his excuses for not releasing them, so it's all a bit of a mess. That said, here's the promise. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

So very, very significant tonight, this development appear on Capitol Hill, the Committee voting along party lines to release this information. And we should note, this is a years' long Court battle from the Chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, Richard Neal. He said just moments ago in a press conference, that this clearly showed that a mandatory audit program, which requires every President and Vice President's tax returns to be reviewed by IRS was not working properly. That was the whole crux of why he requested these tax returns to begin with. He is arguing that they did not do the kind of scrutiny that they should have, and therefore, the Ways and Means Committee also is going to move forward with some kind of legislation.

MICHAEL D'ANTONIO, AUTHOR, OF \"HIGH CRIMES\": Well, the first thing I can think of is, Trump is probably regretting resisting turning over the tax returns earlier, because I think he motivated the Committee. He motivated them to pursue him all the way to the Supreme Court to get these documents, and now I think they feel that the American public has a right to them. He has also forced various institutions, including the Courts and Congress to make efforts to normalize his behavior or to make his behavior normal. So, here is a person who said he was going to release the taxes as all presidential candidates have since Nixon, he didn't do it. He said, well, come catch me if you can, and they caught him.

[20The committee said it involved the damning testimony in late June by former White House aide Cassidy Hutchinson, and that, according to committee member Zoe Lofgren, she was advised to say that she didn't recall something, and she did. Tonight, we know the name of the former Trump associate, someone who, if the allegation is true, was once in a position to know better. Katelyn Polantz joins us in the House. So, Katelyn, you know, you helped break this reporting. Who's the person at the center of all this? KATELYN POLANTZ, CNN SENIOR CRIME &amp; JUSTICE REPORTER: Well, John, this reporting comes from myself, Pamela Brown, Jamie Gangel, Jeremy Herb. This is about a lawyer named Stefan Passantino. It's about his work for Cassidy Hutchinson. That former White House aide, star witness against Donald Trump. Passantino, he was an ethics lawyer in Donald Trump's White House. Then he started a political law firm. That firm has been paid hundreds of thousands of dollars this year alone by Donald Trump's political fundraising groups, and that included were able to confirm payments for Passantino to represent Cassidy Hutchinson in the House Select Committee probe. At least that was until she was preparing to testify publicly this summer. She got a new lawyer around that time, became the star witness. Now the House is publicly raising concerns about that entire set up. They have other concerns to, John, with this lawyer, and it's a long list. This lawyer was telling her not to recall facts. She did recall not to clarify testimony that she believed was inaccurate and on something that would cast a bad light on Donald Trump. He told her, we don't want to go there, we don't want to talk about that. That is all according to the committee, which spoke to Cassidy Hutchinson many times, they never reached out to Passantino. He's also not been charged with any crime. But he did provide us with a statement today pushing back on this. He was saying that he represented Cassidy Hutchinson ethically, that she was truthful with the committee whenever he was shepherding her through testimony. He's also said he's taking a leave of absence from a corporate defense law firm where he is a partner. But all of this matters now, John, because the committee flagged this instance, among other things, for the Justice Department when they released that summary yesterday and previously. And we do know now we can confirm that Cassidy Hutchinson spoke to criminal investigators about this episode and, of course, may be an important witness for federal investigators that continue to look into January 6.",

That's something the Justice Department knows, at least about one witness already. They also mentioned that Secret Service agents and other employees decided to hire private lawyers that they would presumably pay for themselves or have another entity pay for when they had the ability to just use the agency's own lawyers for free to represent them in the House investigation.

Because if they're not going to do that, then we have this space where you have an individual who is being publicly maligned and they're not making a criminal referral. And so then that leaves just sort of this open area as to whether or not they really think his conduct or they really have the evidence suggesting that he potentially committed a crime.",

I have actually been concerned for people like Cassidy and others who may have wanted to come forward and tell the truth and testify under oath and really comply with Congress along the way, because this is kind of the dynamics that people, individuals who want to tell the truth and comply face. And look, I lived the first impeachment in the White House internally, first hand. I saw what the witnesses that were going to go before Congress went through. I personally actually advised a colleague that they should retain a lawyer outside of the circle because they were being advised that they would be fine. And I said, no, you won't be fine, because these people all work for the man in the Oval Office. And it's like the mob boss. It's the mob boss mentality. At the end of the day, they're going to do his bidding, and that's exactly what this entire inner circle does.And so, it doesn't surprise me that Cassidy faced this dynamic possibly. And look, I believe her because this isn't the one-off situation here. This is something that I've seen happen personally. And I turned out that in that situation, I was 100% correct and right. And that person did retain their own counsel because they wanted to comply and they wanted to tell the truth about what they had witnessed. And I think when I look at Mar-a-Lago to be honest with witnesses that may be complying and coming forward, I think about them too, because not only do I worry about the intimidation tactics that Trump uses and the people around him, but I worry about their safety as well.",

Clearly, when there's payment going on and then someone is being paid by someone other than who their client is, then you worry about the influence that the person who's paying the bills is perhaps influencing the conduct of the lawyer. That's not the way that it should work, but as a practical matter, I think we all know that it can.And so, it speaks to her strength in having the wisdom, as it sounds like Olivia also advised some other folks, if they want to really, truly be independent and get legal advice that is specific to them and in their best interests and in the interests of the truth, then they needed to retain their own counsel.",

The Texas military department says the national guard did not alert the border patrol or local officials that this fence would be constructed. [20:45:04] On Monday, El Paso official said national guard soldiers would primarily focus on humanitarian efforts and with security of migrants who were already in the city, not with deterrent efforts.

The Republican governor has repeatedly criticized the Biden administration for not doing enough to secure the border. But the newly installed fence isn't stopping migrants.
