First up, Russia has struck Ukraine with a new wave of attacks including a vicious missile strike in a residential building in Zaporizhzhia. That is as China's President heads home from Moscow leaving promises of economic cooperation this week suggesting a new world order is aligning against the United States. French Unions call for another nationwide strike against pension's reform as President Macron addresses the nation in an interview. Then the Fed will announce later today whether rate hike is on the cards as it battles inflation and a banking crisis. You're back with us for the second hour of CONNECT THE WORLD wherever you are watching. You are more than welcome. Washington growing seemingly more frustrated with Israel's government for the first time in over a decade. The U.S. has summoned the Israeli Ambassador after parts of a law barring settlements in the Northern West Bank were repealed. Now the U.S. says it is extremely troubled. But Israel's Prime Minister in an attempt to reassure his most important ally says that no new settlements in those areas will be built. So tonight we ask are U.S. Israeli relations at a critical point? Well, CNN White House Correspondent Jeremy Diamond is with us from Washington with more on these tensions and Hadas Gold following this for us from Jerusalem. And Hadas, let's just start with you on the ground. What is the perception there? What are you being told about this summons?",

      "sentences": "Well, it's very unique. The fact that the Israeli Ambassador to the U.S. was summoned to the StateDepartment, as you noted, has not happened in more than 10 years. The Foreign Ministry did not have an immediate comment on this summoning. But I think it's a clear reflection of where things stand in the Israeli/U.S. relationship. Just look at the number of times in the past few weeks the State Department the White House, the White House Spokesperson; National Security Council Spokespersons have spoken out with great concern over what's happening in Israel. Whether its security related issues within the occupied West Bank or related to this judicial overhaul. And keep in mind, Becky that Netanyahu has still not yet received that invitation to come visit the White House and I am not getting any indication that invitation will come anytime soon. Now this bill that was passed, it repeals parts of the disengagement bill that passed in 2005. This is when Israel withdrew and evacuated from Gaza as well as parts of the Northern West Bank around these flashpoint cities of Jenin and Nabulus, those areas became closed military zones, and Israeli civilians are prohibited from entering them. But this has been a big issue for the settler movement who of course now helped prop up Netanyahu's government who has been saying that it was - that it was essentially should not have happened and that they are welcomed. Now they are very excited for settlers to be welcomed back in two parts of the Northern West Bank. But what we're hearing from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in his statement is essentially, he wants to have it both ways, because in parts of his statement, he says that the repeal brings an end to discriminatory and humiliating law that prohibited use from living in the areas of Northern Samaria, part of our historical homeland. He's using the biblical term for parts of the West Bank. But then the very next line, he says, oh, but the government has no intention of establishing new settlements there so clearly trying to appease his base, while also trying to appease the international community. This is something we've been seeing as a theme so far from this new government when you have these sorts of extremist elements of the government. And then you have Benjamin Netanyahu and some other government ministers trying to keep things calm and keep things going. I should also note that even though this law passed, the Israeli military would have the same this because it's a closed military zone because of their control over the area. And from my understanding, they have no intention of allowing settlers to come in anytime soon. So far, this repeal seems to be more symbolic than anything. But of course, the symbolism is so important here, especially at this time period, especially as this time of increasing violence and especially as this repeal comes just a few days before the holidays of Ramadan and Passover, which is already expected to notch the tension up here to levels potentially we haven't seen in some time, Becky.",

      "sentences": "Well, U.S. officials also have to play a balancing act. As you noted, when Lloyd Austin went toIsrael, he reaffirmed that security partnership, but he also expressed serious concerns about the ongoing violence in the West Bank. And what we have seen from U.S. officials, as Hadas noted, is in recent weeks increasing criticism and concerns expressed by U.S. officials about these various Israeli actions, whether it is some of those raids that we have seen in the West Bank. The judicial reforms which have prompted perhaps the strongest expressions of concern from Biden Administration officials in recent weeks, or just now this repeal of this 2005 law, which saw Israel evacuate settlements in the Northern West Bank and also prohibited the establishment of new settlements in the Northern West Bank. And so you certainly are seeing a rise in expressions of concern and criticism from the Biden Administration but still reaffirming that long term strategic partnership. Part of that, of course, is politics here in the United States. President Biden certainly doesn't want to be viewed as being of showing any animus towards Israel. He wants to show that he is still a stalwart supporter of Israel but at the same time trying to play that Big Brother aspect of this relationship. We saw President Biden on Sunday speaking over the phone with the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu expressing concerns about these judicial reform proposals. And subsequently, what you did see was Netanyahu say, you know, that they were going to push this back until after the Passover holiday, I believe. And so, you know, there is a sense that the U.S. can try and play a role here, but also some on the left in the United States who believe that President Biden should go much further in his criticism and take that role of trying to rein in Netanyahu trying to rein in the Israeli government more seriously? But of course, there's no indication that Netanyahu would necessarily listen to that from Biden.",

Uneasy watching perhaps for Boris Johnson, but he's really sort of gathered and collected his thoughts here because it is a hugely as you say, important day.

That's his problem. That's his Achilles heel if he loves his children. So that's always been the difficulty of dealing with these children who are. And it's again, it's an --it's such a reflection on our life at the moment. That sense of entitlement those kids have. Logan doesn't feel that because for Logan, and this is what's so important when people go in and compare it to it's like, in there like the Murdaugh. So, they're like the Trumps or like the black family. And you know the big difference between Logan and all those guys is he's self-made. He didn't inherit anything. It all came from nothing.

The official numbers telling the story theBritish Consumer Price Index unexpectedly rose to 10.4 percent in February pushed up by higher food and drink prices now that comes one day before the Bank of England decides on its interest rates. Another important inflation number, the U.S. CPI as it's known it's up 0.4 percent for February. That is very different from June's big spike, but no one the Fed will no doubt be assessing before its high stakes rates announcement a couple of hours from now. The U.S. central bank is in a tight spot. It is trying to balance fighting inflation with maintaining the safety and security of the banking system. Well, here is how Wall Street and the European markets are doing. And Wall Street's it's sort of lacking confidence today. It's been up and down in and out of positive territory. And it's just dipped down at present not to suggest that people are selling off this market big time, because they're not. But they are just really treading water with a sort of slight sense of pessimism; it seems ahead of that rate decision. The NASDAQ and the S&amp;P are higher only just. And then again, you've got sort of marginal gains across these European markets, the footsie specifically of course with the potential of a further rate rise at supporting the currency Sterling, the British pound that market looking OK-ish today. Let's bring in CNN's Rahel Solomon live from New York. And I'm sort of I can even hear myself sort of doing the issue around, you know, these markets because I think they are feeling just a little bit ish, aren't they? They don't really know what's going on at present. And it is all about what we hear from the not just the UK, of course, but the Fed ahead of that later today.

And the question is, canJay Powell and the Federal Reserve sort of strike this perfect balance between we still have our eye on inflation, however, we know that we have created some financial instability, we know that there is some financial instability and we are watching that too. And so, the question is, can they deliver that message of confidence, and also essentially walk and chew at the same time. So, expectations heading into this meeting, we will hear from the Federal Reserve in two and a half hours, but we'll get that right decision in almost exactly two hours. It's about 12 pm eastern. So yes, exactly two hours now expectations are largely for another quarter of a percent rate hike. Nine out of ten traders essentially expecting that and so, you could argue that we don't necessarily want any major surprises from Jay Powell. But messaging will also be key here. Can he be clear about the fact that they know that there is a lot of uncertainty right now in the markets, and some would argue that what we're seeing in the markets is essentially equivalent to a rate hike. And so, I think messaging will be most important here perhaps the most important meeting of the Feds most recent rate hiking cycle since March of last year.",
