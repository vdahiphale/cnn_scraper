      "sentences": "Hello, welcome to CNN \"Newsroom\". I'm Max Foster in London. Just ahead, bidding farewell to a giant of the Catholic Church a Former Pope Benedict is laid to rest. Two days, six votes, zero answers, the fight over who will be the next Speaker of the U.S. House drags into his third day. And one newspaper reports it seemed Prince Harry's new book and reveals it contains explosive claims that his brother William physically assaulted him, details coming up.Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI was laid to rest today following a traditional funeral service at St. Peter's Square in Vatican City. Tens of thousands of faithful attended the ceremony, which is led by Pope Francis. This was the first time in modern history that the Pope presided over his predecessor's funeral. As Benedict coffin was being carried to St. Peter's Basilica. Many were heard calling for him to be immediately may the saints. CNN's Fred Pleitgen joins us from Rome. You were there, what was it like?",

      "sentences": "I there, Max? Well, it certainly was an incredibly large ceremony the same way, also a humbling ceremony and certainly a ceremony. That was very much the way that Pope Benedict would have wanted if he had wanted to be more low key, for instance, than the one for John Paul the II in 2005. And there were a lot fewer people on the square today than there were in 2005.But certainly at the same time, it was a very respectful ceremony that, as you said, was led by the current Pope by Pope Francis. But then and him praising Pope Benedict XVI as a great thinker of the church, but also, of course, someone who led the church in some very turbulent times as well and really gave his entire life to the church, so certainly a ceremony. That will be remembered for a very long time here in Rome, in the Vatican by many people. And certainly also Max, the end of an era in the Catholic Church and in the Vatican as well, we have to keep in mind that Pope Benedict, even when he was still Cardinal Ratzinger, for many decades, was a very influential and powerful figure in the Vatican, who did a lot to shape the church and the direction that the church was going into. So certainly the end of an era here, the latest word that we have from the Vatican right now is that the coffin of the Pope has now been brought to the Crypt of the Pope's underneath the Vatican, and that he has found his final resting place. That's information that we got from the Vatican just a couple of minutes ago. So certainly things have run their course here and at the same time, of course, people are now letting all, of this sink in. But we witnessed this morning and that very imposing ritual that took place there. As far as the attendance is concerned, a lot of Heads of States did come, although not as many, as did to John Paul II funeral, but the Germans certainly present with a very large delegation Pope Benedict XVI, of course, was a pope from Germany, specifically from Bavaria. And if you look at the crowd and you were just alluding to the fact that some of them had a sign that said sainthood sent immediately, and there were some people chanting that as well. Certainly from our vantage point, it looked as though that was coming from the corner. And when we saw a lot of German flags, a lot of Bavarian flags, but in general, this is certainly discussion that could unfold in the next couple of years. Again, this was a Pope with a punch ticket. That didn't last very long. It was less than eight years long, but if you look at his full body of work, certainly one of the most influential figures of the Catholic Church of the past decades, if not even longer than that, Max.",

The question is, will they go ahead and take an immediate seventh vote. That's what we're trying to dig in on right now.It's possible that McCarthy tries to just adjourn and go back to meetings and negotiations because McCarthy and his allies do believe that they're making some progress with some of these hardliners. But the simple math remains, even with a bunch of concessions that he made just in the last 12 hours really giving in to a lot of these demands from these hardliners. It's still not enough to get into that magic number. So he's still going to have to negotiate, they still need to bring more people over. And frankly, sitting on the floor and having the same 20 people vote against him, doesn't look great for him. It continues to weaken him. He doesn't want to do that, he wants to show progress. His allies and supporters want him to show progress. We're told they don't have endless patience for all of this. At some point, they want this to be resolved. But there are tiny indications that he is at least going in the right direction after days of going the wrong direction having more people vote against him. But the question remains, can he get there? And again, we're now it was Tuesday, all day Wednesday. And now here we are on Thursday. Can he get it done today? Does this stretch into a fourth day or even into the weekend? As you mentioned, in your reporting, the house is at a standstill, all of these new members haven't even been sworn in. And not to get too into the weeds, but they're operating without any rules that's set by the new Congress. So, it's kind of the Wild West in there in terms of how they're doing all of this. They are they're voting but they're not operating by any sort of set rules, which is normally what's put in place by the House Speaker by the majority. So we're waiting for all of that and it just remains at a standstill until they can come to an agreement on who's going to be the next House Speaker.",

And that's, of course, because it does depict this event according to Prince Harry have a physical altercation between the brothers when during an argument over the Duchess of Sussex Meghan Markle. Apparently Prince William, according to Prince Harry struck him, causing him to fall to the floor hitting himself, on a dog bowl apparently resulting in visible injury, which according to this passage that has been published by the Guardian.We understand that Meghan Markle was not told initially about this fight between the two brothers. But then when she noticed some marks on Harry's back, she asked him what had happened. And that led them to the revelations, Harry described it, saying he sat down the water, called me another name and came at me. It all happens so fast, so very fast. He grabbed me by the collar, ripping my necklace, and he knocked me to the ground. So Max, these are serious allegations. And we haven't heard from Buckingham Palace or Kensington Palace. And as you know, that is par for the course and really puts the differences of communication styles into sharp relief here, because Prince Harry has said in his interview that was pre-recorded with ITV that he doesn't believe that silence is going to solve any of the problems here. Whereas in terms of the Prince and Princess of Wales, we haven't heard anything, there hasn't been any briefing and it seems that we're unlikely to hear anything from them, Max.",

So it might be a logical response, as you suggest, perhaps, the palace just doesn't want to add any oxygen to this and thinks that by briefing in any way.That won't be a helpful response to this situation, if that is in fact, what Prince Harry believes has led to the tensions being where they are right now. And also because there's that royal motto never complain, never explain. And in response to people that are being public writing books, doing documentaries and sharing their story with the world, perhaps the best alternative if you don't want to escalate matters is, to remain silent.",
