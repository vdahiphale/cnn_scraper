This as Tim Walz and his first solo campaign event goes because into attack mode just moments ago. Plus, tonight, Ukraine making major gains inside Russia and they are doing it fast. Tonight, I'm going to speak to an award photo journalist who is there with those troops on the Russian line, seeing firsthand what happened when Ukraine invaded Russia, catching Putin by surprise. And Elon Musk going all in on MAGA, pushing Trump's talking points and even finishing his sentences for him. Is it good for the richest man alive? Let's go OUTFRONT. And good evening. I'm Erin Burnett. OUTFRONT tonight, the breaking news. He better snap out of it. That's a direct quote from a Trump insider, who is just one of many voices from Trump's inner circle tonight worried that the former president is spiraling and losing focus, that he's veering off message in event after event after event. And in fact, according to new reporting just out this hour from our Kristen Holmes and Steve Contorno, sources close to the former president say this race should be easy for Trump. They're telling their telling CNN, quote, talk about the economy and talk about immigration. Of course, Trump likes to talk about other things. Instead, he has dabbled and conspiracy theories, claiming that thousands of supporters that we saw in this picture at a rally in Detroit were doctored. Of course, we were -- our cameras were there, our photojournalists were there. It was not doctored. And just moments ago, Trump made this comment where he again focused on purposely mispronouncing Harris's name.

So that is talking about the crowd sizes, talking about Kamala Harris's ethnicity.Then you have him completely off message. One instance that was pointed out to me by a number of conservatives was him at a rally in Atlanta, Georgia, going after Governor Brian Kemp, the very popular Republican governor in what is now a very critical swing state. That's a message that they would not like him to be sending. And then the third is that people are really paying much more attention now. When you talk about him going off message on these fringe theories, he really runs a risk and this is what his allies are telling me. They're concerned about people remembering or voters remembering why they shied away from him in 2020, when he was pushing all of those lies about the 2020 election. Now if you talk to people who are close to him, who are outside of the campaign, they are encouraging him both privately and publicly to stay on message. And I want to read you one exchange between Larry Kudlow, who served on the Trump administration, and Kellyanne Conway, who obviously was part of the administration and led his successful 2026 -- or 2016 campaign, she says to Kudlow, the winning formula for President Trump is plain to see. It's fewer insults, more insights, and that policy contrasts, where Larry Kudlow says, don't wander off, don't call her stupid, or all kinds of names and stay on message. Now, partially, what's been alarming to people who are close to Donald Trump, is this picking up of these fringe conspiracy theories. It is something they've seen before and they worry that he is particularly susceptible when he is in a state of vulnerability. Obviously, Donald Trump has held at a lot of upsets in the campaign recently, particularly as we have seen the enthusiasm boost for Kamala Harris, the polling boost for Kamala Harris, and his advisers really blamed the accessibility that people have to him, that these kind of fringe conspiracy theorist have to him, whether it be at Mar-a-Lago, whether it'd be on the golf course, whether it'd be the fact that they have his cell phone number, many times these advisers don't even know who Donald Trump is speaking to on a regular basis. And so, that is where he's getting some of this and now he's at a point where he is promoting it. And that is where they see a problem, particularly when they want him to stay on message as this race seems incredibly tight.",

Astead Herndon, you just heard Kristen talking about that. And as I said, it is telling that you're hearing people on the inside have this concern.

We've asked this question so many times over the last year, and honestly, I think we should reframe the idea of message discipline with Donald Trump.I mean, when there is a person like Joe Biden across from him, he's more willing to talk about the economy. He's more willing to talk about the substance. When there's a person of color, when there's a woman, when there's someone who kind of puts him on edge, he has consistently been someone who leans into those personal attacks, the ad hominem, he leaned into conspiracy theories.

I think about that last speech on the Thursday, there was such promise of Donald Trump kind of find to get different version of themselves. Republicans were signaling that this was going to be a different version of Donald Trump.And we got the same rally version that we get all the time. And I really think that's indicative of someone who was thinking they were operating from a place of strength, but was really he operating from a time in which she was only doing he was only looking strong relative to his opponent.

However, because when he started questioning the -- when he raised the conspiracy theory of the A.I. generated crowd who did on Truth Social, it got a lot of attention, but is going to let get a lot more attention on Twitter if he does that.In addition to that, they have the mini rally ideas. Here, let's put it in a smaller setting, have it more policy focused. One of the things that you'll notice from that clip you played earlier of Donald Trump talking about being at a rally and not wanting to be on script, he's a performer as well as a candidate. One of the people I spoke to said, look, he likes to be at the center of attention and he wants to give his crowds, his people show. There's going to be less of a pressure doing that at these mini rallies. There are also bring back a top aide, Taylor Budowich, who is good at messaging and is well-liked both by Trump and by Vance, J.D. Vance, the vice presidential running mate. So those are some of the things that they're doing to sort of more insulate him and give him more of an opportunity, I think as Astead said to -- to be the better version of himself. The question is, can he? So far, there are a lot of doubts that that's going to be the case. He is going to be doing more local press interviews. He's doing them from Mar-a-L. They have a satellite pack there where there started to dial in a little more. And I wouldn't be surprised if they started doing more press conferences as well. Yeah.

And it's funny because everything I've been hearing is all these people are saying to do the best version of himself, they want him to be a fake version of himself. Donald Trump is a bombastic narcissist, and he loves attention, and he is not going to be happy, you know, being quiet or being on message. It's not who he is. And so, they don't know that. Look, we did this a million times. We did it in 2016. We did it throughout our time in the White House. We were all trying to keep him on message. Everybody was frustrated all the time.
