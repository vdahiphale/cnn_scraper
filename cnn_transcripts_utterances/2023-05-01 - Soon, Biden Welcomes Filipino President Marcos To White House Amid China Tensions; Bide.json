First Republic is now the third bank to fail in just the past seven weeks. Regulators are hoping this move is going to boost confidence in the U.S. banking system. Brianna?",

And of course, this is all happening amid these regional concerns over an increasingly aggressive China. We have Phil Mattingly at the White House for us. So, Phil, you have the president looking to reset this relationship. You cannot miss his concentration on shoring up these alliances with Asian countries, right, following on the state visit last week from the South Korean president.",

      "sentences": "Yes, it's been such an animating feature of the president's really entire foreign policy, but certainly his foreign policy in the region.And that is either reestablishing alliances that had shown signs of fraying or starting to wane in terms of their importance or their focus over the course of the years leading up to this moment or trying to ensure that alliances that have long existed only grow. And I think this is one of those cases where it's somewhere in between. You will recognize the name of the current leader of the Philippines. He's the son of the late and deposed dictator, Ferdinand Marcos. An individual, a very complex relationship with the U.S. One where there is still litigation related to the father in the country. And yet, the U.S. has utilized the ascension of the younger Ferdinand Marcos, Ferdinand Marcos Jr. As an effort to almost do a complete reversal on a relationship that had waned under Rodrigo Duterte, his predecessor, and has shown very clear results in the course of less than a year, including an expansion of U.S. access to military bases on the island. This is a meeting that is critical, not just for the region, but also in the partner-to-partner ties between the two countries as they continue to expand their military to military relationship, also economic relationship, trade relationship as well. And, Brianna, you hit the key point. While administration officials try and make clear this isn't about one nation, this isn't about just China, it very clearly is central to the focus. The northernmost point of the Philippines, only 100 miles away from Taiwan, which is obviously at the center of the tensions between the United States and China at the moment. And what the president and his national security team have very clearly been doing over the course of two-plus years is trying to pull tighter the alliances that have been long-standing. This is certainly a focal point of that effort as will be shown when the two presidents meet in the Oval Office in just a few moments.",

We'll keep you posted on what comes of that meeting. Meantime, staying overseas, 100 Americans who evacuated from war-torn Sudan have now reached the port city of Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. This, after leaving Port Sudan on the \"USNS Brunswick\" yesterday where American servicemembers guided the boarding process. The U.S. consul-general in Jeddah said about a thousand Americans have been evacuated since the start of the conflict. They are among the tens of thousands who have fled that country. In the last two weeks, more than 500 people have died in the fighting between opposing military factions.

And then the process over there getting the documents looked at. And then they go over across to the other side to clear Customs, have their passports stamped, and they're into Saudi territory. Many people we've been speaking to tell us they are grateful to the Saudis for having organized this. Because before there was this U.S. naval ship, many came on Saudi royal Navy ship, and they were just grateful to be away from an active war zone. Many of them had kids, families, elderly people, those who were sick, some who were stretching out of the ships. It's such a relief for them to be away from that. But also, a sense of survivor's guilt that they are lucky to get out because they have passports. For many others, they don't have the same privilege. And so many heartbreaking stories, people in tears at being able to leave when so many family members, even those sick or elderly, are stuck in Sudan as this fighting just drags on. But quite a scene that's been playing out over the last two weeks. This fighting is now in day three. And this port of Jeddah has become the main extraction point for so many people fleeing the fighting in Sudan. Larry Madowo, CNN, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

As you can see behind me, the riot police are just now trying to clear the last of the protesters out.It has been, Brianna, even by the standards of the last few weeks in France, a day of remarkable violence. Pitched battles between the riot police and you see lined up here and the Black Bloc protesters that came out in their many, many hundreds today, far more than any of the other protests. These are the most radical extreme elements that really seek out the confrontation with the police. That's why you've seen so much water cannon, tear gas, so many moments of direct confrontation between protesters and police. Behind that, there were of course all the hundreds of thousands of people who protested far more peacefully. And in fact, the figures will be good use to the unions, nearly 800,000 people nationally, more than 110,000 people here in Paris. And that makes it the biggest protest, Brianna, that we've seen since this movement began on January 19th. It's something of a success for the unions. They now regroup tomorrow morning to decide what their next step is. Because even if this pension reform is now becoming law, they intend to carry on fighting. And they'll be deciding tomorrow whether the next day of protests is Wednesday or June the 8th. But they intend to get once again many more people out on the streets of Paris to make clear their discontents. And I think this matters beyond the particular raising of the retirement age from 62 to 64, for what it means for Emmanuel Macron's ability to govern beyond that and get through the many ambitious reforms he had planned for his next four years in government -- Brianna?",

America the beautiful, America the lonely, diagnosablely so, in fact. U.S. Surgeon General Vivek Murthy says American is such a lonely nation that it's a health concern. He says, quote, \"The epidemic of loneliness and isolation has fueled other problems that are killing us and threatening to rip our country apart.\" The nation's top doctor laying out the problem and also how to fix it in a \"New York Times\" essay. We have CNN senior medical correspondent, Elizabeth Cohen, joining us with details on this. I mean, Elizabeth, this is a huge problem when you have the surgeon general highlighting this. DR. ELIZABETH COHEN, CNN SENIOR MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: That's right. And actually, he's been talking about this for years, before Covid, how loneliness increased during Covid and now. Let's take a look at some of the statistics that he cited in his \"New York Times\" piece. He cites a survey of about 2,500 Americans, 58 percent said that they have suffered from loneliness. He also looked at who was most likely to be lonely. It is black people. It is Hispanic people. It is parents. It is those who are lower income and those who are under 25. And really, I think the most powerful part of Dr. Murthy's essay is when he talked about his own struggles with loneliness. He talked about feeling isolated, even from the people that he loved the most, and how it eroded his sense of self-esteem -- Brianna?",
