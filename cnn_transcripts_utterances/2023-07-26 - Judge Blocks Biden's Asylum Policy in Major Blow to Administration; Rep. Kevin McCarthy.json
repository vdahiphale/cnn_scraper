And it was the latter in this case who sued against this rule. It was immigrant advocates who put forward this lawsuit saying that the administration should not be using this asylum rule and likening it to one that was used under the Trump administration and similarly blocked.So, again, what this does is that it largely bars migrants who transit through other countries to seek asylum in the United States if they hadn't already tried to seek refuge elsewhere. And, of course, there are many, if not, all migrants who come through different countries, like Mexico and Guatemala, to try to seek asylum in the United States. So, it barred a lot of them from having that opportunity, marking a decades-long departure from a decades-long protocol. Now, the administration has continued to defend it, including after this ruling. Take a listen to what the White House press secretary said just yesterday. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KARINE JEAN-PIERRE, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY:  The Department of Justice will appeal the decision and seek to extend the stay. And as we have said multiple times our border enforcement plan works. It is a deterrence, diplomacy and enforcement. We have seen that plan working. Unlawful border crossing have come down to the lowest that we have seen in the past two years.

His argument to members both behind closed doors and publicly is that an impeachment inquiry gives you more tools to give interviews, to seek information, to try and get some of those documents that Republicans want to get in order to make the case against Joe Biden. But, of course, there is going to be some trepidation among some members who still don't know if there is a direct tie to be had between Hunter Biden's business dealings and the president himself. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. DON BACON (R-NE):  I don't know that we've made the case for a formal impeachment inquiry yet. I do want the committee digging into this. I think the facts that we're seeing are alarming. REP. JIM JORDA (R-OH):  The speaker has been clear if, in fact, where the facts dictate, the Constitution dictates that we go to an impeachment inquiry phase of the investigation, we'll do that. And the advantage of when you get to that point is it's easier to get the information. REP.

He is a Trump nominee, got this job in 2018 with the support, I should note, of both of Delaware's Democratic U.S. Senators and Joe Biden, President Biden, when he took over in 2021, left David Weiss in place. Now, Weiss has somewhat responded to these allegations. He has written a letter to Congress saying, I have been granted ultimate authority over this matter. So, he said, I was in charge. But the question is, did he head off any avenues of investigation, which brings up this. These are the questions that ultimately David Weiss, we now know, has agreed to testify in front of Congress.

Essentially, he's trying to make this lawsuit from Ruby Freeman and Shaye Moss where they accuse him of defaming them. He's trying to make it go away. And the way he's doing that is that he's conceding that, yes, he did make these false statements about these women after the 2020 election. He's also saying that he acknowledges that those statements can be defamatory, that they were defamatory.But he's trying to avoid his own accountability here by saying in this court filing late last night that his statements mean that he shouldn't necessarily have to pay damages to them because his statements alone might not be what was hurting these women. And also, he's trying to say that what he was saying after the 2020 election is still protected speech, First Amendment constitutionally protected speech. Now, this is, like I said, a highly unusual filing. And it's the type of filing I have never seen before in a civil lawsuit. It's normally the sort of thing you might try and do in a criminal context, but this is a lawsuit he's facing. And so a judge has to look at this now. She has to determine whether this is going to be an acceptable way to resolve this lawsuit. And also I've reached out to the lawyer for Ruby Freeman and Shaye Moss to see if it's acceptable to them as well. They had tried. To make some sort of settlement with Giuliani before, and it didn't amount to anything.

So, he's trying to confine it just to this case.What it means to the special counsel is really going to be something that the prosecutors will have to decide. And, of course, not only do they have all those documents from his close colleague, Bernie Kerik, they also have sat down with Rudy Giuliani as investigators looking into criminal activity around the 2020 election.

He is no longer in the ICU.CNN's Omar Jimenez joining us now with more. Has the family spoken at all yet about what they think may have caused this cardiac arrest?",

Damar Hamlin, who suffered his own cardiac arrest during an NFL game in January, wrote something similar. Here for you guys, just like you have been for me. Shaquille O 'Neal's son, Shareef, who battled a heart condition that sidelined him from basketball temporarily, reacted to the news on Instagram simply commenting, no, no.There's no evidence Bronny's situation is similar to his, but moving forward, there are still major questions surrounding what exactly happened to one of the brightest new stars in the game. DR. JONATHAN KIM, DIRECTOR OF SPORTS CARDIOLOGY, EMORY UNIVERSITY: Sudden cardiac arrest and death is rare in young competitive athletes, but these cases are tragic and they do occur. There are nuances we know that based off of sex, self-identified race, even sport-type risk can differ among different athletes, but it is important to note that, thankfully, these cases are really quite rare. (END VIDEOTAPE) JIMENEZ (on camera):  Now, as rare as they are, this is actually the second time in as many years at USC with USC basketball that they've dealt with something like this. About a year ago, Vince Iwuchukwu, who's forward on the team, suffered a cardiac arrest and now he was treated, and months later, he was able to make a comeback. So, from a basketball perspective, I think there are a lot of people that that are hoping that that can happen here as well. But, obviously, with so little information, this is also a family decision on potentially what the long-term health implications are here and we're just going to have to see what those are.",

Obviously, we all think about you and your coverage of Damar Hamlin, wasn't that long ago, different circumstance here. But now, you have another young athlete at the prime of health, right, and this happens. We know it's rare. The question now is why, right? DR. SANJAY GUPTA, CNN CHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENTSome context, you know, going back to a study from 2015, we know that, again, rare, but just to give you some numbers, about 6,000 to 7,000 times a year, you do see these out of hospital sudden cardiac arrests in young athletes. Sports involved, you know, 39 percent of the time if people are under the age of 18, it's still involved about 13 percent of the time as you get older. If you get older than that, you know, 35 years and older, then you have related concerns due to coronary arteries, which can become blocked or occluded leading to a heart attack. That's not what this is here. So, sudden cardiac arrest does happen, rare, but these are the sorts of numbers that we're talking about.",

      "sentences": "Yes. So, let me just show you, because this comes up quite a bit. When we talk about a heart attack, there are these blood vessels that are on top of the heart over here called the coronary blood vessels. They actually supply blood flow to the heart. So, when you have a heart attack, you think of that more like a circulation problem. One of these arteries becomes blocked, heart muscle tissue dies, and that can lead to the heart attack.With a sudden cardiac arrest, it usually, seemingly comes out of nowhere. You might have an abnormality with some of the muscles of the heart or there could be an electrical problem with the heart. The electrical issues of the heart allow the chambers of the heart to beat in a coordinated fashion. If that gets thrown off for some reason, then you might have a sudden cardiac arrest. Someone goes pulseless, they become unconscious. Oftentimes, they require defibrillation and getting to a hospital, as it seems to have happened with Bronny.",
