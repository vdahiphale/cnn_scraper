That comes from a senior Democratic adviser. Also, according to the adviser, he has gone from saying Kamala cannot win to, do you think Kamala can win?

There's a lot of emphasis and a lot of positive unity on the Republican side. As a Republican, I think that's great. And we're having a tremendous week.But as soon as the convention's done, around Monday, Tuesday, all the attention is going to focus right on Joe Biden. And they're going to say, what are you going to do now, because now we're in real trouble. And as was just noted, you guys were talking about, he's - he - they're trying to - they're finally forcing him to look at the data. So, I still very much believe Biden will not be the nominee. Kamala Harris will be there. And my warning to Republicans is, don't take that for granted. That's not an easy race. If Kamala were smart, she's going to pick a Republican - a Democrat governor, like a Shapiro or an Andy Beshear, something like that. That's a new, refreshed ticket. It's a short timeline, but don't count them out by any means. And Republicans up and down the ticket are going to have to run hard to close this deal so we can win in November.",

There's a question of whether they're going to - how supportive they're going to be. Clearly that confidence is just cracked right through the party. So, the Democrat Party is in a complete mess right now. If Biden wants to stay, he's going to stay. And that's going to be a real problem for them. I'd love it if he stayed, because I think he's very easy for Republicans to beat. But my - my role here is to kind of hopefully remind Republicans what's really happening on the ground. And if the powers that be in the Democrat Party can convince him to move off, it's going to be a very different race here in just a month. And it's going to be a nail-biter. I still think Trump can win. I still think Republicans can be very successful. But we're going to have to work really, really hard, take nothing for granted. I think JD Vance is a great pick. He brings a whole different kind of energy and background to the top of the ticket. That'll even - that'll help a lot of our congressional, Senate and governor seats. Even the state seats on the Republican side can all benefit from that. But, at the end of the day, if the Republican - if the Democrats actually get their act together, we've got a race on our hands. And I've said it - like I said, I said it for over a year. I just - I just think that that's - that's the reality we're going to be facing in November. It's going to be a wild 100 days.",

Clearly, everybody has come on board on the Republican side. Folks that had their doubts and all that sort of thing. Folks like myself, who worked really hard to get another nominee in there. And we worked hard. And we had our primary. And the voters chose. Unlike the Democrats, on the Republican side, the voters made their choice. It wasn't my choice, but the voters made their choice. And now it's down to A versus B, that's Biden versus Trump today.So, I think the opportunity for the former president is to talk to all of America. To even talk to those Democrats that are still, you know, hanging on, the Democrat ticket, with - with all fingernail saying, please, you know, give me a better option than Joe Biden. He's going to be talking to them. He's going to be talking to a lot of folks in the rust belt, in Michigan, and in Pennsylvania, back in Georgia, all those swing states. Those folks that might have walked away in 2020 but realize that we've got to bring this case country together. So, I think it's going to be a good speech. I think what you've seen in the last hundred days, you know, well - even well before the assassination attempt, the debate showed a sense of professionalism from his campaign, a sense of discipline, if you will, on - on messaging, not just being completely blustery and - and - and, you know, going out there and just shooting from the hip. He's keeping his measures fairly controlled. And that's - that's exactly what you want to see in a candidate at this point. And I think it's going to resonate tonight and be very successful.",

And that's OK. It's saying that within the party we can have a variety of ideas and a variety of approaches here.So, Donald Trump clearly born with a silver spoon in his mouth and, you know, obviously had a lot of economic advantages. JD didn't. And talking about that background and about that contrast, that connects with folks that struggled with drug addiction, had, you know, that have been kind of suffering in poverty for too many years. He's lived it. That's a real life experience that could now be at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. That's an amazing opportunity that I think a lot of families are going to connect with. And yes, it's not Donald Trump's story. It's not every position that every Republican initially wants to take. But it's saying, we're going to put these ideas on the table. We're going to challenge the status quo. We're going to challenge that establishment. And I think '24 is all about that. People want the Washington establishment, the Washington elite to be disrupted and challenged. That's why Trump won in '16. I think that's why he's going to do very well again in '24. So, it's that kind of nature and that kind of disruption, I think, that as a team they bring to the table and resonates very well with a lot - a spectrum of American families.",

This is going to be a close race in November, just as it was four years ago. But increasingly, people remember and recognize what's at stake in this election.
