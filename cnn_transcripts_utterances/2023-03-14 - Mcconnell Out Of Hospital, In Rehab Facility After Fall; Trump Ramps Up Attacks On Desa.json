Over the course of treatment this weekend the leader's medical team discovered he also suffered a minor rib fracture on Wednesday for which he's also being treat. So that's the latest we heard. And in this update we also heard that his concussion recovery is proceeding well. But to hear these kind of injuries following a fall at his age is not uncommon. This just tells us he has a little more work to do before he's back at 100 percent.",

He's going after him. Donald Trump is mad at Mike Pence. Pence says history it going to hold Trump accountable. Trump says histories going to hold Mike Pence accountable for January 6. Donald Trump uses the tried-and-true tactics, wants to knock down all of his rivals or would be rivals. I think my question today about Governor DeSantis is whether his fairly controversial position, posture on the relevance of the war in Ukraine to U.S. policy, whether that's going to be impacted by what's happened with the drones over the Black Sea with the U.S. drones.",

And this is to Fox, to Tucker Carlson, so consider the audience there. Ron DeSantis called the invasion, the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the illegal unprovoked invasion a territorial dispute, basically saying the U.S. shouldn't be too involved there.

      "sentences": "I mean, look, so far Donald Trump has been the core of the -- sort of anti- -- not going to say anti-Ukraine but anti-U.S. involvement, limiting U.S. involvement. Some people have said that this puts DeSantis in Trump's camp. I think it puts DeSantis further to the right of Donald Trump. And that Donald Trump has said that Ukraine is not of vital national interest to the U.S., and it's more of vital interest to Europe and that the U.S. shouldn't be as involved.DeSantis has taken this further calling it a territorial dispute. There is -- Ukraine is a major wedge issue inside the Republican Party. There is a isolationist and nationalist wing, and just a wing that has fatigue from two decades of war in Iraq and Afghanistan that's saying the U.S. should focus on its problems back home. That is not a unanimous view inside the Republican Party by any means especially when it comes to Russia and what -- and the tests that Russia is making out of Ukraine right now. And you can see that Marco Rubio now criticizing DeSantis and they share a state. You know, Marco Rubio is a Republican Senator from Florida, but saying, no, this is not a territorial dispute. Nikki Haley and Tim Scott, much more in a we should do more not less position when it comes to Ukraine. So, we're seeing those battle line. But if you add Trump and DeSantis together in terms of early support you're looking at a majority of Republican early 2024 support and it goes to one of these two candidates and they are both now firmly in the get the U.S. out of Ukraine's war camp and that is very noteworthy. Yes, that says something. That is noteworthy. And you look at new CNN polling that suggests exactly what you just laid out there, that the majority of Republican voters for now at least when presented with nine potential candidates, Donald Trump is number one at 40 percent, and Ron DeSantis is there at 36 percent. This isn't just an inside party issue now in terms of where Ukraine stands. This is something that the White House I would imagine is watching closely as well because when you've got a divided Congress, you've got a president who's going to have to go back and ask for more funding to support this war throughout the year.",

And so, after that was formed and people could come forward to some civilian review board and made complaints against the Louisville Police Department. They were having trouble -- according to this inspector general -- with getting information from the police department to conduct these investigations against these complaints of officers.So, this takes out a way. There's now going to be more transparency for the public in Louisville. There's a new mayor, a new interim police chief, so lots of changes there. Two headlines to really point out here. One of them is that this is now going to allow the inspector general's office to require officers to be present for when they actually interview witnesses, and they're going, of course, have due process for those officers as well. So they're going to be a part of this process as they conduct these investigations by the inspector general's office. And the second is a big one, and this is body cameras. Of course we know how much body camera footage is so important to come to light. That wasn't exactly happening in Louisville as we have seen not just there but of course in other instances across the country. So now this is going to allow the inspector general's office access to that body camera footage as well as administrative documents to conduct that investigation and have no lag. Because that's also a big thing, right? They want that video to be -- you know, handed over right away so there is no questions of any manipulation of video by the police department. So, these are two big headlines. And as you guys mention this directly addresses sort of the DOJ conversation that points out what they pointed out last week about what reforms needed today be made. But I want you to hear from the police chief her response to these new reforms. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) CHIEF JACQUELYN GWINN-VILLAROEL, LOUISVILLE POLICE DEPARTMENT: I fully know from where I stand today that my officers are wanting to do what is best for the department and for the community. So I'm going to put myself out here and say I've got faith in them as I stand today that they will do what is in the best interest in order to move these processes along. This is a new day.
