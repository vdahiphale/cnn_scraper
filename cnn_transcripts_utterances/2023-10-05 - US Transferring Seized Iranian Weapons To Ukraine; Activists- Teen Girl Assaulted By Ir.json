A multibillion dollar funding bill for Ukraine is in limbo, after Republicans ousted the speaker for the US House, Republican Kevin McCarthy.And now concerns are growing in both Washington and Kyiv that any delay of military assistance will have serious consequences on the battlefield. In the meantime, the White House has authorized a transfer of more than a million rounds of Iranian ammunition and other weapons seized by the US Navy. Iran's Revolutionary Guard was behind the shipment, which was destined for Houthi rebels in Yemen, in direct violation of UN sanctions. For months the weapons which include assault rifles, anti-tank missiles, and propellant and fuses for rocket propelled grenades have been stored at a US military base in the Middle East, while officials in Washington worked on the legal process of sending the stockpile to Ukraine.

The Americans can only produce maybe 11 thousand rounds in a month of artillery shells at least in one ammunition plan. So, you know, they essentially can't keep up this rate of artillery fire.

So the comments are the context of questions he got from five retired conservative cardinals, saying would he reaffirm that marriage is just between a man and a woman? And he said, yes, of course. However, he opened the door to say, but same-sex blessings of unions is something we want to discuss. Because he said today in his opening homily, the church needs to be welcomed -- \"tuti, tuti, tuti (ph)\" -- for everyone, everyone, everyone. And so his real vision is to open the inclusive element of the church. And so, he's not going to say that we're going to sanction gay marriage. The church will not be doing that. But we need to allow people who are gay, and others who feel excluded, to be more included and maybe this blessing of unions is a step toward that.",

And boy, are they looking at some of the biggest, most difficult, controversial issues which are facing the Catholic Church.So along with this issue of same-sex unions, there will be priestly celibacy, married priests, ordination of female deacons, as well as extending sacraments to divorced people. And you mentioned this. So Pope Francis has sort of indicated this position, this sort of big tent approach, if you like. And you said the quote, saying the church should \"avoid becoming a rigid church, which arms itself against the world and looks backward.\" It should avoid becoming \"a lukewarm church, which surrenders to the fashions of the world. Church doors must be open to all, all, all.\" Which I think is the \"tuti, tuti, tuti\" (ph) quote. So I guess Francis seems to me, anyway -- you can correct me if I'm wrong -- he seems to be trying to influence, you know, church practice as opposed to church doctrine.",

Is it inclusive?And that's really been the message of Francis. It's about mercy. It's about how you have to get everybody in, not decide who's out. So it very much is a tone and a perspective. And Francis has really made some real shifts but not a lot of changes in doctrine, but really a way of looking at. And saying it's not really about law and legality, the way many would interpret the church. It's really about mercy and compassion and forgiveness and inclusion. Now, within that structure, obviously, you have certain standards and certain laws, et cetera, but that's not really his focus. His focus is really the inclusion of the church.",

And they're doing it to push the agenda to say, you know, as, priests-- you know, yesterday was the Feast of St. Francis of Assisi, John. OK? And all over the world, Christian churches blessed animals. So you're saying that priests can bless animals? I know priests who have blessed guns. And you're saying priests can't bless people, who want to have a loving relationship and ask God to help strengthen their commitment and their resolve and their relationship? I mean, it sounds kind of ludicrous in many ways. So I think Francis is trying to say, the perception is that the church is closed.
