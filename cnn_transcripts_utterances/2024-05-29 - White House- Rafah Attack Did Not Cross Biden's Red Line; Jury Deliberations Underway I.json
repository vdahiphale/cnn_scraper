      "sentences": "A very warm welcome to the show everyone, I'm Isa Soares. Tonight, a new CNN investigation found U.S.ammunitions were used in a deadly strike on Rafah. We'll look at how the Biden administration is reacting to this. Then Donald Trump's fate in his historic criminal trial is now in the hands of 12 jurors as jury deliberations now begin. We'll have the very latest. Plus, we are just an hour away from polls closing in South Africa in the country's most pivotal election since the end of apartheid. That story, of course, and much more just ahead. But first this evening, the White House says its support of Israel is not wavering and no red lines have being crossed after devastating strike killed dozens of people at a displacement camp in Rafah. A CNN analysis of video from the scene found that U.S.-made bombs were used in Sunday's attack against two Hamas targets. Gaza's Health Ministry says at least 45 people were killed, and that includes women and children. Israel says its investigation on what caused the fire that incinerated tents with families inside, suggesting there may have been a secondary explosion. Israel is brushing off global outrage, pressing ahead with its offensive in Rafah. And this, as you can see there is our first look at tanks advancing further west near the Egyptian border. A top Israeli security official says the war could last another seven months to achieve the objective of destroying Hamas. Let's get more now on all of these strands, our Jeremy Diamond is in Jerusalem for us this evening, Kylie Atwood is in Washington. And Kylie, let me start with you because at this time roughly yesterday, we heard, of course, the White House said that the attack in Rafah that killed those 45 people did not cross President Biden's red lines. Today, this analysis from CNN shows weapons used in the attack were U.S. made, what more do we know about this? What has been the reaction from the Biden administration to the CNN analysis? KYLIE ATWOOD, CNN U.S. SECURITY CORRESPONDENT: Yes, that's right. So, the administration continues to say that, you know, there are no policy changes on behalf of the Biden administration after this. They obviously are saying that the attack was horrific in such that it killed dozens of innocent Palestinians. They repeatedly say that one death of an innocent civilian is too many, but they are also stopping short of saying that this is going to change the Biden administration's policy with continued support for Israel, because they say that this was according to Israel, a precision-guided attack effectively gone wrong of course. But that, they aren't actually carrying out an all-ground offensive on Rafah, which the U.S. has repeatedly warned them against doing. However, they're also calling for Israel to carry out a swift investigation to figure out how this precision-guided efforts actually went awry. Of course, they killed those Hamas leaders that they were going for, but they'd also killed those Palestinians. Listen to what the Secretary of State said about this earlier today.

      "sentences": "Well, certainly, what it indicates is that the Israeli military is not going to stop, it's acampaign in Gaza after it concludes this military offensive in Rafah. This indicates that the war will continue at least through the end of the year as Tzachi Hanegbi; the National Security adviser to the Israeli Prime Minister says to expect at least another seven months of fighting to quote, \"deepen our achievements\". And he also says that it is to destroy Hamas and Islamic Jihad within the Gaza Strip. This is, you know, notable for a few reasons. Keep in mind that the Israeli Prime Minister in April, more than a month ago said that he believed that Israel was quote, \"on the brink of victory against Hamas\". And what we have seen in the time since then is the Israeli military sending ground troops back into areas of northern Gaza that it had previously withdrawn from months ago as Hamas fighters returned to the area. And that indicates that there is a real broader strategic question of what Israel is doing to actually secure the achievements that it is making in Gaza in terms of eliminating Hamas and securing territory. Because clearly, as the United States and as Secretary Blinken is pointing out here, there appears to be no strategy from the Israeli government in terms of the day after the war in Gaza, in terms of establishing some other kind of Palestinian civilian government inside the Gaza Strip. And so, that is going to be a long-term challenge for the Israeli government and for the Israeli military, one that we have seen has really percolated within Israeli politics and within the Israeli military itself, with a lot of questions and fingers being pointed at the Israeli Prime Minister himself.",

Of course, previously a presidential candidate running against formerPresident Trump for the Republican Party nomination. Also, as you said, the former ambassador to the United Nations during the Trump administration, she has staked out very clearly that she is on Israel's side as this war has grown tremendously challenging. She has been a voice for the Republican Party who has tried to stake out that position that the United States, there can be no daylight between the United States and Israel. So, on this trip, she wrote on that photo that I think you put up, \"finish them\", on an Israeli artillery shell. And the key thing here is not only that she wrote, \"finish them\", which you know, we understand means finish Hamas, of course, the terrorist organization that Israel has been going after. But she also did that the day after there was that attack that killed dozens of displaced Palestinians. Of course, Israel has said that it was a mistake for those deaths to have occurred, but the timing here was just horrendous, because there is a lot of push-back on her for not understanding the plight of the Palestinians as they have had to endure the challenge of this continued war in Gaza, been displaced, being killed and the like. But for Nikki Haley, she wanted to make this trip to Israel, it was very important for her to make sure that she was the voice in the Republican Party, saying that don't listen to anyone, Israel, the United States isn't backing away, we will be with you until the end here.",

In fact, the judge here spent just a bit about an hour instructing thesejurors on really how to apply the specific law to all of the evidence they've heard over the past five weeks. After that, the juries -- the jurors went into the deliberation room about 11:30 this morning, so, they've been at it for almost three hours now. We're expecting they will go about another two-and-a-half hours until 4:30 today. Of course, unless they reach a verdict sooner. Now, interestingly, the jury does have a laptop with them in their deliberation room where they are able to access all of the evidence that was admitted throughout this trial. That includes those checks that were signed by Donald Trump, that do provide part of the basis for these 34 charges of falsifications of business records, it also includes the vouchers and the invoices. So, they will be able to look at that throughout their deliberations. The judge, of course, was very clear to the jury, you know, they must decide this case unanimously. They must evaluate all of the facts and evidence they've heard throughout this trial. And the judge at parts was very specific, in one part, he even said, you know, even if they find that Donald Trump was just simply involved rather than being the main player in that scheme to falsify business records, they can find him guilty. They also have to find in addition to the whole falsification of business records aspect, they need to find that there was another violation of the law, like federal election law or tax fraud, that's in order for these charges to rise to felony counts. So, they kind of have to find two fold on each count, and then the judge talked about Michael Cohen. He noted that the jury can in fact take account of Michael Cohen's guilty plea several years ago for lying to Congress when they're considering his credibility. And this was a really interesting part, Isa, and this is standard in jury instructions. But if the jury finds that one part of Michael Cohen's testimony is not true, they can disregard --",

I want tobring in national security attorney, Bradley Moss, who joins us now live from Washington D.C. Bradley, great to have you back on the show. Let me pick up really where Jessica Schneider just left off, and really the jury instructions. And one of those instructions that really caught my eye was the fact that they cannot convict Trump on Michael Cohen's testimony alone because he's an accomplice, but they can use evidence if corroborated with other evidence. I mean, explain that and what else perhaps stood up from that long list?",

The only way a defendant could ever respond is somebody to testify himself, which would, you know, simply run a follow up of those Fifth Amendment rights. It's not their burden, it's the government's burden to demonstrate beyond a reasonable doubt that a crime was committed. And so, this is how the Manhattan DA's office has structured this, was always that they built a wall in this case of evidence of documents, e- mails, texts, other witness testimony around Michael Cohen, so that any credibility issues that he has because of his own past, his own legal problems would not on its own crash the case. The question is, does the jury find him sufficiently credible? Does the jury find the remainder of the evidence sufficiently corroborating to conclude that Donald Trump, in fact, should be found guilty?",

But that doesn't necessarily mean something good or bad for either party. Lawyers are more legally trained in the nuances, they understand details better, but they're also more attuned to how to decide what is and truly is not credible. So, efforts to try to take down Michael Cohen with some of these cross-examination attacks on, you know, various things he said may not play as well with those lawyers. But in the end, this is how the criminal justice process works. These are why we put it in the hands of juries, 12 ordinary citizens. We have, you know, several men, several women, various walks of life. This is how it's supposed to work. Donald Trump is going to be judged here by a jury of his peers.",

I think what they're hanging their hat on is that, one, two, maybe even three jurors will not go along with a guilty verdict, conclude that there's -- the jury will conclude there's no way they can reach unanimity on a decision and a hung jury is declared.

Few  Britain -- sorry, there were Germany, France, Poland, then following suit. What we heard today from Secretary Blinken was interesting.

But certainly, a suggestion that the policy may shift -- his words were that American policy has adapted and adjusted to what's been happening on the battlefields of Ukraine consistently over the last couple of years, and that it would continue to do so. And this, Isa, was in direct response to a question about whether or not it was changing its position. So, an interesting shift in position -- remember, just a few months before NATO marks its 75th anniversary, and even as, as you said, Russia has warned directly in the shape of Vladimir Putin only yesterday, that this would represent a serious escalation and something as a declaration of war.

Local residents have actually been getting warnings to avoid outdoor activities because authorities just don't know exactly what is inside these things. Photos show plastic bags with garbage and filth, as South Korea described it, you know, scraps, paper, dirt, that sort of thing. North Korea says this is a response to South Korean activists sending prohibited materials. For a long time now South Koreans -- a lot of NGOs, sometimes former North Korean defectors that are now living in South Korea, they send into the North, sometimes using balloons leaflets, food, medicine, even media like Korean dramas or K-pop, music that is forbidden for North Koreans to listen to, programs that are forbidden for North Koreans to watch, but they send them from South Korea anyway as part of this propaganda push to try to convince the North that there's a better way of life in the South. This has been going on for a long time. North Korea has long accused the South of psychological warfare and has promised retaliation. So, now, by sending these hundreds of trash filled balloons, they want South Korean authorities to experience the headache of cleaning up and locating all of this, just like they say they've been dealing with for a long time. But for North Koreans who receive content, particularly from South Korea, the penalties can be extremely severe. Remember, we showed you rare footage of those North Korean teenagers, apparently sentenced to hard labor for viewing and distributing South Korean content. There was a time, 2017 2018, when there were some brief periods of cultural exchange between the North and South, part of that diplomatic detente. And at that time, North Koreans were allowed to legally get a glimpse of South Korean culture. But those days seem like a distant memory now, with information controls arguably tighter than ever inside North Korea. And now, these trash balloons being sent to the South, part of this tit for tat back and forth and just yet another sign of the escalating tensions on the Korean peninsula. Will Ripley, CNN, Taipei.

The jury, as you can see there on your screen, is made up of 12 people, seven men and five women. They have been deliberating just over three hours now in nine minutes. They will need to decide if Donald Trump is guilty of falsifying business records to pay off adult film star. The prosecution claims it's election interference, but the defense says Trump is not guilty. Now, the demands of the trial have prevented Trump from aggressively campaigning for president, although his lack of appearances may not be hurting him with voters. Recent polls show current President Joe Biden down in several key states. Let's look at further larger, of course, implications of this and the trial. Excuse me. Steve Contorno. Steve, great to see you. We have seen -- I think it's fair to say, Steve, seen more of Trump in the court than on the campaign trail.

Lots of black voters, lots of Latino voters, and he has been making the case that, look, what has the Democratic Party done for you in all the years that you have given them your support? Now, there are -- majority of black voters continue to say that they will support the Democratic ticket, but again, if Trump is able to shrink that margin, even just a little bit, Philadelphia is a state where that could come -- or Pennsylvania is a state that could come into play, where Joe Biden is today, could affect the outcome in Michigan, where Detroit could be swung by black voters. Same thing with Georgia. These are all key states that Democrats really need to win once again, otherwise, it could be another four years of President Trump.",

The CNN analysis indicates made use of weaponry provided by the United States. But pressure is growing and not just internationally. A social media campaign title, as you can see there, \"All Eyes on Rafah,\" has gone viral, bringing wider condemnation and calls for change in strategy in order to avoid devastation of the civilian population, of course, of Gaza. To get greater perspective on the wider reaction to recent events as well as revelations, let's go now to former State Department Middle East negotiator, well-known face here on the show, Aaron David Miller, who's a senior fellow of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. Aaron, Great to have you back on the show. Let me pick up, really, with that CNN analysis that we have been reporting that U.S.-made munitions were used in that deadly strike in Rafah that killed 45 people, mostly women and children. This time on the show, roughly yesterday, Aaron, you know, and prior, I should say to this analysis, the White House said the attack did not cross President Biden's red lines. It falls short of what it deemed to be a ground operation. I want you to have a listen to this little excerpt. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And the reality is, again, I understand the shock and the outrage, but if you look at why the president seems to be giving the Israelis extraordinary flexibility and is reluctant to really get tough, it's been this way over the last nine months. Partly, it's the president's -- this president's emotional identification with Israel. Second, it's the fact that Israel is not involved in a conventional war against another state. It's involved in a war against Hamas, a terrorist organization which willfully and discriminately kills civilians on October 7th, and then took hostages, which it continues to abuse. There's the politics of it, we know well. The Republicans, in response to one pause of one shipment, became outraged. And finally, I think it's -- in the end, I think that the Biden administration internally believes that the only way to extricate or de- escalate this crisis is through an Israeli-Hamas deal. Negotiations, temporary ceasefire, six weeks to break the battlefield dynamic, surge humanitarian assistance. And to get that, to get that deal, you're obviously going to require Hamas' assent, but you're also going to require the assent of a government headed by a man who's conflated, Benjamin Netanyahu, his own political and legal travails with the prosecution of this war, which I think he believes needs to go on. So, it's the worst leader at the worst time in the worst set of circumstances. That's the situation the president is dealing with. And frankly, we're approaching the ninth month of this war. Unlikely to change, it seems to me.",
