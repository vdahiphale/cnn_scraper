It is day three, also known as Veep Day here at the convention. J.D. Vance, stepping into a spotlight brighter than he's ever faced before, about to deliver a speech more important than he's ever given before.The Ohio senator has been Donald Trump's vice presidential pick for just over 40 hours now. Who's counting? Tonight, all the reporting points to him leaning heavily on his life story, growing up poor in the Rust Belt as he introduces himself to Republican and Trump faithfuls, a story and background that Vance himself says that Trump hopes help them win in states like Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin. J.D. Vance's big day follows a night that can be summed up as burying the hatchet. Five of Trump's former Republican rivals taking to the stage to give him their full embrace, including Nikki Haley.

And I don't think anyone will question that it is a pretty remarkable journey from him growing up in a very unstable childhood. His family struggled with opioid addiction. And then he went on to go to Yale Law School, he wrote the bestselling book, Hillbilly Elegy, detailing his childhood. He was a Marine. He was a venture capitalist. He was only in the Senate for a year-and-a-half until Donald Trump tapped him to become his vice president.So, that's really what we're told he's going to be focusing on tonight. And that's according to someone I know who is helping work on that speech with him. Now, I do want to read for you what someone told me, because I think this kind of encapsulates it perfectly. They wrote, quote, if you want to crack suburban women, get them to watch the screen adaptation of Vance's memoir, Hillbilly Elegy. His life story is so powerful. Expect a lot of focus on his bio and his life story, the source said. And it is interesting as well, we saw in recent days that the screen adaptation and the book of Hillbilly Elegy has actually spiked. It's true (ph). We have the numbers here, about 1,179 percent in viewership of the screen adaptation, and it's obviously a number one and number two bestseller on Amazon, and so all of that in the aftermath of him becoming the vice presidential pick. But, look, I also think you can hear J.D. Vance. He's very smart when it comes to policy. I think you'll hear him walk through some of that as well, touch on foreign policy, something that he talks about often in the Senate.",

We know he purchased a five-foot ladder that morning, Saturday, at 9:00 A.M., at Home Depot near his house. That ladder has never been found to date, but the investigation has developed that he climbed up onto an air conditioner handler, and you can see that they're all around these buildings, and then hoisted himself onto a very low roof that's in the center of that complex, almost kind of in a courtyard, which would have been away from the view of a lot of people. Before that, and this is interesting, he had already attracted the attention of security people at the screening area for the rally. He had been walking by the magnetometers with a rangefinder in his hand. Now, a rangefinder is something that shooters use to measure the distance in long shots. Golfers use them, too. It looks like a small pair of binoculars. But if you're a police officer or someone who knows about firearms, you'll know what that is when you see it. He was carrying it in his hand and kind of circling around the mag area. There's conflicting information as to whether he went through the mags, which means he was unarmed, but he had this in his hand and had to go through screening or whether he just stayed outside, but they started looking at him, but then he leaves the area and, you know, goes out of view from that inner perimeter. So, that is just interesting that he was already on the radar a little bit, which happens often in these things. They look at somebody, then they leave the secure area. The rangefinder comes up again, though, because as he gets to that roof, they see him looking through the range finder and one sniper team is looking at him looking at them through the range finder but this all now starts to happen very quickly because now a police officer is coming up the ladder behind him. We know about that confrontation with the firearm, then he comes up and fires that shot those sniper teams are trying to determine and talking to each other about who is this guy? Is he law enforcement? Is he part of one of the other sniper teams that's supposed to be in that building? And then that first shot fires and then everything goes very quickly. So, we're learning kind of a lot about those moments leading up to it.",
