I'm Becky Anderson in Doha, in Qatar. And breaking news as we come on the air. A four-day truce between Israel and Hamas is set to take effect at this hour. Nearly seven weeks of punishing air and ground campaigns to root out the militant group now on hold. This is part of a deal to secure the release of Israeli hostages captured in the October 7th terror attack. According to Qatar, which helped broker the deal, the first hostages are expected to be released at 4 p.m. local time, about nine hours from now. Women and children, some from the same families, will be turned over to the Red Cross. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says the deal is not without its challenges. And the Israeli military warning there could be changes at any moment. Well, Israel's military operation, of course, prompted by the Hamas terror attacks back in October that killed around 1,200 Israelis and foreign nationals. It could take some time before we know just how successful this pause in fighting will be. Qatar's foreign ministry spokesperson says the aim is for a lasting truce that would extend beyond four days and lead to negotiations to end the violence. The Israeli government said earlier this week an extra day could be added to the pause in fighting for every ten additional hostages released. Well, meanwhile, the Israeli military kept up the bombardment of Gaza in the hours leading up to the truce. CNN crews witnessed explosions across the border from their vantage point in Southern Israel. And Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant said the military campaign could go, quote, \"forcefully\" for at least two months more after this pause. Well, I asked Qatar's foreign ministry spokesperson -- of course Qatar, has mediated these talks, this negotiation. I asked Majed Al- Ansari what would constitute a breach of this truce. This is what he told me. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DR. MAJED AL-ANSARI, QATARI FOREIGN MINISTRY SPOKESPERSON: I don't think I can get into the technicalities, you know, tactically on the ground. Of course, this is to be handled by the, you know, people on the ground. But what I can tell you is that the agreement is about full cessation of hostilities within the four days. So obviously, any resumption of hostilities of any kind would be a breach. And I think it's very important that lines of communication remain open so that any possible breach, however it is defined, is communicated immediately to both sides and there is a way to walk back from it and make sure that we continue with -- with it.

An Israeli officials says a total of 39 Palestinian prisoners will be released on Friday but not until a group of 13 women and children, hostages from Gaza, are back in Israeli hands. The Israeli government has notified the families of the first group of hostages set to be released on Friday. And the U.S. says it will contact families of Americans released, after it has confirmation that they are departing Gaza. Among the ten Americans being held in Gaza is 3-year-old Abigail Edan. U.S. President Joe Biden said on Thursday that he has his fingers crossed that this little girl will be released. Qatar says it will be receiving a list of hostages to be freed in a -- on a day-by-day basis, in a day-by-day process. Israel will also -- this is the schedule, at least, this is the plan, Israel expected to hand over a list of Palestinian prisoners expected to be released. Here's the founder of the HOSTAGE FAMILIES FORUM in New York, speaking on Thursday. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) OMER LUBATON-GRANOT, HOSTAGES AND MISSING FAMILIES FORUM: I think that every soul that we'll manage to bring back, Judaism will say that every person is a whole world. So every person that we can get out of there, it's amazing and it's good. It's the good news that we are waiting for, for a long six weeks that we have only bad news, and only hard times. But we still remember and understand that the struggle is long. We will have to help the ones who will come back and, hopefully, we'll see them come back to recover and return to a normal life as much as possible. And we will have to keep fighting for the rest of them because Hamas is not planning on opening the gates and let people just go. It doesn't matter if they are Israeli, or American, or Canadians, or Thais. It doesn't matter. They took innocent people. They took innocent people from the houses in a vicious attack. And we are highly devoted to bringing every -- each and every one of them home. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

They should be, they should throughout all of these seven weeks, been, if not providing those goods and needs themselves, then allowing humanitarians unfettered access without undue interference so that we could address those needs.

That has been impossible on this occasion. For that reason, Dan, they have built in certain obligations from both sides every day and have made it absolutely clear to both sides, to Israel and to Hamas, what those obligations are. Can you just take us through what we -- what we understand this deal to include? And what you make of this deal, given that you've been -- you know, you have such experience in hostage negotiation. O'SHEA: Well, two things that I do know. And I'm not privy to all the details of what was actually negotiated. But what has come to light is the fact that the Red Cross and Red Crescent will be able to visit the hostages within Gaza. Conversely, the concern and fear Hamas would have is that, obviously, then it could get released where the remaining hostages are held. But also, I've been told that drones will not be able to fly during certain hours, presumably during daylight. So that's just part of the level of distrust these two sides have, and that's just two examples of how -- how complex and how fragile this -- this truce between two sworn enemies is. And we can just hope and pray that it does last for four days, and there is a transfer of both the hostages on one side and the Palestinian prisoners on the other.
