It's not something that she needs to focus in on her campaign ads. I mean, we're talking about it on the panel. It gets talked about on a regular basis from Democratic strategists. So she understands the history of it, but she also understands the difficulties that come with that. She's aware that when it came to Hillary Clinton that she did not end up shattering that glass ceiling. So I think there is an awareness that she needs to be focusing on policy issues. On defining why she would be the best president; not why she would be the best woman president and not why she would be best Black woman to do this. And I think that's where she's really trying to define herself and say this is not about identity. This is that I am the best person to do the job. And I think that is an evolution and the message around identity and gender that we've seen within the Democratic Party, and I think more broadly, in the country.",

That's a pretty powerful combination and it comes at a time when reproductive rights, abortion politics, the post-Dobbs decision, the end of Roe v.

There are -- they are completely zeroed in there and they do still have, to Lindsey Graham's point, advantages with voters on issues like immigration and the economy that they can try to take advantage of.

And I do think whether you have a crowd of 10,000 or a crowd of 100, you can still go completely off the rails if that's what you decide that you want to do.But I do think one of the elements that is going to be interesting is watching how former President Trump and how Sen. Vance try to balance out the groups to whom they're messaging as well as the geographic places where they're messaging. And we were talking about boys versus girls a minute ago. One of Sen. Vance's problems is the woman vote right now, quite candidly. The effort to try to bolster or recapture support in Georgia is also a dynamic that I think is really interesting. The -- what was the Biden-Harris ticket and is now the Harris-Walz ticket does have vulnerability on two issues -- and one of those issues in inflation, and one of those issues is the border. And while we are seeing that American voters don't fully blame Vice President Harris for all the things that they might not like about what's happened in the last four years, the border really is an area where she is vulnerable. And that's going to be something that she is going to need -- she'll be -- she'll be coming out of the defensive on. And Trump is right to see a vulnerability there.",

I think it was clearly easier for them to deal with that when Biden was at the top of the ticket. Now, of course, with Harris, Trump has been calling her stupid. They have been -- many Republicans have been trying to convince him not to do that. Here was the latest round of him doing that -- calling her stupid.

I know you're actually in touch with a lot of these groups and there is a change in how they are approaching this because Harris is the person that is going to be accepting this nomination and not President Biden. How is that playing out on the ground? JOEL RUBIN, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST, FORMER DEPUTY ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF STATE UNDER PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA (via Webex by Cisco):  Yeah, that's right, Kasie. Really, there's a couple of different lanes now in front of us for these protests. There's the people who are organizing the uncommitted voters, and they're going to be participating alongside the convention. They have delegate representatives and have largely expressed support for Kamala Harris as the nominee. And then separately, there in the street protests, much more aggressive strain. And I think we're going to see that split continue. I think it's very important to ensure that there is a policy discussion, as there should be, about what happens on Israel and Gaza and how president-to-be Harris will handle that. But when it comes to the street protests, the danger here is that they can veer quickly into hate speech and some of what we saw in Washington a couple of weeks ago when Prime Minister Netanyahu was in Washington, which Kamala Harris, as vice president, condemned appropriately. So I think that's where this is heading. The sort of pragmatic strain that wants to work to try to shape policy, and then the street strain which, quite frankly, may not really want to listen to any argument that is put forward.",
