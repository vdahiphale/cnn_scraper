I want to get straight to our breaking news this hour. Any minute now, U.S. President Joe Biden will welcome President-elect Donald Trump to the White House. Hard feelings are being set aside, as the outgoing President prepares to meet with the man who is both his predecessor and his successor. Four years ago, then-President Trump did not offer any White House invitation to Mr. Biden. But soon, they will be discussing seeing their starkly different ideologies in the Oval Office. Trump's first stop was at, in Washington, D.C., was at the Republican Candidate Forum. He was met with a joyous welcome for Republican lawmakers who are gathering to pick their leaders for the next session of Congress. Now, whomever they pick will help Trump carry out his agenda in the coming years. The President-elect addressed lawmakers and talked about the positive election outcome for the Republican Party. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP (R), FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT AND CURRENT PRESIDENTIAL- ELECT: You know we had like historic kind of numbers, especially for the President, but we won't get into that. But, the House did very well, and I think we're responsible for 31, helping you with 31, meaning, we could have lost by quite a bit, and we ended up -- I guess you'll be five up. Are you looking at five or four? Five or four, right? It doesn't matter. We get used to one for a little while. When you can get used to one, you can get used to anything. So, I just want to thank everybody. You've been incredible. We worked with a lot of you to get you in, and you helped me, and you helped me too, and my numbers were -- so, they say the 129 years, the most important election in 129 years. That's pretty good. (END VIDEO CLIP) SOLOMON: Now, even before Trump touched down in Washington, the President-elect was sending shock waves through Washington, as he unveils more cabinet picks. On Tuesday night, he announced that Pete Hegseth would be the next Secretary of Defense. Hegseth is an Army veteran and a host on Fox News. He has s been an outspoken defender of Trump and a critic of current military policies. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

That is something Biden and his advisors have stressed he is trying to ensure it happens in the coming months.

      "sentences": "Well, Rahel, I just want to let you know that we just got word from the print poolers over at the White House that this meeting between President-elect Joe Biden and -- President-elect Trump and President Joe Biden has started. It appears that they spoke very briefly, and Trump thanked the President for a smooth transition, noting that Trump said politics was tough, and Biden said, you're welcome. The reporters were then pulled out into the room for now this private portion of this meeting between President Biden and President- elect Trump to begin.But, as we were talking about, for Biden, this is really a step in showing that he is committed to the peaceful transfer of power. This is a tradition that has gone back many, many decades to Presidents before. Trump was the only one to have shunned this tradition of inviting his successor to the White House. Biden is trying to restore some normalcy and some order back to these transitions. But, heading into the meeting, National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan said that Biden also wanted to talk about the most pressing domestic and foreign policy issues of the day. Of course, Trump stands to inherit two major conflicts, one in Ukraine, as well as in the Middle East. Biden is expected to spend these final weeks that he is in office, especially arguing that aid for Ukraine should continue beyond his presidency. Biden has directed his team to disperse all of the approved aid and money to Ukraine, as -- at a time when Trump has really cast doubt on what that future U.S. support for Ukraine might look like. There is also the conflict in the Middle East, which Biden's team is still hopeful that they can reach some type of ceasefire and hostage deal between Israel and Hamas in Gaza, though, right now, those talks do remain at a standstill. I will note that President Biden, later this afternoon, is actually set to meet with the families of the American hostages who are believed to be held hostage and held captive by Hamas in Gaza. So, those two foreign policy issues are also items that could be on the agenda today. But, for President Biden, this meeting is really an attempt to show that he is committed to this peaceful transfer of power, something that he was not afforded back when he had beat Trump in 2020, and this meeting is a key sign of that.",

This has been so central to Joe Biden's term in office. He views it as, I think, the most important part of his presidency. And I think he is quite sincerely concerned about what Trump might do with regard to Ukraine, but also with regard to all of America's alliances abroad.So, Trump doesn't necessarily take kindly to people who he views as trying to lecture him or tell him what he doesn't know about the processes of government. But, if he is able to have a cordial conversation with Joe Biden, I'm sure that that's the message that Biden is going to try to get across to him.

But, that doesn't mean it has any long term or even medium term, and maybe not even short-term effect on him. We all know him. He has s been out there since 2015 in a very public role as a candidate for President, and then through his term, and then he has been running ever since he left the first term.So, these things are nice, and I think the symbolism is important, and Joe Biden is doing everything he can to make that a smooth transition, but it takes two to tango, and I don't think Donald Trump will be tangoing for very long,",

When something doesn't go his way, how does he react? And we do have a lot of experience with how he tends to behave in that situation.That being said, when he won in 2016, he was very ill-prepared, and the people around him had -- did not have much of an organization. We're clearly seeing the way he is assembling his cabinet, even the way he is approaching these leadership elections that are happening right now on Capitol Hill, is much more organized, much more done with an understanding of the way the government actually works. Some of his picks for the cabinet have been somewhat disruptive. Others have been much more normal. There is still a lot to come in terms of the people that are going to be in n his administration. So, I think we're all going to be looking at those signs to see what they portend.

But, certainly, there was a very bitter period of competition between these two men, where they both flung insults at each other on the debate stage and out on the campaign trail. And for President Biden, of course, he has directly -- he is called Trump a direct threat to democracy. This meeting is playing out just a few feet away from that private dining room where Trump had watched the January 6 insurrection play out, something that President Biden has often criticized Trump for.But, for Biden's part, he wants to show that he is committed to this transition of power. He said in that statement that he hopes that there will be a smooth transition, Trump also saying that, and also making the point that politics can be tough at some point, and it certainly was a tough competition between Biden and Trump, as they campaigned against each other earlier in this election. Now, I also want to note, we just got word from our sources in the First Lady's office that First Lady Jill Biden actually greeted Donald Trump with her husband when he arrived at the White House, and the First Lady gave President-elect Trump a letter of congratulations for former and incoming First Lady Melania Trump. Her office saying in that letter that she expressed that her team remains committed to assist in any way that they can with a transition process for the First Lady as well. Of course, Melania Trump is not joining her husband on this trip to the White House, another sign of her unconventional role at times as First Lady. It's not expected that she would be moving to Washington, D.C., living in the White House full time, more likely splitting her time between other places such as Mar-a-Lago or potentially New York City as well. But, the First Lady, at least, is trying to make that overture to First Lady Melania Trump, saying that they're ready to help with any transition, along with what President Biden is doing here in this very Oval Office with his former competitor Donald Trump.",

There is no question. And part of what -- why he is here today, part of the things he is saying to them today is to emphasize, you hear him talking about his victory, his mandate, he is taking credit for the victories of all of these senators and representatives to underscore the message that he believes they owe him. He believes they should be grateful to him, and he believes that they should obey him as a result, and it's all going to be warm and fuzzy until there is actually legislation being discussed, and that's when it has the potential to get much more contentious, because, as Larry said, these margins are so narrow, pretty much anyone can throw a wrench into things.",

And Trump threw his support behind Johnson, which is huge, because the Speaker is trying to navigate a very divided conference, and he has some outspoken critics, critics so to have President-elect Trump throw support behind Johnson was a huge deal.

So, he is looking for an ally to lead the Senate Republicans, and of the three, he hasn't weighed in officially, but a lot of right-wing officials and personalities, including Elon Musk, support Rick Scott.

Trump sat down a few feet from the dining room where nearly four years ago he watched the January 6 riot unfold on TV.

Huckabee has left no doubt where he himself stands on key issues, wants to meet -- once meant to be resolved in an Israeli-Palestinian peace process.

Some of them were actually better. I mean, I would say Marco Rubio, Secretary of State, is an upgrade over Rex Tillerson. I would say that Mike Waltz as National Security Advisor is an upgrade over Mike Flynn. But, going from Jim Mattis as Trump's Secretary of Defense to Pete Hegseth, that's not an upgrade. That's a massive down shift. I mean, Pete Hegseth is basically a Fox News personality, and I respect his military service, but he was a relatively junior officer. And in recent years, he has been kind of waging rhetorical on the military. During Trump's first term, he convinced Trump to go easy on three military members who are accused of war crimes. Just last week, Pete Hegseth said that General CQ Brown, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, should be fired. If you would actually become Defense Secretary and begin by firing the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs for no apparent reason other than perhaps some kind of political Vendetta, I think that would send a very destabilizing and very dangerous signal to the U.S. military. It would risk politicizing the armed forces.",

And now, you're -- Trump is going to send to Israel an ambassador who is very much pro-settler. And so, the forces are lining up potentially for Israel to annex the West Bank, which I think would be a disaster and would greatly set back Israel's relations with the Arab world, and would also compromise the democratic character of the State of Israel, because basically Israel would be annexing millions of Palestinians who would not have political rights within Israel.I think that's a very dangerous situation for Israel's long-term security and its future as a democracy. But, keep in mind, Huckabee is only going to be the ambassador. I mean -- and that's not a decision- making function. The decision is really going to be made in Washington. And so, I hope that Mike Waltz, the new National Security Advisor, will give trump the benefit of his expertise and knowledge, to make clear why this would be such a dangerous move to allow Israel to annex the West Bank.",

He served on the Intelligence Committee. He served on the Foreign Relations Committee. He has a real passion for democracy and for standing up to hostile regimes.I was -- many moons ago in a previous incarnation, I was even a foreign policy advisor to Senator Rubio's 2016 campaign, and I've been dismayed to see since then the extent to which he has kind of trimmed his sales to win favor with Trump by, for example, opposing aid to Ukraine. I think that is a concern. But, I think on the whole, he is still somebody who is very much committed to an internationalist vision of American foreign policy, to American leadership in the world. And he is not an isolationist, which is why you saw some of the extreme MAGA circles greeting his nomination with consternation and concern. And I think Rubio is somebody who, I think is, is, is probably the best possible choice you can get out of a President Trump for such a senior position.",

Of course, we will bring that to you just as soon as it happens. You can see our Manu Raju there standing by. But, also happening now, President Joe Biden has been meeting with President- elect Donald Trump at the White House. And moments ago, they shook hands as they sat in front of the fireplace. It was the first time that they had been in the same room since the CNN debate in June. Mr. Biden told Trump that his administration would do everything it could to ensure a smooth transition, a courtesy that Trump did not give to Biden four years ago as he fought the results of the 2020 election.And this comes amid fresh announcements about who will lead key roles and posts in the new Trump administration. The President-elect has announced that Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy will lead what he called a new Department of Government Efficiency, but there are questions about how it will operate and how it will be funded. Ramaswamy is an entrepreneur who ran against Trump for the Republican nomination before then dropping out and endorsing Trump. Trump says that the department will dismantle bureaucracy and restructure federal agencies. The choice of tech billionaire Musk, though, raising potential questions and issues of conflict of interest. Let's bring in CNN's Alayna Treene again in Washington. So, Alayna, talk to us about Elon Musk saying that this will send shock waves through the system. What do we know about what the role and the department really entails?",

Then, this is something, of course, just remind you that Donald Trump had said that he wanted to do on the campaign trail months ago, shortly after Elon Musk had first endorsed Donald Trump and started to become more of a high-profile surrogate.Remember, he had hosted Donald Trump on an X spaces, and that was when Musk himself was the one to bring up to Donald Trump that he thought that if he were elected, he should create some sort of government efficiency program aimed at tackling waste. Donald Trump told him he loved the idea, and then continued talking about it for the remainder of his time on the campaign trail. But now, obviously, now that he is President-elect and he has the power to do this, he is making it official, and so he is going to be naming Elon Musk and his former Republican primary challenger Vivek Ramaswamy to kind of oversee this. Now, again, it is unclear exactly what this department is going to be doing. One thing that Donald Trump did say in this announcement, he said, quote, \"that it would provide advice and guidance from outside of government\", and that's really key here, that it's not going to be essentially within the executive branch or operating directly under Donald Trump. I know that in conversations in the past about what kind of role Elon Musk could take in a Trump administration, there were concerns about Musk not wanting to divest from his businesses and his different investment accounts and whatnot. And so, I think this is kind of solving for some of that. But, we do have some sound of both Ramaswamy as well as Musk talking about some of this. I want you to take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
