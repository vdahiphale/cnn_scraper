But she was also humble and modest, and she knew that this was going to not be easy, but she took it with her usual cowgirl, a plum. And immediately convinced her brothers -- her new brothers on the court -- that even though she'd been just a state Court of Appeals judge, she knew what she was talking about.

And yet, as you say, only when -- and she didn't get a job, they asked her, how well -- how well can you type? That was the question for a legal secretary job.You know the thing about her is she was never. She just said, OK, and went down the street to the DA's office and said I'll work for you. The guy said I have no money. She said. I'll do it for free. He said I have no space. She said I'll work off of your secretary's desk. She did. And she worked her way up to the public sector, finally getting in state Court of Appeals job, but serving the Arizona legislature along the way. The job learning a lot.

It was a difficult question for her.

She was a balancer. And she sometimes came out with liberal results, and she sometimes came out with conservative results. She thought the law ought to move slowly and pay close attention to where the country was on issues like abortion and affirmative action.So, she was not predictable.

And as a large publisher, they put out a wide range of books, from a wide range of authors, with diverse backgrounds, thoughts, and ideas, they say that's what democracy is all about. And that the government shouldn't be deciding what's appropriate for students to read. That should be in the hands of teachers and librarians.Now Ohio's Republican governor, she's responding to this lawsuit, and she says, and I'm quoting. Protecting children from pornography and sexually explicit content should not be controversial. But Penguin Random House might say that that statement is a bit disingenuous. They point out in their lawsuit that a lot of books that they have published has already, as a result of this law, been removed from schools or targeted for removal. And when you look at the list of the books that they lay out here, these are books that have been on, like bestseller lists, \"New York Times\" since bestseller. Some even winning the Pulitzer Prize. And so, we have some of them there on the screen. Books like \"Beloved,\" \"The Bluest Eye\" by Toni Morrison, The \"Handmaid's Tale\" by Margaret Atwood.
