Of course, for the loser's elimination and for England fans, I'm sure it will be. Yes, you guessed it gratification and you know I'm biased so we'll move swiftly on. Unfortunately, it's red cards. However, for markets U.S. stock market futures giving up gains after more inflation that frustration just released numbers showing prices at the factory gate. The so called producer price index rising by a greater than expected at 7.4 percent year over year that rate hotter than expected too and the month over month readings as well. It's the first in fact of two major inflation indicators ahead of the U.S. Central Bank meeting next week and as you would expect, the market reaction is negative. Wall Street now futures firmly lower Europe also mostly well it's a mixed bag as you can see there there's extra DAX in fact managing to hold half a percentage points higher. We'll discuss the market outlook however, with famed Investor Mark Mobius, known for his winning trades in emerging markets in particular, and more recently, some bold calls on Bitcoin crypto enthusiasts take cover. Mobius sees a further 40 percent crash that could take Bitcoin down to $10,000 a coin from where are we now, $17,000 per Bitcoin levels as we speak. In the meantime, Asia finishing out the week in the green new numbers from China show a further easing of consumer prices over there particularly for food and the HANG SENG up for a second straight day buoyed by China's moves to ease COVID restrictions. COVID cases, however, asked her on the rise across China as one would expect just one of a number of huge health care challenges worldwide, which we'll be discussing. And a brand new push to battle AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria and other diseases with Chelsea Clinton, the Vice Chair of the Clinton Foundation and the Clinton Health initiative that's coming up on the show. But first, we do start with an emotional homecoming for basketball star Brittney Griner now back on U.S. soil after a 10-month ordeal in Russia. Griner landed in San Antonio, Texas just a few hours ago. A U.S. official told CNN, she was in good spirits and \"Incredibly Gracious\". Griner had just begun serving a nine-year prison sentence in a Russian Penal colony on a drug smuggling conviction. She was freed in a swap with the Russian Viktor Bout, a convicted arms dealer who had been imprisoned in the United States, the two of them passing. As you can see they're on the airport tarmac in Abu Dhabi on Thursday. Rosa Flores joins us now from San Antonio. And, Rosa, I know you were there for when she stepped onto the tarmac in the United States. Her first three steps felt a little anti-climatic to me. I've watched the video number of times, but one can only imagine what she felt at that moment?",

There was no big public spectacle welcoming Brittney Griner to the United States. It really was very simple. All that we witnessed happened here was the plane landed here at Kelly Field in San Antonio, Texas. And the plane stopped by a hangar and a few officials boarded the plane and then after a few minutes, literally a few minutes they de planed and then Brittney Griner left the plane, got off the plane and she walked into a hangar. And that's all that we were able to observe here from the public spaces where all of the media was and that was it. But those were her first steps as a free American in the United States.

They do say that she is going to a medical facility to get a medical evaluation. And as you know, just a few months ago, Trevor Reed went through this very same experience. He actually landed here at Kelly Field in San Antonio, Texas, and he was offered the opportunity for a program by the DOD that helps not just military people, but also civilians reintegrate into society after an isolation event in this case being detained in a foreign prison. And Trevor Reed's family telling CNN that they recommend for Brittney Griner to do this and for the process to be at her pace because of course, this is different for everybody and of course it's different for Trevor Reed. It's going to be different for Brittney Griner. But the point here is that there is care that is here in the United States the U.S. welcoming Brittney Griner with open arms and resources.

Thanks to one Chinese artist in Italy in particular, and our Selina Wang got to speak to him. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SELINA WANG, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice over): Video after video of historic anti-zero COVID protests in China. Broadcast on the world's television screens everywhere inside China, where authorities censored all evidence of the protests. So how did these images managed to get beyond China's controlled internet? Newsrooms around the world, including CNN have been relying on information from this Twitter account. And there's only one man behind it? Li, a Chinese painter in Italy, whose identity we're hiding for security reasons. MR. LI, OWNER OF TWITTER ACCOUNT @ WHYYOUTOUZHELE: This account may become a symbol of the Chinese people are still pursuing freedom of speech. When you post something within China will quickly disappear. This account can document all these historical events that cannot be saved inside the country. WANG (voice over): His account quickly turned into one of the world's key sources for protest information. Li says he received thousands of submissions per day as the demonstrations unfolded. Apps like Twitter, YouTube and Instagram are banned in China. But people used virtual private networks or VPNs, which are prohibited in China to access Twitter and send their videos to leave.

That's a sigh of relief when we were you know, having 8 percent in October. However, economists were expecting the drop to be even steeper, the estimates were for a 7.2 percent increase year over year. So slightly higher than that and I think the reason why futures then turned around. We were looking at higher open now slightly lower is because again, it's going to raise questions about what the Fed does next week. Everyone's hoping for the pivot just a half point rate increase, instead of a fifth straight three quarters of a percentage point increase. Odds are still in favor of just a 50 basis point hike next week. But is Jerome Powell going to sound more hawkish again on the Commedia call that I think is going to be something that a lot of Investors are going to be looking very closely at.

But were an exporter, people who do exports, time, Turkish Lira, and their income is in dollars. But generally speaking, I think we can expect the Fed to have higher interest rates if the CPI continues to be at this level, because their playbook says, look, if you want to kill inflation, you going to have interest rates higher than the CPI. CPI now is what 7 percent that means you going to have 8 percent interest rates. So I think people are not looking at the real situation and taking it seriously.",

What you're saying is if they're earning in foreign currency, but they're buying products.

So I think we've had a run, usually markets run ahead of what is expected coming in the next six months. So I think a lot of these emerging market currencies - stabilize, and in fact, some of them have actually got stronger. But that is the key point going forward, is what's going to happen in the crypto world. There's a lot of central banks, in fact, probably all have underestimated the impact of crypto currencies on the lower income people around the world. A lot of people have been putting money into these crypto funds and crypto exchanges, because they've been promised 5 percent interest or even higher. Now, of course, some of these companies are going bust so they can't pay back the money was the 5 percent is out the window.

In the short term, I think a lot of people couldn't see even from the basis of the chip making progress that Taiwan has and other things going on in the country that that make it an investment opportunity at this moment.

And suddenly, all the assets that you have in China are out the window. They're going to be locked up; you won't have access to them. So that's one thing that worries me. So we decided Taiwan is the place to be, for a number of reasons. It's a great country, great entrepreneurial people, you have the best of the Chinese there, in the sense that it's an open society. They're very creative and then of course, the leader in the tech field, particularly in microchips. So what we've been doing is saying, OK, let's be careful and invest in those companies that are doing the software for chips, because it's really a people business and these people can be flown out and flown to California or anywhere else in the world if something happens.

I have to say the majority of the fans here in the suit this evening; they are supporting Argentina with the messy name proudly emblazoned on their backs. Before that one though, we are gearing up for Brazil against Croatia of Brazilian size who have been supreme in their last couple of games.

Neymar of course knows that one more goal will see him tie that 77 record goals for Brazil of the three time World Cup winner Pele all the thoughts with him still in hospital in Brazil.

Since its launch, the Global Fund has invested more than $55 billion and saving 50 million lives in the process and cut the combined death rate from the three diseases by more than half. The organization also works with a number of crucial partners, including the Clinton Health Access Initiative, which has helped scale and raise awareness of health inequity in some of the poorest nations of the world. The two organizations together have also been integral players in lowering the cost to treat diseases like HIV. For example, at the beginning of this century, treating HIV cost over $10,000 per person per year. Today, treatment costs just under $50. Last month, a global fund of partners announced it raised an astonishing $15.7 billion and its latest round of funding for the work to come over the next three years. Here to discuss is Chelsea Clinton, Vice Chair of the Clinton Foundation and the Clinton Health Access Initiative. And Peter Sands, the Executive Director of the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria. Chelsea, Peter, fantastic to have you on the show. And I think all I can say at this moment to begin is Wow, actually, what an incredible outcome and impact. And I think both you and your organization's are trailblazers for what can be done to tackle these huge healthcare challenges. Peter, I want to begin with you. It's clearly not the easiest time to be raising money. But you did it. Just frame the challenge for us and who rose to meet it?",

      "sentences": "Well, this was Julia rollercoaster year for, a difficult year for raising this kind of scale ofmoney. But I actually think it's testimony to how much there for all the different pressures, there still is a spirit of global solidarity of people willing to step up to save the lives, protect the communities, some of the poorest and most marginalized communities in the world. This year, we raised $15.7 billion, as you said and we saw a number of countries really, really step up. So the United States took the lead both in hosting the replenishment, but in increasing its pledge by 30 percent. But so too, did Canada, Japan, European Commission, Germany, Korea increased by 300 percent. So we had a range of major donors really increase their contributions. And it wasn't just governments, we also saw increased contributions from our private sector supporters.",

So it must bean incredible feeling, I think to be to be working with them and achieving what you are now for health inequality. But it's also about continuing the work that your father began after he left the White House and recognize that, at least in his part, he didn't feel like you've done enough and more needs to be done for things like HIV. Just explain that and the work that you've been doing on this too.",

      "sentences": "And so more than 20 years ago, the Clinton Foundation started the Clinton Health Access Initiative to focus on trying to change the marketdynamics that you talked about in your introduction to shift what had been a high price, low volume dynamic in the market for anti-retroviral to help treat HIV, to shift it to a high volume, low price dynamic, he believed it could be done and kind of by 2004. So within just a couple of years, kind of the launch of both the Global Fund and the Clinton Foundation's HIV program that had really started to happen. And so the price drops were pretty substantial and were substantial, not just kind of in one, one medicine, but in almost two dozen to help treat adults and children and adults who had co-infections. And that really set the kind of parameters and the kind of protocols for how we've been thought about our work over the next 20 years to try to bring together similar to what Peter does at the Global Fund kind of different partners, from government from the not for profit sector, from the private sector, who have a shared kind of purpose and a big ambition to help save and protect lives. And so now we've helped negotiate well north of 100 different agreements on everything from pediatric HIV medicines to kind of hepatitis, tuberculosis, malaria, for maternal and child health, child nutrition, and so much more.",

I think at the core of in many ways of what you're both saying is that you found a way to be incrediblyefficient about pulling the private sector together, the public sector together working on these partnerships. And ultimately getting the money, the research the information, the intellectual property where it needs to go in order to make dramatic change over the shortest period of time. And Peter just explain to me if you can give me an example of how this money is utilized? And I'm sure as well, particularly in this day and age, the process that goes through vetting that, but also vetting where the money comes from to, because I know for, for all donors out there and from anybody who gives money on a small or a large scale, ensuring that the money goes where it's intended is also vital for, for that decision to hand it over.",

And yet, forall the focus that we've placed on COVID, quite rightly, over the past couple of years, but we have to keep these other diseases, front and center of our conversations and understand that the work needs to continue and the money needs to be raised. Chelsea, I have around 90 seconds left. I want to give you the final word for, for what the plan is, as you've said, enormous change over the last 20 years enormous progress, but much more work does need to be done. What are you going to be doing over the next three years?",

      "sentences": "You know, well, I think it's so important to recognize that COVID also wasn't the only story of the last few years when you think about --.As Peter was talking about tuberculosis, I also was thinking about the fact that we did lose ground painfully lost ground against HIV and AIDS over the last few years as people weren't able to have access to early detection to early treatment to prevention to keep themselves and their families safe. And so the story to me is that we know progress is possible, we also can never stop kind of fighting HIV AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria, some diseases that have been around for decades, some that have been around for, you know, hundreds of thousands, even millions of years because that's an all of our interest. It's in not only the interest of everyone that Peter was just speaking about who he had seen, you know, in Malawi, but we know certainly from the last few years that our health is all interconnected. And so we have to, in my mind, recommit kind of more ferociously than ever to help kind of protect, protect people from these infectious diseases, anywhere and everywhere with disproportionate focus on the most vulnerable and the most marginalized. That's, that's morally the right thing to do. But it's also kind of not only for solidarity, but really to help protect our shared global public health. And so we're going to just keep doing all that we have done to continue to focus on HIV and AIDS will also be responsive to new challenges, including COVID. And whatever else may inevitably come next.",
