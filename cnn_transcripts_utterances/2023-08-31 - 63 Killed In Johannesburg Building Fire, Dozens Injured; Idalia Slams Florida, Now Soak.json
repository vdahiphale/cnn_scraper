Water levels are Charleston Harbor in South Carolina rising to near record levels. Residents are being asked to stay inside and avoid downed power lines. Video from Goose Creek South Carolina shows a weak tornado tossing a car around like a toy. Only minor injuries there though. But there are reports of one death each in Georgia and Florida.

Russia is getting a reminder that the war in Ukraine is too close for comfort even in areas far from the border. Officials say air defenses shot down a drone headed towards Moscow Thursday morning which came on the heels of the biggest wave of drone attacks Russia has seen since the war began. Six Russian regions came under attack Tuesday night and Wednesday morning, but across the border. Ukrainian officials say Kyiv also came under attack the most powerful assault in months. But Ukraine says it shot down dozens of drones and missiles near Kyiv and across the country. And for more, CNN Investigative Reporter Katie Polglase joins us now live from London. Good to see you, Katie. So, what more are you learning about what appears to be the biggest drone assault on Russian territory since Moscow launched its war on Ukraine?",

      "sentences": "While Rosemarie it's clear that drone and drone warfare is an increasing part of this war both, as you say in the Russian side and also, on the Ukrainian side. We saw another reported attack on Moscow this morning. According to the Moscow mayor, Sergei Sobyanin, that was intercepted, there's no reported damage or casualties yet.And this as you say comes in a week of intense drone assaults on the Russian territories. This is the biggest since the war began. And it covers a wide range of regions from Skov in the north, far beyond Moscow, far away from the Ukrainian frontline. That targeted an airport. Apparently, it seemed to target military and civilian aircrafts or at the aircraft but for were damaged, four military aircrafts. Also, it targeted a region in Bryansk. That is bordering with Ukraine. There they seem to be targeting a T.V. tower according to the Bryansk governor there. And this is really showing the way the war is moving here because it's notable that these drones if they are coming from Ukraine and Ukraine has not claimed credit for these attacks yet, notably, but they are widely suspected to be behind them. If they are using these drones. It may be that these are Ukrainian- made drones because under agreements with their Western allies, Ukraine cannot use drones inside Russian territory. And so, if they are using them, this can show the capability, the manufacturing capability developing at home in Ukraine. And the tactic here is clear. With that although they have not said they are behind it. It is clear the tactic is to bring the war home to Russia. And we heard yesterday from Ukraine's special adviser to the president Volodymyr Zelenskyy. The advising has positively said that it's clear from these drone attacks that the war is moving to Russia's territory and it cannot be stopped. That is the intention here to make the war be felt at home here by the Russian people as it is being felt clearly by the Ukrainian people. Because at the same time that these drone attacks were happening, there were also drone attacks, other missile attacks, other forms of aerial bombardment across Ukraine, in particular on Kyiv. So some of the most intense shelling of missile attacks and drones Tuesday into Wednesday night with two dead as a result. So, it shows that this drone attack, these types of drone attacks will only continue. Rosemary?",

And what it means is that as this war began, 18 months ago, 18 long months ago, now, boys and girls had to learn what an air raid siren meant, and that men get out of your bed and get to a basement. Now they're learning about these merciless things underground called landmines. Meanwhile, Rosemary, as you said, they're learning in maths and in languages, that is -- that is declining.

And they'll talk to them about any leads their child may have. Any issues maybe from breastfeeding or it may be again, the mental health struggles they're going with or that they're on the move or that they can't get to a clinic. So UNICEF now has these nurses ensuring that they get to the frontlines, they get to where families need them. And I think that's one of the things that UNICEF has done so frequently. Whether it's rebuilding water points or mental health or education in a classroom or in a bunker. It's trying to adapt, knowing that this war still is ongoing, still is coming to real civilian areas. It's trying to adapt to that and to get some semblance of reality for boys and girls because it's the reality that -- of war that they just keep enduring.",

And boys and girls are, you know, naturally adventurous.So those places they go to a river, as you rightly say, or an abandoned building, these places can become lethal. So again, UNICEF has trained thousands of teachers, mine-risk education for boys and girls for -- two and three, four-year-olds and little fun interactions to teenagers is now mandatory in Ukraine. It's become one of the most mined countries on the planet. And again, this is what we struggle with because, you know, these boys and girls are going to be an economic powerhouse for Ukraine. That is, you know, skills and education really are that they're a bridge, not just to dreams but for prosperity, Rosemary for communities.

While that problem has somewhat abated this year, the report says the future of global food prices depends on the Black Sea initiative which enabled Ukraine to export its grain.Russia ended that deal as we mentioned in July.

MCKENZIE (voiceover): Gabon, the latest in a cascade of coups on the African continent, if solidified, it will be the eighth in central and West Africa since just 2020. Most of them former French colonies, but each of them a different cocktail of power plays and discontent. In Gabon, the citizens have lived under a dynastic regime for more than 50 years. Omar Bongo ruled for more than four decades, much of that time spent in France, a critical ally. The elder Bongo, members of his family and confidants were accused of eyewatering corruption. Often linked to OPEC member Gabon's significant oil wealth. Ali Bongo took over from his father in 2009. He has been praised for conserving Gabon's vast forests and taking innovative steps to develop carbon credits to combat climate change. But he's faced growing discontent from many, with violence breaking out after disputed polls in 2016 and an attempted coup three years later. But these scenes have wider consequences. Many fear that Gabon is not the last domino to fall, African Union and international actors have failed to effectively counter recent military takeovers and Bongo's fate in house arrest remains tenuous.",
