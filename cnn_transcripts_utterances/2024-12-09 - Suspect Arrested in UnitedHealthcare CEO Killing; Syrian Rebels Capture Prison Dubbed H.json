I am Rahel Solomon in today for Richard Quest, and this is QUEST MEANS BUSINESS. Good evening. We want to begin with some breaking news this hour. The suspect in the killing of UnitedHealthcare CEO, Brian Thompson is now in custody. Police arrested 26-year-old Luigi Mangione in a McDonald's in Altoona, Pennsylvania on a gun charge. His capture came after an employee recognized him from police images. Now according to officials, Mangione had multiple fake IDs and an untraceable ghost gun on him. NYPD Commissioner Jessica Tisch spoke earlier and gave more details on how police went about the days' long manhunt. Listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And this could be the very person, in fact, I believe it probably is that committed this horrendous crime. So yes, it is just good. Now they recovered a lot of evidence. They got a gun, they got a suppressor, they have some document with some writings that really show some displeasure toward corporate America, insurance industry in particular. And of course, at the crime scene, they gathered an awful lot of forensic evidence. They got DNA, they got fingerprints, they got a lot of evidence that now they can match against the suspect who is in custody.

The ousted prime minister met with Abu Mohammad al-Jolani, that's the leader of the main rebel group, HTS. The rebels say that the meeting was to coordinate the transfer of power. Now, HTS does not have full control of Syria, it split between multiple groups with different interests and we don't know what Syria's next government will look like. Foreign powers, meanwhile, are conducting military operations inside Syria. Israel says that it struck chemical weapons sites, while the US says that it bombed dozens of ISIS targets. Meanwhile, the rebels have captured a prison that Amnesty International dubs a human slaughterhouse. CNN's Clarissa Ward reports on the desperate search for those trapped inside. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) CLARISSA WARD, CNN CHIEF INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice over): The stream of families never stops, climbing towards Syria's most notorious Saydnaya Prison pushed on by reports that thousands of people imprisoned by the regime of Bashar al-Assad are still trapped alive in a section underground.

No one is certain where this Red Section is, or if it even exists. Inside the prison, family members are searching, too. WARD (on camera): You can see people everywhere just combing through all the papers and records they can find, looking for names, seeing if maybe their loved ones are there. WARD (voice over): Tens of thousands of Syrians were forcibly disappeared in Saydnaya, lost in the abyss of a prison that was known as a slaughterhouse, industrial scale, arbitrary detention and torture, all to keep one man in power. WARD (on camera): They call this the white area of the prison because they say the conditions here are much better than in other areas, but you can see its still miserable. WARD (voice over): In the center of the prison, another frantic rush. Someone thinks they have found a tunnel. They desperately try to get a look inside.

Those are the things that the US is watching to see, and of course, one of the major aspects of this is what happens to those weapons caches that Syria's Bashar al-Assad left behind, the chemical weapons stockpiles. Do the rebels take those and start to use them in very dangerous ways, or are there going to be efforts to destroy those weapons stockpiles and hopefully transition Syria into a more peaceful future? That is something the US is obviously concerned about and watching. But as of right now you know, they're not overly concerned by what they have seen. They are optimistic for the most part. But again, how this plays out is going to be very closely watched. And the biggest question as well is what happens to the US forces that are in Syria? As of right now, it does not appear that they're going to be pulled out because the US wants them to continue that anti-ISIS mission, wants to caution these terrorist groups against even thinking about trying to reconstitute in a major way.

The Russians also saying that it was Vladimir Putin himself who signed on Bashar al-Assad and members of his family being able to come here and being granted asylum inside Russia as the Russians say, for humanitarian reasons. Now, of course, for the Russians, all of this could have very big repercussions. At the same time, the Russians do understand that there is a new reality on the ground in Syria. As of this morning, the flag of the Syrian opposition flies above the embassy here in Moscow and we asked here at the embassy and folks here told us that the embassy is actually working as normally, even though the transition in Syria is already very much taking place. For the Russians, however, they were one of the biggest backers of the Assad regime and of course, still have major military assets inside Syria as well. They have an air base in Khmeimim close to Latakia, which is very important for them, not just for air operations in Syria, but also to project power into the Mediterranean and even all the way into Africa, and of course, they have a major naval base in Tartus and just last week conducted a big naval exercises, firing some high powered missiles from ships inside the Mediterranean Sea. The Russians admitting that for them, it is unclear what the future of those military bases will be. [16:20:09 ] They say a lot of that depends on who will have power in Syria in the future.

He was taken into custody at a McDonald's restaurant in Altoona, Pennsylvania, which is roughly four hours away from New York City. Law enforcement officials say that a McDonald's worker recognized him from pictures like these. Now police found multiple fake IDs on the suspect, and CNN obtained the image of one of them. So you can see in this picture what appears to be a New Jersey driver's license and it does appear to have Mangione's picture on it, but the name printed is Mark Rosario. Police also found a firearm when they searched the suspect. We have obtained this photo of it. Now during a press conference, the NYPD said that the gun was a ghost gun that had the capability of firing a nine- millimeter round, and it may have been 3D printed.

Like you said, we're now tuna Pennsylvania at this McDonald's where Luigi Mangione was apprehended earlier this morning. This is a pretty rural part of Pennsylvania, which you know, well, I know we're in between, really western and central Pennsylvania, in between Pittsburgh and Harrisburg. As of this moment, we don't know of any connection that Mangione would have had to this specific area, or really, to Pennsylvania, despite he went to college here a couple of years back. But nevertheless, again, this is McDonald's where he was apprehended earlier this morning. So, we learned from the Altoona Police Department that around 9:14 this morning, they got a phone call from an employee here at this McDonald's that someone inside of the restaurant matched the description of the United Healthcare CEO murder suspect. At that point, Altoona police, they arrived here on the scene, and they found Mangione who was just sitting here and eating. That was according to the New York Police Department. They spoke with him at the restaurant here. They ultimately apprehended him on unrelated charges, but ultimately, they found in his bag around his person a ghost gun, a suppressor or a silencers, like you noted, Rahel, because you just showed the picture of that gun. They also found a number of fake I.D.'s, and of course, this manifesto that we've heard from so much about from CNN John Miller and others as well. Now importantly, Rahel, like I said, he was arrested here on other unrelated gun charges, not for the ultimate murder yet, of Brian Thompson, UnitedHealthcare CEO. And that's important, because right now he's being held by Altoona police and New York Police Department detectives have actually just in the past hour or so arrived here on the ground in Pennsylvania. They're going to then take a shot at interviewing him, crossing their T's and dotting their I's before they hope that New York officials, the New York D.A.'s office comes with a -- an arrest warrant and a process then can begin to potentially extradite this suspect from Pennsylvania to New York. But again, we still have a number of questions. Like I said, why, predominantly, was he ultimately here in Altoona. And also, and this has been spoken about a lot over the past couple of hours, why when he was caught here, five hours away from New York City, did he still have so much evidence on his person for police to find? Is it because he was not anticipating being caught or maybe he was anticipating being caught whether here or somewhere else down the line? So that's the latest here. Again, an incredible story, all resulting in the end of this manhunt. Thanks to a McDonald's employee who made a phone call right behind me. Rahel?",

Then there were also divers as early as the past 48 hours in Central Park looking for other evidence items in there. We heard from the NYPD in a press conference earlier that there were federal, state, local law enforcement partners all out there searching for this suspect.

So, the next days -- the next three or four days from the -- from now, we are talking about the civilian society organization and NGOs and everybody can help us to push or to provide the people with the services. But after that, we can manage with everything with the -- with many of resources, like the gas, like the airport resources we have at Syria. We have many, many places we can take or generate resources from it. Like also, we have more than six million person in -- out of Syria, and they are sending money now for the people. We are talking about a big or huge amount of dollars and Euro every month for it. So, it will be good for the people but for the government will be -- in the authority, in the next month, maybe it will be very difficult mission for making a revenue. We are without any balance for the next year. We don't have any budget also for the next year. And as you know, the only -- the main, the main resources for the Syrian economy is not with the authority of the Damascus now. It's out of them, so it will be a very bad situation.",

Nvidia shares close lower, more than two percent, about 2.5 percent or trade shares trading at 138 a share. On the news, China's state-run media says that investigators are looking into Nvidia's purchase of an Israeli networking company. Report did not specify how the merger might violate Chinese law. Let's bring in Clare Duffy who is in New York. So, Clare, how significant is this for Nvidia?",

We've seen the Biden administration and the Chinese government, as you said, tradethese sort of tit for tat actions in this escalating trade war. Just last week, the Biden administration implemented its third restrictions on these chip sales related to these high-tech memory chips. The U.S. government is concerned that China could use advanced A.I. to get ahead militarily. So, it's trying to get ahead of that and the Chinese government is fighting back again. Last week, we saw the Chinese government restricting some sales of chip making materials to the U.S. at a time when we know the U.S. is trying to boost chip manufacturing. So, it makes sense that China would go after Nvidia. This is kind of the Golden Child of the U.S. tech industry at this point. And we'll see how this progresses, if it escalates. But China also needs Nvidia. Like the rest of the world, Nvidia is so far ahead of competitors. While it can't sell its most advanced A.I. chips to China, it does sell an approved version, and you have to imagine that China isn't going to want to lose that opportunity to continue to buy this technology.",
