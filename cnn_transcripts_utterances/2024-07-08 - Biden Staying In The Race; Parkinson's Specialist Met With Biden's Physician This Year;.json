A lot of Democrats would have liked to see thatkind of proud, combative, even obdurate performance from the president that he offered on the MSNBC show this morning. A week ago, the White House essentially just sat there and did very little as this crisis crested over the last week. There are more cracks appearing in the president's support on Capitol Hill, to have someone like Adam Smith, a senior Democrat, come out four months before an election and say he doesn't think the person that's going to be the Democratic standard bearer who also happens to be the president should be in the race is extraordinary. I think the question now is, does this worry and anxiety about Biden's position reach a critical mass? The majority, for example, of people on the Hill want him to go. If it does, are there leaders of Democrats on the Hill who are willing to come to the White House and say, it's time for the president to step aside? But even if they do, on the evidence of today, Paula, it looks like the president has got absolutely no intention of going anywhere, and since he has the delegates through the primary process, they can't make him go.

If we see a bunch of swing state polls coming out in the next few days showing that Biden really gets beat very seriously by Former President Trump, that could create more opposition. I think what the White House and the campaign are probably hoping is to get through this week. Biden will be on the world stage, showing himself to be a statesman at the NATO Summit. Next week is the Republican National Convention. We're expecting to see Trump's vice-presidential pick unveiled soon as well. If the president can get to the end of this week, other stories might sort of muscle this out a little bit, and he may be able to survive. But it's very dicey, and it really is just extraordinary.

And what we're starting to see and we'll see throughout the course of this week is essentially a thickening of that NATO support in terms of the structuring of the support by these NATO countries. NATO itself, the alliance, will take on more of a leading role in terms of this -- the support for Ukraine. And that is part of the future proofing, the Trump proofing, if you will, of the NATO alliance if President Trump were to get elected and the U.S. were to essentially recede in its support for Ukraine. So, what we're going to see throughout the course of the week is a full- throated endorsement of NATO membership for Ukraine eventually, not now, that is not going to be offered. That is not on the table. In fact, we've just learned, however, that in the declaration coming out of this NATO Summit, NATO allies will almost certainly declare an irreversible path for NATO membership for Ukraine. But that is probably something that is not going to happen during this war. What is going to continue to happen during this war is more support, more financial support, more weapons support, more training support for Ukraine. And that is something that is going to be at the top -- the very top of the NATO agenda. Of course, they're going to be celebrating 75 years of the alliance. They're going to be celebrating the fact that Sweden -- sorry, excuse me, Finland and -- has just joined the alliance, along with Sweden. And -- sorry, sorry, Sweden has just joined the alliance as well. And so, it's the expansion of the alliance and it is going to be that those messages of unity. We're going to hear from President Zelenskyy tomorrow night when he gives a speech in which he will talk about the bridge to membership to joining NATO and the assurances that he gets from the alliance for their fight against Russia.

But the torrential rainfall, damaging winds, and dangerous flash flooding continues. In Texas, Louisiana, and Arkansas, where more than 3.5 million people in all are both under a tornado watch and a flood watch as the storm continues along its punishing path. (END VIDEOTAPE) VAN DAM (on camera): Now, Paula, you heard from the Houston mayor himself, he says the primary drainage mechanism for the City of Houston is its streets. Bad or good, regardless of whether or not it works. Well, what you're looking at behind me is urban sprawl. This is a large city, a lot of pavement, a lot of what we call impermeable surfaces. So, when it rains, the water has nowhere to go. And unfortunately, this is the result of that heavy rain coming too quickly and too fast. Paula.",

So, yes, still for today, this is the third landfall. Obviously, we had the Grenada landfall, Barbados got hit, then Kingston kind of got grazed, then all of a sudden, we had that really slam into the Yucatan Peninsula, just south of Cancun, and now back into the Gulf of Mexico, and then into the United States. So, that's a long, long track. Considering it came off the African Coast about 14 days ago. So, yes, it has been in the water for a long time. A couple things to think about tonight. There will be some tornadoes, especially in Louisiana into Arkansas. There will also be many people with generators running out there because 2.7 million customers are without power. Those generators create carbon monoxide. You have to watch out for that. Those roads are going to get dark, and you're not going to be able to see where the water is. And if you're driving around after dark or even before sunrise tomorrow, you may get yourself into trouble because it is still raining in many, many spots. Not over Houston proper, but on up toward the north, we still have flash flood warnings going on and also the tornado watch that Derek was talking about. Tornado warnings going on right now. We've had at least four on the ground today. And you can see them, they don't last long, just maybe five or 10 minutes. It doesn't take much of a tornado if it's in your town. And then, there's the flooding all the way from Shreveport all the way back down to the south. The highest wind today 156 kilometers per hour. Freeport, Texas, 97 miles per hour was the gust there. And then, Houston University, somewhere, almost 90 degrees there. 2.7 million customers, not people. You got to think that every customer is two or three people in a household. So, there are millions of people. And guess what? Guess what we have tomorrow? Every time a hurricane goes by, the day after is the hottest day you've ever experienced in your life. 2.7 million people without electricity, without a fan, without air conditioning, and it's going to feel like 105 degrees tomorrow. Not going to feel like it's going to feel in the west. Like, I understand that. Many, many heat records going on out west where temperatures are well above 100. Yesterday, it was 120 degrees in Las Vegas. 49 degrees Celsius, hottest it's ever been on any date, any year, any month ever, 120 degrees. The old record was 117. So, hot up north, hot in the northwest. Not supposed to be that hot up there. Most people don't have any type of air con there. And then, for Bakersfield, above 110 solidly for the next four days at least. The heat in the west is relentless. The heat in the morning is certainly as bad as well because temperatures aren't going down at night. Look at Phoenix tomorrow, 117 degrees out there. Paula.",

Even Tesla's much praisedsuperchargers take 20 minutes sometimes to complete, sometimes more than that. And those with a passion for petrol are keen to point out that pumping a full tank of gas takes, well, you know, two minutes. That includes paying for it. Now, a British startup called Nyobolt has Developed a new lithium-ion battery, which charged from 10 percent to 80 percent, think about that, in four and a half minutes. That was at a recent demonstration featuring its sports car prototype. Now, it was tested on a track using a 350-kilowatt ultra-rapid charger. The company says it's unlocked new battery technology, which is scalable, and that opens the doors to a wealth of new products and services. Sai Shivareddy is the CEO of Nyobolt, and he joins me now from Cambridge, England. I hope to discuss on innovation. We all need. You had us at five minutes. You're saying five minutes to charge potentially to 80 percent. You know, if that's true, to call this a game changer is actually underselling it. But if and only if it works.
