The current deal expired on Saturday night. CNN national correspondent Camila Bernal has been tracking the details.

What I'm hearing from one side when it comes to Kaiser is that they're optimistic that they're making progress, that they've come to agreements on some of the issues here and they've made some proposals to the coalition of unions.But on the side of the unions you have them saying we are not going to take those proposals. And they're saying they're not going to budge when it comes to the amount of money that they are asking for. They want raises across the board and they do want protections against outsourcings, among other things. But one of the things that I'm hearing over and over again from Union members, Boris, is that they really feel there's a shortage of workers and they need Kaiser to address this. They say, they're doing the jobs of 2-3 people and they're overwhelmed. They say they're exhausted both physically and mentally -- Boris.",

So no matter what, it's the patients that are losing. I spoke to one Union member who told me the consequences are so huge, even from just her job, that she is extremely concerned.

Suggesting that the population in the U.S. also right now the majority of people are skeptical of further aid to Ukraine.The Ukrainians also believe it doesn't necessarily reflect what's going on in the battlefield. They believe that right now they have the upper hand. In large part thanks to weapons from the United States, and they certainly believe that if the aid continues that they have a pretty good shot at pushing the Russians back Jessica.",

Some really consequential issues at that.So we do have an upcoming case that will be heard next month on gun rights. This is about a lower court that struck down a federal law that restricted whether people under domestic violence restraining orders, whether they could have guns. The federal law said they couldn't. The lower court actually struck that down, saying it was in violation of the Second Amendment. So that will be one to watch next month. Also, if states can force social media platforms to actually host content as opposed to being able to restrict it. So that will be a big case as well. We'll have a trio of cases as well about federal agencies and whether they can continue to wield significant power in making consequential decisions. This conservative court has actually had some backlash against federal agencies, so we'll see if they take it even a step farther. So there is a lot to come on this docket. And so far, you know, only a handful of cases are lined up for this term. So we're expecting even more cases that we don't yet know about to be added to the Supreme Court's term. And all of this, Jess, as we're seeing approval ratings at historic lows for the Supreme Court. The Gallup poll just did another poll just before the start of the Supreme Court term, and we're seeing that number continue to hover right about 41 percent of approval, a significant number of disapprovals, 58 percent. So this court faces a big uphill battle just in winning the public's approval at this point.",
