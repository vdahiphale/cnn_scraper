New reporting tonight about how the former president is coping after becoming the first president to face criminal charges and have his mugshot taken. And brought down by a bomb. That is one theory into what caused Prigozhin's plane to crash, according to U.S. intelligence. Who could have done it? Let's go OUTFRONT. Good evening. I'm Brianna Keilar, in for Erin Burnett. OUTFRONT tonight, blaming Trump. Yet another one of the 19 defendants in Georgia's election case now claims she was just following Trump's orders when she signed on to be a fake elector. And a new court filing, Kathie Latham's attorney writes, quote: Mrs. Latham was acting pursuant to the guidelines of the Constitution at the direction of the president of the United States. Latham's claim comes as Trump was trying to distance himself from some of his 18 codefendants. (BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)",

Though, as the world witnessed, Trump did surrender to authorities yesterday -- not long after his former chief of staff, Mark Meadows. And tonight, Meadows is gearing up for a major hearing. Monday, he is trying to move the case from Fulton County to a federal court. And it could have major implications for Trump and the case as a whole. I'll have much more on that on a moment.

She's asking for a rather large USB drives to provide, so that she can sheer this initial batch of discovery.And, look, she's already told the judge in this case that she would like to see it with the trial in October of this year. A date that many lawyers involved, and not involved, in this case think is unrealistic. Trump's team has already weighed in on this, saying they oppose that October date, although they have not offered an alternative. And most importantly, we still haven't heard yet from the judge in terms of what he thinks is a reasonable schedule for this case. In the meantime, though, you've got 19 defendants. It's a little bit like herding cats. You're starting to see everyone make moves that they believe are in their best interests and not necessarily together. So, today, we also saw Sidney Powell, who is one of those attorneys who was working with Donald Trump in the aftermath of the 2020 election say that she wants a speedy trial in the Fulton County superior court. Another one of these defendants, Ken Chesebro, had previously told the judge that and he had his court date set for October of 2023. The judge made clear, he was saying that for Chesebro, not everyone. We'll see what he does with the Sidney Powell request.",

Now, there are problems with Meadows' argument, including some emails that he wrote and the fact he wasn't a mere listener on the call to Raffensperger.

Sources telling CNN Donald Trump's team has had multiple conversations about how to navigate his 2024 campaign and his growing court schedule.Let's go right to Kristen Holmes, who broke this story. Kristen, what are you learning? KRISTEN HOLMES, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Well, I talk to a number of Trump advisers, and I will say that starting point, they don't believe that this is going to happen. That the trials are actually going to happen while he is campaigning. But as the trials mount, they have come to the realization that this is a possibility. And look at this calendar here. This is what we know right now. Again, this is subject to change, but if you look at the campaign schedule and the trial schedule, particularly, let's look at January, the 2nd we have this potential trouble for the 2022 election charges, the 15th, is the Iowa caucus, and the E. Jean Carroll civil trial. In March the 5th, you have Super Tuesday, as well as the 25th, the Stormy Daniels hush money trial. So, they're clearly aware that this is a possibility that he could be campaigning for president and be sitting in these trials. They point to a media strategy which is somewhat on the mind of all publicity is good publicity. Something we know that Donald Trump himself believes. And they look at the coverage at Thursday, they like the way that that went, particularly because it was a day after the debate, and it really took all of the oxygen out of the race. Everything was focused on him and his arrest. And they believe they can manipulate the media and spin the media that way, if he is having this kind of extensive coverage during a trial. Now, it remains to be seen whether or not, of, course that is true. But they say that Donald Trump is somebody who has the capability of doing so, looking at last night and his decision to post on X, formerly known as Twitter, taking a moment which he was already the center of attention and essentially building on that. His team had had multiple discussions about when he was going to post on Twitter for the first time since he was banned in 2021, and then reinstated. This was out of the blue. This was Trump himself deciding that he was going to take control of this media narrative. But I will tell you that even if this does happen, if they do believe they can capitalize on this with voters and try to take the oxygen out of the race, I've spoken to a number of Trump's allies and public operatives who worry this kind of extensive media coverage is actually just going to exhaust voters and turn them off. But, of course, Brianna, as you know, this is all unprecedented. This is completely new, so we're just going to have to watch it unfold to see how this really plays out, particularly with the election.",

So, Jonah, you just heard Kristen's reporting there. We saw Trump really wasted no time last night trying to capitalize off of his arrests.

And so, I think that -- while he's going to want to be out there, he's basically like the Energizer bunny. He can be on the go constantly, I witnessed it firsthand during my time at the White House.

So, if Kenneth Chesebro gets this September 23rd trial date, which is the current order of the court, then Trump as a legal matter does get to preview the entirety of the prosecutor's case against Kenneth Chesebro, and then his lawyers will be much better preparing themselves in the eventuality of when he's tried.And, of course, they also get to see all the witnesses, so they could figure out if there are any discrepancies between the witness statements in the Kenneth Chesebro trial versus his trial. So I think there's some -- of course, that trial would result in an acquittal, there would be very significant for him. If that trial were to result in a conviction, that would put him in significant jeopardy. And then, of course, the other question for him in any trial is jury nullification, whether or not the jurors, if they see guilt, would say no, not for him. Any one of them doing that would prevent a conviction. And you can imagine they might be more willing to nullify pre the presidential action then post the presidential election.",

I mean, look at the facts of the case in Georgia, for example. He's on audiotape telling the Georgia secretary of state to find him 11,780 votes, when there have been multiple recounts already. I mean, it's going to be really hard for him to prove that he wasn't trying to overturn the election.

You saw a lot more inexperienced fighters, convicts even, joining the rank and file of Wagner to help make progress here in Ukraine. But if you take those Wagner fighters who were very experienced fighters, the elite, they had a great deal of respect for Yevgeny Prigozhin. This was not just a founder of Wagner. He was very hands on. Whether it was from the battlefields of Syria to 2015, to more recently in so many of those African countries, where Wagner has become part and parcel, not just for the political landscape, but for the security landscape of so many countries. What many of his fighters saw was a man who was hands on, and they themselves found themselves at the heart of a group that had a deal of reputation for being a fine fighting machine. Now, of course, there is then what Yevgeny Prigozhin represented to those beyond his immediate fighters. And I think you're seeing a lot of that in the outpourings, Brianna, that you're seeing at those makeshift memorials that have popped up in St. Petersburg.

Putin has strong reason to want to send a signal to Russian elites that he was responsible for taking Prigozhin down. He wants to reestablish his authority, show them that he is in charge. But he also doesn't want to put himself in legal jeopardy, or put the Russian government in legal jeopardy. So I expect that the results of this investigation will either be inconclusive, or they will try to pin the blame for this on Ukraine and the United States.",

Ironically, I think a lot of the elites are going to welcome this action. They don't trust each other, these are people that fear some sort of return to a situation like the 1990s, when they were at war with each other and they lacked someone with a firm hand in the Kremlin that could protect them against each other. Now, Putin has said I'm in charge. He's shown that he will deal decisively with rebellion, and I think that will be a source of comfort within the Russian elites. As for the Russian people, I think they're going to want to know their stability and order in the country. I think a lot of them were shocked by this uprising, and I think the degree that Putin can show that stability is back, it will serve his cause with Russian people as well.",
