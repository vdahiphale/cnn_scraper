This is what's left behind: twisted metal, uprooted trees, power lines that have been down, and especially mobile home parks just ripped apart and sent out flying several hundreds of yards away. It's estimated that at the most, 200 homes have been destroyed. This tornado lasting on the ground for 11 minutes reaching peak winds of 140 miles and the length of this thing over six miles.

Jill, good to have you. These deployment of these tactical nuclear weapons to Belarus, Secretary Blinken says, that the USC has no evidence that or any indication that, the Russians intend to use them.

So, remember back in March, they began to talk about this, we will be putting tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus, then they said, but we have to build the shelters for them, the buildings for them, then that took another month. So, this is eking out, you know, slowly. The message is, of course, that the West, and NATO, and Ukraine should be very afraid that Russia will use nuclear weapons.And it's a tactic that, you know, is less, and less effective, I think, because the assessment by the United States really is that Putin does not want to start a nuclear war. That said, you can't eliminate the possibility that they might use tactical nuclear weapons. So, you know, looking at the speech by President Putin was actually a speech and then kind of a Q and A with a person and analysts. You really have to, I think, interpret him in the way he has to be interpreted, which is, in my opinion, he's kind of like the arsonists the, you know, pyromaniac, who starts a fire, and then puts out his own fire. So, he raises the ante saying, well, you know, we could use nuclear weapons, the big ones, if necessary to protect Russia, however, there is no need. So, this is all you know, he doesn't say anything just for the fun of it. I think this is definitely his message to frighten the West.",

And then, from the nuclear perspective, he's saying we've got these weapons, but we really don't need to use them. So, because, you know, we're not losing the war.So, I think again, yes, he's using it for a couple of different reasons. And don't forget that some of this is talking to his own people. You know, one phrase that he used in that Q and A with the, with the expert, was a pretty off-color Russian expression, which I guess I could use I.R., but it's basically, you know, screw them. And it was that strong, he used it. And that reminded me of back in the Chechen War, he used a pretty obscene description for what he was going to do to terrorists. That was very popular in the beginning of early Putin. So, when he uses these tough guy, phrases kind of off color, tough, he's also sending a message to his people that, \"I'm not going to be pushed around. I am in control.\" And don't forget, the war is not going the way he expected. And there is more criticism of how he's been conducting the war, domestically.",

But that is a threat, that he would attack a NATO country to destroy those planes. That's very serious, because that does start a war. So, again, he's pushing the envelope. He's hinting he's not; he's not precise in what he's saying. But it's another scare tactic. Don't try this, otherwise, I could come. And he used the phrase, the F16 can burn too, just like the tanks.
