I'm Jake Tapper in Washington, where the state of our union is getting ready for the main event, a momentous week in campaign politics in a presidential race that polling shows has held fairly stable now for months.Both President Biden and former President Trump will meet for a debate right here on CNN on June 27, the very first televised debate between a president and a former president ever. On Friday, that former president, Donald Trump, was on the trail in blue Minnesota trying to expand his electoral map. But, come Monday morning, he will be back in a New York courtroom, where closing arguments could begin as soon as this week in the only criminal trial that President Trump is likely to face before Election Day. Meanwhile, President Biden is confronting a stubborn polling deficit, often trailing his opponent in key battlegrounds. Biden spent the weekend trying to shore up support among a crucial group, young black voters, who are frustrated over the economy and other issues. In Georgia, where recent polling shows Biden has lost ground with black voters since 2020, Biden brushed off broader concerns that he is trailing Trump. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

When you have 150,000 people casting a protest vote in Pennsylvania suburbs against Donald Trump for Nikki Haley, those are the votes that Joe Biden should be targeting.

And I was ready to pack my stuff up when we were over and leave.

And you rarely learn real big lessons when you're an adult, but, that night, Alice taught me it wasn't about politics. I say that a lot on the show. It's about the people. And she was a good person.
