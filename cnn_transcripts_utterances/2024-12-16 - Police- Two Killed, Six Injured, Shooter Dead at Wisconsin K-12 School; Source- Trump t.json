First of all, there is a lot that our community can and will do in the coming days to support the victims and their families, and we will have more information at future briefings. If anyone and I would urge you all to include this in your stories, if anyone needs mental health support as a result of this incident and the coverage of it, I encourage them to reach out to 988 by phone or text, and to get the mental health support that they need. It is incredibly important that we take care of our community in this very difficult time. We all have a role in preventing gun violence. Our entire community needs to be part of the solution here. There are many things that we can do, and we can have those conversations in coming days. But first and foremost, what needs to be the priority for all of us is supporting our young people, and that is where our community's attention needs to turn at this point in time. The police department, the fire department, the city, the county will share additional information about the investigation as it becomes available.

And by new era, I mean this idea that big tech is now embracing Donald Trump, something that he said himself was very different than the last time he was in office. He said it might be because his personality changed, but I think that overall, there is a better understanding in Washington and around Washington of how to get in Donald Trump's ear, and Donald Trump himself has a better understanding of Washington, meaning that these companies like TikTok are looking at these lobbyists and people that are close to Donald Trump, and they understand that they need to work Donald Trump the same way they would work any other administration and that's not something that they really understood how to do the first time around.

Certainly, if we can take anything from the first time Trump waspresident, he was very supportive of the industry and the comments about removing unnecessary regulation, I think is very welcome, particularly given what we've seen in the later stages of the current administration, where I think there were very heavy handed in terms of additional regulation. And your question is very important because we need Europe to change as well. And I think Europe is beginning to recognize the need to address its competitiveness on a global scale rather than its fixation, if you like, on competition within the single market in Europe. So I am optimistic that 2025 will be a positive year for, you know, rolling back on some of the unnecessary regulations we've seen.",

Syria's deposed leader appears to have broken his silence. The statement attributed to Bashar al-Assad was posted Monday on his official Telegram account. It claims that his departure from Syria was unplanned. The statement says that Syria had fallen into the hands of terrorists and that the presidency had no further purpose. It's not entirely clear whether the post came from Assad himself. CNN's Frederik Pleitgen is in Moscow. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

But normally, of course, you are our man in Berlin, whereyou will be returning to and where a political crisis is unfolding. Fred, Germany, as you know, is facing snap elections after Olaf Scholz, chancellor lost a confidence vote. Tensions between Scholz and his finance minister doomed the governing coalition last month. The two disagreed over how to revive the economy. The political uncertainty has left Europe's largest economy adrift. Fred is with me. Fred, I know that Scholz wanted to lose. He wants the election. He believes he can win in February. Is he in danger of doing a Macron?",

And there's very few people who believe Richard that Olaf Scholz is going to make a comeback and is going to be able to win that election. Right now, if you look at the polls for his party, the Social Democrats, they're at around, I would say 14, maybe 15 percent but even more important than that, the confidence in Olaf Scholz, the confidence in the government that he has led is virtually at zero. So, there's very few people that he - - that believe that he is going to be able to win that economy. At the same time, you have the conservative candidate Friedrich Merz who looks like he could indeed win that election. But really, it's unclear who's going to be able to form a coalition, because there's very few people in the whole political sphere where Germans trust them to solve the problems of the country, Richard.",

Since then, its financial performance has been poor, to say the least. Now, Czech billionaire Daniel Kretinsky is buying it for the princely sum of $4-1/2 billion. Now he made his money in energy, but he has a few U.K. interests already. He owns a 27 percent stake in the West Ham United Football Club and a 10 percent stake in the British supermarket chain Sainsbury's. His mysterious personality and reluctance to talk about business dealings in the nickname of the Czech Sphinx in 2019. Now he won't be able to do anything he likes with Royal Mail. This takeover comes with strings attached. Royal Mail will still have to deliver letters six days a week, Monday through Saturday and parcels Monday through Friday. And the U.K. Government will hold a so-called Golden share in the company, because this is vital British infrastructure. So, they'll get final approval on things like a change in ownership of the company, a change in headquarter location or tax residency. This takeover is expected to complete next year. Richard, I'm very sorry I can't join you tonight, but I am going to send you a Christmas card. Now, I hope it's going to make it to you in a timely fashion. Earlier this month, Royal Mail was fined $13 million for not delivering letters on time, right? Merry Christmas.",
