They've conducted nearly a thousand or approximately a thousand different interviews, some with very senior former Trump administration officials and people in the former president's orbit. This - Victor, this is the next stage of this investigation. The Committee's work is done. It's expected that the Committee will ultimately be dissolved when Republicans take over the chamber next year and now these transcripts are really going to be a key piece of evidence in the hands not only of prosecutors, but also defense attorneys, journalists and historians. As CNN has learned that Special Counsel Jack Smith has actually sent a letter to the Committee asking for all the evidence that is collected. The Committee has been sharing some of that. And going forward, even Trump's attorneys, they want to see these transcripts too. Now, as I said they conducted approximately a thousand interviews. They will release hundreds of transcripts and it's going to be really interesting Victor to see which ones get released.",

Now, this is President Zelenskyy's his first overseas trip since Russia invaded Ukraine more than 300 days ago. Zelenskyy said that he made the trip to thank the American people and to thank President Biden and Congress for helping Ukraine. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, PRESIDENT OF UKRAINE:   Thank you so much for the invitation. I really wanted to come earlier. Mr. President knows about it, but I couldn't do it because the situation was so difficult. And now, if I've come - I came - I mean, that we controlled the situation and because of support - and, first of all, because of your support. And I really - I understand that we have very important topics, and we'll discuss them everything - so many challenges in Ukraine, in Europe, in the world and from energy to the situation on the battlefield. But I - first of all, I really - all my appreciation from my heart, from the hearts of Ukrainians - all Ukrainians. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

We're getting right up on the one year anniversary of this war in Ukraine.But we also expect to see him trying to bolster support for Ukraine's efforts. You just laid it out, there is a changing tide here on the Hill, of course. The House is about to be taken over by Republicans in the next Congress and there have been some Republicans, especially House Republicans that have indicated they are not willing to just blindly sign checks to send over in Ukraine funding and that is a bit of a departure as to where the Hill has been, where Congress has been and its support of Ukraine over the last some 300 days. So we certainly think that he will be speaking to that audience as well and this comes as this war moves into the winter season, Of course, Western Europe especially reliant on Russian oil. There's just a lot of dynamics at play here. And one additional one, of course, is as Zelenskyy will be speaking, the Senate is seeking to pass this massive funding bill for the next year with $45 billion included for Ukraine within that bill that would then pass through the Senate and go to the House. So there are so many dynamics at play, as this historic moment happens just several days before the Christmas holiday, before so many of these lawmakers head home for the holidays. So it's quite a busy day here on the Hill. Victor, what we do expect this sense of history tonight as Zelenskyy addresses this joint meeting of Congress and it is interesting too. One last thing to note, Pelosi is sending out a note last night to House members really trying to get them all to be in the chamber for what she called a special night for democracy. It will also be interesting to see how many senators are there if they're voting at the time, there had been hoped they might be able to be done and have left town but it looks like they will still be here when he speaks later tonight, Victor.",

Patriots will be the first long range system for aerial defense handed over to Ukraine. Ukraine has already shown very good use of some of the shorter range systems.For example, the NASAMS which is more of a medium range envelope and then there are shorter range stingers as well. They've used those very effectively and other systems to counter these Russian barrages that we've seen. But they have always looked for and requested for months now, the longer range capability of the Patriot missile, capable of shooting down ballistic missiles, drones, even aircraft that are arranged simply beyond what they have now and that's one of the reasons this is so important. Is it in and of itself a game changer? Does it make Ukraine win this war? No. But it adds to Ukraine's aerial defense capabilities. And that, as we've seen with these Russian barrages, is absolutely critical. The other reason this is important, it's not just the capability of the Patriot, though that is incredibly significant. It is the symbolism behind it, a statement, a definitive statement from the Biden administration that it will continue to support Ukraine, not only with capabilities, but backing it and making sure allies as well are providing the weapons and the capabilities needed for Ukraine to keep up the momentum it has on the battlefield, Victor.",

      "sentences": "The significance of leaving Ukraine in and of itself is huge, Victor. This is a bold move. President Zelenskyy is someone who likes to make bold moves. Just yesterday, he was on the frontline city in eastern Ukraine and Bakhmut. Today, he has left the country for the first time since the invasion to go to Washington.And as you say, it's no accident that this was his first choice in terms of the country that he wanted to visit. It is incredibly important for him to underscore, as you heard, in his brief remarks with the President, his gratitude and the appreciation of the Ukrainian people. But also, it's critical to really shore up and rally support for the future, because President Zelenskyy understands that while Ukraine has made formidable and really unexpected triumphs on the battlefield, there are still many challenges ahead. It is a freezing cold winter in Ukraine. Russia is bombarding the critical civilian infrastructure there. There are many parts of the country where brutal fighting continues, where a sort of war of attrition or a grinding stalemate prevails. And Zelenskyy knows that he is going to have to push hard to get even more weapons and even more support, if he wants to be able to kind of push this over the edge, so to speak. And he also knows that's going to be a challenge that there are changes happening next month in Congress and so that's why he's there to deliver that message, not just to President Biden, not just to the House and the Senate, but also, I think, to the American people to make that appeal on a personal level. And in doing so, by the way, he is also sending a very bold message to the West in terms of look, we are united, we are staying the course here and also to President Putin who just earlier this week left the country to visit Belarus. And what a stark contrast that is, Victor, to see President Putin sitting there in freezing cold Minsk with Alexander Lukashenko, who's widely called Europe's last dictator and today you have Zelenskyy making this bold journey, visiting President Biden at the White House, and really a moment that does feel historic, Victor.",

This is the first time that the President that the both presidents are meeting in person since the war has started. They, of course, talked a lot on the phone and on VTC, video conferencing equipment, but this is different. And they really want to take the measure of each other in some sense. The degree to which the President Biden is committed to continuing to support and the extent of that support, that he personally through Congress and the American people will deliver to Zelenskyy and the President will want to know what are in some ways Zelenskyy's goals here, what is - what are we trying to do and can we make sure that we are aligned in not only today with - and yesterday, which we have so far, but also tomorrow. Clearly, the - Zelenskyy wants to do whatever he can to liberate his own territory, not only the territory that has been taken since the war started on February 24th, but in the eight years prior to that when Russia first invaded Ukraine, and the President Biden will want to see whether President Zelenskyy understands that there is a limit to what the United States can do, because we don't want - we cannot be moved into this war directly militarily that there's something - some limit to what we can do in terms of the support we're giving. And that ultimately, we also want to find a way for Ukraine to succeed without necessarily leading to an escalation to the use of nuclear weapons on Russia.
