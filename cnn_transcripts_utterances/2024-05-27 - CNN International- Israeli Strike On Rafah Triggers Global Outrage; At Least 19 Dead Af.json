It is a strike Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is now calling a tragic mistake. Gaza's health ministry reports at least 45 people were killed, more than 200 injured, many of them women and children after fire raged through the camp, which Israel had designated as a safe zone. Israel claims two Hamas commanders were killed in that strike using what it called precision munitions to target the Hamas compound. The aftermath captured in some of the most graphic video from this war, showing charred bodies being pulled from the rubble. You can hear screams filling the air, even a man carrying headless body of a child. International condemnation of the strike has been swift, especially as it comes just days after the International Court of Justice ordered Israel to immediately halt its offensive in Rafah. French President Emmanuel Macron said he was outraged by this most recent attack, calling for the operation to stop. Doctors Without Borders for its part saying the attack shows once again, nowhere is safe. As I mentioned, Prime Minister Netanyahu addressing that attack in Israel's parliament today. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER (through translator): In Rafah, we already evacuated about 1 million noncombatant residents. And despite our outmost effort not to harm noncombatants, something unfortunately went tragically wrong. We are investigating the incident. I'm going to reach conclusions, because this is our policy.

We saw, of course, on Thursday, a series of attacks that led to the ruining of a printing press. On Saturday, it was a hardware store with many hundreds of fear to have been in and around the building when the strike took place. The death toll continuing to rise on Monday, even as Ukrainian officials say they've only sifted through a small part of the rubble that now remains. Those assaults on civilian infrastructure coming even as Russian forces continued to press their advantage militarily, the Ukrainian say they've seen over the course of 24 hours. No fewer than 15 strikes on the front lines of Kharkiv region. A reminder of Russia's aim of continuing to pile pressure on that new northern front. President Zelenskyy urgently asking for Western help and increased help with his air defenses. We've also been hearing from President Macron speaking in Dresden, as part of a three-day state visit and calling for peace and the unity of Europeans in continuing to back Ukraine at what many consider could be a crucial turning point in Moscow's favor.

This is just going to be one day after another with the heat index well, over 100 degrees. Dangerous heat index is right along the Rio Grande there in south Texas. And even warm, not hot, but warmer than we should be all the way really up the East Coast. Something else is going on in the East Coast. I'm going to zoom you right in here. There is going to be some severe weather today, if you're having a picnic outside, anything outside, you need to watch the storms here. It appears the storms have gone by, but they haven't. They're going to redevelop back out to the west here and there's going to be more lightening. So you need to have a place to go from your picnic, even it's in your car when you hear the thunder, because one of the things today, there'll be some small hail and there'll be some wind, but more lightning I think is the danger tonight because this is going to be a lightening event all the way through the overnight hours. Things are going to continue to move off shore. But for Boston, all the way down to the Carolinas, we are still going to see storms into the darkness. We still have 460,000 people without power. Some of those people don't have power and don't have homes and are sitting there in 105 or 110 degree heat index right now.

He was the only witness the prosecution put forward that could directly tie Donald Trump to the reimbursement scheme that's at the center of this case. So their strategy all along has been to try to knock down the ability of the jurors to believe Michael Cohen. And I expect fact that in their closing arguments tomorrow, they will continue to do that, to argue that you cannot convict Donald Trump of these 34 counts based on Michael Cohen's testimony.And that's why the prosecutors will say to the jury, you don't have to believe just Michael Cohen and they'll try to point the jury to the other evidence that they've introduced in this case. They have called a total of 20 witnesses. The jury has also seen text messages, phone records, handwritten notes, and they'll point the jury to all of those documents to tie it together, to say that this is how you can believe Michael Cohen, this other evidence corroborates Michael Cohen. So I expect that that is how they will frame their closing arguments. Now, this is expected to go all day tomorrow. The judge say saying that it's possible they will even stay late to finish the closing arguments. He will then instruct the jury on Wednesday on the law. That is what they need to decide if prosecutors have proven the case in order to find Donald Trump guilty, or if they haven't, then to acquit him. The deliberations will then get underway after the instructions are read to the jury and they will continue until as long as it takes for this jury of seven men and five women to come to a conclusion and reach what will be a historic verdict.",

He's not there, of course, because he's in jail right now. He's serving time for perjury in a separate case, civil case involving Donald Trump.

DEANThat argument got taken off the table very early with the -- what evidence could come in and what couldn't come in, in the early stages of the trial. Yet throughout the trial, Trump's lawyers have been raising this issue. So they may well try it pitch much of the jury on their closing that Trump was really relying on his lawyer in this instance. I think that's one of the wildcards and one of the judges who hates to interrupt a closing?

The prosecution, right, when they get up, will say, listen, you don't have to believe Cohen, there's so much other evidence and information including your common sense and good judgment, including reasonable inferences you can draw from the fact, including an oval office meeting in which Cohen wasn't there to discuss an attorney general appointment, including the reimbursements that came right after that White House meeting that would establish that Trump was involved in the falsification, and, of course, the cover up. Now, what concerned me very briefly, Erica, is that there's been very little said. We know that in order to establish the felony, you have to show that the falsifications of business records, was to cover up some other crime. Its still sort of remains a mystery. What specifically that crime is, and I think prosecutors are going to have to tie that in. But to extent that closing arguments are to bring home your case, I think the layover is not going to not benefit anyone. That's why closing arguments are going to be so important.",

Now the question is, did he change the hearts and minds of anyone there? And when we talk to a lot of libertarian voters and libertarian convention attendees, they said that Donald Trump does not align with them on a lot of issues. This is a rather strident party. You would say something even say absolutes in a lot of their views. They believe that there shouldn't be a federal income tax that the Federal Reserve should be eliminated, that we should end all foreign wars. And Donald Trump, while he may have some libertarian tendencies or tempted to make some libertarian outreach, they ultimately say he is not aligned with them and he has no different in many respects than President Joe Biden.

And I think it probably on a track for that again.Look, the two - the two parts of the electorate, the two components of the electrode that has seemed the most movable, the most fluid in 2024 are non-white men and college-educated Republican leanings suburbanites who are pretty much what we're talking about with Haley voters. And, you know, Trump, if you compare where Trump is now to where he was in 2020, his improvement, is predominant among those non-white and both Latino and Black men. And if Biden is going to over -- I think Biden can do better on election day than he is today with those voters, but he's not likely to get all the way back to where he was in 2020, given the discontent over the economy. And where does he go to make up those lost votes? I mean, the most logical place are those Haley type, if not literally, Haley voters, who are expressing a lot of discontent with Trump.

They think that the best argument to make to them is one on extremism, which is you didn't like the last four years of Trump, you're not going to like another four years of Trump. If you're concerned about democracy and the Constitution which a number of these Republican voters have expressed concern about, then Donald Trump is continuing to run a campaign where he is saying in that he will seek retribution for 2020, that he, the 2020 election was stolen, that 2024, maybe stolen, and that is their big argument to those Nikki Haley, Republican voters. The other thing they're talking to them about, which some of these voters have expressed to them is concern about political violence, just the nature the tone of the country over all right, now that they don't like that, and they feel as though they can make a strong argument to those Nikki Haley voters about that concern.",
