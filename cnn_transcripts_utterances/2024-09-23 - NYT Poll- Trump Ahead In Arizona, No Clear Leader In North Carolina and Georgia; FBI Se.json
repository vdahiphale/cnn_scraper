A closer margin in Georgia and North Carolina where it is within the margin of error. The Times notes about 15 percent of the electorate in these states still undecided or not definitely decided.With me now is former Trump White House associate counsel May Mailman, and former senior adviser to the Biden 2020 campaign Alencia Johnson. May, first to you. What do you see in these poll numbers from the Sunbelt? MAY MAILMAN, FORMER TRUMP WHITE HOUSE ASSOCIATE COUNSEL (via Webex by Cisco):  Yeah. So these are all still within the margin of error, but I think what's notable is the trend. I think everyone was expecting to see Kamala Harris get a big boost after the debate and not only is there no boost but it's actually the other way. So this same poll, The New York Times/Siena College poll, had Kamala Harris up five points in Arizona one month ago, now 10 points the other way. Trump is up. This is a state Biden won very narrowly. And so I think that these trends -- it's not so much the numbers, its trends are extremely positive for Trump.",

How is it these two seem to be moving in opposite directions?ALENCIA JOHNSON, FORMER SENIOR ADVISER TO THE BIDEN 2020 CAMPAIGN, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST (via Webex by Cisco):  Listen, I think polls -- this is the one thing I'll agree with the other panelist is that polls show a trend, but it's not the full picture. As someone who has sat on four presidential campaigns, polls aren't everything. It is what happens on Election Day and early voting. And to that, Kamala -- Vice President Harris and Gov. Walz have been campaigning in states throughout the country to make sure that voters know about who they are. We are still in the margin of error and while this poll shows that Trump might be ahead in Arizona there are other polls that show Vice President Harris is ahead in some of the other states. And that indicates to me that the vice president's campaign needs to continue to do what she says she's doing -- is going out and earning everyone's vote. I will say in all the presidential campaigns I have worked on these races have always been close, right? They've always been close when it comes to the polls. And so, again, it matters what happens at the ballot box and that will be the indicator, particularly on the issues that voters will be making decisions on, particularly around abortion, in states like Arizona.",

This is such a personal failing from what appears to be more than a decade ago, so it's difficult I think to take that and say somehow that that's Donald Trump. It just -- it really feels -- it's so wild and at this point so long ago. And Mark Robinson's entire team quit, so even the GOP is distancing themselves from him.

We are still trying to learn more about the reasons why federal investigators took the remarkable step of searching the homes of Tom Donlon on Friday.But here is what we do know. Our law enforcement sources tell us that this search warrant is related to apparent documents that Donlon might have held onto from his previous FBI and law enforcement jobs. They also tell us that this latest search warrant for the police commissioner is not related to any of the other four federal investigations that are currently ensnaring City Hall. Now, Donlon issued a statement after the search warrant was executed at his home, and I want to just show you a portion of it because he says that federal authorities \"took materials that came into my possession approximately 20 years ago and are unrelated to my work with the New York City Police Department.\" Now that distinction, Sara, is really important. And the reason he's trying to draw a distinction there is because the NYPD is already under federal investigation. As you noted, the previous commissioner had to resign after his electronic devices were confiscated. So he's trying to draw that distinction. Now, Tom Donlon has had a long career in law enforcement, including as special agent in the FBI. He was -- he ran the FBI national threat center, and he worked with the NYPD joint terrorism task force here in New York City. He was also in charge of New York's Homeland Security office.

Hezbollah hasn't used those yet.It looks like what Israel is trying to do right now -- the weekend strikes were aimed at rockets that were about to be launched, according to the Israeli Defense Forces. But now with this warning to Lebanese villages to clear out of those villages it seems Israel may be planning to go in first with aerial bombardments but perhaps later on the ground to hit stored weapons that Israeli officials believe are in those villages just north of Israel in southern Lebanon. And that means if people don't leave, we might see the situation that we've seen in Gaza where Israel says well, we gave you a warning and now we're going to hit the targets.

They're Iran's strategic reserve just in case Iran feels it's about to be attacked by Israel or the U.S. Then those missiles allegedly would be fired at major Israeli populated areas. So you've got the Biden White House and other Western powers looking at his just as the U.N. General Assembly week starts in New York.

It's good to have a good defense. The Chiefs have won their three games by a combined 13 points, but a win is a win at the end of the day. Patrick Mahomes shook off an interception to throw a pair of touchdown passes. But the Falcons were able to stay close in this game. In the fourth quarter, down five with just over five left to play, Atlanta quarterback Kirk Cousins throwing to tight end Kyle Pitts on fourth down. He drew some heavy contact, by the way, from Chiefs safety Bryan Cook. No pass interference flag thrown, and the Falcons would get the ball back for one more drive in the final minute. Once again, Kansas City's defense rising to the occasion, stopping Bijan Robinson for a third-yard loss on fourth and one. So the Chiefs win a nailbiter 22-17 the final there. The Vikings also improving to a perfect 3-0 with a dominant win over the Texans. Minnesota quarterback Sam Darnold matching his career high with four touchdown passes in the 34-7 win. It was the biggest margin of victory for the Vikings in five years. Pittsburgh is off to its first 3-0 start for the first time since 2020. Justin Fields absolutely lighting up the Chargers, throwing one touchdown and rushing for another in the 20-10 win. Fields starting in place of his injured teammate Russell Wilson, but it's going to be very hard to take him out of the lineup now. And to the Rams. Nobody was giving the winless Rams a chance against the Niners. L.A. missing a handful of starters on the offensive side of the ball and fell behind by double digits in the fourth. And Matthew Stafford just kept grinding and grinding. The quarterback leading his team to three scoring drives in the last 10 minutes of this game. Kyren Williams rushing four yards to score his third touchdown of the day with just under two remaining to tie it up. And then it all came down to the leg of kicker Joshua Karty from 37 yards out with two seconds left. And Sara knows this. It is good to complete the 27-24 comeback. It was such a great day.

That's why it's important to get your booster. And then number three, we also know that we tend to see outbreaks of whooping cough every three to five years. And this year, on September 14, the number of cases reported were five times more than the number of cases reported for that same time period compared with last year, Sara. And the best way to prevent whooping cough is to get vaccinated. The pertussis, also known as whooping cough, is included in the DTaP or Tdap vaccinations. These vaccines are part of the routine childhood immunizations. It's also recommended during pregnancy. And for adults, it's recommended to get your booster every 10 years. And pertussis or whooping cough is a bacterial infection. And even though the initial symptoms are similar to the common cold, Sara, when the illness progresses it's known for causing coughing fits. And the name comes from that whoop noise you make after coughing so much and you're trying to catch your breath. That's how whooping cough got its name.
