      "sentences": "He did. Defense Minister Oleksiy Reznikov said, even though the United States was anticipating fighting to slow during the winter months, the exact opposite may happen.Because, from the Ukrainian perspective, once the deep freeze kicks in the official start of winter, just days away, and temperatures plunging by the day, it will be much easier to move heavy equipment and weapons through areas currently very muddy, swamplands that are very difficult to traverse. So the Ukrainians planning to retake territory currently occupied by the Russians. And it's been very intense fighting along the frontlines, both in the east in Donetsk and also in the south. Now, the Ukrainian side has been shelling very heavily in Melitopol. You just mentioned, this is a town which is believed to house a hotel that was a sleeping quarters for Russian mercenaries working for the privately owned Wagner Group. It's basically an arm of the Russian army, unofficial, of course, because they often have been accused in past conflicts of doing the dirty work that the Russian military doesn't want to be officially tied. And yet, they're supplied with weapons and money by the Russian government. These fighters are on the front lines fighting in Ukraine. They're fighting in Donetsk, trying to retake Bakhmut, a town Russia has been setting its sights on in recent weeks. But in Melitopol, these Wagner Group operatives, these mercenary fights, perhaps hundreds of them were sleep in a hotel that was hit with Ukrainian rockets, fired by U.S. military equipment. And according to reports coming in, potentially very heavy losses sustained. Certainly, if that, indeed, is the case, it would be a significant, a significant development and victory for the Ukrainians. The defense minister also talking about the constant bombardment by Russians at the power grid, including kamikaze drone attacks that plunged 1.5 million people into darkness over the weekend. Those are, of course, the drones made in Iran, fired by Russia that explode on impact. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Audio from a year ago of a meeting in which De Leon and other council members were discussing, in rather disparaging, rather racist unpleasant terms, another council member and that council member's son. Now, the president of the council, she apologized and resigned. De Leon has been keeping a low profile, refusing to resign. This was really his first sort of step back into the public waters. He attended a city council meeting on Friday, then this event at which this erupted. Now both De Leone and the man he is seen wrestling with, both of them claim that the other one was aggressive. The LAPD now has this video and they will have to decide what they think happened. But, listen, the general background here, a lot of people in this city think that local politics is broken.

And I think, as people see just how much virus there is out there this time of year -- you know, when you are in a public place and you are surrounded by strangers, throwing on a mask for 30 minutes while you go shopping is not too much to ask just to protect yourself. Even if you are a healthy person, being sick for a week or two with flu or COVID is not fun. GOLODRYGA: No, it's not. But I have to tell you, just from watching people here in the city, I don't see many people walking around in masks yet. That could change in the next few weeks. While we have you, let me ask you about another alarming development we have seen, and that's a shortage of over-the-counter medications.

They don't absolutely need to be treated. Of course, talk to your doctor. Kids under 2 months old, 100 percent, call your doctor if they have a fever. In the case where your kid is feeling pretty bad, yes, you might have to call around stores to find that children's Tylenol, children's ibuprofen. One more reminder. Baby aspirin is not for babies. Kids and adolescents should not be receiving aspirin for fever, aches or pains, or anything else because of the risk of something called Reye's Syndrome.
