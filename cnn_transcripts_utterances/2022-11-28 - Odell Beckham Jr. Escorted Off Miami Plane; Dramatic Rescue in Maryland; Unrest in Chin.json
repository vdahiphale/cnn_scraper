In China, demonstrations that began as a response to the country's zero COVID policy are now expanding, as some protesters openly demand freedom of speech, some even calling for President Xi Jinping to step down, things that are virtually never uttered in public there. At the same time, months of human rights protests in Iran coming to a head at the World Cup ahead of tomorrow's crucial match between the United States and Iran. The U.S. must win to advance. Now, Iran's state media is calling for the Americans to be booted from the Cup over an image U.S. soccer posted on social media. And now we're learning the regime has threatened the Iranian players' families. CNN's Don Riddell is in Doha at the World Cup. And CNN's Jomana Karadsheh is on top of everything happening inside Iran right now. Let me start with you, Don. What are the players and coaches saying about all of this ahead of tomorrow's decisive game?",

Within the last 24 hours, the tensions around this match have really been ratcheted up with the decision to replace the flag by the U.S. Soccer Federation, which has absolutely enraged the Iranian team. And they seem to be using this as a way to galvanize their own players. And this has now become a political clash. The United States team was facing the media today, and they were peppered with political questions, Tyler Adams, their young captain, having to fend off some of those. And the Iranians have become very, very good at holding up a mirror and saying, well, if you think these are the problems in our country, what about the problems in your countries? What about the racism, for example? And so Tyler Adams had to answer that. And he was also educated on the way to say Iran. It's not Iran, as they say, often in the United States. It's Iran. This is what Adams had to say. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TYLER ADAMS, CAPTAIN, U.S. MEN'S NATIONAL SOCCER TEAM:  My apologies on the mispronunciation of your country. Yes, that being said, there's discrimination everywhere you go. One thing that I have learned, especially from living abroad in the past years and having to fit in different cultures and kind of assimilate into different cultures, is that, in the U.S., we're continuing to make progress every single day.

It's a rematch of their epic World Cup clash in 1998, where Iran won to knock the United States out.The American players do not want a repeat of that. But the hype and anticipation and the intensity around this game is only building. And it's going to be fascinating to see which set of players can handle it best. The Iranian players are already in a very, very difficult situation. Famously, they refused to sing the national anthem in their opening game. They then mouthed the words in their next game. So some people think they're sympathetic to the demonstrators. Some people think the team is pro-regime. The players are in a very, very difficult position. And the American players now have to go into the middle of this and try and block all of that out and just win the game in 90 minutes to get to the knockout round.",

Their family members have been arrested. And so we're seeing something on a much larger scale here. And I think, for that reason, you really have to respect the quiet protests of the Iranian players ahead of the first game, the team captain speaking out in support of protesters and offering grief for those who have lost loved ones. Ramin Rezaeian, no relation to me, but who scored the second goal in the game against Wales on Friday, speaking about dedicating it to the suffering people of his country, I think it's quite clear that these -- these players are under a tremendous amount of pressure and are dancing a very delicate line, and are taking great risks to stand up in support of the protests.

Then your whole neighborhood or community can go into strict lockdown. Regular COVID tests are required to enter any public area in many cities across the country. I have become used to standing in long lines outside for my regular COVID test. I need a 48-hour test to go into any public place. Beijing has locked down several districts.

There is video of it. The airline has confirmed it. Beckham's attorney has confirmed it. But it's what led up to that moment. That kind of depends on who you ask. Let's start with what police are saying. In their statement -- and I will read it with you -- it says: \"The first crew\" -- or -- excuse me -- \"The flight crew was concerned for a passenger,\" talking about Beckham there, \"as they tried to wake him to fasten his seat belt. He appeared to be coming in and out of consciousness prior to their departure.\" Police say that, when officers arrived he was asked to get off the plane, he didn't get off the plane. So everyone was asked to deplane and eventually he was escorted out. So let's now go to the other side. You go to what Beckham's attorney is saying. And I will read that statement with you. He's calling it an overzealous flight attendant, saying: \"The overzealous flight attendant refused to simply allow Mr. Beckham to fasten his seat belt and proceed with the flight, and instead immediately removed everyone from the plane.\" Now, this was a flight that was from Miami heading to L.A., several hours of delays, but they did eventually take off. And we should also note that while one is kind of framing this as a medical emergency, the other is saying he was just asleep and he was willing to comply, not disruptive at all.
