Jeddah has become one of the main landing points for so many people who were evacuating from Sudan and Saudi Arabia as a key diplomatic player in Sudan but also one of the biggest countries that's helping people leave from Port Sudan across the Red Sea into Jeddah. The reason so many people, thousands are leaving to border posts across Chad and Egypt and Ethiopia and South Sudan is because there is no sense that this conflict is about to come to a close. So far, all of the ceasefires between the Rapid Support Forces and the Sudanese Armed Forces have quickly fallen apart. And despite every international effort to try and get these two warring generals to agree to a cessation of hostilities, it does not look like it's about to happen.

What it means is that those staying in the capital are facing horrific conditions, both in terms of danger from the fighting and also just the deterioration of humanitarian situations.

The Egyptians, it sounds like, have been fairly uncooperative, frankly, on an administrative front, letting Sudanese pass into the country without visas, without papers. They've obviously fled for their lives. So, they're without many of these kinds of documents, and so the Egyptians not making it any easier to move into Egypt.

But the view in the Biden campaign and I think view among most professionals in both parties is that we are living in such a polarized era where the lines between the parties are so intractable and so many voters are motivated less by the enthusiastic support of their side than the desire to keep the other side from gaining power and implementing their agenda. Ultimately, that kind of concern falls away when you get to the actual choice. There are a lot of Democrats, a majority of Democrats at these polls say they do not want Biden to run again.

He inspires a lot of turnout on his side, among non-college, non-urban evangelical voters who don't usually vote.But he has inspired massive turnout on the other side and the number of millennials and Gen Z that are going to be eligible to vote in '24 is going to be substantially larger than it was in '20. I mean, the electorate is kind of evolving toward the groups that are the most skeptical of Trump. That fundamentally is the argument against him in a Republican primary. I mean, it is hard to make a case against him on policy grounds. He's a pretty good match of where the Republican coalition is now, motivated more by cultural and economic issues. Most Republican voters were satisfied with his administration. The strongest case, I think, that his rivals have against him is that whatever he is promising you, he is not going to be able to deliver it because he is not going to be able to win again.

The concern among city officials is the average daily rate of asylum seekers arriving here in New York, about 200, is likely to potentially increase, as we are beginning to see many of those migrants finally crossing into the U.S., and with that, concerns of that increasing price tag.Over the last year, city officials are saying that the migrant crisis here in New York City has already cost them at least $817 million in order to care for and house for these migrants.

And that is why what we've heard since last year, New York City Mayor Eric Adams really calling on his fellow Democrat in the White House to do more to assist New York City in managing the situation. He is calling for any potential executive action on behalf of President Joe Biden to expedite the application process for many of these asylum-seekers that time and time again have shared with us that they simply want to work legally in order to pay their way into housing versus relying on the strained homeless shelter system here in New York City, but the mayor also calling for more government workers to be able to expedite those applications. CNN has reached out to the White House for further comments, as we continue to monitor the potential increase in asylum seeker arrivals here in New York City. Polo Sandoval, CNN, New York.",

The leading opposition candidate has vowed to cut diplomatic relations with island democracy in favor of China, if he wins. It comes as Beijing's influence across Latin America continues to grow. CNN's Rafael Romo reports. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) RAFAEL ROMO, CNN SENIOR LATIN AMERICAN AFFAIRS EDITOR (voice over): China has launched a diplomatic offensive with Latin America in recent months. In September, then-Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi met with his Argentine counterpart at the U.N. General Assembly. Two months later, he sat down with Mexico's foreign minister at the G-20 Leaders' Summit. And in January, President Xi himself delivered a video address at a Latin American and Caribbean forum. China's influence in the region has grown so much and so fast that Taiwan's president, Tsai Ing-wen, felt compelled to visit Guatemala and Belize a week after Honduras severed ties with Taipei, a move Taiwan called very regrettable, as the Honduran foreign minister traveled to Beijing to establish formal diplomatic ties. Now, only 13 countries in the world diplomatically recognize Taipei over Beijing, which considers Taiwan part of its territory despite never having ruled it. Beijing refuses to maintain diplomatic ties with any country that recognizes Taiwan, among them, Guatemala and Belize, and in South America, Paraguay. [03:45:08] And it is holding presidential elections this Sunday and the leading opposition candidate has signaled he may rethink his country's ties with Taiwan if he wins victorious. Efrain Alegre says national interests and foreign policy goals would influence his decision, adding that he is not happy with the current relationship.

On Monday, he returned the favor by starting a three-day visit to Taipei, where he called for a free, sovereign and independent Taiwan. Before departing, the Guatemalan president said he hoped Taiwan would now buy as much sugar and coffee from his country as it used to get from Honduras, hoping the unwavering loyalty Guatemala has shown will pay off in the long-term.

First Republic stock has fallen 97 percent since March 1st, on Friday, hitting $3 a share after it revealed depositors withdrew $100 billion during the first quarter.A $30 billion lifeline from some of the largest banks clearly was not enough to stop the freefall. Reports say JPMorgan Chase and PNC Financial are in the process of bidding to buy First Republic. University of Michigan Economics Professor Justin Wolfers says the deal could benefit both parties. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JUSTIN WOLFERS, PROFESSOR OF ECONOMICS, UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN: There's a real problem that arises for a very small number of banks. Silicon Valley Bank was among them and, of course, First Republic was as well. These are banks where they are mostly catering to very wealthy depositors. Deposit insurance only covers the first $250,000 of your deposit. So, these are banks that are not covered by our usual deposit insurance. And that means if people get a little bit nervous, they start to pull money out and that means they could be caught without enough cash in the vault. And that's really their problem. It is not that this is a completely unprofitable bank, it's not that it doesn't it does not have assets, it's that it does not have enough cash in the vault. And one of the best ways of resolving that, the worst way would be a bank run, the best way would be if another bank just came and took it over and said, hey, we've got an even bigger vault, plus, we like owning profitable businesses.
