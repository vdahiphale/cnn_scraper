And as you can see about 20 meters behind me, to be able to protest. But when he did speak in primetime to the Israeli people, he certainly didn't mince his words. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ISAAC HERZOG, ISRAELI PRESIDENT (through translator): I'm going to use a phrase I haven't used before. An expression that there is no Israeli who is not horrified when he hears it. Whoever thinks that the real civil war of human lives is a limit that we will not reach has no idea. Precisely now in the 75th year of the state of Israel, that this is within touching distance.

And therefore as far as the government is concerned, they're going to continue to ram through this judicial overhaul. They said they want it done and adjusted within the next couple weeks before the Jewish festival Passover.And as you can see, the protests behind me, they are still continuing. It's still quite relatively early here, so it will build up throughout the day. This has been going on now with weekend protest included for the last two months. And it seems that although Herzog's words were certainly very striking, but there is still no opportunity or compromise between the government and between the protesters and the opposition in Parliament on judicial reform, (INAUDIBLE) overall say will continue and these protests will continue as well -- Max.",
