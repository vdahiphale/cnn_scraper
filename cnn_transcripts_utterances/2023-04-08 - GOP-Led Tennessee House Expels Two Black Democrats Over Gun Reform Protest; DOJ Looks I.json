The state lawmakers, all Democrats, were targeted by Republicans for leading a loud but peaceful protest on the House floor in that legislature. They were demanding gun reform after the Nashville school shooting that left six people including three 9-year-old children dead. The two expelled lawmakers Justin Pearson and Justin Jones are black, Gloria Johnson who is white kept her seat by just one vote. That fact has only added to the anger in Tennessee and across the country. CNN correspondent Isabel Rosales joins us with more details. It seems like there's already a path potentially to return both of these lawmakers to their seats. So what happens next?",

Over at Nashville Metro City Council, they are holding a special meeting come Monday where they're anticipating nominating and then appointing Representative Justin Jones.One barrier that might come in the way here is a rule, a rule within council that prohibits somebody from being nominated and appointed within the same day. But if they passed that rule and move forward beyond that rule, it is possible that within an hour Jones is not only nominated but then heads on over to the state capitol back to his normal seat. Similarly over in Memphis, Mikell Lowry, the chairman of the Shelby County Board of Commissioners, says that they will not address Pearson's situation before Wednesday, their normally scheduled meeting, then they will call for a quorum to schedule a special meeting. In Tennessee, we are certainly seeing a political tensions rising.

Taiwan says it has detected more than 70 Chinese warplanes and nine military vessels crossing the Taiwan Strait today. China says the exercises should be viewed as a warning. And joining us now to talk about this Democratic Congressman Ritchie Torres of New York. Congressman, thanks so much for giving us your time this evening. You were part of a bipartisan delegation that met with Taiwan's president this week. What do you think? How do you view China launching these military drills in retaliation? They seem to be saying, please view this as a reaction to what has taken place over the last week. REP. RITCHIE TORRES (D-NY): Well, since the 1970s, there have been a series of policies, the one China policy, the Taiwan Relations Act, the three communiques, the six assurances. The combination of all those policies has brought decades of stability in the Taiwan Strait and the United States remains committed to preserving those policies. Whereas China is increasingly moving away from those policies. And China has displayed the kind of bullying and belligerence toward Taiwan that Russia had shown toward Ukraine, and that is unacceptable.

This is a 6-3 court. It's very ideological. The three Trumpy justices are super conservative. They have been in a hurry to remake the country and its very conservative image. And it's certainly possible that we see a ban. I mean, I think they're right.

You know, they know this is not popular. They know that the more they take away women's rights, the more the culture of realizes how women are supposed to have them.

And then the second miracle is, you know, when you look at all the injuries, they're really perfectly placed, preserving a lot of the joint spaces, but you know, preserving -- his liver was a little lacerated by his 12th rib, puncturing the liver, and his lungs collapsed. But other than that, no other vital organs were damaged.His spinal cord was preserved, and his brain, I mean, the Cat ran all the way over his face and skull and would have, you know, crushed his brain, but he is neurologically intact. (END VIDEO CLIP) MELAS: So remember, Jeremy in this interview with Diane Sawyer, you know, he says that he was trying to save his nephew's life when he kind of leaned out of the cab of the Snowcat, 14,000 pounds, he lost his footing, and it literally rolled on top of him. Jim, I just want to talk to you a little bit more about Jeremy's injuries: Eight broken ribs in 14 places, a broken eye socket. Jeremy said, at one point he could like see his eyes sticking out of the socket, broken knee, a collapsed lung and as we heard, his liver pierced from a rib bone, but that is just some of the injuries. So yes, it is a miracle that he is alive and just 10 weeks later, already walking with the help of a walker.",
