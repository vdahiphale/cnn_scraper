You could see it clearly all day yesterday. She was supposed to be largely off the trail, preparing for a CNN town hall, but instead, Harris abruptly called reporters to her Washington, D.C., residence yesterday afternoon to make this argument.

That has moved against her to now 53 percent unfavorable to 45 percent favorable. And of course, the campaign is not making decisions in a vacuum.

      "sentences": "Mitigating greenhouse gases. That is the key.And I'm going to let you in on a little secret. If we don't, it is extremely expensive. Take last year, for example. We had a record number of billion-dollar- plus disasters. And if we go towards this year, we're still rewriting the history books here. But we have this data that we've already accumulated over $50 billion from the disasters we've had. But this is only valid through August. Remember, September and October? Yes, Hurricane Helene, Hurricane Milton. So, those numbers are going to drastically rise. Look at the previous decades, as well: 2010 to 2019, nearly $1 trillion from these natural disasters. 2017 sticks out in my mind. I was in Houston for Hurricane Harvey. That was an incredible rain event that caused so much catastrophic flooding. And the reason is, is because of this heat that's baked into our atmosphere. Remember: when we warm our planet, we also warm the oceans. And so, that allows for more water vapor in the atmosphere. And that allows for more frequent and more intense rainfall events like Harvey, just like Milton. Remember the flash flooding that happened. And also with our warming oceans, we see this rapid intensification occurring more frequently as well. There's been an uptick just in the past decades of these hurricanes going from tropical storm to major Category 5, just like Milton did a couple of weeks ago. And no state across the U.S., Kasie, is sheltered from these billion- dollar disasters. It happens everywhere. Climate change is happening now.",
