I'm Bianna Golodryga in New York, sitting in for Christiane Amanpour. Ukrainians have now endured nearly 500 days of war. And their pain shows no sign of easing. The death toll from a Russian strike on the western city of Lviv has now listen to 10. In an attempt to help bring that suffering to an end, the United States is expected to announce a new military aid package for the country. But in a highly controversial move, they will send cluster bombs to Ukraine for the first time. So controversial that they're actually banned in 120 countries. You can see them here, cluster bombs are canisters filled with smaller bombs that can be dropped from the air and released across a wide area. They pose a major threat to civilians after the initial attack because they leave behind unexploded munitions. It is important to note, the cluster bombs have been used before in this war by both Ukrainians and Russians. Joining me now from Washington is the national security council's John Kirby. John, it's always good to see you. So, Ukraine welcomes news of these cluster bombs because they \"have extraordinary psycho emotional impact on the Russians.\" But up until recently, we know that the U.S. has been hesitant upon delivering these cluster bombs. And given the timing of this, this counteroffensive, even according to President Zelenskyy going slower than expected and Ukraine quickly running through its ammunition, why shouldn't this be viewed as an active desperation? JOHN KIRBY, U.S. NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL COORDINATOR FOR STRATEGIC COMMUNICATIONS:  Well, look, I think we'll have more to say about this later this afternoon. And I don't want to get ahead of that process here right now with you. I would just tell you that we are in constant touch with Ukrainians about how this counteroffensive is going and what they need to be effective. And we have shown many, many times, over the last 16 months, that we're willing to evolve and change the capabilities, as we need to be to allow them to be as effective and more -- and successful as we can on the battlefield. The other thing that we have done, historically over 16 months, Bianna, is make sure that we are effectively managing the inventory of the kinds of systems that we have and are providing, and their inventory in Ukraine, about how much they have and how much they're going through. Again, without getting ahead of any announcements, you don't have to look very far to see that this counteroffensive is very much about artillery. It is a gunfight, literally, as Ukrainians are trying to penetrate deep in behind Russian defenses and make some progress. So, artillery and artillery rounds are our key capability. And you're going to see us continue to provide that.",

Yes, cluster munitions had been used on this battlefield by both the Ukrainians and the Russians. The difference is, the Russians are using them as a part of a broader range of capabilities to kill indiscriminately and to attack and a neighboring nation that's posed no threat to them. They are the aggressors and they are using cluster munitions in a very deadly, lethal way to kill innocent Ukrainians. The Ukrainians have used cluster munitions in this war, as you noted, to defend themselves. And they're using them on their own territory. And they would probably the first to tell you that Ukrainian civilian population is far more at risk by Russian drones, Russian cruise missiles, Russian soldiers, Russian tanks and Russian artillery on their property, on their territory, than those civilians are at risk by the potential for unexploded ordinance. That doesn't mean -- and this is a really important point, it doesn't mean that even without speaking to a decision today, it doesn't mean that we aren't taking seriously the risks of unexploded ordinance in Ukraine. We already have taken that seriously. We are working with Ukraine on demining efforts. Demining efforts that they're doing now, Bianna, and demining efforts that they're going to have to do when this war ends. But let's not be pollyannaish about who the aggressor here is Russia. And Russia are using these munitions literally to kill indiscriminately.",

Let me go back to the counteroffensive though, because as I noted, President Zelenskyy himself has admitted that it's going slower than had been anticipated. And his reasoning is, perhaps, to blame the West, at least, in terms of being adequately supplied with the weapons that he needs. Here's what he said to Erin Burnett about this, earlier this week. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT (through translator):  I'm grateful to the U.S., as the leaders of our support. But I told them as well as the European leaders that we would like to start our counteroffensive earlier and we will need all the weapons and material for that. Why? Simply because, if we start later, it will go slower. And we will have losses of lives, because everything is heavily mined, and we will have to go through it all. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

We have worked to provide all of that to them. And basically, filled their shopping list well in advance of their kickoff date. So, we're comfortable and confident that we and our allies and partners did everything we could to fulfill their needs and to get them ready for this counteroffensive. Now, they can speak to the timing and when and where and all of that, that's their operations. But we're very comfortable that we did everything we can to help them.

But the counteroffensive tools that they most needed were the ones that we most work on filling. I mean, and there's really four categories of that.

And Ukraine is -- you know, has not met those requirements right now. So, we're working with Ukraine, we're working with our allies and partners. And we'll see where this goes. Back in 2009, as you might remember, in Bucharest, there was a declaration by the alliance that basically said that NATO is -- that Ukraine's future place is in NATO, but it remains to be seen exactly how and when that's going to happen. I will add this, at the summit in Vilnius next week, you can expect President Biden and our allies and partners to spend a lot of time talking about long-term defense needs for Ukraine. So, whether membership is the issue or not, Ukraine is still going to have a long-term -- a long border with Russia after this war ends and they're going to need to able to defend that border and defend themselves.

Apparently, Prigozhin did go for five seconds or less, he did go to Belarus, so we told, according to his plane schedule. But then, suddenly, he's roaming around Moscow at St. Petersburg and his property, his guns, his money, his vehicles, his computers are given back to him because the criminal case is closed.

There's really never too much coherence or consistency but this is really something absolutely special in addition to the fact that the president of a sovereign country, or so he says, often is basically playing a second fiddle -- not even second fiddle, but sort be ranger (ph) of Putin on embarrassment with Prigozhin, which is kind of, yet, also another level of discombobulation of Russian politics.",

I don't read the same way that cheering up for Prigozhin, for me, that was -- when I was watching those -- this footage, and I was in Moscow at the time, so I saw similar things and people were like, well, that's not real, it cannot be real.

He doesn't really stamp on his own. He thinks that, you know, this KGB kind of camaraderie, the Siloviki camaraderie doesn't require that. But now, we see that it is indeed going to happen.

U.S. China relations have taken a nosedive in recent years, Premier Li Qiang likened the relationship to a rainbow, saying, while there may be wind and rain, there will always be a rainbow. So, let's dig into all of this with economic historian Adam Tooze. Welcome to the program from France. Adam, good to see you. So, I know the expectations are pretty low here, similar where they were with Secretary of State Blinken in his recent visit to China and meeting with President Xi. The U.S.'s goal was basically to create a floor under the relationship. What is Secretary Yellen need to accomplish on this trip? ADAM TOOZE, HISTORY PROFESSOR, COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY AND AUTHOR, \"SHUTDOWN: HOW COVID SHOOK THE WORLD'S ECONOMY\":  I think that what she's trying to do is fill this very thankless task of spelling out to Beijing that on the one hand, the United States wants a cooperative relationship with China in the economic sphere, it wants what they call healthy competition. And on the other hand, Washington will not step back from the national security carveouts. And she's been trying to walk this line. Jake Sullivan fleshed this out with this old image of a small garden with high walls. And what's in a small garden are things like artificial intelligence and chips and certain key areas of renewal technology. And those are as it were kind of carveouts. And at the same time, they're trying to get Beijing to agree that they're not in a state of economic war and that China and the U.S. still have a huge number of interesting common, and that full-on decoupling is basically unthinkable. So, de-risking is this term that the West has kind of agreed on, but of course, the Chinese hate thinking of themselves as a risk. So, really, it's a delicate, delicate diplomatic balancing act.",

But I think that deep down everyone understands that this means two different things, which is that for the Europeans, multipolarity is what they want. They actually would like to have a variety of different trading relationships at emerging market and low-income countries around the world. The United States, fundamentally, is not in the business of promoting multipolarity. The United States wants to consolidate a block, which is in the business of containing China's rise.

I guess my bigger question to you is, yes, Janet Yellen is respected by many of her counterparts in China. But can anything be tangibly accomplished without President Xi signing off on it? And I ask because he does seem to be the outlier, the idealogue here. And perhaps it was his policies alone that have led to some of the economic challenges the country is seeing, whether to Zero-COVID policy and obviously, cracking down on their private sector.

And twice over Xi said, as it were as authorize from the top down, we need to continue developing this relationship. And I think that is exactly, as you're suggesting, a kind of opening to say, look at the presidential level from the very top. This is our mandate to act. At the same time, however, though these countervailing tendencies, which certainly are ideological, it's also, I think, if you talk to Chinese economists, very unclear whether Xi really fully realizes the seriousness of the economic crisis that China is in. Because the business cycles in the United States and China are going in very different directions right now. With the American economy so resilient with these incredible job numbers coming in. And on the other hand, really rather alarming figures for unemployment in China. 20 percent unemployment amongst young people. These are not figures we've seen anytime recently. And it's not clear whether Xi has really -- has it were given the greenlight for the regime to go into stimulus mode, to offset this, and they need that. They need that greenlight.",

It's -- so, the Michigan numbers, which are one of the most commonly tracked sentiment numbers show this. And it's a truly astonishing fact. It's as though -- actually, people's assessment of their pocketbooks was entirely colored by their party politics. So, given Biden's approval ratings in general, given the fact that as it were the political camps in America are deeply entrenched, and given the ambiguity of the recovery that we are seeing from COVID, this is no ordinary business cycle, this is a very unusual cycle we are seeing. Those was huge increases in employment, which the president is citing, they're -- absolutely, they are there in the statistical record, but they come off the back, of course, of the horrendous unemployment numbers of 2020. So, as the American economy has swung back, many people have gone back into work. The gap between white and African American employment rates has narrowed to a degree we've never seen before. But at the same time, the inflation has eaten away at real wages, and that, I think, is where compounding the existing polarization and partisan interpretations of every single fact about American reality is where I think you get these extraordinary numbers from.
