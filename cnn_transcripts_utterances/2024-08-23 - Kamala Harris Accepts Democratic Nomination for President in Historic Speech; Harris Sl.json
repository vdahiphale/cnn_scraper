That wanted to reelect Joe Biden, but there was not a majority in the country that wanted to put Donald Trump back in the White House. She did not have to dwell -- the convention as a whole did not dwell as much on making the case against Trump, although she did quite a bit. Her job, I think, is to reassure, to convince that majority that already does not want to put him back in the White House, that she is an acceptable alternative, and she tried to do that last night, I think, more through her personal story and the kind of presence, the presidential presence that she projected, a lot of P's there, than by, you know, really detailing the agenda. By the way, I think we know what her agenda would be. The agenda of the Democratic Party is very clear. It's bottom up. It's a vast amount of it is stuff that the House passed in '21 and '22 that Sinema and Manchin blocked. But she did not do that last night. It was more about here. I am. I am change. I am energy.

So, that's what we don't know about today. Here's what we do know.
