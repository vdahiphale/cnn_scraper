The recommendation comes as the special counsel zeroes in on a chaotic Trump White House meeting that included Giuliani. And a town divided. Elon Musk's SpaceX is transforming a quiet town into a bustling terminal for space travelers. Not everyone, though, is on board. Let's go OUTFRONT. Good evening. Thanks for joining us tonight. I'm Erica Hill in for Erin Burnett. OUTFRONT tonight, lethal aid. The U.S. announcing it is sending its cluster ammunitions to Ukraine. It's a highly controversial weapon that Kyiv has been pushing for and one for which Russia has been widely criticized for using in this war. It's controversial because as you can see in the video here, it breaks apart midair, scatters explosives over a large area. In fact, cluster bombs can munitions that didn't explode on the ground long after the fighting has stopped, continuing to endanger civilians in the area. That, of course, is part of the problem and part of the concern that was discussed with Russia early on. An exclusive interview with CNN with Fareed Zakaria, President Biden explained why he believes, though, now is the time to arm Ukraine with this powerful weapon. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

The number of key allies are among 120 countries that have banned cluster munitions because they can cause so much damage, both initially and as we noted, for years to come. The U.S., Ukraine, and Russia are among the 71 nations that have not signed on to that ban.This decision by Biden also puts it with odds with members of his own party. Among them, Congresswoman Chrissy Houlahan from Pennsylvania who writes in a statement: I challenge the notion that we should employ the same tactics Russia is using, blurring the lines of moral high ground. Since the early days of this war, both Russia and Ukraine have been using cluster munitions, with deadly results. In a new video posted by Russian soldiers, Putin's men could be here pleading for help as they are being hit with Ukraine's cluster munitions. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) RUSSIAN SOLDIER (through translated):  We were at the front line, with under constant border fire of the enemy. More than 2,000 shells were fired at us every day. We had no opportunity to take cover, because all of the positions that have been dug, they were all destroyed under enemy mortar fire, as well as cluster munition. We were there without air and artillery support. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "Yeah, Erica, what we saw today from the White House and the Pentagon was really a full- throated defense of this decision to send Ukraine these very controversial munitions. We heard from the national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, who said essentially that without these cluster munitions, the U.S. is very worried that Ukraine might not have enough artillery ammunition to actually get through the rest of its counteroffensive and successfully prosecute this war against Russia.Now, of course, this has serious implications for the U.S.'s relationship with its allies, particularly those that have banned the use of cluster munitions. As you said, over 100 countries worldwide have done so. But the U.S. says that it is confident that they've managed to reassure allies that this is what Ukraine needs right now. And national security adviser Sullivan also sought to draw distinctions between how Russia and Ukraine are actually using these munitions on the battlefield. Russia does have these cluster munitions, but importantly, the dud rate of those munitions in terms of how many of those little bomblets that scatter across large areas actually explode, actually do not explode. It's much higher than the dud rate of the munitions that the U.S. would provide. What does that mean? It essentially means that the risk posed to civilians in the longer term by the Russian cluster munitions is far greater than those that would be posed by the ones that are going to be provided by the U.S. So, the U.S. is also drawing a distinction, of course, between the morality of these cluster munitions, the Ukrainians are using them to defend their own territory, whereas the Russians are using them to attack a sovereign country -- an important distinction that the White House has sought to make, Erica.",

Not in Russia, nor the Ukrainian frontlines but standing empty for now in Belarus.Well, this is where we thought that Wagner soldiers invited to Belarus could be housed, in vast tent city that supposedly this disused military base, about 100 kilometers, 70 miles or so outside of the Belarusian capital, in tents like these that have been set up to house a couple of dozen fighters at any given time. For the most part, empty at the moment, and that's because the plan to invite Wagner and its leader over here into Belarus after the military uprising of Russia, it now appears to be on hold. Recent satellite images showed how quickly the camp at Asipovichy was transformed, ready to house large numbers of troops at short notice. And the Belarusian general who gave us access told me that Wagner forces could still be deployed here if the political decision is made. There is room for up to 5,000 soldiers, at this camp alone, he tells me. And we have other facilities, too. Have you've been told to prepare this camp for the possible arrival of Wagner fighters? Is that what you are told? We have prepared it for training and for territorial defense, he says. It was the sudden announcement by the leader of Belarus that neither Wagner nor its leader was in fact in the country. It seems to have thrown planning into disarray. Lukashenko insists his offer which helps bring Wagner's armed uprising to an end last month is still on the table. But with new questions, over Wagner and its leader, it seems unlikely that this would be Wagner camp will ever now be filled. (END VIDEOTAPE) CHANCE (on camera):  Well, Erica, what I think this shows is that the offer to house Wagner fighters in Belarus was genuine but the move towards the mercenary group and its leader, Yevgeny Prigozhin, is changing rapidly. The chance to leave Russia in that camp may have now passed. Back to you, Erica.",

Ukraine posed no threat to Russia. They've invaded and they have devastated city after city.Your crews have documented in places like Mariupol and Bakhmut and Melitopol, how the Russians don't just attack but they utterly destroy these cities and killed countless civilians. Nobody with a straight face should utter the notion that there is any question of where the moral high ground lies, number one. Number two, we are not using these munitions and the same way that the Russians are. The Russians are indiscriminately bombing civilians. And civilian targets with cluster munitions that have dud rates of over 30 percent. Ukraine is using their weapons and will be using these weapons to target military targets that have invaded their own country. So, any suggestion that this is somehow even remotely similar to what the Russians are doing is just ridiculous, frankly. Now, we don't want to use cluster munitions, not because of any moral comparison in Russia, but because we would rather not do it. But Russia has forced Ukraine's hand with this brutal and unending invasion. So, that's I think the proper way to look at this difficult decision.",

The instability in Russia is undermining that. What is Prigozhin doing? I mean, it's -- you know, I don't know where he's at, but it definitely adds an element of instability. It is worth noting that Prigozhin's comment saying this war, Putin lied basically. This war isn't what he's been telling the Russian. People it wasn't provoked. It was a war of choice.

Mr. Giuliani has not acknowledged or accepted responsibility for his conduct and the misconduct here sadly transcends all his past accomplishments.This, as we learn special counsel Jack Smith is focused on that chaotic Oval Office meeting we heard so much about in December of 2020, the one that Giuliani, and other Trump legal advisers attended, where Trump considered every possible option to stay in power despite the objections of his then White House counsel, including seizing voting machines. Paula Reid is OUTFRONT. So, Paula, we know special council has asked Giuliani and others about this meeting.

It's widely considered to be one of the most chaotic meetings of the entire Trump administration, which as you can imagine is really saying something. This was something covered extensively by the January 6th committee, but we've known about this for quite some time.So, the fact that they are now in recent weeks and months asking witnesses about this suggests they are crossing their T's, they're dotting their I's, right? They are finally talking to Rudy Giuliani after about six months of silence. He sat down for this voluntary interview. And they are asking him about this meeting. He was a central player here. All of this in addition to other reporting about how we know they are interested in the campaigns for state, the pressure on states to overturn their election results. It all suggests that this could be close to wrapping up. But, Erica, we have other reporting that suggests they are not done yet. We know there are some other witnesses who have recently been contacted by the special counsel but I have not set a date to sit down with him. So, there are still some people that they need to interview. At this point, it is not clear when charges will come. The other big question I get is, will the former president be charged?

What you have in this meeting is one group of lawyers saying to Donald Trump, do these things, seize voting machines, named Sidney Powell, special counsel. Another more sponsor will group of lawyers were saying, no, you cannot do that. I don't think you can charge Donald Trump with a crime because he chose to listen to group A rather than group B.

Instead, and they send somebody like David Axelrod, at the architect of the Obama generation, to go out there and take the hatch to him to try to marginalize him -- again, it plays exactly into what he is talking about.

There is a long tradition of grassroots support, particularly more in the populist and more liberal-leaning bent in those Democratic caucuses.

To your point about the South Carolina primary, where Joe Biden can do, since that is likely the first primary, is start talking about those issues early, set the tone, and hope that carries into the general election.
