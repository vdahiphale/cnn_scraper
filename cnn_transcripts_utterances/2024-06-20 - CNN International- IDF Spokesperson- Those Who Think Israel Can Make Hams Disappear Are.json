First off is Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu comes under increasing pressure nine months into the war in Gaza. A rift between his office and the Israel Defense Forces is now spilling into public view. Since October, Netanyahu has promised absolute victory over Hamas, but on Wednesday, the Israeli military's chief spokesman warned anyone who thinks they can fully eliminate is wrong. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REAR ADMIRAL DANIEL HAGARI, ISRAEL DEFENSE FORCES (through translator):  Hamas is an idea. Those who think we can make Hamas disappear are wrong. I'm not talking about the alternatives. This is a decision of the political echelon and the IDF will implement. But the issue of -- the issue of eliminating Hamas is simply to throw dust to the eyes of the public. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Israel has controlled all checkpoints into Gaza for the last six weeks. CNN's Paula Hancocks joining me now from Jerusalem. So, Paula, let's first begin with this increasingly public rift between the IDF and the prime minister's office, how is that playing out in Israel?",

Certainly, if you look at the polls, the IDF does have the trust of the public for the most part.Now, what we have seen in recent weeks is more and more of a dialogue and public statements from IDF officials saying that there needs to be a political decision and the political strategy for the day after the war ends in Gaza. Now, we're seeing this more and more publicly now with the IDF spokesperson as well. But it's certainly been the feeling within the IDF that they can try and degrade the ability of Hamas. But there does have to be something which follows politically otherwise, Hamas can inevitably just fill the vacuum that is left. Now we have also heard a subtle changing in the determination not to destroy Hamas, which is what we certainly heard for the first several months of this war. But there now is a public talk of trying to destroy the political and the governance and the military capabilities of Hamas. So, it is changing. I think there is this realization that Hamas cannot be destroyed in full. But there is certainly more of a support for the military sided seems in fact right now, there is a protest outside the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's house calling for him to resign, as there has been for months, Erica.",

That the Pentagon says within that time they had about 6,000 metric tons of food and aid that was able to get in.

      "sentences": "Yeah, Erica. So, obviously, the tensions between Israel and Hezbollah have been ramping up significantly over the last several weeks, including last week when we saw the highest rate of cross-border fire between Israel and Hezbollah really since the beginning of the war. And so, all of this has raised fears among the U.S., among its allies that the Israelis and Hezbollah are or potentially getting ready to go to war.And what we're told is that that would be a potentially big problem, particularly for the Israeli air defense systems, that Iron Dome air defense system that has been so instrumental in protecting is Israeli skies from Hamas rockets and from Hezbollah rockets flying over the border. But that in an event of a full scale war in which has below would launch potentially tens of thousands of precision guided missiles at northern Israel, then that Iron Dome system, especially in the north, it could really fracture. And so this is what the us has been telling the Israelis that before Israel decides to make a move on southern Lebanon, on Hezbollah there, they need to really consider how this could escalate in a dramatic way, how this is not necessarily going to be a swift and quick and easy victory over Hezbollah there. But the Israelis are saying, look, we need to do something because Hezbollah continues to launch rockets and missiles over the border into northern Israel, where of thousands and thousands of Israelis have had to flee their homes since October 7. And so, they may feel the need to create a buffer zone between the Israeli and Lebanese border to push Hezbollah back, and they're willing to do so forceful -- forcibly if the U.S. is unable to come to some kind of diplomatic deal with Hezbollah here. So that is what the Americans are working on now, is trying to de- escalate situation, trying to come up with some kind of diplomatic arrangement, but we are told as the ceasefire seems further and further away, in Gaza, it is also increasingly unlikely that there's going to be a deal reach between Israel and Hezbollah for some kind of peace here, Erica.",

Thank you.Joining me now to discuss, CNN political and national security analyst and \"New York Times\" White House and national security correspondent, David Sanger. David, good to see you. Let's pick up where Natasha left off there if we could. First of all on this -- this effort by the U.S., and, of course, by the U.S. envoy to try to de-escalate the situation here, try to find some sort of a diplomatic solution, is that realistic at this point that that could and will happen? DAVID SANGER, CNN POLITICAL &amp; NATIONAL SECURITY ANALYST:  You know, we have had lots of efforts in that where we thought diplomacy was going to work at the president just a month-and-a-half ago, Erica, saying that he thought that a hostage deal was going to come together and course, it didn't. And now, there's, you know, another -- he gave a speech at the end of May with a proposal for Hamas. Hamas has come back accepting some parts, but rejecting most and that has dragged on. I don't think it's going to be any different in the West Bank with Hezbollah. In fact, Hezbollah sees a moment here to act because they know that a good deal of the Israeli attention and until recently, a good number of the forces were down south. So this has been the fear all along that this would spread and that if its spread to the West Bank and that's why it would spread to Iran.",

But think about this for a minute, on the one hand, Prime Minister Netanyahu is saying that they have to completely destroy Hamas and the Hamas leadership is in southern Gaza.On the other hand, they're moving forces understandably up to the north to deal with Hezbollah, and I think that is part of what's going on when you're hearing the Israeli military officials in these remarkable statements, basically saying that the prime minister doesn't understand the situation and that you never completely defeat a terror group. He's right. We came to that conclusion after 911 as well, right? We degraded al-Qaeda, but al Qaeda still exists. ISIS then came up. So, you know, on the face of it, the Israeli military has got this right. But Netanyahu does not want to hear it at the moment that his war cabinet has basically fractured and he had to dissolve it and he's very worried about whether or not the right-wing groups that have propped up as government are going to stay -- stay supporting, you know, his bare hold on power.",

So there's one drama underway there.Vietnam is about trying to stay competitive there because the U.S. has a pretty good relationship now with the Vietnamese government, but they still by Russian military goods and so, what -- they're one of the countries in Southeast Asia.

The national security adviser did an interview earlier this week with PBS, where he said that the new Biden administration policy, which was enacted just last month, that allows Ukraine to shoot over the border at Russian military, you know, effective goals.On the other side of the border in Russia, it does not just allow them to do that in Kharkiv and the northeast of the country, but it's expanding to anywhere along the border where the Ukrainians see that they need to be going after those kinds of targets that are on the other side of the border. That's significant because what it means is that this is not just a policy decision that lives in one part of the border as this war continues to spread. And, of course, expand and at different times in different places, but they're now allowing Ukrainians to do what they need in a greater number of areas along that border. Of course, this is something that's helpful for the Ukrainian military a they defend themselves.",

But I want you to note the trend line from February. Donald Trump was ahead by two in February again, no clear leader within the margin of error, but a four point movement towards Joe Biden. Of course, I was interested in whether or not it was just the Fox News poll that's showing movement towards the current president of the United States, and it turns out it's not. If you look at the aggregate, you do in fact see this small movement towards Biden over the last few months whereby he was down two in an aggregate back in February. And now, the race is tied.

Indeed, look here, only favored by five points to win the debate, Donald Trump is, over Joe Biden and that's not very different from what we saw four years ago heading in the first debate where Donald Trump was favored by a point maybe slightly more favorable for the former president, but not overly so.And of course, I'll note, Erica Hill, that the post debate polls last time found that Joe Biden overwhelmingly won that debate.

Of course, that process has already gotten started, starting with these binders that have all of the questions and potential topics that could come up. And then, of course, more importantly, the answers president could give on stage. And if 2020 is any indication, aides have told us that he tends to get very detailed and offering feedback on what exactly he wants to say in any -- any given scenario and question.And then as we get closer to debate night, we do expect that the Biden team is going to be doing these full run through his mock debates and 2020, you remember that it was the presidents lawyer, Bob Bauer, who played the role of Donald Trump. We're still waiting on board on whether he's going to be you repeating that role-play again this time around. But really, Erica, the broader strategy that the Biden campaign is going for is holding Trump accountable whenever the president can. So, drawing contrast on issues like reproductive rights, painting the former president as being a threat to democracy and the campaign is really hoping that at the end of the night, what the audience will see is former President Trump is being divisive and chaotic and President Biden being sort of the steadier and wiser alternative. Now, we are going to see the former chief of staff to the president, Ron Klain, sort of leading these debate prep sessions. But of course, members of his top team, everyone from the deputy chief staff, Bruce Reed, Jeff Zients, Anita Dunn, all of the names that you are familiar with. They're going to be joining him at Camp David.
