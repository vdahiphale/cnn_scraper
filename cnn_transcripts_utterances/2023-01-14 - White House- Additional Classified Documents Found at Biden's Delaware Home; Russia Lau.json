They've known about this and they turned it over to the FBI, and of course now we know that the Attorney General had gotten a recommendation days ago from the US Attorney Chicago, John Lausch who had been doing a review, and he recommended appointing a Special Counsel to investigate all of this. And you saw, Pamela, you saw the Attorney General do an unusual thing on Thursday when he appointed Bob Hur to do this investigation. He also gave a fulsome timeline, in part to make sure that the full story was out there. And of course now, the latest is today, the disclosure that they were another five documents that were found, and were turned over to the Justice Department. This is in addition to another document that they had talked about yesterday. So here we are, the total number is around 20 documents, and we know that 10 were initially found at the Penn Biden Center. The rest of them were found at the Wilmington home of the President, you know, just in the last few days. And so now, the question is, you know, are there additional documents? This is something that Bob Hur, the Special Counsel is going to want to know and how does the Biden White House, how does the President's lawyers reassure the FBI and the investigators that there is nothing more. We've heard from the President's personal attorney, by way of explaining why you've seen this shifting narrative and he says that the President's personal attorneys have attempted to balance the importance of public transparency where appropriate with the established norms and limitations necessary to protect the investigation's integrity. Of course, I should note that the Justice Department never told them not to disclose any of this. This is something that the White House has controlled.",

Now, you know, the question is, does this create more of a legal problem for the President? I have to say that, you know, when you do have these shifting disclosures, it does raise questions in the minds of investigators, is there something more that you're not telling us?

According to a GOP source I spoke to, concerns about his backstory became widely known in the summer of 2022 leading into the fall campaign season. I'm told that once Santos had a chance of winning his district, there was even more inside talk that his resume didn't add up. That talk became more vocal. There was alarm among consultants, donors, and other Republicans, and many believe the media would blow the lid on his inconsistencies, but that never happened other than a small publication in New York shining a spotlight on that before the election. \"The New York Times\" first reported details of what Republicans knew about Santos before the election. The freshman Congressman remains defiant pushing back on calls for his resignation. Ukraine says at least 12 people including one child were killed in a Russian missile strike on an apartment building in Dnipro, 64 others were injured in the attack.

Explosions could be heard from the city center in Kyiv before the air raid alert system actually went off.There was a second air raid alert that went off a few hours later, this one lasting some two-and-a-half hours. Many people in this city spent it deep underground inside the city's metro system. The Ukrainians say that about two-thirds of the incoming missiles were shot down by air defenses, but many of the ones that actually landed were aimed very clearly at energy infrastructure in five different regions. Officials say that the integrity of the system remains intact though the power deficit is now significant. And it wasn't just energy infrastructure that got hit, there was also an apartment block in Dnipro that by judging from the video, it is difficult to imagine how anyone could have possibly survived a strike like this one and yet there were survivors amongst the dead and wounded, survivors that were pulled out thanks to a frantic effort to rescue them. The Ukrainians also say that the type of missile that was used in this strike is normally used to try to sink ships. It was also used in an attack on a shopping mall in Kremenchuk last summer. The apparent target of that strike was a facility to repair military vehicles nearby, but this particular type of missile is not very accurate. Western analysts say it's accurate only within about a 500-meter radius -- Pam.",

So the reason that this is such a dire warning even though we may be seeing less rain than New Year's Eve and in the last couple of weeks, for example, is because the ground is already so saturated, so it's not going to take much for more flooding and potential mudslides to happen.

Well, the White House is condemning the latest Russian strikes in Ukraine, calling them \"brutal and barbaric.\" One missile struck an apartment building in Dnipro, killing at least 12.

What is your assessment of what's going on here? COL. CEDRIC LEIGHTON (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST:   So the biggest assessment here, Pamela, is that, we have this area right here in the east. This is Soledar, right here and then you look at what happened at Dnipro which is right in kind of in the center of the country, so these are the things that are going on right now. Let's move into the close up maps that shows Soledar and Bakhmut. These areas have become really part of what we're talking about right now, because the Russians have made them this way. What the Russians are doing is they're saying we need to capture something in order to have a victory - any victory at any cost. And so they are - their initial goal was Bakhmut, this city right here, but they couldn't get it very quickly. So what they wanted to do was they want to take Soledar and then encircle the Ukrainian troops in Bakhmut. The reason they want to get in this area is because they believe they need to control the rest of the Donetsk region and then - that would then give them control of all of this territory right here. We have to remember though that the Ukrainians pushed them back in this area during the summertime and during the early part of the fall.

That advisor is Dr. Paul Offit. He joins us now. Dr. Offit, thanks for coming on. So I want to first start out with just this confusion about the booster safety. What do you make of the CDC statement saying that after further investigation, this is basically a non-issue? DR. PAUL OFFIT, MEMBER, FDA VACCINE ADVISORY COMMITTEE:   I think that's right. So the question was there was an episode or episodes with - in the Vaccine Safety Datalink of strokes in people greater than 65 years of age. And the question is was that associated with the vaccine? There's a lot of reason to believe that wasn't true. First of all, it was the only database where that was found. There are a handful of other databases where that wasn't seen. So I think this really is just a coincidental association. I don't think the vaccine causes strokes in people over 65.",

ASHISH JHA, DIRECTOR, HARVARD GLOBAL HEALTH INSTITUTE:   The data that has emerged in the last three months with the new bivalent vaccine, it's really not a close call. This is why I've made it - I've recommended it to all my family and friends. It's what I recommended to Americans. The bivalent that we have right now that's available for free at 90,000 locations across the country that is clearly superior based on all the data we have than the original vaccine.

To answer the question, did you get a better neutralizing antibody response if you got that bivalent vaccine? And the answer in both of these studies, one out of Colombia, the other out of Harvard, was no.Now, the good news is that this bivalent vaccine is no worse than the monovalent vaccine.
