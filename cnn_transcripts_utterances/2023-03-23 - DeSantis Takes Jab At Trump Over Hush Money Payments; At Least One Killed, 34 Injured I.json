If you're just joining us, let me bring you up to date with our top stories this hour.In the coming hours, the CEO of TikTok will testify before a House committee that data of more than 150 million active users in the U.S. is secure. The hearing comes as the U.S. considers banning TikTok. Plus, a New York grand jury is expected to meet in the case of Donald Trump's alleged hush money payment to adult film star Stormy Daniels. Sources tell CNN prosecutors are considering calling more witnesses, and it's unlikely they'll hand down any indictments today. As legal problems continue mounting for Donald Trump, one of his top rivals for the 2024 Republican nomination is striking back at the former president. It's a notable change for Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, who until now has generally avoided criticizing Trump by name. CNN's Brian Todd has our report. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BRIAN TODD, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Florida's governor now taking stronger but still subtle swipes at Donald Trump. Ron DeSantis, in an interview with Piers Morgan for his talk show that streams on Fox Nation, had some fun with Trump's nicknames for him.",

Over in the Kyiv region, that was a drone strike. This was part of a barrage of drones that were launched at Ukraine overnight, Tuesday into Wednesday. Five of them evaded air defenses, and one of them hit this sort of training school, a professional training school with dormitory buildings. Nine people now confirmed dead there. President Zelenskyy, meanwhile, turned up on the eastern front line near Bakhmut, and he had this to say about those attacks.

There was a blackout around that because of the area and the sensitivities around the security there. But then he came here to Warsaw, and he's got a series of events today. Lots of cameras here, so that's no secret. He's coming to the wreath here at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. Then he goes to meet President Duda, where he will express, he says, his gratitude to the people of Poland. And it's a big message, really. He's talking about the protection that this country is offering to freedom, to the west, to the world in many ways. As you say, some would see it as a political message, but the family have very much got behind the Ukrainians throughout this since the beginning of the war. So it'd be interesting to see how he does that. He was playing table tennis yesterday, last night, when he arrived here in Warsaw. That was at an accommodation center. The other message he wants to get across is that 1.5 million Ukrainians have settled here. They continue to be supported by the Polish, full access to public services. Many have been taken into people's homes here, others are in these accommodation centers. He really wants to highlight the continued work that Poland is giving, really, to the Ukrainians. And in terms of freedom, really, that he says, is something that we all benefit from. So he's going to be reflecting that again today.",

(COMMERCIAL BREAK) [04:42:19] MACFARLANE: Frustration and anger over Lebanon's spiraling economy boiled over on Wednesday. Hundreds of protesters gathered outside parliament in Beirut, furious over the deteriorating economic and political situation. And security forces fired tear gas to clear the crowd. Customers are demanding banks release their withheld savings. And retired military personnel are livid over the dwindling value of their pension. Lebanon's national currency hit a record low on Tuesday. The crash taking place as the Central Bank's governor is under investigation in Lebanon and Europe for allegedly embezzling millions of dollars in public funds. Meantime, protesters in Israel plan to kick off what they call the Day of Shutdown. They've been rallying against a proposed judicial reform for weeks, saying it will derail Israel's democracy. The rallies will continue as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu prepares to fly to London today. His coalition is facing international pressure to find middle ground. On Wednesday, the White House urged Israeli leaders to find a compromise as soon as possible. Now, thousands of police have been mobilized across France today as that country braces for another nationwide strike. A new law aims to raise France's retirement age from 62 to 64 and has set off weeks of angry protests. One of the most visible signs of unrest is the tons of uncollected garbage on the streets of Paris. President Emmanuel Macron says he understands the public's frustration, but insists that raising the retirement age is necessary to preserve France's pension system. Well, CNN's Melissa Bell is standing by for us in Paris with the latest. And Melissa, Macron defiant here, standing firm. But a deal on the pension reform still has some way to go.

The seven MPs who were in there, they really seemed to be going after him on the detail of his argument. And his argument was, I didn't mislead Parliament intentionally or recklessly, because that's the accusation.He did accept that it misled them, but he said it was because his advisers had told him what to say. And he shared their understanding that these gatherings, these parties were the sort of following the guidelines of, you know, of COVID policy at the time. And he was questioning, he was -- well, OK, in that room, where were the mitigating circumstances that were called for in the guidance for a workplace? He said, well, you know, like partitions. He said where they were in the next room. And there was another point that was, I thought, very, very telling where it was another gathering and Boris Johnson's wife and his interior designer -- because his apartment was being redone at that time -- were both in the room. And the question from the MP was, well, if this is a workplace function and you're putting in these best mitigations that you can, because you've said that it's an old building, it's a small building, you know, we're doing the best we can, why at this gathering would you have your wife and an interior designer who are not connected to the running of the government? And really, I think when he was pressed on points like that, despite the fact he was assertive, despite the fact that he was at times defensive, I don't think he won that room.

He's deciding whether the facts that have been presented so far, both in his courtroom and in court filings, whether those facts are sufficient for him to rule in favor of either Dominion or Fox News without this case going to trial.Now, that is a very high bar. And the likelihood here is that this case will go to trial unless Fox and Dominion settle before then. And in a hearing on Wednesday morning, there were also questions about how a trial would proceed. Judge Davis actually said he could possibly compel Fox Corporation Chairman Rupert Murdoch to testify at any trial. And that's because, as Judge Davis put it, Rupert Murdoch has a special role at Fox Corporation. And he was aware of the guests appearing on Fox News's air. In fact, Rupert Murdoch even acknowledged in his deposition that he could have stopped Trump's legal team from appearing on the network's air. Fox News attorneys, though, were saying that any compelled appearance by Rupert Murdoch on the witness stand would just create an undue burden, also a media circus. And in response to that, the judge did say that he'd consider bringing in high profile witnesses via Zoom or some other teleconferencing platform. But the stakes in this case are very high. Dominion is demanding $1.6 billion in this defamation case, even though Fox News is saying that those numbers are inflated. But Dominion, at the core of this is arguing that since Fox News executives and its hosts knew that they were putting on guests who were promoting false election fraud theories, they say Fox should be held accountable here and liable for defamation. Fox, on the other hand, is arguing that they are fully protected under the First Amendment. So no matter which way you slice it, this is a high stakes case, and we'll see if it goes to trial.
