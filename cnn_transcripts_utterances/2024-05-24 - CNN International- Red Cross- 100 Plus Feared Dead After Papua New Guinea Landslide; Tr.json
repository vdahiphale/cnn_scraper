Chinese military officials say China is testing its ability to seize power and occupy key areas. Taiwan's defense ministry says 49 Chinese aircraft flew into Taiwan's air defense identification zone in the past 24 hours. The office of Taiwan's president says it is confident and capable of defending national security. U.S. officials tell CNN that CIA Director Bill Burns is heading to Europe in the coming days to try to revive the ceasefire in hostage negotiations between Israel and Hamas. This as aid groups have begun distributing more than 500 metric tons of supplies brought into Gaza across a floating pier. And a massive landslide in a remote region of northern Papua New Guinea. The Red Cross says more than 100 people are feared dead. According to the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, it hit around 3 a.m. local time in the dark of night in an area about 600 kilometers northwest of the capital port of Moresby. Joining us now, Serhan Aktoprak. He is chief of mission in Papua New Guinea for the International Organization for Migration. I think you're the only U.N. organization actually involved in this. What can you tell us about what happened?",

There is no power to continue the relief efforts. Only with the sunrise, the teams will be returning. IOM is additionally deploying further its personnel from the nearby provinces who will be joining the relief efforts from early on.
