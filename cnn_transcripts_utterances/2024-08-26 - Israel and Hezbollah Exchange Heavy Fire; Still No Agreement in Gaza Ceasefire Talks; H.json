      "sentences": "Hello and welcome to our viewers joining us here in the United States, around the world and streaming us on CNN Max. I'm Rosemary Church. Just ahead, pulling back from the brink after a flurry of attacks between Israel and Hezbollah, the threat of a wider war seems to have cooled for now.U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris is riding a wave of momentum coming out of the Democrats' convention as her campaign announces a record- breaking fundraising haul. And Donald Trump's team signals an aggressive new phase of the campaign, comparing it to Trump on steroids. Good to have you with us. And we begin in the Middle East where there is a tense calm following a heavy exchange of fire between Hezbollah and Israel. It appears the two sides want to avoid escalating the situation into a wider war after launching a barrage of strikes on Sunday. (VIDEO PLAYING) The IDF says it destroyed thousands of Hezbollah rocket launcher barrels across dozens of launch sites in Lebanon. Hezbollah's chief says its latest attack on Israel in retaliation for the killing of a top military commander is done, but more strikes are possible in the future. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is also vowing that this is not the end of the fighting. Meantime, another round of hostage and ceasefire talks in Egypt ended with no agreement. But a U.S. official says talks will continue in the coming days and negotiating teams will remain in Cairo to hopefully iron out the remaining issues. And for more, let's go to CNN's Paula Hancocks, who joins us live from Abu Dhabi. Good to see you, Paula. So what is the latest on this exchange of heavy fire between Israel and Hezbollah? PAULA HANCOCKS, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Well, Rosemary, what we saw on Sunday morning was really among the most significant strikes we've been seeing between Israel and Hezbollah since the increase in tensions last October. Now, what Israel has said it has done is it did prevent a more significant attack by Hezbollah. They say that they had intelligence that Hezbollah was in the process of preparing for this attack, so they carried out a preemptive attack saying that they used 100 fighter jets at least to take out certain military targets in southern Lebanon. Let's listen first to the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, PRIME MINISTER OF ISRAEL (through translation): The Israeli army destroyed thousands of short-range rockets, all of which were intended to harm our civilians and forces in the Galilee. Additionally, the Israeli army intercepted all of the drones that Hezbollah launched at a strategic target in central Israel. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Let's listen to what he said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) HASSAN NASRALLAH, HEZBOLLAH LEADER (through translation):  We will assess the outcome of the enemy's concealment of today's events. If the result is satisfactory and it achieves the intended goal, we will consider the response process to the assassination of Fuad Shukr complete.

This was just the latest episode, what we saw yesterday was just the latest episode in an increasingly fragile and increasingly tense region. That's where you have different actors literally dancing at the edge of a precipice. The actions of Israel and Hezbollah on Sunday, the rhetoric (ph) we have right now is literally a battle of narratives.Israel is claiming that they had reliable intel and they're talking about 1,000 -- they're two different stories -- one thousand. Others are saying 6,000 missiles that were going to attack Israel and attack civilian infrastructure. Ben Gurion Airport was mentioned. This seems quite far-fetched because everything we have seen from Hezbollah and Iran at this point is that they have avoided civilian infrastructure. They do not want to escalate into an all-out war. They have no interest in that because an all-out war will only cause a lot of damage for them. On the Hezbollah side, also they've been perpetuating a narrative that their operation was a success and that they managed to hit a number of bases and that it was not a preemptive strike. They had struck first. Honestly, I think time will tell what actually happened on Sunday morning. But what we do know is that the exchange of fire is over for now. Civilian infrastructure and civilian targets were avoided by both Hezbollah and Israel to a more limited extent. So this episode is over until the next escalation takes place. And we will continue seeing this escalation until a ceasefire takes place in Gaza and a more kind of region-wide de-escalation initiative is put in place.",

Many of us who are here remember the horror of living under Israeli bombs. So it's a very anxious country, people are leaving, cutting short their summer vacations and leaving. There's a lot of worry, but at the same time they're going on with their daily lives.So it's the sense that there is nothing that ordinary Lebanese are able to do about this and that the momentum and decision-making is happening elsewhere is also very frustrating for many, many Lebanese. But I can tell you, no one wants a war here. Everyone wants this to be over and done with. They want to see an end to the carnage in Gaza, but also an end to the conflict in Lebanon. More than 150,000 civilians still live in the areas that were being bombarded yesterday and far more than that. There are 100,000 Lebanese who have been displaced from the border areas and whose homes are now rubble, you know.

So at this point, look, it was always going to be a dead sprint, but I think even more so because the map looks different. Kamala Harris has changed this. She's tightened the race.

This is a deal which Hamas officials have said they agreed to in early July, and accused Israeli officials of presenting new conditions to try to undermine the progress of ceasefire talks.Now when its latest statement, Hamas officials have reiterated that they want to see guarantees that there will be a transition to a full and a permanent ceasefire, that those guarantees as far as indications suggest, right now, have not been it upheld or committed to rather by Israeli officials. We've heard from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in the past few weeks saying that while Israel might welcome a temporary pause in fighting, that first phase of the deal, of course, presenting a six-week pause in fighting. Israel wants to see a continuation of the war in order to eradicate Hamas's military capabilities. This despite the fact that the current U.S. assessment is that Hamas's military capability have so far been downgraded. Now, of course, there are also other key sticking points, namely surrounding the longer term presence of Israeli troops within the Gaza Strip. We know that Israel has presented a revised proposal which would see a reduced number of Israeli troops stationed along the Philadelphi corridor, a buffer zone separating Egypt from southern Gaza. But Hamas has in the past rejected any suggestion of a longer- term presence of Israeli troops in any sorts of post-war agreements. And they have reiterated the fact that they want to see a full withdrawal of Israeli forces from the Gaza Strip. Now, of course, these talks have been focused on the so-called bridging proposal put forward by the Biden administration in an attempt to narrow the gaps between Israel and Hamas, and while it appears as though there hasn't been a huge amount of progress in trying to narrow those gaps. So far, we know that working level conversations will continue over the coming days between mediators and representatives of both Israel and Hamas to try and hammer out those final details of the cease-fire agreement. But at this stage, there have been no major breakthroughs. We'll be watching to see whether we see any further negotiation talks being held between Hamas and Israeli delegations.

The results from two clinical trials were recently released, finding that after four weeks, women taking the medication were having about eight fewer hot flashes each day while women taking a placebo reported about four fewer a day and by 28 weeks, more than 80 percent of women taking the medication saw at least a 50 percent reduction in the frequency of their hot flashes, and women taken the drug reported that they're hot flashes were less intense and that they were sleeping better.Now, currently, hormone replacement therapy is safe and it's a commonly used to treatment approach for women in menopause. But Elinzanetant is being studied as another option for relief from hot flashes, and it does not involve hormones. So that's a big deal for women who may not be able to take hormone replacement therapy. Outside of medications though, other steps women can take to reduce their hot flashes symptoms are dressing and loose layers, avoiding alcohol, spicy foods, and caffeine, not smoking, maintaining a healthy weight and try meditation or other practices to help reduce your stress.

You see, this is a community that saw Evan grow up. He went to Princeton high school where he played soccer, won the statechampionship when he was a senior. So this is a community of people that have watched him grow up, followed his career. And when they found out that he had been taken going into custody and put into a Russian prison, they jumped right into action. They try to figure out what they could do as a community to support him. They partnered with \"The Wall Street Journal\" and held a series of events to keep Evan's name and his story and people's minds. They worried that as time went on, that somehow people would forget about Evan's story. So they've been holding these types of events. In fact, the event that was held here was originally scheduled to be another one of these awareness type of events, but when they learned the good news on August 1st, that Evan was coming home, they quickly pivoted and change it is into a welcoming party. They have gathered here the same place where they gathered as young students. This is where they gathered to celebrate their victories. They say they want to welcome him home and celebrate that he's finally free.",

And people here told me that it didn't surprise him, that it was just part of what Evan's character has always been and that they were not surprised to see him deal with such a difficult situation in that way.
