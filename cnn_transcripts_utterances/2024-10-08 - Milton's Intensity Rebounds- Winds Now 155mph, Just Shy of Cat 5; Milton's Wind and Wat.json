      "sentences": "We're back live in Treasure Island, Florida, a community that is set to be impacted, at the very least impacted, if not devastated, by Hurricane Milton. This hurricane that is now close to a Category 5 storm, flirting with Category 5 winds, is headed directly for this region, and there are so many complex issues at play. In large part, it has to do with recovery that's still ongoing from Hurricane Helene, which hit this area about two weeks ago.There are enormous piles of debris throughout this area, throughout the west coast of Florida, and now we're talking about a 15-foot storm surge potentially on top of that. We want to discuss with a local leader. Joining us now is Joe Ayoub. He's the mayor of Safety Harbor, Florida. Mayor, we're grateful that you joined us this afternoon. I understand that you actually evacuated, in part because you've seen what this storm can do. I wonder if your residents are also heeding the warnings.",

I live in Evacuation Zone C, so I'm following orders just like everyone else should be right now. This is a serious, catastrophic storm that's coming our way.We are expecting widespread power outages. We're expecting trees to come down. We're expecting utilities, maybe water, maybe sewer, to have issues. So we're asking residents, please don't take any chances. If you live in an evacuation zone or you live near the water, please evacuate now.",

      "sentences": "Yes, this storm could have huge implications. We get a lot of storm surge from Hurricane Helene. We're expecting greater storm surge up to 15 feet from Hurricane Milton.And that's no joke. If people were around for Hurricane Helene, you would have saw firsthand the damage and the flooding that it caused. I mean, it totally washed away our pier. It caused a lot of damage to our marina. I know people that live just a couple blocks from me whose houses were more or less destroyed by it. So this is not something to mess around with. This storm is coming directly at us. If it happens to come directly at us or a little north of us, that storm surge is going to whip that water right into Tampa Bay. It's going to create real big issues for us. And on top of it, people are going to be without power and possibly water in other utilities for a while. So there's really not a lot of sense in staying put at this point.",

SANCHEZOn that note about evacuating folks in this area of Treasure Island, all access is going to be cut off at 7 p.m. tonight. Just outside City Hall, there's been a bus that's been posted there. I was told that locally officials had until 4 p.m. to register to be evacuated. The last time I spoke with a bus driver who left a short while ago and appears to have come back, she said that no one had gotten on the bus. I talked to residents that were kind of on the fence about leaving. I am hoping that those residents will soon get on the bus and get out of here. Again, the Tampa Bay area has not seen a direct hit from a hurricane in something like 100 years. And I want to go to Isabel Rosales now, because Isabel, you're very familiar with this area and what it could mean to see a 15-foot storm surge come through. Tell us about that.",

So just across the bay, Hillsborough Bay is down that direction.And this is essentially a one-two punch, right? Helene came and left all of this debris. This is the biggest concern right here, because, sure, you have insulation, but you also have things like pieces of wood like this. And hurricane-force winds, these are flying projectiles, extremely dangerous. And, Boris, as you mentioned, you know, I lived and worked here for several years before coming into CNN. Milton appears to be the storm that they have been dreading here for decades, a direct, potentially, hit in the Tampa Bay area, something that hasn't happened in more than 100 years. They're worried about this. So what we've been seeing is workers that have been contracted out to essentially gut these areas and get rid of all of this debris. The governor issued an executive order opening up all the landfills to storm debris. I went over to the Florida Fairgrounds, a site I have never seen before for any storm, and that is mountains, mountains of storm debris like this being piled up. They need to get these away from the neighborhoods. They're so worried. But I will say this, Boris, people are taking it seriously. Here in Davis Island, it was eerily quiet. So many neighbors heeding that warning and leaving.",

Justices from both sides of the bench look like they were ready to side with the Biden administration on these guns that, you know, have the name of ghost guns because they're untraceable. They're not marked with serial numbers or registered and licensed the way most firearms are.And what the solicitor general was arguing was that, look, under new ATF requirements, these kinds of kits that essentially take, you know, could take only 20 minutes to put together after someone's gotten them online should be covered by 1968 firearms law. And the government was appealing a ruling from lower court judges that said that, no, these kits are not firearms. But listen to a -- let's listen to an interesting exchange between Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar, representing the Biden administration, and conservative Justice Samuel Alito, who's usually quite suspicious of gun regulation.

Well, this new report from the CDC shows that more than three in four high school students, 77 percent reported that they do frequently use social media several times in a day. And this is seen more among girls than boys.And this report also showed that about 30 percent of high school students, Brianna, said that they use social media more than once every hour. So we do see this frequent use. And this report highlights that this can come with some potential mental health impacts. Because the students who reported frequently using social media were more likely to also report experiencing bullying or experiencing a persistent feelings of sadness or hopelessness. On the other hand, though, among some teens, they were able to find community online, especially among some LGBTQ plus students. So having those positive connections online can have some protective effects when it comes to mental health, Brianna. So this does seem to be a nuanced conversation that's happening.",
