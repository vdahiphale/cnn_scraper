This massive campus, more than 40,000 students, no classes. And the police presence came in because the governor of California said it was really inexcusable what happened last night, that the security and the police were so far back. So and clearly, they also made a decision at some point that they were going to go in and move into this encampment. And for that, they needed a massive presence. They needed sheriffs. They needed LAPD to control the crowds and they need CHP to go in. It is a massive operation. There are, listen, I looked over the wall there just an hour ago, dozens and dozens of tents, hundreds of people still in that encampment, hundreds more out here. They need a massive force in order to make this work. And they need a lot of people to try and prevent this crowd getting too unruly.

So Ben, what is the latest on this new hostage and ceasefire deal and when might we know if Hamas accepts the terms or not? BEN WEDEMAN, CNN SR. INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, Rosemary, we're expecting Hamas' final decision on this Egyptian proposal to come within perhaps hours, maximum days. But the signals coming from both Israel and Hamas seem to be somewhat confusing. Osama Hamdan, who is a Hamas official close to the senior leadership, yesterday in an interview on Al-Manar television, affiliated with Hezbollah in Beirut, said that Hamas' attitude toward the Egyptian proposal as it stands now is, in his words, negative. It's not a final rejection of the Egyptian proposal, but it appears that Hamas still wants modifications to it before it agrees. From the Israeli side, the messages are very confusing. The Israelis have said they're considering this proposal. They seem to be positive. On the other hand, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said that the Rafah operation, Israel's offensive in the Rafah area where more than a million people have taken refuge, he says it's going to go ahead with or without a deal. But the deal, as is on the table at the moment, talks about a pause in hostilities. So if the prime minister is talking about hostilities, then he essentially is rejecting the deal. So the situation is confusing. And, of course, every day the death toll is rising, and the people of Gaza are desperate for some sort of pause in the fighting. But it appears that neither Hamas nor Israel is ready at this point to actually cease fire. Rosemary?",

I don't know how decisions are made these days. It takes it a long time. The Egyptians, the Qataris attested to that effect, that it takes too long, and no one knows who makes the exact decision and why it takes so long, obviously because some of them are hiding in tunnels.

And they think it's a game.They think they will pay with the deal and then Israel will resume military activities three, four weeks later. They're not happy with the assurances they're getting from Qatar, from Egypt, and indirectly from the Americans. I think this is part of what Secretary Blinken tried to relay to them, that the assurances are real. But there's another issue here, Rosemary. I don't know that Mr. Netanyahu wants that deal, because if the deal, as was reported, includes a lengthy and almost indefinite ceasefire, then the war ends with almost zero tangible achievements, and he is left with Israel in Gaza and the Gaza quagmire without any post-war Gaza plan.

Russian forces have used the delay to make the largest advance since the early months of the war.

Well, the latest now on our breaking news on the standoff at the University of California Los Angeles, there is a massive police presence on campus right now. And it is clear they will at some point be moving into an encampment of pro-Palestinian protesters after the gathering was declared unlawful.Now, exactly when that happens remains a mystery. Protesters have been chanting, we're not leaving. But some have actually left. It's after midnight local time at 12:31, to be exact. And the crowd has grown smaller. Prisoner buses from the sheriff's department are waiting nearby. We are hearing it's the California Highway Patrol that will actually begin to break up that encampment because it is a state agency and this is state land. Now, this situation is playing out just one night after fighting broke out between the pro-Palestinian demonstrators and counter-protesters. Now meanwhile, at Columbia University in New York, dramatic scenes played out as police officers moved into clear Hamilton Hall. That was Tuesday night, an academic building where demonstrators were barricaded. Journalists say they were blocked from entering the area and were unable to cover the arrests that night. But CNN has now obtained body cam footage showing the New York Police Department breached the hall and CNN's John Miller gives us a closer look at that. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JOHN MILLER, CNN CHIEF LAW ENFORCEMENT AND INTELLIGENCE ANALYST (voice-over): The retaking of Hamilton Hall by the NYPD. At the front door, students singing a protest song. The first layer, a tangle of barricades. Metal tables and chairs stacked and tied to the doorway outside. Police break a window. Through a vestibule, more furniture and debris. The door chained shut. Police use a high-powered electric saw. Then a hydraulic tool, the Jaws of Life, in an attempt to breach the door. But it wouldn't budge. Finally, they break through, confronted by another tangle, layers of furniture, chains and metal grating. Police said, unable to see beyond the barricades, they deployed distraction devices upon entry. With loud bangs and blinding flashes. To disorient anyone who might have posed a threat. It took six minutes and 40 seconds. To breach the layers of barricades, to reach the protesters who had been holding the building. As one protester appears to advance towards police, a second protester wrestles him to the ground. Police reach a stairwell. And advance upwards through the building. Finding more locks, chains, barricades, but no more protesters. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Now the Israeli military is responding to questions from CNN's Jeremy Diamond about that strike, as friends and family of the victims still mourn their loss. We want to warn you, some of the images in his report are graphic and difficult to watch.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JEREMY DIAMOND, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): This grainy home video is the closest Mona Audatallah will ever get to seeing her 10-year-old daughter. A stack of school certificates, a wardrobe of her favorite clothes, the perfume she used to wear. All that remains of the daughter Mona poured everything into. There is no Shahed now. Every time she came in she said, Mom, I would say my soul, my soul, my soul is gone. Shahed was one of 10 children killed when an Israeli airstrike hit the crowded street in the al-Maghazi refugee camp where she was playing with her friends. Her pink pants, impossible to miss, among the small bodies splayed around a foosball table in the chaotic aftermath. Two weeks later, the Israeli military still won't take responsibility for the strike that killed her. CNN provided the IDF with the coordinates and time of the attack based on metadata from two different phones in the immediate aftermath. The IDF said they did not have a record of that strike. They said they carried out a strike at a different time than described and that the collateral damage as described in the query is not known to the IDF. The IDF makes great efforts to mitigate harm to the civilian population from areas where strikes are being carried out. Evidence recovered and documented by CNN at the scene of the strike paints a very different picture of Israeli military responsibility. This circuit board and bits of shrapnel, walls and shop steps distinctively pockmarked and a small crater barely a foot wide, all pointing three munitions experts to the same conclusion. The carnage was likely caused by a precision-guided munition deployed by the Israeli military. CHRIS COBB-SMITH, WEAPONS EXPERT: I've seen these strikes so many times. There's a relatively small crater in the road. There's no large shrapnel holes or fragmentation holes that would have been which would have been caused by, say, a mortar round or an artillery round.

Seconds later, the missile hits the street below, landing in the middle of the road, just a few feet away from the foosball table where Shahed and her friends were playing that day, delivering certain death. Against all odds, these children have returned to play at the very same foosball table, including some of Shahed's friends. I miss her a lot, Sama says, wearing a necklace Shahed made her. She says she was nearly killed with her friend, going home moments before the strike to drink water. Others were not as lucky.
