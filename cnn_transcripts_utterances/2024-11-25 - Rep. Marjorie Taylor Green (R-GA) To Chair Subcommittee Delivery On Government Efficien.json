Well, the early sort of efforts to pin down what is going to be the focus have yielded quotes -- I'm paraphrasing -- such as \"It's everything.\" So I think there's a lot of conversation about everything being on the table.But one of the areas that we've heard a lot about is just the idea of compelling federal workers back to work because of the idea that would prompt a lot more efficiency. And then it's some other things like you're seeing Marjorie Taylor Greene talk about cutting off funding for basically major cities with Democratic populations and Democratic mayors who've adopted a more sympathetic approach toward undocumented migrants -- that sort of thing. So we'll see about that. Then it's like should entire parts of government be eliminated or merged. So that idea of kind of reorganizing government. Could there be a purge of federal civil service employees? Could some of this be contiguous? In other words, you try to force people back to work five days a week. They've gotten accustomed to working three days a week and they're like forget it, I'll just quit. So maybe some of that's out there or maybe between the labor unions and the real number of people who are actually on their way back to work anyway, it won't actually have that much impact, but there may be a lot of conversation and talking points around. But then I think it's also going to be things like are there USAID and diplomatic programs that are being targeted -- you know, countries outside of the United States that we've sought to use soft diplomacy for, and they're deemed a non-worthy project. Or is there going to be funding for public radio that's going to be eyed? These sort of things. So I think there is a real catch-all. And then the question is, like, well why has President-elect Trump tapped these people -- these particular people to be the face of this effort? You've got two billionaires who don't have to work in an office five days a week and actually are interested in making government -- money from the government --",

That's really not true.This Lebanon conflict is discreet from the conflict in Gaza. But the connector point, of course, is Iran. And the big question is how much effort is Iran going to put into supporting Hezbollah and continuing its fight -- this losing fight? Especially with the Trump administration coming in it's likely going to tighten the screws on Iran and give a lot more freedom of action, quite frankly, for Israel to strike into proxy groups that Iran is supporting. And so it's not directly connected. And the last thing. It's important to mention that Lebanon is an American ally.
