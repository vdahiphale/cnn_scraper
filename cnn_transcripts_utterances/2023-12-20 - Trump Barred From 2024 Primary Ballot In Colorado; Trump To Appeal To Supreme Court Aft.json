These actions constituted the court say overt, voluntary and direct participation in the insurrection.Now while Trump himself has not commented publicly on the matter, his campaign certainly has saying this, is a completely flawed decision and they plan to swiftly file an appeal and take this extraordinary case, all the way to the Supreme Court. Now it is important to note that this ban only affects the Colorado primary, but the political and legal fallout is far reaching. Let's lead off with CNN's Marshall Cohen in Washington, D.C.

      "sentences": "Well, the challengers who filed this case they are taking a well-earned victory lap and Donald Trump is bashing the courts and vowing to appeal. So, as you mentioned, this was a historic moment last night, when the Colorado Supreme Court ruled in a 4 to 3 decision that January 6th was an insurrection, Donald Trump engaged in the insurrection and that he is no longer eligible to hold office because of the 14th Amendment's ban on insurrectionists serving in our government.That is just a breathtaking level of accountability for January 6th, of course, though, it may not be the final word. You've already talked about the Supreme Court appeals. But let me read you a quote from the ruling which as of now is holding the day from the Colorado Supreme Court. They said quote, that President Trump's direct and express efforts over several months, exhorting his supporters to march to the Capitol, to prevent what he falsely characterized as an alleged fraud on the people of this country, were indisputably overt and voluntary. He took overt actions to support this insurrection, to engage in the insurrection, and that's why he's disqualified. So that's what the court said. Here's what the challengers said. This is Noah Bookbinder, he is from the legal advocacy group, CREW that filed this lawsuit, and now can claim that for the moment, they got Trump off the ballot. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) NOAH BOOKBINDER, PRESIDENT, CITIZENS FOR RESPONSIBILITY &amp; ETHICS IN WASHINGTON: In 2020, voters had a chance to decide if they wanted Donald Trump to be president. They decided that they didn't. And what happened after that was Donald Trump refused to accept that result and incited a violent insurrection to try to keep himself in power despite having lost. There's simply no reason to think that somehow, we can do it this way. And it'll come out differently. I am confident that other states will be looking at this but, but we're taking this one step at a time. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

This is not the first place where this type of litigation was pursued. It was previously filed and rejected in major cases in Michigan, Minnesota and others where Trump was kept on the ballot.

His lawyers argued were protected under the First Amendment and did not call for violence.

And this, of course, is a different type of case. But the reaction is very similar. Republicans are saying that judges should not make these decisions.

No one has voted in this race. But he has a commanding lead without a question and time is running out for his rivals to make their case.
