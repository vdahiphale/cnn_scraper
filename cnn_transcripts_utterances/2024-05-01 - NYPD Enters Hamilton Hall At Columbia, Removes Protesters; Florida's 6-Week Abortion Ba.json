The pro-Palestinian group using umbrellas, plywood, and barricades to try to hold the ground around the encampment. We have seen people throwing bottles, pallets, traffic cones -- even a scooter. Several fistfights have broken out. The mayor has now said that LAPD has arrived on the scene, but this did go on for several hours with no police in sight. Meanwhile, at Columbia University, the campus now clear of protesters late last night. The police were called to remove demonstrators from Hamilton Hall and the encampment outside.

Hagar, good morning to you. Thank you for being here. Clearly, the university was trying to avoid taking this step with the police. They had spent days negotiating with these protesters after they felt a previous call to the police had led to an escalation. They now have said in a statement that they believe that there were some outside activists in this group that took over Hamilton Hall -- that it was not just students. What is your understanding, and what have you been hearing and absorbing as you've been on campus? HAGAR CHEMALI, ADJUNCT ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR, COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY (via Webex by Cisco):  Well, thanks, Kasie. First of all, you make a very important point about the fact that the administration had been negotiating with the students for over a week and the view was that after the arrests that took place about 10 days ago -- two weeks ago -- and the backlash that ensued, the administration tried to take a different approach. So, again -- I mean, they were navigating, really, uncharted territory here and going this way and then going that way. And they negotiated really in good faith from what I saw as a faculty member. They were updating us multiple times a day. Not just every day -- multiple times a day we were getting emails from the administration talking about the progress that they were making with the students. That they were hopeful. That it was very clear, as a professor, that they were trying to do everything they could to avoid bringing the police back. But at the end of the day, they were not only -- they were not only breaking Columbia's rules by staying there but they were preventing kids from studying for their final exams. This is the week of studies -- of studying and finals, and it goes into next week as well. They were disrupting everyone at their dorms, in front of the library, and so on. And also, critically, they were encamped in an area that was there for graduation, and you wouldn't have been able to hold graduation with the encampment there even though this is a minority of students. Now, on the question about the outside agitators, Columbia has had this problem since the beginning where there have been outside agitators either invited onto campus by students or who have taken advantage of these young, impressionable minds. As it wore on, you saw Columbia tighten the security. But we already had one instance of students who were suspended for inviting speakers who were tied -- one of whom was tied to a U.S.- designated terrorist organization. And Columbia said you can't have them speak. They went ahead and did it anyway privately in their dorm room and then those students were suspended. So it doesn't surprise me that there might be some outside influence here.",

And Columbia did manage to avoid this kind of a scene -- I will say that -- which is interesting. Here you can see a protester throwing traffic cones. We know that they also threw scooters as well. And again, the L.A. mayor saying that the LAPD is on the way there.

These -- the professors -- and I have to say I'm in the minority. I believe I'm in the minority at Columbia. I don't think that -- or a silent majority. But I'm not in the -- certainly not a loud majority. At Barnard, the president, earlier this year, put a ban a lot of political speech and pro-Palestinian speech on campus. And so, for example, professors were barred from putting outside their office some kind of poster or statement that leaned one way or the other. And the reason for that is that they didn't want students -- these are -- these are offices that students are going to for office hours or questions, or meetings, and they didn't want students feeling intimidated because of one leaning or one view or the other. And frankly, I agree with that decision. It's one thing for a professor to speak out or to research something and write something that's thoughtful and publish something. And it's completely different for a professor to slap some kind of statement that's very sided on their office door when they are teaching a wide range of students. They -- it doesn't help keep the dialogue open or safe for most students. So that's the thing we're mostly upset about. I disagree with it, but it feels like I'm in the minority.",

And I've heard -- I've been hearing them make that reference numerous times that this is their Vietnam and that they're right -- they are on the right -- the right side of history.And I think it's important to let students explore that and have debate and freedom of expression. I don't want to come off as though students shouldn't protest on campus -- they should. And that's the beautiful thing about this country and about being at Columbia where this kind of expression is encouraged, if anything. But in my view, as somebody who works in foreign policy and history is a big part of that -- to me, Vietnam was completely different. You're talking about -- there was a conscription of American soldiers. You had soldiers abroad dying. And you had a U.S. government that was falsifying information to make the war more palatable to the public. This is a completely different situation. But I do think that the students -- they see that history -- the activism -- and I do think that for them it felt like this moment. But I don't believe it will land the same way. If -- in my view, if they really want to end the war, then they would be marching in Washington. And by all means, do it. I think that if they focused their message on ending the war on the catastrophic humanitarian situation in Gaza and the -- they'd find many allies in that. If they were to call for the hostages to be released, they'd find many allies in their -- in their cause. But the way they had a lot of language that was very violent, that incited violence -- calling for intifada and saying resist the colonial power by any means necessary. They had a lot of hateful language. I saw a lot of students sending me messages about keeping Zionists out and Zionists not allowed at social events and so on.

There was only one clinic. But in Florida, there's dozens of clinics. Tens of thousands of abortions there, until today, each year. And the switch -- I mean, there's no -- where are so many women who still are going to be seeking abortions -- where are they going to go? They're going to be driving, in some cases, five, 10, 14 hours to Virginia, maybe. They're going to have to go, like, really out of the entire southern region, which was the whole point for the anti- abortion movement. But also, you think back to two years ago, I remember talking with some activists -- anti-abortion activists about how kind of euphoric they were thinking about the fall of Roe.
