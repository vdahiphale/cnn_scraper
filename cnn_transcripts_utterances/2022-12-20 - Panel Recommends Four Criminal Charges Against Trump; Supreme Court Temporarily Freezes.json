Where for the first time in U.S. history a Congressional committee is recommending formal charges against a former president. In their final public meeting the House panel investigating the January 6th Capitol riot said all roads lead to Donald Trump.There are four charges, obstruction of an official proceeding, conspiracy to defraud the United States, conspiracy to make a false statement and aiding or assisting an insurrection. The panel also claims evidence of conspiracy to impede a federal officer and seditious conspiracy. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. ADAM SCHIFF (D-CA): The charges relating to the obstruction of a joint session, the interference with a joint session, the conspiracy to defraud the United States, those would be probably top of mind for the Justice Department. But they also need to look at the most serious charge, that is the incitement of insurrection, the aid and committing of people committing an act of rebellion or insurrection. That is, you know, certainly not a charge that's brought very often and never brought before against a former president but nonetheless the facts here are very much on point. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

It's a product of lengthy negotiations between top congressional Democrats and Republicans. Lawmakers have until Friday at midnight to approve the bill and get President Joe Biden to sign it. If they can't agree on a deal, federal funds for key government agencies and programs will expire.The Biden administration is preparing for the end of Title 42 despite the announcement that the Trump era immigration policy will stay in place for now. A Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts has temporarily blocked a lower court order that would have end the it on Wednesday. More than a dozen Republican led states have fought the White House to keep Title 42 intact. Now in the policy has allowed border officials to turn away tens of thousands of migrants to slow the spread of COVID-19. But while they're thankful for the respite, they're still preparing as if the policy will ultimately be lifted. We'll get to the growing humanitarian crisis at the border in just a moment. But first, CNN's Jessica Schneider reports from Washington on the Supreme Court decision. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) Jessica Schneider, CNN JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT: Chief Justice John Roberts stepping in to temporarily keep Title 42 in place. That's all because the full Supreme Court will decide whether these Republican- led states can actually mount their challenge against the controversial program. So, the bottom line is Title 42 likely will not end as was originally anticipated Tuesday into Wednesday at the strike of midnight. So, Title 42 it has been in place since early days of the pandemic in 2020. It allows officials to bypass the normal course and expeditiously expel migrants at U.S. borders. Now border states because of that were bracing for an influx of migrants when Title 42 expired, but now those states will likely have at least a few more days before that actually happens. So, here's how it will unfold. The Chief Justice is asking for more briefing from the Biden administration and the ACLU on this case by Tuesday at 5 p.m. And that means the court will likely decide pretty quickly about whether to officially let these Republican-led states step into this case and mount their fight to keep Title 42. That's something that has the lower courts have not allowed. Which is why we all thought that Title 42 would in fact end on Wednesday. But now the Supreme Court is essentially extending the time line. Now to be clear here, the decision does not mean that the court is siding with these Republican-led states on the merits, they're just doing it to procedurally to let everyone in this case have a little bit more time, effectively keeping title 42 in place likely a bit beyond and may be far beyond Wednesday.
