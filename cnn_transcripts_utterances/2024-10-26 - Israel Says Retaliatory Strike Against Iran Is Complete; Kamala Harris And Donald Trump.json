      "sentences": "Hello and welcome to all of our viewers watching us here in the United States and from all around the world. I'm Alex Marquardt live in Washington. Thank you so much for being with us.Israel has carried out a major, long awaited series of airstrikes against Iran. That is just part of what the skies over the Iranian capital Tehran looked and sounded like just a short time ago. You could see and hear what appeared to be those tracers and anti-aircraft fire. Now, Israel's military has announced that the strikes against Iran are over. Two sources telling CNN that there were three waves of strikes in retaliation for Iran's missile barrage against Israel on October 1st with some 180 ballistic missiles. As things stand right now, there is no word on possible damage in Iran or casualties. But Israel says that it struck military targets, including missile manufacturing facilities and surface-to-air missile arrays which we understand to be air defense systems. The U.S. asked Israeli officials to avoid strikes on Iran's nuclear or oil facilities for fear of escalating the conflict in the Middle East and furthermore affecting the global economy. Just moments ago, a senior U.S. administration official said this should be the end of this direct exchange of fire between Israel and Iran. Israel has made clear to the world that its response is now complete. It was extensive. It was targeted. It was precise. It was against military targets across Iran. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, they monitored the strikes from a command post along with other top Israeli officials. The IDF says that the strikes are a response to months of attacks by Iran and regional groups backed by them. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REAR ADM. DANIEL HAGARI, ISRAELI MILITARY SPOKESMAN: I can now confirm that we have concluded the Israeli response to Iran's attack against Israel. We conducted targeted and precise strikes on military targets in Iran, thwarting immediate threats to the state of Israel. The Israel Defense Forces has fulfilled its mission. If the regime in Iran were to make the mistake of beginning a new round of escalation, we will be obligated to respond. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And I think that was quite deliberate in the sense that I think what Netanyahu and the Israeli government were trying to do is send a message to the Iranian government to basically say this is a limited response to your earlier attack on us. Take the pain and back down.So in other words, the Israelis are trying to prevent a wider war. I don't think the Iranians want a wider war.

Yes, it's a humiliation. The fact that no Israeli aircraft were shot down, no missiles were intercepted, and the Israeli attack was very effective, but the Iranians would actually reap the whirlwind and lose much more if they decide to retaliate.",

And the sort of targets I've talked about, the nuclear facilities, the oil facilities, leadership, those are the targets that would be hit.But I think what Israel wants to do is finish the job in Gaza as quickly as possible, get the hostages released or rescue the hostages and at the same time suppress and defeat Hezbollah in southern Lebanon.

State media says that the Israeli attack caused what they called limited damage. The strikes come in response to an Iranian missile barrage launched against Israel back on October 1st. We do expect to learn more as the morning develops and Iranian officials get a clearer picture of the situation. Israeli officials, for their part, say that today's strikes were the culmination of weeks of deliberations, both internal as well as multiple rounds of consultations with U.S. officials. And now that Israel's retaliation is complete, the White House is calling for this to be the end of this cycle of fighting between Israel and Iran. I'm joined now by Arash Azizi.

It did not attack oil installations, did not cut Iranian electricity, did not attack the water, did not assassinate Iranian military or political officials or all the sort of scenarios that they had feared or that Israeli opposition politicians like Naftali Bennett had sort of asked the government to do. So I think Iranians, and I've spoken to several sort of sources in Tehran in the last few hours. I think they're mostly relieved. There are those who think Israel might escalate later on, but I think they're relieved. And I think the consensus is that they don't really want this. They don't want to broaden the conflict.

What it can do and it has done is to sort of do a very drawn out game of rising up these anti-Israel militias in the region, setting them against the countries in the region, setting them against Israel.And, you know, Israel's sort of continued wars has sometimes helped Iran to have some legitimacy in the eyes of, you know, some of the people in the region. But ultimately it's untenable. And I think the past few months have really shown that it's untenable. I think in the long run, Iran will need to rethink these policies. And I think that there are chances that this could happen. The problem is Ayatollah Khamenei and some of the others. I mean, he's not alone. But not everybody is like this. The problem is that they're revolutionaries built in the 1960s and 70s, and they have this long term goals that they believe they've dedicated their lives to. But their agenda is not supported by the Iranian people, who certainly don't want the war with Israel. They have no reason to want to go to war with Israel. I believe they're not also even supported by many in the Iranian establishment who believe this is very foolish and ruinous for Iran to get itself into a war with Israel, which would definitely also mean a war without the United States. Let's not forget that the United States, we can talk about its role. There's obviously presidential elections next week that will determine a lot of things. But there is no scenario in which there's an outright major war between Iran and Israel and the U.S. simply sits out. That's just not going to happen.

The two candidates held dueling rallies in Texas on Friday, and they're expected to do the same in Michigan, another battleground state, or rather that is a battleground state. Unlike Texas, they'll be holding those rallies on Saturday. On Friday, music superstar Beyonce headlined a campaign rally for Kamala Harris. That was in Houston. The singer came out onto the stage with her former Destiny's Child bandmate Kelly Rowland. Now, Beyonce didn't perform at the rally, but she did introduce Harris.

Now in addition to that, the organizers deployed a floor that meets up to the stage what you would expect during a concert, and I can tell you that there are multiple pens of spectators, and they're standing shoulder to shoulder, standing room only. Now, if you're wondering why Harris is in Texas when Texas is not a battleground state, you're probably thinking what most people in the United States are thinking. Why? Well, as Kamala Harris continues to create a contrast between what an America under a Harris administration would look like and an America under a Trump administration would look like when it comes to abortion rights, Texas is center stage. Texas is the biggest stage because Texas is one of the states with the strictest abortion bans. There is -- there are no exceptions for rape or incest in this state, and there's a very narrow exception for life of the mother. Now it's not just the star power that Harris has brought to Texas, it's also the stories of real women who have been impacted by the lack of abortion care in several states. In the United States, take a listen. KAMALA HARRIS, U.S. DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: The reality is, for every story we hear about, about the suffering because of a Trump abortion ban, there are so many stories we've never heard an untold number of women and the people who love them, who are silently suffering, women who are being made to feel as though they did something wrong, as though they are criminals, as though they are alone.

Its publisher said that the decision is consistent with its values and a return to the paper's roots. The Washington Post has made an endorsement in every election since the 1980s. A person with knowledge of the matter told CNN that the Post's editorial page staffers had already drafted an endorsement of Vice President Kamala Harris. But then the Post said that owner Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon, one of the richest men in the world, he made the decision not to endorse. Robert Kagan was an opinion editor. Excuse me. He was an opinion editor-at-large at the Washington Post and he said that he resigned over the move was. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ROBERT KAGAN, FORMER WASHINGTON POST EDITOR-AT-LARGE: A pretty easy decision. This is obviously an effort by Jeff Bezos to curry favor with Donald Trump in the anticipation of his possible victory. Trump has threatened to go after Bezos' business. Bezos runs one of the largest companies in America. They have tremendously intricate relations with the federal government. They depend on the federal government. And Trump has made it clear that he will attack media organizations that are critical of him. The Post has had no trouble endorsing presidential candidates up until now. And by the way, this argument that they're making, that somehow they want to become above it all on this thing. They've endorsed all kinds of candidates in this election season. They endorsed the Democratic nominee in Maryland. They've endorsed other Democratic nominees. So is it just only in the race that Donald Trump happens to be running in that they've decided not to endorse? It's absurd. (END VIDEO CLIP)",
