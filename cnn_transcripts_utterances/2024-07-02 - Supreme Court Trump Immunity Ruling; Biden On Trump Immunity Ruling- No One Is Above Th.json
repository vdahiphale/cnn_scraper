All the justices on the top row backed his immunity argument. Three of them Brett Kavanaugh, Neil Gorsuch and Amy Coney Barrett were appointed by Trump himself. That ruling deals a huge blow to the elections aversion case against Trump for the alleged crimes he committed while trying to reverse the 2020 election results.The case was not thrown out but won't be going to trial anytime soon. After the immunity decision, Trump's lawyers wasted no time filing a letter to challenge his conviction and the New York hush money trial is supposed to be sentenced next week.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) DONALD TRUMP (R) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Presidents have to be given total immunity. They have to be allowed to do their job. PAULA REID, CNN SENIOR LEGAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): The Supreme Court partially siding with former President Donald Trump in his ongoing January 6 case, ruling that former presidents are entitled to some immunity from prosecution for official actions, but not for private conduct. In the six-three opinion, Chief Justice John Roberts writing for the majority, at least with respect to the President's exercise of his core constitutional powers, this immunity must be absolute. The President enjoys no immunity for his unofficial acts, and not everything the President does is official. The President is not above the law. The High Court though leaving it up to lower courts to determine which actions are official and therefore immune. Roberts writing, other allegations such as those involving Trump's interactions with the Vice President, state officials and certain private parties and his comments to the general public present more difficult questions. Meaning District Court Judge Tanya Chutkan, who is overseeing Trump's January 6 case will need to decide whether Trump's pressure campaign to get Vice President Pence --",

The news comes amid a string of bad publicity for Boeing, which has recently faced a series of whistleblowers alleging safety issues at the company. There is no evidence Monday's incident had anything to do with a safety malfunction. Boeing announced it will buy back manufacturing partner, Spirit AeroSystems to help address its ongoing safety issues. This brings key production back under Boeing's control. The news comes as the company nears an agreement with the Justice Department to potentially avoid a criminal trial. The case is tied to fatal crashes involving its 737 Max, which killed 346 people. Under a proposed agreement, Boeing would plead guilty to criminal charges and reportedly pay a fine of around $240 million.The company would have to agree to safety improvements and government oversight as well, but the deal will reportedly not force Boeing to admit that production problems led to the crashes. Victims' families call the offer a \"sweetheart deal\" and they say a trial is the only way to hold Boeing accountable. Boeing has declined to comment and the Justice Department has not respond bonded to CNN's request for comment.

He was cut into a thousand pieces in a field in Ethiopia, far away from us, far away from our loved ones. I know parents who lost their children who will never see them walk. They'll never see them graduate, go to college. They'll never walk their children down the aisle. And we are talking and discussing a fraudulent charge; it doesn't make sense to me. There is no conceivable place or reasoning behind this. I think as an international kind of citizen, my only understanding could be maybe it is the fact that you know, Boeing bankrolls America. I don't know what it is, maybe because it is such a big contributor to the economy, they are less likely to charge them. Because it is ridiculous, had this been somebody who walked down the street and shot my dad in the head, there would have been charges. This would be murder.
