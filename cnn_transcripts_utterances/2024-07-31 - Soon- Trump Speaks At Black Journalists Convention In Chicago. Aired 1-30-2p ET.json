I have a lot of friends who are black journalist and I have talked with a ton of them over the last 24 hours.But I also found, in my conversations, texts, a few phone calls, that they also thought that it was important. I mean, here's someone who very well may become the next president again of the United States. And there are some very serious questions that black journalists, who do represent the interests of the black community, should be able to ask both leading candidates in terms of their policies and their politics and their philosophy and how that will have implications on the broader black community. That is their job as journalists. And the job is to take two task politicians and political leaders. And so my hope is that they will ask tough questions. And my hope is that the former president will answer those tough questions. Black people are not pusillanimous in nature. That is just not in our being in terms of who we are in this country. We went through a whole host of things. And so I think three strong black women can ask the former president some pretty darn tough questions.",

We're going to bring that to you live. Former President Trump expected just moments from now. We'll get in a quick break. Stay with us. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) [13:40:13] SANCHEZ: So we are closely watching Chicago this afternoon because former President Donald Trump is set to appear at a conference there, the National Association of Black Journalists. It's expected to be a Q&amp;A session, question-and-answer, with three journalists. At any moment, the former president is set to appear. We have a panel with us, Shermichael Singleton and Kate Bedingfield, as well as Sara Sidner, who is actually there at the conference. And, Sara, I want to go to you because you're there. You have a sense of the room. You've been speaking to journalists who are there. We know that the co-chair of this conference actually stepped down over Trump's appearance. So this is not without controversy. I'm wondering what sense you're getting from folks attending this year's conference about the former president being there.",

      "sentences": "(INAUDIBLE) involved the co-chair with the decision. But she stepped down for this and for other reasons.It is interesting to note that if there was a controversy and people did not want to show up, that is not the case. There are so many people here. It is a -- a packed house. There's -- there's not an open seat and there are still people waiting outside. And remember, this is not open to the public. This is for the National Association of Black Journalists. The people in this room are going to be coming to the convention anyway. And they are here and in full force to listen to this conversation. And it will be a conversation. This is not a speech. This is three journalists who are going to be asking him questions from different news organizations. And so you will have a robust conversation. The other thing that NABJ insisted upon is that there would be a fact- check in real time. No matter who showed up for this, if both candidates did, fine, it would still be the same way. And so there's going to be a real-time fact-check that is implemented here during this conversation as well. But people are interested in hearing what Donald Trump has to say. And he will be asked some tough questions from the black community. There -- there is a sense, for those who are upset, that Donald Trump is here, are concerned about giving him this particular platform. And part of that stems from some of the ways he has spoken to black journalists in the past, including our own brilliant, Abby Phillip. Where he has called journalists dumb, where he has said black journalists, in particular, called them stupid, in particular, pointedly, to specifically black journalists not using that same language for other journalists. And then you, of course, have, for all journalists, him using the saying, \"enemy of the people,\" when it comes to journalism and journalists, in particular. And so that is the consternation here. That is the concern about having him invited to this event. But I do want to point out that NABJ has been inviting presidential nominees to this event since 1976. It is what they do to try to encourage people to turn out and have these conversations. It is what journalists do. And so they felt very strongly, the head of the organization and others, felt very strongly that they have to put this opportunity out for the candidates who are leading, as far as in the polls, two to see what they have to say to the American public, but also to the black community. And so they felt like, if whoever said yes, they were going to accept it. And that's what most journalists would do in this case. And so we're going to have this robust conversation. There are at least a thousand people who have filled all of the seats here. And now we are at capacity. And, of course, there has been big security sweeps, considering what happened to Donald Trump in that attempted assassination. So everybody is locked down here for the next however long it takes for Donald Trump to take the stage -- guys?",

So I think, you know, while there was -- you know, my sense of it is there are, amongst the black community, as among many other constituencies, there's frustration with President Biden over the economy, in particular.I think that was part of what was driving some of that interest in Trump and also in third-party candidates. And I think what we've seen with Kamala Harris now moving to the top of the ticket is we're seeing a reset across -- across constituencies here in this race. So for one sort of proof point in support of that, I see the Trump campaign has now gone up, or is about to go up tomorrow with TV advertising in North Carolina, a place where they are now suddenly feeling a little bit on the defensive. I mean, if you want to know how -- where a campaign really feels strong versus where it feels weak, look at where they're spending money. So you see the Trump campaign now, in the wake of this reset that we've seen in the race, you see the Trump campaign now spending money in North Carolina, a place where the black vote is significant. I think there is, I think, a much bigger opportunity here for Kamala Harris to grow with black voters than there was with President Biden, who was such a known entity, sort of all of his favorables and unfavorables were baked in. That's not true with Vice President Harris. She has a lot of room to grow. So I think we're going to see a new race here in terms of competing for some of these key constituencies who are ultimately going to determine the outcome in November.",

If you talk to Democratic operatives, they'll say Donald Trump's safest place to be politically is just two hammer Kamala Harris as a San Francisco liberal, attack her on immigration.And yet, he cannot seem to shy away from taking shots that are obviously racially loaded. And I think I may be generous in my characteristic there. He won't say her name correctly. Just on Friday, he was saying he couldn't care less, even though he does seem to care. A lot of his supporters have been talking about, you know, DEI hire, which makes no sense and just seems to be a bit of a slur. So if he's questioned about those things and he just doubles down on it, I mean, how is that moment going to go before this audience?",

As well as Harrison Faulkner, who is a FOX News host. And Semaphore politics reporter, Kadia Goba, will be there. So three female journalists who will be questioning former President Trump. In the meantime, let's bring in CNN's Kristen Holmes, who is at Trump's next event, which is in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. It's not actually all that far from Butler, Pennsylvania. I know that's been getting a lot of notice there, Kristen. What is the strategy in Trump World for him as he's going into this in Chicago?",
