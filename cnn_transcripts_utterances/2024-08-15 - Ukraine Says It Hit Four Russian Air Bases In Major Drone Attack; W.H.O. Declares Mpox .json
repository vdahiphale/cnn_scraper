Ukrainian troops sweeping through A Russian village behind a U.S. supplied Max Pro armored vehicle. Kyiv soldiers taking down the Russian flag in another town, with Ukrainian TV reporting from the scene. Ukraine's Top general telling President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, the advance continues. Troops have advanced one to two kilometers in various directions, he says. And then adds, since the beginning of this day, we've taken captive about 100 enemy soldiers. The Ukrainians say they want to create a buffer zone in this part of Russia to stop Moscow's army from attacking Ukrainian territory in the future, but the blitz offensive is also a major morale boost for Ukraine. Commander fighting inside Russia tells CNN, catching the Russians off guard. They were shocked by such a rapid advance, he says. They were in tactical encounters and willingly surrendered to the defense forces, and then every warrior, every soldier who defends their homeland, probably had a dream of stepping onto Russian soil and destroying the enemy there. These feelings are impossible to forget. While the Russians claim they are stopping Ukraine's assault releasing this video of their jets dropping powerful glide bombs. Ukraine says it shot down a Russian war plane, and a security source says it launched the biggest drone attack on Russian air bases since the war began. Russian leader Vladimir Putin has vowed a crushing response to Ukraine's incursion, but even Kremlin control TV acknowledging that won't be so simple. UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator): Unfortunately, I must say that in some settlements, the enemy is holding their ground, and we will need to fight them out of there. That will not happen as fast and as easy as we want it to.

They've also moved some of them across from Kharkiv in the Belgorod region. And of course, they have them stationed in Crimea. They are suffering from a manpower shortage. Of course, the Ukrainians are suffering from a manpower shortage as well.So what this does is it complicates things for both sides, but the side that can move more quickly is the side that will definitely have the advantage. And at the moment, the Ukrainians have the morale, they have the esprit de corps, and did they have the movement, the quickness of movement, where they can actually gain some territory.

And that's going to, I think, challenge the Ukrainians and their ability to not only stay put, but also obviously challenge their ability to move forward, so they may have a bit of a tougher slog ahead, but they could still do some things that can cause damage to the Russian forces.And it really depends on the Russians ability to be innovative and to fight back.

But this is the first time in several weeks now that you will see all the key players in Doha, and that is to say the Mossad director, David Barnea, leading the Israeli delegation, sitting down with the head of the CIA, the Qatari Prime Minister, as well as the head of Egyptian intelligence. Hamas, for its part, says that it will not participate in these discussions. But there's a key caveat there, because they do say that they are willing to listen and to hear out the mediators after those negotiations happen. And frankly, that's different rhetoric, but it's not all that different from the way these negotiations have happened at key moments. They have been -- Hamas and Israel have never actually sat down together in the same room. It's the Egyptian and Qatari mediators who, after meeting with the Israeli officials, then go and pass along a message to Hamas. So it appears that we may see something quite similar unfold after that initial meeting between the Israeli delegation and the other heads of intelligence. Now the real question is how much progress can actually be made here. The Israeli prime minister, as we understand it, has given an expanded mandate to his delegation, but my sources tell me that they are still uncertain that that is going to be enough to bridge the gap with Hamas. What is clear, though, if progress can be made. There's real potential for lowering the temperature in this very volatile region. The U.S. Special Envoy Amos Hochstein, who was in Beirut on Wednesday, he made very clear that he sees an opportunity, not only to reach a cease fire in Gaza, but also saying that he believes that would then present a window of opportunity for a diplomatic solution between Israel and Hezbollah.

Prime Minister Srettha Thavisin has been removed from office after a court ruled that he violated the Constitution.And this is the latest court decision that brings even more political turbulence to the kingdom. The court says Srettha violated the Constitution when he appointed a former lawyer who had served time in prison. The lawyer also once represented the powerful Shinawatra family. This is the politically powerful family that founded Srettha's ruling Pheu Thai Party. Now, Srettha denied wrongdoing and said that the lawyer who has since resigned was properly vetted. Now, with Srettha now dismissed, the first deputy prime minister will step in as a caretaker prime minister and a new government must now be formed. The ruling coalition will nominate a new candidate for prime minister for parliament to vote on. So now the jostling and the horse trading begins. Now, the candidates include Paetongtarn Shinawatra, a leader of the party and daughter of the influential billionaire and former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra, as well as a former justice minister, interior minister, energy minister, and an influential former army chief who was involved in two coups. The process could take several weeks. The ruling comes just days after the court disbanded Thailand's most popular political party, the progressive Move Forward Party. Last year, Move Forward won a landslide victory as it drew huge support from across Thailand, especially among young people. But it was blocked from forming a government by lawmakers allied with the military. Its leaders are now banned from politics for 10 years. Both cases are raising concerns about political stability in Thailand. This is Southeast Asia's second biggest economy. And over the past two decades, multiple parties have been disbanded and governments overthrown in coups or court rulings, with the judiciary playing a key role in the relentless struggle for power in Thailand.

So Vangelis has also stored some of his most prized possession, some of the work he does for fun in this container. There's a secret lock inside. You can't open it. The metal is completely melted. And if you look inside, completely dark and the smell of smoke so evident. He just doesn't know the status of his work right now and he needs to bring someone in to cut this open. Many like Vangelis were not ensured. They now depend fully on the government assistance plan. Residents can get up to 10,000 euros in aid. Vangelis estimates 60,000 euros worth of damage, but that's not really what hurts.",

The Consumer Price index fell below 3 percent for the 12 months ending in July, a milestone not seen since march of 2021.Wednesday's report builds on another positive report from June, which has helped reassure the markets and the Federal Reserve that inflation is moderating. And this could all pave the way for the Fed to cut interest rates next month. Japan is marking an economic achievement of its own. The country's GDP grew by more than 3 percent in the second quarter according to government officials. Now it's the first time in two quarters that Japan has seen positive growth. Reuters initially cited a forecast of a little more than 2 percent for the same period. Public investment is 4.5 percent higher up from 1 percent decline in the first quarter. Tourists are capitalizing on the unpredictable nature of the Japanese yen right now. Japan's National Tourism Organization says more than 3 million people visited the country in June and is on pace to break its annual tourism record.
