You know, the just the sheer enormity of this, the scope of this earthquake is what's going to present some of the problems. You know, unlike Surfside where it was in a compressed couple acre site. Now we're talking about a large, widespread area. You know, back in 1999, I responded with search and rescue to Turkey and we experienced the same thing where you had access issues trying to get into these remote areas to perform the search and rescue.

And those divisions very much do still remain between these G20 members. But there was a question of whether despite those divisions, they would still be able to come up with a joint leader statement in the same way that they did at the G20 Summit last year. And we have just learned in the last hour or so that that joint statement has indeed been reached and it has been released. And -- and it makes -- it also addresses one of the most contentious issues between those G20 members, which is Russia's invasion of Ukraine. And on that issue, we do now have a statement which the National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan is calling consequential in terms of the language on the war in Ukraine. And he's also calling it a significant milestone for India's leadership at this G20. And a vote of confidence that the G20, despite its divisions can still address those hard issues.I want to read you a section of that statement addressing the war in Ukraine where the leaders say quote, \"In line with the U.N. Charter, all states must refrain from the threat or use of force to seek territorial acquisition against the territorial integrity and sovereignty or political independence of any state. The use or threat of use of nuclear weapons is inadmissible. We highlighted the human suffering and negative added impacts of the war in Ukraine with regard to global food and energy security supply chains, macro-financial stability, inflation, and growth. But then there's this key section. There were different views and assessments of the situation,\" which highlights the fact that Russia is nonetheless a member of the G20, as is China, which has refused to condemn Russia's invasion of Ukraine. And so those divisions still evident despite the fact that they were able to reach that statement. But as you mentioned, the President has been taking the opportunity to really try and present himself as a counterweight to Russia but in particular to China as it relates to the developing world, in particular, as well. And the President was asked just moments ago whether the absence of the Chinese President impacted the summit. He said, quote, \"It would have been nice to have him here. But no, the summit is going well.\" And the President certainly taking advantage of Xi's absence to highlight the U.S. presence and the fact that the U.S. is putting out a hand to the developing world.",

His job approval ratings just stands at 39 percent. And also this, a broad a 67 percent majority of democratic and Democratic-leaning voters say the party should nominate someone other than Biden, which is up from 54 percent in March.I mean, put this in perspective for us, how bad are these numbers, considering we are still 14 months out from the election?

They both are -- have high, you know, they have very low support in terms of people being happy with the jobs that they've done. But it still is surprising given all of the indictments, Amara, that President Biden's poll ratings are so low, and it's certainly something that the campaign isn't happy about or something that Democrats aren't happy about. They're pretty frustrated because of the fact that they feel as though the economy has been doing well in recent months and that it appears as though President Biden isn't receiving any of the benefits of that. With that being said, one thing that they're looking at, despite those bad polling numbers now is they're saying that the Democratic base has not engaged at this point in the race at the -- at the same level that the Republican base is. And also they're holding out hope that because of prior election cycles, because of what happened in 2022, and because of what we've even seen in some special elections in Ohio and in Wisconsin, with the Supreme Court, where abortion has been a really big galvanizing issue for Democrats.

So that is the next focus for them. But as we understand it from the European Cave Rescue Association, this rescue operation is being divided into seven segments that will be the focus for these teams and each segment will be overseen by a different rescue team and this really is a multinational effort. As you mentioned at least 180 rescuers on the ground including 32 in the cave. We're talking about rescuers from countries including Turkey, Hungary, Croatia, Bulgaria, Poland, and Italy. So there really has been an outpouring of support. It's unclear when that ascent will begin, but it is anticipated that it will take days. Victor. Amara.",

When she's asked about you're like, whoa, everybody well, you know, Serena is the greatest of all time, and went on to an amazing career as we know and retired last year.So at this stage, Coco Gauff is not Serena, because no one would be Serena at this point. This is the beginning really for her journey. She made one other final in a grand tour. This is her second. She's 19 years old. She needs to win a few of these. And I say that is someone who thinks she will. But she needs to start winning some Grand Slam tournaments. And again, she'd be the first to say that before this comparison, but it is absolutely correct, journalistically sound to say that she is the first teenager now at this position in over two decades since Serena Williams. And so I think that's where the comparison comes in. And also, the biggest part for me is being the role model. Serena and Venus Williams, Coco Gauff grew up watching them. And she said to herself, my goodness, if they can do this, I look like them. I can do this too. And that's the beauty of what's happening in tennis now. The diversity and inclusion that the sport has had for 60, 70 years. Now, again, bearing fruits with all of these wonderful players who are in other sports might not be in the country club sports might not necessarily be allowed or wanted.
