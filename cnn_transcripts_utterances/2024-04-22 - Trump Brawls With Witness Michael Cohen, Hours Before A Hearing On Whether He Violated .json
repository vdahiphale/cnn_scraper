      "sentences": "OUTFRONT nextOpening day of Trump's trial and it's getting ugly fast. Name-calling, insults-flying between Trump and what will be a star witness, Michael Cohen. This as the first witness as starting to testify. Will David Pecker help Trump's case? Plus, Russia's new \"It\" girl. State television now fawning over Marjorie Taylor Greene even though she tried but failed to sink American aid to Ukraine. Hear what they are saying tonight about, quote-unquote, Moscow Marjorie. And Melania Trump now selling more jewelry. Is it to help her husband pay his legal fees? Let's go OUTFRONT. And good evening. I'm Erin Burnett. And OUTFRONT tonight, we begin with Trump's trials spilling out of the courtroom on a day when the prosecution and defense laid out their cases for the first time to 12 jurors and the six alternates in the room. And it's on this momentous day, the former President Trump and his former fixer, Michael Cohen, are now in a free for all. Now, it did actually start in the courtroom. It was during opening statements, Trump was watching as his lawyers were tearing into the key witness. They said, quote, his entire financial livelihood depends on President Trump's destruction, referring to Cohen. So that was all in the courtroom. But then after court, when Trump walked out and he could speak to the public, he said this about Cohen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT &amp; 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Whether they're going to look at all the lies that Cohen did in the last trial. He brought lying in the last trial. So, he got caught lying, pure lying. (END VIDEO CLIP) BURNETT: Well, moments later, Cohen firing back. Hey, Von expletive in pants, your attacks of me stink of desperation. We are all hoping that you take the stand in your defense. This public spat between a key witness and the defendant is remarkable in a court and Trump, of course, is under a gag order, forbidden to speak about any witnesses in the trial. But this public brawl breaking out just hours before Trump is back in court, face-to-face with the judge, Juan Merchan, for hearing on gag order violations he faces fines and of course violations could ultimately put them in jail. So this is really serious stuff, and it comes as witnesses are already taking the stand. The prosecutors' first witness was actually Trump's longtime personal friend and the former chief of the \"National Enquirer\", David Pecker. He was on the stand today for a brief 40 minutes, and he will be on the stand tomorrow and its going to be much more extensive. We just barely started there. Pecker is at the center of the hush money payment to the adult film star Stormy Daniels at the heart of this case. Now, Trump will be there for all of that testimony as he is required to be every single day of this trial. Now, you know, we've heard him so many times complained before the court dates are keeping him off the campaign trail, that he has to be in the courtroom and is prevented from being in Iowa, or whoever, wherever it is, except for it has not been true until now. Now, he is required to be there and it comes as the stakes are rising. The national poll tonight showing Biden gaining steam in the national poll, and that has Trump concerned. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Opening statements are crucial, I mean, in some senses for many jurors, they'll say that's what made up their mind, right? Here at the beginning. And then that becomes confirmation on what they heard when the witnesses go. So this matters a lot. So, let's start with the prosecution. They go, first, prosecution lawyer goes for 46 minutes. So, I'm just going to pick one line, but it was 46 minutes. One operative line from the transcript, Donald Trump orchestrated a criminal scheme to corrupt the 2016 presidential election. Then he covered up that criminal conspiracy by lying in his New York business records over and over and over again. Did they do a good job?",

Most good lawyers will do with the prosecution did do on the defense, in some measure, which is under-promise and over-deliver.And I think what the prosecution's point of view was and they said it in terms of your theory of the case, conspiracy and a cover up. Now, conspiracy is not charged. That has legal significance. Conspiracy to more people engaging in illegal acts. But it kind of is, and here's why. What happens is, is that from the prosecutions' perspective, this was part of an enterprise orchestrated by Trump to interfere with the election. And how did they do that? They did that by virtue this payment that was indeed reimbursement says the prosecution and they had nothing to do with a retainer agreement and then they talk about the cover up, right? And so I think to the extent that they put that narrative out there, they being the prosecution, they did their job and wrapping up what they're going to show over and over, 34 four times again, as to these fraudulent business records and the intent and purpose which was to interfere with the election.",

And he said out loud in court, I did this at the direction of Donald Trump.

We're letting you know now, but you're going to see at the end of the case that you should credit his testimony in this courtroom. And what they missed out doing is saying to the jury, people don't plead guilty to things they didn't do. So, Michael Cohen is going to be believable. He took a three-year jail sentence for this alleged scheme. Trump is saying it's an alleged scheme. Michael Cohen was saying it happened.
