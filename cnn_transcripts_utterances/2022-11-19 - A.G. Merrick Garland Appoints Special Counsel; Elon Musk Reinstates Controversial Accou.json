That is how Attorney General Merrick Garland is describing the appointment of Jack Smith, a former war crimes prosecutor and registered Independent to be the special counsel to oversee two criminal probes involving former President Donald Trump, both the investigation into sensitive government documents found at Mar-a-Lago as well as Trump's actions surrounding the January 6th attack. Garland says the appointment was necessary now that Donald Trump is a 2024 presidential candidate and President Joe Biden says he also intends to run for reelection. Trump's lawyers had been dreading the prospect of a special counsel announcement and the former president quickly seized on the opportunity to publicly bash the move. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

That is not the case. We know that from watching the experience that Robert Mueller had. However that doesn't mean it's the wrong decision to appointment one, there are no hard rules or policies or laws that demand the appointment of a special counsel here. It's up to the attorney general. He's obviously taken a look at the situation and assessed that the obvious concerns of conflict of interest now that Trump is a candidate make it the most prudent thing to do to appoint a special counsel. I complete agree with his decision. But I hope that Mr. Smith is bringing some thick skin to the job.",

I think it could be a much broader investigation than people perceive. It's just not somebody who's been placed on the president to chase him -- or the former president but rather to look at the entire situation. Interference with the certification is very broad.

They could also be aware of all sorts of other things that are potential defenses or problems with that evidence we're not aware of. Clearly DOJ still has a decision to make. But based on what we know from what is already in the public record, this is a case that is far beyond, I would say far beyond the halfway point. And let's think about that as compared to the job that Special Counsel Mueller walked into when my colleagues and I pushed then acting attorney general Rod Rosenstein to appoint the special counsel. At that moment we were at the very beginning of a broad scope investigation into potential foreign influence. So Mueller was brought in and essentially told determine if this happen, and if so, should charges be brought. With respect to the Mar-a-Lago case we know what happened. We know a lot of what happened and we know that based on what we're aware of, there could very well be an indictment in this case.",

And that is indeed the record that Jack Smith will pick up and pursue. And I don't think it'll be very long until he makes a decision one way or the other.

And in this emails -- we received one of the sample emails that was being sent out -- in this email from Education Secretary Miguel Cardona, he talked about how those lawsuits are preventing them from actually implementing the program. He writes in that email notifying applicants of their approval, Cardona writes, quote \"Unfortunately a number of lawsuits have been filed challenging the program which have blocked our ability to discharge your debt at present. We believe strongly that the lawsuits are meritless and the Department of Justice has appealed on your behalf. Your application is complete and approved and we will discharge your approved debt if and when we prevail in court.\" But this program has now been in limbo for weeks as there have been lower court rulings that have blocked it from going into effect. Now, on Friday, the Biden administration asked the Supreme Court to allow the program to go into effect while these lower court challenges are playing out. This comes as so many millions of Americans remain in limbo. About 26 million people applied for this program and the Biden administration says that 16 million have been approved. But for the time being they can't give any of that relief to these applicants. Now also in addition to this, that pause on federal student loan payments, it's set to end on January 1st. This has been a pause that has been in place for over two years now due to the pandemic. And one question that the White House has started to face is whether they might consider extending that pause yet again. White House press secretary Karine Jean Pierre yesterday said they're considering all options, that there are millions of Americans who right now remain in limbo about the future of their student debt.",

Of course, the president and the first lady were there. The president walked the first lady down the aisle, escorted her. And the couple wrote their own vows. It was a relatively short ceremony, just under an hour or so again in the cold weather. And then, after the ceremony, the family -- the wedding party essentially, it was a very small wedding party, went to the White House, had a small luncheon and reception. Again, the guests went home, they had this sort of day-long break. Then they'll come back tonight to party. Here's the important stuff that people care about. Her dress was designed by Ralph Lauren, it's custom, it had a cathedral length train that flowed all the way down the aisle. And she looked lovely though I hear tonight the bride will be wearing other outfits for the party. So this is a multi-dress affair. But certainly something interesting for the president. Tomorrow he does turn 80 making him the only octogenarian president ever in history of America. We're told the first lady is going to host a brunch for him.

Like the World Cup, one country can decide to take beer away from the world. And at top, at these conventions, one country can gum up the works. Almost 200 countries have to agree on this language. We're not in the world agreeing on moving beyond fossil fuels. Countries are arguing for that as we speak. But it speaks to the enormity on the global scale but also of the problem at the national scale. That can make a huge difference.

Holmes was convicted in January on four counts of defrauding investors but found not guilty of defrauding patients. She had at one time been an icon in Silicon Valley for being a young female entrepreneur, starting the company, Theranos, and claiming her technology could use just a few drops of blood to conduct a variety of tests. But that technology didn't work. Prosecutors said, when faced with failure, she chose fraud. A separate trial earlier this year found Theranos' second in command, \"Sunny\" Balwani, guilty on 12 counts of fraud. Holmes has to turn herself in to custody next April. That may have something to do with the fact she's currently pregnant. Her pregnancy and her 1-year-old child with partner, Billy Evans, were brought up by some of her supporters when they wrote to the judge, stating how one must consider very young children growing up without their mother. There were more than 100 letters written in her support. Holmes had a chance to speak for herself on Friday before the judge read her sentence. She was emotional in telling the court, quote, \"The people I tried to get involved with Theranos were the people I loved and respected the most. I am devastated by my failings.\" Her team is expected to appeal her conviction and sentence. Back to you. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

First, Giannis, who struggled badly from the foul line in that loss earlier that evening attempted to practice foul shots after the game on Philadelphia's home court. Seems innocent. Harrell says he was trying to get a workout in and Giannis ignored him. So, Harrell took the ball. Yes. He took the ball. There it is right there. At that point, the two-time MVP of the league decides to try his luck on the other side of the court. One problem, an employee with a ladder was working on the court. So, yet another confrontation. Giannis decides to remove the ladder. For his part, the Milwaukee Bucks superstar called it an unfortunate event and said he was merely trying to push the ladder out of the way when it fell.
