Ant it may still be on the ground right now. It was about 10 minutes as the storm has moved 75 miles to the northeast. This is the area we are watching. This highlighted area here in orange, this is where most of the weather will be tonight. There will be more weather and there are likely going to be more tornadoes. The problem is it's 10:30, 10 o'clock there in the central time zone. People are sleeping. You need to get away from this storm. Many of these tornadoes that we've seen tonight are underground tornadoes. You need to get underground to survive them. That's how large they are, and they're still going on right now.

Thank you very much for that breaking news.Now, we want to turn to Gwyneth Paltrow taking the stand today, testifying in her own defense in a lawsuit that accuses her of skiing into a 76-year-old man on a beginner slope. He says he suffered broken ribs and a traumatic brain injury as a result, but Paltrow says it was his fault, not hers. So, there's a lot to discuss. Let's bring in our panel. We have our defense attorney, Joey Jackson, here, former Democratic Congressman Max Rose, psychotherapist Robi Ludwig, and former U.N. spokesperson Hagar Chemali. Also joining us is Stan Gale, who is a ski and snow sports safety consultant. So, Stan, I want to start with you because you've consulted on 200 ski collision cases, as I understand it. So how is this one that Gwyneth Paltrow was involved in? How's that? How's it stacking up for you? STAN GALE, ROCKY MOUNTAIN SKI AND SNOW SPORTS SAFETY CONSULTANT:  What do you mean by stacking up?",
