This is a White House event that felt like a campaign rally. Biden's biggest applause lines coming when he talked about Harris saying, \"She's going to make one hell of a president.\" And also when he attacked former President Donald Trump, his onetime rival for the White House, mocking his name, calling him Donald Dump and then saying, \"Let me tell you what our Project 2025 is, beat the hell out of them.\"",

      "sentences": "Yes, it certainly felt it had some campaign rally effects to it for sure, and interesting to watch this dynamic play out as we've seen Vice President Kamala Harris on the road for her own campaign, the center of the attention, the center of the stage, back to being vice president, serving under President Biden for his the remainder of his term.Again, this is the first time we're seeing them together since he exited the race. I want to go now to CNN's MJ Lee who is in Maryland, with more on how the White House is touting this as a winning message for Harris in her bid for president. And MJ, for President Biden's legacy as well.",

      "sentences": "Yes, I can definitely confirm what you guys were just saying about the vibes in this room being very much that of a campaign rally, even though it is an official White House event.Seeing on stage for the first time the retirement lame duck President Joe Biden alongside Vice President Kamala Harris, who is now, of course, the new Democratic nominee for president, and actually the single longest pause line of the entire event was when actually Vice President Harris introduced President Biden, and in turn, we of course, heard President Biden describing to the crowd his vice president as making one hell of a president someday. Now, the topic of this event, as you mentioned, very politically interesting, the idea of lowering the prices of prescription drugs. This is an idea that is, of course, quite popular, particularly important for the senior and elder community, a group that actually President Biden tends to do well with and I think this event gave us a pretty good preview of how the vice president is going to try to juggle the issue of the economy. She is the face of the Biden-Harris administration and its record, but at the same time, she is going to have to pick and choose specific policy prescriptions that will help her tell a compelling economic story and a message. And to that end, we of course, heard her today in her remarks, saying that people shouldn't have to choose whether to sort of ration out their medication, because medication is so expensive. We are going to see her continuing on that theme tomorrow with an event that is going to talk about a federal ban on price gouging that is aimed at lowering grocery prices. Of course, as we talked about so much, that is such a big part of the psychology for a lot of Americans, when they are thinking about whether the economy is doing better for them.",

We have CNN Political Director David Chalian with us, along with the folks that have been patiently waiting alongside us watching the speech. David, as Kamala Harris was introducing President Biden, she was effusive in her praise. There was about a minute long ovation of folks clapping for him. She said, few leaders have done more on so many issues. There was a thank you Joe chant, and then she said, I am eternally grateful, it is a great honor to introduce you an extraordinary human being, obviously being very deferential to the president. I am curious, though, how do you expect her campaign is going to use him moving forward as we get closer to election day?",

It's something that clearly does very well with voters, something that they're very proud of. And this was an event, as MJ was talking about, that they feel like sets the vice president up really well in her campaign, but also is good for President Biden's legacy, as David just noted, he was able to get something done they've been talking about for a long time.Do you see this as calls continue for her to have more policy to explain more about what she's going to do? Do you see them leaning more in to issues like this? This seems like something they really want to be talking about?",

      "sentences": "Yes, I do for two reasons. One, because it is a tangible -- it has a tangible impact in people's lives. You can explain it to people they'd understand. They say, OK, making this drug that I need less expensive, that helps me, that helps you know, as I'm -- my family's planning our family budget, that's important.So, having a really tangible accomplishment like that is a great thing to be able to talk about. But then secondly, it also sets up this broader narrative, which you heard her lean into in her introduction, and then also President Biden very much lean into in his remarks. It sets up this broader narrative where, you know, big special interests, big pharma is the foil, and it tells you who Kamala Harris is fighting on behalf of, she's fighting on behalf of you. She's fighting, you know, against the big moneyed special interests on your behalf. So, it helps sort of set this broader narrative that will be, I would imagine, will continue to be a really powerful one for her in the duration of this campaign. And it's also a great contrast for the Democrats in their messaging against Trump, because then, you know, they also get to say, look who Donald Trump's fighting for. He's fighting for billionaires. He's fighting for, you know, tax cuts for the richest people in this country. He's fighting for himself. He's not fighting for you. So, this issue, this insulin cap issue, is, you know, it's a terrific issue for both those reasons.",

      "sentences": "Yeah, well, one thing that I've heard from Harris allies is that they know that there are two policy places that Republicans will hit them on, that is immigration and that is the economy.And so, I think that's why you're going to see her tomorrow in North Carolina lay out how she views at least part of her economic policy going forward, we're going to hear her talking about price gouging. Now, this is something that President Biden has talked about while in office. It's something that he focused on, and say the union he's talked about since then, but it just did not resonate in the way that Harris allies are hoping that it resonates when she talks about it tomorrow. She's going to talk about rent stabilization. She's going to talk about other parts of the care economy. I'm sure we're going to hear her also talk about some lowering health care prices, the same thing we heard her say from today. But these are all things that are not necessarily very different than what President Biden has put in place in his last three years. But they're hoping that people hear it differently from her. They're hoping that they feel it or hear it, at least, more empathetically than we heard from President Biden. Because at the end of the day, they recognize that people don't necessarily know how the vice president would govern in office, and it's something that they are actively trying to combat by putting out positive, futuristic looking messages, not just to contrast former President Trump, although I think when you see her really staying on message, reading off the teleprompter, hoping to look presidential tomorrow versus what we saw for President Trump yesterday, that contrast will be visible they believe, but also just making a message that people can understand, that people can hear and try to see playing out in their own lives.",
