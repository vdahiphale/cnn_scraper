A pair of conflicting rulings from federal courts on Friday has now created what is arguably the most contentious flashpoint in the legal battle over abortion access since Roe versus Wade was overturned last summer. In one case, Texas judge -- a Texas judge said that the FDA's 2000 approval of Mifepristone, which is one of the drugs that is used to terminate a pregnancy, should be halted. In the second case, a judge in Washington ordered the federal government to keep the drug available in 17 liberal states -- Democratic-led states, we should note -- plus the District of Columbia. The rulings came down within an hour of each other and they have set up a legal showdown that is likely to reach the Supreme Court. The Health and Human Services Sec. Xavier Becerra says that the Biden administration is reviewing all of their options after that ruling from the Texas judge on Friday, which would effectively suspend the FDA's approval of that abortion pill.
