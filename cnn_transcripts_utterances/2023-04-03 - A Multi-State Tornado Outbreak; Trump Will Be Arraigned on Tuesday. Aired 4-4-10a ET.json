And we are standing directly in that path from this devastating tornado. I want you to see behind me, this is a home, that is a living room and that`s somebody`s piano. There`s no music being played there today. This house has been vacated. There have been injuries. Overnight, there were active search and recovery efforts taking place. We`ve walked around this area. The Wynne high school here in Arkansas, home to the Yellowjackets, their home football field was decimated by this tornado and I want you to see it from the air because you can notice the kind of indiscriminate nature of a tornado and how its path of destruction is very concentrated. It`s literally like peeling back the skin off of an orange, took the artificial turf and ripped it off of their home field. But on the other side of the football field, it was left untouched so were some homes. but the areas where it hit hardest of course completely devastated and we have seen just the true nature of how incredible Mother Nature can be. It is a scary morning as we get first light and get a idea of just how bad this tornado really was. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

The charges include more than 30 counts related to business fraud, but the specific details of the indictment have not been made public. This is the first time in U.S. history that a current or former president has been criminally charged. But did you know that Ulysses S. Grant was once arrested for speeding. That`s right, speeding on his horse-drawn carriage all the way back in 1872. Now, in response to the charges, the former president has maintained his innocence and claims that the charges are politically motivated. The unprecedented nature of bringing a former U.S. president in for criminal charges has activated a complex choreographed security effort in the city of New York. CNN`s Shimon Prokupecz is in Manhattan as the city prepares for Tuesday`s arraignment. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SHIMON PROKUPECZ, CNN SENIOR CRIME AND JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  With an unprecedented indictment comes immense security challenges. The NYPD, along with court officers U.S. marshals and the United States secret service are running through logistics of how Tuesday`s historic arraignment of the former president will go down. Law enforcement sources telling CNN officials are conducting a dry run of Trump`s movements including his motorcade route to the courthouse in downtown Manhattan where he is expected to be arraigned Tuesday afternoon. How he will get inside the courtroom flanked by Secret Service and what will the arrest process look like. Will he be treated like any other defendant? The former president expected to be fingerprinted and photographed for a mug shot. It`s a massive effort starting when Trump arrives by plane Monday, securing Trump Tower, the court and the motorcade route.",
