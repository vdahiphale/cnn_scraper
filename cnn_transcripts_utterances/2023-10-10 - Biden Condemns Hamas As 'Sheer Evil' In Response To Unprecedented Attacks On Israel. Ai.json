      "sentences": "I'm Boris Sanchez live in Washington DC. You're watching CNN News Central. Bone chilling. That's how a UN humanitarian envoy described the scale and speed of the violence in Israel and Gaza. US and Israeli officials are characterizing the terror attacks carried out by Hamas as ISIS levels of evil. One of those massacres was at a rural community or a kibbutz in southern Israel. The Israeli defense forces say they discovered women, children and elderly people who were quote butchered by Hamas fighters.Elsewhere, hour after hour, we're seeing Israeli airstrikes pounding Gaza and Hamas rockets streaking across the sky toward Israel. This is the backdrop as we await remarks from President Biden at the White House at any moments. Remarks that the entire world no doubt will be watching. Let's get started with CNN's Ben Wedemen, who's live for us in Jerusalem. Ben, what is the scene where you are?",

      "sentences": "Well, Jerusalem is relatively quiet, but certainly the area around Gaza and the Israeli cities just to the north of it have had a very noisy day at five o'clock in the afternoon. Local time. There was a massive barrage of rockets fired from Hamas in the to the city of Ashkelon. Now, a few hours before that, Abu Obaida, who's the spokesman for Hamas's military wing, had warned that Ashkelon would be targeted if its residents did not leave the city. And sure enough, on the dot at five p.m. local time, we saw this massive volley being fired out of Gaza.At the same time, Israeli forces struck the main port in Gaza, in fact, the only port in Gaza, which is normally only used by fishermen. And this is just the latest series of strikes and counterstrikes we've seen today. The Israelis, since last night, have conducted hundreds of airstrikes on Gaza in one particular neighborhood, Ariel, which is in Gaza City, really reduced to rubble. Now, the death toll on the Palestinian side, the latest numbers we're getting are 830. Those numbers from the Palestinian Health Ministry, more than 4,000 wounded. And of course, on the Israeli side, the latest tally they have of the dead, and it seems to be increasing as they find more and more bodies, is at least 900. Now, the Israeli embassy in Washington was reporting more than 1,000. The Israeli military has yet to confirm that number, but certainly the numbers on both sides are rising. And there is growing anticipation of an Israeli ground incursion into Gaza. There have been many in the past, but this one, many believe, will be certainly greater than ever before. And we did hear Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu yesterday say that what we've seen so far is only the beginning in terms of Israel's response to Saturday's massive surprise attack by Hamas.

Islamic Jihad says they have as many as 30 being held captive now, for a fourth day in Gaza, the families of the missing are living in unimaginable agony. My next guest included; I'm joined by Gaya Kalderon.Five members of her family are missing right now. Her brother, her sister, her father, her grandmother, and her cousin. Gaya, thank you for being here. I am so sorry for what you are going through. Tell us about your family members, what happened to them.

I wake up six in the morning and just calling my mom and dad to check that it's all good in Niz Oz. My whole family live in Eroz. I'm the only one who not live there. So, my father talked to me and said, Gaya, it's never been like that. I don't know what is happening. And then I'm like, okay, it's all good. Like it's always happened. It's going to be okay. After a few minutes, my sister write me, Gaya, I can hear shooting guns. I think they are here. I can hear them. And I'm like, what?What is going on? Tell me and try to understand. And then she's writing me, they are here. And I'm asking her, where are you? Are you in the Mammad? In the safe place? And she's telling me, no, we are outside and hiding.

There were civilians in Gaza that were trying, or rather were told to evacuate a certain crossing and this Rafah crossing right here. And it's been complicated, partly because it was targeted. Obviously, you mentioned some of the complications regarding a ground operation. What about the fact that Hamas is holding some 100 to 150 hostages, potentially some American citizens? How does all of that, the difficulty of getting civilians out and the fact that there are hostages in Gaza alter the calculus for the Israeli defense forces?",

But those capabilities will be there, and we'll be monitoring all the electronic and visual intelligence we've got. We'll be looking for other people talking and communicating, people on the ground. We'll do everything we can to locate them. But you know, it's in Hamas interest not to execute those hostages. They need those hostages as bargaining leverage at the end. So, you're gonna hear a lot of threats. You may have some out-of-control people who do want to kill the hostages, but my bet would be that the Hamas leadership will not want to give up those hostages.",

I do wanna share with you some new satellite images we have of the Erez Crossing Complex. So essentially what we're looking at, this right here is Gaza, and this is Israel. This is part of the border and on it, you can see craters in some areas where Israel launched retaliatory strikes. What really stands out to me are breaches in the border wall where Hamas broke through and you can see them in these circles I'm drawing. This is where Hamas militants were able to get into Israel. It's striking partly because of the scale, General, of the attack. They executed an attack unprecedented in the history of Hamas without Israeli intelligence having a clue that this was going to happen. How is that possible?",

If you do that, you can maintain security. But you know, Hamas has been there for a long time. We cannot underestimate their sophistication. It's a mistake to think that they're just terrorists out there waving AK-47s. This is a sophisticated military force. It's had training, it's had assistance from the Iranians, maybe some Russian equipment in there for all we know. They can monitor communications. They have cyber, they have anti-aircraft missiles, they have anti-tank missiles. They've got a lot of stuff buried underground. They prepared this for a long time. So, I think, you know, we have to anticipate this is not like going when the United States Army raced through Baghdad in 2003, shattered the Iraqi guards and the people in Iraq were like, hey, well, some of us liked him, some of us didn't. Let's see what happens now. That's not what this is.This is a fortress area that's been prepared. Now, how many Hamas fighters are there? 15,000, 20,000. We saw maybe 2,000 committed in this operation. So, they've got lots of forces left behind and ready and no doubt willing to sacrifice their lives to take Israelis with them. So, this is gonna be a tough fight. And at the same time, of course, we've got the northern border to worry about. The president's talking about maybe sending another carrier battle group in. And don't forget, the North Koreans are now shipping artillery and ammunition by rail to the Russians to put the pressure on Ukraine. We can never neglect that because that fight in Ukraine is very much in America's interest. They're fighting our battle there against Russian aggression.",
