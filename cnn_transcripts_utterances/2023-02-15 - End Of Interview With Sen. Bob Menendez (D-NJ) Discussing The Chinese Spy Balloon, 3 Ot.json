There were concerns that they were issues with some of the key witnesses here, including the congressman's long-time friend and wing man, Joel Greenberg, who's currently in a federal prison after pleading guilty to several felonies. There were other witnesses that they were concerned about credibility problems or were reluctant to cooperate. There were also concerns that many of the key people involved in these alleged events were intoxicated with drugs or alcohol during key moments in the timeline. So there are concerns they may not be able to prove these charges beyond a reasonable doubt. There is also a reluctance at the Justice Department to pursue an obstruction case without the underlying crime. So based on all these concerns, the leadership of the Justice Department heeded this recommendation and decided not the proceed with any charges here.",

This is one of the most aggressive steps we've seen from special counsel, Jack Smith.There have been three attorneys representing President Trump who have gone before the special counsel grand jury. And one of them, Evan Corcoran, when he went in, he was asked about events leading up to the eventual FBI search of the former president's Mar-a-Lago home, and in several of those incidences, he invoked the attorney/client privilege, which is his right, which is what an attorney is expected to do. But now prosecutors are trying to convince the court to apply one of the few exceptions to attorney/client privilege so he can answer some of these questions. And they are telling the court in writing that they believe that the former president may have engaged in criminal activity with the help of his lawyer or with his lawyer's advice. So they were asking the court to apply that exception so they can go back and get more information from this attorney.",

Let's start with this exception, the crime fraud exception to attorney client privilege. Explain what it is and how rare it is for an application to invoke it. HARRY LITMAN, FORMER U.S. ATTORNEY: It's not completely rare, Victor, to try to invoke it, but it's fairly rare. And of course, this is Trump, so it shows treating him like any other defendant. The big point though is it's Trump's words they want. Corcoran fills out that form that said we did a diligent search, turns to the junior attorney, Christina Bobb, and said, sign right here, which she does with a little notation. They bring him into the grand jury. And because it has to be attorney/client communications, they ask him -- his client here is Trump -- did you and Trump talk about this? What did Trump tell you? Attorney/client communication. OK, fine. See you in court. So what they're saying is we believe that we need Trump's statements because those will be -- we have thresholds showing good enough, not criminal, that what he said is evidence of a crime. What would the crime be? Obstruction of justice by not complying with this subpoena. So the big point here it's Trump's words they want, and Smith is treating him like any other defendant.",

You know, as I said, this is a blue-collar blueprint to rebuild America. I want to be clear with all of you. We're not just buying American for this thing. For every project we have, every project we're installing, it's going to buy America. There's a law passed in 1933. Most presidents, Democrats and Republicans, didn't pay much attention to it. It said, if the president is spending taxpayers' dollars hiring somebody to do something, whether putting a deck on an aircraft carrier or on a railing in a public building, every federal project is supposed to be built by American workers. Everyone. Using American products, creating American jobs. Well, guess what?

And the possibility of a debt default, the first ever in U.S. history, if the debt ceiling is not raised.This is a new estimate by the Congressional Budget Office saying if the debt ceiling is not raised by the summer, there could be a default in July as late as September. That's the estimate right now. July through September, that's the new timeframe they are now looking at. That could potentially slip depending on when, how the U.S. fiscal outlook looks after-tax season as well as any other major expenses come from the federal government that changes its projections. But that is the key moment here. Right now, there is no agreement between how House Republicans and the White House will move on this going forward. Joe Biden and Senate Democrats have made clear they want the debt ceiling raised without any conditions whatsoever. They have told the speaker that just to simply be done on a clean basis. No conditions. That is unacceptable to McCarthy and the House Republicans. Even the most moderate Republicans are in line with McCarthy's strategy, which is to negotiate with the White House, to add an array of spending cuts. They have not yet detailed what cuts they want. They are talking to their own members to come up with a plan to lay out exactly what level of spending cuts they want. But they want far more than the White House on this issue. So they'll have to figure out some sort of resolution here over the next several weeks to get a deal between the House Republicans and the White House, something that could get 60 votes in the Senate. Otherwise, they're facing the prospects of the first set of defaults as soon as July.",
