This hour, the age factor in the 2024 race, what 77-year-old Donald Trump has to say about his main opponent, President Joe Biden, who is 81 years old. Plus, President Biden's wide ranging interview with Time magazine hot off the presses. What did he say about the war in Gaza?What did he say about Donald Trump? What about voter concerns about his age? And leading this hour, breaking news, Donald Trump's attorneys are asking the judge in his hush money cover up case to terminate the gag order against the former president now that the trial is over. CNN's Kara Scannell joins us live. Kara, what arguments are Trump's attorneys making to the judge?",

They're saying that now that the trial is over, the judge should lift this gag order because that was the reason for -- to be in place is no longer happening. What they wrote in the letter is, \"Now that the trial is concluded, the concerns articulated by the government and the court do not justify continued restrictions on the First Amendment rights of President Trump, who remains the leading candidate in the 2024 presidential election and the American people.\" They're saying that there's even a stronger reason now to lift it because several of these witnesses in the case, Michael Cohen, Stormy Daniels, who made comments on it, President Joe Biden himself has commented on the verdict. And he cite -- they cite in their letter, even the upcoming presidential debate that you will be moderating is another reason why this gag order should be lifted. So, they sent this letter to the judge yesterday. It just became publicly available. And we're waiting for the judge's response on this. Now, previously, a spokesman for the court has said that the order speaks for itself and the language in the order does say it would continue to be in place through the proceedings. Exactly when those proceedings are deemed to have end is the question here which Trump's team is clearly seeking some clarification on.You know, Trump has violated this gag order ten times. The judge fining him in criminal contempt and fining him $10,000. So, certainly a concern by Trump's team that they want to lift this gag order so he doesn't potentially run afoul of violating it again now that the campaign is back in full swing, Jake.",

Times Massimo Calabresi asking Biden if he is concerned that the large majority of Americans think he is too old. Biden says, \"I can do it better than anyone you know. You're looking at me, I can take you, too.\" Question, \"Did you consider not running again because of your age?\" Biden, \"No, I didn't.\" Question, \"And what do you say to Americans who are worried about it?\" Biden, \"Watch me.\" Calabresi pushed Biden on whether the greatest threat to America's national security comes from, not abroad, but from within in U.S. politics. To which Biden responded, quote, \"I think it has a significantly diminishing impact on our ability to get things done internationally. There's not a major international meeting I attend that before it's over, that a world leader doesn't pull me aside as I'm leaving and say, he can't win. You can't let him win,\" referring to Trump there. And then there's this, President Biden acknowledging there is meddling happening in our upcoming November elections. Times Calabresi asking if there is any evidence that China is behind meddling. Biden responded, quote, \"There is evidence that meddling is going on. I'm not going to get into, I don't think I should from an intelligence standpoint.\" All of this comes after a lengthy portion of the interview centered around Biden's foreign policy and the growing crisis between Israel and Gaza. President Biden refusing to say if Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu crossed his red line in Rafah. But Biden declared a cease fire is necessary and is holding firm in what he sees as a solution. Biden saying, quote, \"There needs to be a two state solution, a transition to a two state solution,\" unquote, which we should say Netanyahu opposes. With me now is the journalist who conducted this exclusive interview with President Biden, Times Massimo Calabresi. Thanks so much for joining us again. We had you here for the Trump one. Now you're here for the Biden one. First of all, did he, like, threaten to take you on? Did I read that? Quite, did he say -- did he?",

China is an adversary the likes of which this country has never seen.They have two very, very different approaches to how to handle that.

But in the meantime, like no one's happy when they look at the southern border and feels like it's going well. So, it's not perfect but I am supportive of the action that he took today. And anything we can do to actually as a nation of immigrants deal with the immigration problem, we want people to come here in a legal and vetted way from their home countries, but not walking over the border like this, giving our customs and border folks the responsibility to decide who gets in and who doesn't, it's just -- it just no one thinks that it's going well.

It's dangerous that President Trump is going around saying the whole trial was rigged. But I think for the most part, his sort of anti- Trump message that we heard at this fundraiser last night was more or less the same as what he has been saying over the last few months. I think the point is really more that, you know, Donald Trump is somebody that he sees as being anti-democratic, you know, dangerous when it comes to democratic institutions.
