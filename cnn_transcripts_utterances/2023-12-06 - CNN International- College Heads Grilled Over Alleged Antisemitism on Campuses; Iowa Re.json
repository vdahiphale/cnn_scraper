If you're just joining us, let me bring you up to date with our top stories this hour.U.S. President Joe Biden is attempting to walk back remarks made about his 2024 presidential bid after telling a group of donors that he wasn't sure he'd be running if Trump wasn't in the race. When pressed on the comments, Biden said he would stay on even if Trump dropped out. And tonight is debate night for four Republican candidates and notably missing will be the front runner, Donald Trump. He attended a town hall on Tuesday where he criticized Biden's physical and mental aptitude and sidestepped questions about abusing his powers if he were reelected. Nearly two months after the start of the Israel Hamas war, the U.S. House of Representatives passed a Republican led resolution on Tuesday condemning antisemitism. The vote was 311 to 14, a number of Democrats, however, expressed concern over the language of the resolution. They claim it would effectively define any criticism of the Israeli government as anti-Semitism. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. JERRY NADLER (D-NY): Unfortunately, this resolution does absolutely nothing to genuinely counter the scourge of antisemitism, nor does it help bring us together with the unity of purpose that this topic merits. Rather, it is another attempt in a long series of veiled efforts by the GOP to weaponize Jewish lives for political gains. It is another partisan gotcha game that amounts to cheap value signaling, not serious action. (END VIDEO CLIP)",
