      "sentences": "Welcome to all of you watching us here in the United States, Canada and around the world. I'm Kim Brunhuber. The U.S. midterm elections were supposed to be a giant red wave for republicans. Instead they turned up to be more of a trickle at best. The GOP is poised to take control of the House of Representatives, but their final margin will be much smaller than many had predicted.And with three races yet to be called control of the senate is still undecided. So right now democrats hold 48 seats, republicans 49. In Arizona, incumbent Democrat Mark Kelly is leading republican Blake Masters but there are still hundreds of thousands of votes to count. Now Nevada, republican Adam Laxalt is leading in common Democrat Senator Catherine Cortez Masto. State officials say final results may not come until Thursday. And in Georgia, the race between incumbent Democrat Raphael Warnock and republican Herschel Walker won't be settled until next month. Now state rules require a run off if no candidate gets at least 50 percent of the vote. republican control of either house of congress will make President Biden's job a lot more difficult over the next two years, but he's breathing a little easier after the lackluster showing for the GOP. Here he is. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

But it does look increasingly likely that this is going to be a divided Washington and that amounts to a huge power shift that both parties are going to have to get used to.Now the house while CNN is not projecting whether the republicans will take the majority yet or not. There are still many outstanding races. The republicans are on a path to likely taking the majority but he here, as you mentioned, is by how much? And it looks much smaller than many republicans had hoped. And that is going to put some real pressure on House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy. He of course is likely to go on to be the next speaker and he will likely be facing a lot of headwinds and headaches from the House Freedom Caucus and the more conservative elements of his party. And we've already seen that play out over the last 24 hours as they try to leverage their power over him as he tries to woo these folks to support him to be speaker. Of course over in the Senate that is still yet to be decided. Democrats feeling good. House majority -- excuse me, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer yesterday told me he felt good. republicans of course in a much different tone really. They are still waiting on Arizona and Nevada. And of course the run off in Georgia. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, he was asked yesterday, how's he feeling. And he, you know, currently responded, I don't deal in feelings. There is a considerable amount of Monday morning quarterbacking in essence going on among the republicans in the senate about the quality of their candidates. And that was a statement that Mitch McConnell said just a few months ago that got a lot of attention that certainly people are remembering now that the candidate quality is going to have a lot to do with it. When he predicted that likely the republicans would take control of the House but not the senate. Certainly a lot of republicans are thinking about those candidates in Pennsylvania that loss Mehmet Oz and also, of course, Herschel Walker in that race yet to be decided in Georgia.",

Because what I have been seeing for months now, is that the energy and the mobilization that democrats saw right after the Supreme Court strike down Roe v. Wade was something that continued. It was a little bit more muted in terms of it wasn't front and center. But what we did see was in the five special elections earlier this year.Democrats completely over performed and one of them in the -- in the special election of New York '19 where Pat Ryan won, he was not supposed to have won every single poll up until the day of had him losing. And he won by two. The Kansas referendum. That was earth shattering for something like that to happen in a deeply red state. And I worked with a lot of democratic campaigns, both senate as well as House. And I saw this energy on the ground, I talked to a lot of voters and so many districts across the country. And undoubtedly, what I heard is that this was absolutely a motivational issue for women, for men, for republican women who said that they're not going to stand for taking away their rights, they were going to go to the polls, vote for the democrat and many of them weren't even going to tell their husbands. And so to me, that said, and what the results of this election told us is that Americans liked their democracy. American women like their freedom, and they're not going to stand around while others get elected, especially republican men get elected and tell them they cannot do what they feel is the best thing for themselves, their bodies, their families, their futures.",

And that's ultimately what we wanted, at least in terms of that's what we anticipate to happen, at least in the House, still to be determined in the senate.Look, granted with all of the factors that you outlined at the beginning, with regard to really tough economic times with a president that's low in the poll numbers and strong republican enthusiasm heading into these elections. We thought we were going to do much better. But the reality is, my friend Maria has been saying this, she was right. There was a lot more enthusiasm or encouragement or motivation by voters on the abortion issue. And that was an under polled topic. And we're seeing a lot of women that did come out on that issue. But also what republicans really need to reevaluate moving forward is, as Sunlen had suggested that the candidate quality. We had a lot of candidates out there that were appointed and really anointed by former President Trump. There were election deniers that were OK with the storming of the Capitol on January 6. That did not sit well with many voters. And we suffered for that at the, you know, on Election Day. And what we need to do moving forward is focus on candidates that are more about the policies of the Republican Party than about trying to navigate past grievances of the former president, and that's incumbent upon republicans moving forward to find candidates that are more about reflecting what people want, as opposed to past grievances. BRUNHUBER:  But a lot of those candidates are still in Congress. And, you know, even if republicans do control congress, they'll -- the margins will be extremely thin. So the MAGA members of the republican caucus, they'll have an outsized influence. So how will, you know, whoever is the majority leader. How will they be able to stick handle this?",

It's one of the things that he touted during his campaign. And frankly, we saw the reality of it, right? The so-called Infrastructure week, well, it actually did happen under President Biden.And he got a great infrastructure bill with the help of republicans. That I think was one of the things that democrats were able to tout across the country for these midterms as an economic driver in all of these districts and states. And so, you already have proof that President Biden and the democrats do have the ability to do this, republicans as well. Obviously, they were part of this. Now I think that there are certain issues that we do have an opportunity to be transformational on together, democrats and republicans, for example, immigration. I think that the Biden presidency, the Biden administration would be thrilled to be able to do something on immigration. And I hope that republicans will be able to join him and able to do that without it -- demanding for it to be we have to secure the border first which has been, you know, a big talking point for republicans, we have an opportunity, and we should try it.",

And he likes them from everything that we've seen and the reporting from CNN is that he's very bothered that he's beside himself about the outcome of this.And we all know that Donald Trump wants everything to be about Donald Trump. He's going to look at DeSantis, he already has a nickname for him. I think this is going to be sort of Clash of the Titans on the side of the republicans. And they're going to have to decide. I think the republicans in Congress are going to finally have to decide whether they now have the backbone to stand up to Donald Trump if in fact, what my friend Alice says is true. And they would be smart to do that to put Donald Trump aside and to finally say, OK, we have to revive the Republican Party to actually have it be a sane, common sense party without any election deniers, without any conspiracy theorists and with the focus on trying to work with democrats to get things done.",

You know, I think, also, black and Hispanic voters came out Democrats. In most states, Florida being the exception, perhaps. And independents, I think, swung towards the Democrats.

And the track of this system will bring with it a dangerous amount of storm surge, possibly up to four, maybe five feet on this immediate coast of Florida. And hurricane warnings have been prompted across where landfall is expected. But even as far north as Savannah on into Charleston, tropical storm warnings remain in effect. And notice, even on the western side there of the state, tropical storm warnings in effect as well as the system has an incredibly wide-reaching impact with its wind field. You kind of compare this to the storm that made landfall 42 days ago, that was Hurricane Ian. That was a category four. A significantly stronger storm. But the winds from the center of the storm expanded about, say, 320 miles away as far as how far the impacts were felt. With this feature, it is a much weaker category one storm, but the winds -- tropical storm force winds are expanding as much as 500 miles from the center. So, even though it's making landfall here across Southern Florida, we're still seeing winds that are close to 40, 45 miles per hour in Southern Georgia and parts of South Carolina. Notice the area in yellow, which are those regions of tropical force winds, it does shrink quite a bit as this interacts with land in the coming hours. And we do expect it to weaken rather quickly as well. But the flooding potential remains very high here as the system moves inland. As much as, say, four, maybe five inches widespread, and notice how quickly it skirts off towards the northeast. So, by the time we get to, say, Thursday night, Friday morning, the system is really screaming across portions of the northeastern U.S. And enough cold air up there to produce some wintry weather as well as Nicole makes its -- what is left of it, at this point, across that region. But notice, just go back to the three systems on record, dating back to the 1860s, just going to show you how rare it is to see a hurricane make landfall in the month of November. It was Kate back in November of 1985. There was a hurricane by the name of Yankee back in 1935. And the Expedition hurricane, as it's known, in the 1860s. That is how unusual it is to see a system again make landfall across the United States in the month of November. Hurricane season officially ends on the 30th of November, but very rarely, Kim, do we see a storm push ashore and it is happening at this hour across south Florida. And again, notice widespread coverage of these wind gusts that are currently at 30, 40 miles per hour. And we do have upwards of 55,000 customers right now across the state of Florida that are in the dark as the system approaches land. So, we do expect that number to pick up here in the coming hours as Nicole makes landfall. Kim.",

That storm surge has arrived here in this area, here in Brevard County. And so, officials are really urging folks to stay off the roadways, to stay home, especially as this hurricane inches its way into Florida. Now, up in Volusia County, at least 22 homes have already been deemed unsafe. Evacuations are in place there. And a coastal erosion plus high tides, major concerns right now in that area. Overall, here in Florida, 45 counties are currently under a state of emergency, Kim.",

I really appreciate it.The Ukrainian flag is flying once again over recently reclaimed villages in the Southern Kherson region, that's after Moscow ordered its forces to withdraw from the strategic city of Kherson and other areas west of Dnipro River. Ukrainian forces have been advancing from multiple directions. Officials are skeptical that Russia will really give up so easily. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says, Russia could be making a strategic move to regroup forces. And he still expects a battle for Kherson. Here's what he told CNN's Christiane Amanpour in an exclusive interview. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT (through translator):  So, they are ready to defend this region and they're not ready to leave this city. And the fact that they are in these homes means that they are seriously preparing. But we are also seriously prepared for these developments. But we are not considering this as just one single operation. We have a strategy and different directions. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "Absolutely, Kim. But really a stunning admission of defeat here from Moscow. In this very orchestrated press conference yesterday, we saw Russia's defense minister standing alongside the top general for this so-called special military operation, Sergey Surovikin. Saying that in order to save the lives of Russian soldiers, they had to retreat. They have to withdraw. That they're unable to continue supplying the city of KhersonAnd, yes, you did hear from President Zelenskyy in his nightly address that there is no gift from our enemies, that was the quote that he used. Essentially, he wants to proceed with caution. Concerned that this could be a trap to lure Ukrainian forces in. But already, Ukrainian officials are seeing movement on the ground. They say Russian troops are withdrawing from the frontline villages in Kherson. They're also blowing up all these bridges along the Dnipro River. Just to give you an outline of the plan, the I.D. here is that these Russian soldiers would pull back from the city, which is on the west side of the river, across the river to the eastern side of Kherson, fortify those positions there. Now, Ukraine, for its part again, saying it's going to proceed cautiously. It will wait and see what happens on the ground. But just the overall picture here, Kim, I mean, for weeks now, President Putin has faced major battlefield losses to this Ukrainian counter-offensive that's been extremely successful. They look set to recapture the one and only capital -- regional capital rather, that Russia has been able to claim in this conflict since the start of the invasion in February. So, a major, major setback for President Putin, who just six weeks ago, Kim, was signing a decree in this very glitzy ceremony declaring that Kherson is part of Russia and illegally annexed. And now this defeat, the only word you can really think of, Kim, here is humiliation. This is an absolutely humiliating defeat for Russia.",

In the meantime, in the quest for peace here, our reporting suggests the U.S. has been, sort of, quietly putting a bit of pressure on Ukraine to at least explore the idea of a diplomatic solution.
