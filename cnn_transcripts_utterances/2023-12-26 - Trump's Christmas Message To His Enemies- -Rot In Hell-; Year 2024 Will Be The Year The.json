Again, Merry Christmas\" -- unquote.Now there are lots of ways to wish America Merry Christmas: Feliz Navidad, season's greetings, happy holidays, merry Christmas. But may they rot in hell is not exactly a phrase you'd want to see on a card. Not that I've gotten my cards out yet, but here's to February. It's obvious what has got the former president, though, so worked up. He's got 91 felony counts and any one of them could potentially land him behind bars. And at this point, it's anybody's guess which of all those legal cases will be the most crucial. This is going to be the year the law rules our politics in a way it never has before, with the presidential campaign about to kick into very high gear and the Republican frontrunner urging a federal appeals court to throw out the federal election subversion case out of right here in Washington, D.C. You know, the one over what happened after the last presidential election, claiming he is protected by presidential immunity. That is, you could say, Republicans are trying to make fetch, that's legal trouble, happen for President Joe Biden. Love a \"mean girl\" reference. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

That by being elected president once again, he is able to potentially absolve himself entirely, but at the very least, potentially stall any indictments or any -- not indictments but in any criminal trials. And so, he has been fighting from the very outset, this legal fight as a political fight. And so that's why he has that message, in part because it's what his base expects him to lash out at his enemies, but in part because he's using the legal fight to bolster his political position successfully so far, and then hopefully use that political position then to actually offset the legal threat that he faces.

To date, she has really helped with Trump's overall delay agenda.So, that would be a really excellent one, but I think because of the contrast between Cannon and Chutkan, most people sort of despair of the possibility of that actually happening before. The other possibility seems to be Fulton County or maybe even remember this old one, the Alvin Bragg case, which is before he was president, also no immunity, but doesn't feel -- doesn't really have the oomph that these other cases do in terms of going to what makes him so dangerous and insidious as a president.",

You see this all the time. People forget that right after the Mar-a-Lago search that was conducted by FBI, guy -- this guy in Ohio goes into an FBI headquarters with a rifle and ends up getting shot to death by law enforcement in the field.

But that is looming once again, 2024 is looming once again. I don't mean to be unnecessarily pessimistic, but it's grim. There's no upside to it.

And you saw this explosion of showing not only Hollywood but the world that women have the power right now. Women are on the upswing. I was looking at some of these numbers and I even surprised myself. Forty percent -- about 40% of all businesses in this country are women-owned small businesses. And guess how much of a punch that they make, $2.7 trillion in annual revenue. That's employing about 12 million people.So, do not sleep on women. We are coming up again. We never left. We were never any -- we were never gone. But there is a real juggernaut. Women are seeing that other women will support them as well. And that's a huge thing. When you find out that it's a woman-owned business, I know Cari and I are like, hey, how can we help? What can we do? What can we buy? How can we do something? So, I think there's a real camaraderie that we're starting to see bigger and bigger and bigger, and it's wonderful to just imagine the possibilities when you consider that almost 40% of all businesses in this country is run by small businesses, women-owned.",
