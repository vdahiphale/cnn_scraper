So, we've just had Biden's trip there to Ukraine, the top diplomat of China heading to Moscow. What's on his agenda once he gets there? KRISTIE LU STOUT, CNN CORRESPONDENT (on camera): Yes, Wang Yi is traveling to Moscow right now. We just learned from the Russian news agency tasks that he is due to arrive at Tuesday afternoon, local time. Last week, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that this visit would be an opportunity for both sides to exchange views about the relationship, also an opportunity to discuss international hotspot issues, which is code for the war in Ukraine. On Monday we heard from Wang Yi he spoke in Budapest. He said that China is willing to work with other nations to achieve a lasting peace in Ukraine. We also heard from the Kremlin spokesman saying that he does not rule out a meeting between Wang Yi and the Russian President Vladimir Putin. Now, this visit to Moscow comes at a time of deepening diplomatic tension between China and the United States over the Chinese balloon and over Russia's war in Ukraine. Just last weekend, the U.S. Secretary of State Anthony Blinken warned Wang Yi of consequences if China was to provide material support to Russia and China has fired back. Now on Monday, let's bring up the statement for you. This is what we heard from the MoFA spokesman saying this \"The U.S. is in no position to tell China what to do. We would never stand for finger-pointing or even coercion and pressurizing from the U.S. on our relations with Russia.\" But since the Russian invasion in Ukraine, look, both Russia and China have been edging closer together on multiple fronts politically and economically. China continues to buy Russian energy, softening the impact of Western sanctions. And China continues to parrot Kremlin talking points on including refusing to condemn the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

But we have heard from a senior Chinese diplomatic official that China does not want to see an escalation in the conflict. It does not want to see it spiral out of control.

And the bridges (ph) of doom which followed have all been well-documented. So, too, the incredible, against-all-odds victories by Ukraine.When you look back at the past year, do you think about those David and Goliath battles, and the fact that Ukraine has won them? And that you're still there and you are still fighting? Or is there a sense of loss for the lives cut short, for the families torn apart, for towns and cities laid waste? How do you deal with the last 12 months?",

So this is the overarching kind of feeling that we have withstood this test off time, this incredible trial and tribulation. Ukraine still stands. This is what President Biden could not keep repeating. You know, and he said he found it astounding, just like his generals found it astounding, that Ukraine lasted more than a week. It just shows how many actors were wrong when this war started. We're still here. And this is incredibly uplifting moment and it feels like the worst is yet to come. We have overcome this fear of the world's great -- second greatest army, of the Russian bear. But, paradoxically, the worst may yet to come. As once again, we may be entering this phase of attrition, more destruction to come. But, you know what? I'm not seeing signs in Ukraine of capitulation, of wanting to sit down at a table with the Russians prematurely. We still have ways to go before we can confidently enter into any negotiations.",
