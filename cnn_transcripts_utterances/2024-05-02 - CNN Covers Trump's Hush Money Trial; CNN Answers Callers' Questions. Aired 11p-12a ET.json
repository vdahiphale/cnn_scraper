Welcome to a special edition of LAURA COATES LIVE alongside Abby Phillip right here in New York.In just hours from now, Abby, Donald Trump will face his 11th day on trial for falsifying business records to cover up a sex scandal. Here you see him across the two weeks that he has now spent listening to testimony inside that cold 15th floor Manhattan courtroom. And in between the whispers to his lawyers and the note passing and the closing of his eyes, the jury is starting to see and hear testimony surrounding a very key question: Just how involved was Donald Trump in the payouts to quiet, damaging stories from Stormy Daniels, from Karen McDougal before the 2016 election?",

And I can't -- I can't even tell you how many times he said to me, you know, \"I hate the fact that we did it.\" And my comment to him was, \"But every person that you've spoken to told you it was the right move.\" (END VIDEO CLIP) PHILLIP:  Now, all of that came after what has been described as a bruising cross-examination of Keith Davidson. The defense tried to torpedo his credibility in front of the jury by going full TMZ, practically, bringing up his alleged cash-for-dirt deals that were tied to a number of celebrity scandals. Trump's lawyer questioned Davidson about if he had helped a client get paid for leaking information about Lindsay Lohan's rehab stint. \"I don't recall,\" Davidson said. He was also asked if he brokered a deal of a sex tape involving a reality star, Tila Tequila. \"I believe so,\" Davidson said. Davidson was also asked if he was investigated by law enforcement in connection with the Hulk Hogan sex tape. \"That's true,\" he said. Now, though he denied extorting anyone --",

And that really didn't come up at all, and really it was focused on painting Keith Davidson as a sleazebag.And I think, to Devlin's point, it was clear that everyone thought that, yeah, Keith Davidson is a sleazebag, and yet we still get to the point that even if that's true, the money was paid, the books were allegedly falsified, and so it doesn't really matter from a legal perspective whether Keith Davidson is a sleazebag.

It has to matter with regard to tying this whole thing in. But if you're the defense attorney, I'm not the one. Trump's not the one concerned about the election. The lawyer is concerned about it because he's leveraging him, and he's trying to get the most out of him like he does all the rest of his clients, and that's what makes him sleazy. That's the argument they're going to make, by flipping this whole election question. Remember the elephant in the room. The elephant in the room is you get the felony, if you can tie in that he was trying to do this, that is Trump, for purposes of the election benefit, If you spin it to make it the attorney who's worried about the election because he can now --",

But it doesn't really technically undercut any of the elements of the offense.And, you know, also, it's not the case, like, I think by the end of this trial, we will know full well that that encounter did happen and that everyone, Trump and all of his co-conspirators, are all talking about the election as the reason why she had to be paid off and it had to be hidden. COATES:  Well, lead into it a little more because I'm curious about the idea of him being sympathetic. I think people might think instantly, well, are you suggesting, you know, that there would be a time when a juror would have the information, they'd meet their burden of proof, and they essentially nullify it?

You saw all these witnesses and you saw what they were about and you saw what all their agendas were. This wasn't a conspiracy that coheres. These people were all out to take advantage of the situation and take advantage of the fact that there was an election. They weren't doing it to influence the election.

I want to play for the audience, though, because there was this moment where the defense was trying to paint Michael Cohen as one we know is going to be a big witness in this case, as somebody whose motivation was, it might be revenge, pure and simple revenge over not getting a job at the White House.This is from Davidson in the court's transcript describing a call with Michael Cohen. It says, \"He said something to the effect of Jesus Christ. Can you get can you effing believe I'm not going to Washington after everything I've done for that effing guy? I can't believe I'm not going to Washington. I've saved that guy's ass so many times. You don't even know.\" This idea of the motivation, not just in terms of why to act in the first instance -- this is, by the way, some things that the jury has heard about Michael Cohen -- this does not paint the most favorable picture, Abby, about this particular witness.

Very few people are qualified to be attorney general of the United States. Michael Cohen is not one of them, okay? So that's just the reality.Nevertheless, you know, you raise the specter of any number of reasons why people are disgruntled or have their own agendas. You know, the jury evaluates all that with common sense. I don't know that that's necessarily going to be dispositive. I mean, that's just a factor for them to consider. I mean, you know, overall, that's why a trial goes on for a number of days. We're only in day 10. You know, there are good days and bad days. And the jury is going to evaluate all of this, you know, together as a meaningful whole.

They're not identified. Why? Why? Because in the event that people find out, there could be consequences as to what they say and what they do. Why? Because they could be intimidated with respect to their verdict. So, unlike you, I do believe, when you make broad references to a jury, that matters because jurors have families.",
