The bloodiest since the cross-border attacks between Israel and Hezbollah began almost a year ago. The Lebanese health ministry reporting close to 200 killed and more than 700 injured in Israeli airstrikes in the South of Lebanon. Many, many residents today feeling echoes of Gaza. Well, it's 10:00 a.m. in New York and the U.N. General Assembly getting set to meet for the 76th time, but with devastation and war dominating the conversations of late. Has the U.N.'s role in world affairs become useless? We will explore that. And prosecutors say the man suspected of the second apparent assassination attempt against Donald Trump wrote a letter detailing his plans. Ryan Routh is due to appear in court next hour. Well, the Lebanese health ministry says more than 180 people have been killed and more than 700 wounded in the latest barrage of Israeli airstrikes. Staggering numbers said to include women, children and medics. Israel pounding what it says are Hezbollah targets. This is the deadliest day of Israeli strikes in Lebanon since the two sides were at war in 2006. Hezbollah is hitting, backfiring rockets into northern Israel. And in a move that we saw in Gaza, Israel is said to be warning people in parts of Lebanon to evacuate. You can see long lines of cars trying to do exactly that. Let's bring back CNN's Ben Wedeman who is in Beirut for you. We have Jeremy Diamond who is in northern Israel where Hezbollah have reached that area. Ben, let's start with you. The deadliest day for Lebanon since the crossfire attacks began on October the 8th. It does feel like echoes of 2006 all over again. Just give us a sense of what is happening in the south right now.",

And as Ben said, if we've already heard reports of at least 300 airstrikes, now add this new intense campaign that appears to be beginning right now as we speak in eastern Lebanon, where Hezbollah has many of the weapons and munitions that they bring in from Iran via Syria and then into Lebanon, those are the main targets for the Israeli military at this moment. And as the Israeli military began to conduct those strikes and started to prepare for those strikes, as you said, they have begun to order civilians to leave those areas. Here's the Israeli Military Spokesman Admiral Daniel Hagari earlier today. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DANIEL HAGARI, SPOKESPERSON, ISRAEL DEFENSE FORCES (through translator): I warn Lebanese residents in the villages of Beqaa, this is a targeted warning for the villages in the Beqaa. The residents near buildings or inside houses where missiles or weapons are stored, move away immediately. Move away for your safety and security.

And so, when Hagari is telling people if there are weapons in the home where you are or in the neighborhood where you are, you should move away. That's not necessarily something that the civilians in that area are going to know, but there's no question that Hezbollah has used this tactic for years now of storing weaponry and munitions in and around civilian buildings in addition to their own separate facilities. And certainly, that puts the people of Lebanon at risk. But as we know, it does not, of course, remove the responsibility of the Israeli military to take precautions to avoid civilian casualties as well.

More than 17 soldiers were invaded and our offices and raid offices. And when they raid the offices in Ramallah without a fair legal process is an aggression. I was there in the office when they came. First of all, more than 20 Israeli military cars were invaded in Ramallah and the Manara Square, whereas our offices in the city's center building in Srinagar Street. And then they surrounded the building, and they closed everything, and they broke into our offices. I was there where I went to the door just to see the medal, and the commander said that we have order to close your office and you have to leave within 10 minutes as our commander came and said, you have only two minutes to leave. You can only take your personal things and then they pushed us out. Yes.",

I just wonder, do you plan to contest this legally? AL-OMARI: Of course, we have legal team who's working now and, you know this -- they extended their actions against Al Jazeera since the 5th of October, the 5th of May, after they closed our office and done our work inside Israel until now and they extend that -- renew that every 45 days all the time. So, we're trying our best to have legals and we have supporters from the foreign press association, from the organization of the Israeli journalists and the others and human rights and the human citizens who are surprising us. And we have the legals and all the lawyers of all these groups are working together now to see what we can do. But this action especially because who gives the order was commander from the Israeli military and it was without any fair legal process. It's mean that this is aggression against the journalists, not only the Jazeera. And as you know, 174 Palestinian journalists were killed since the first day of this war until now.",
