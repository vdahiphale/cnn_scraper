The negotiations are set to resume in the coming hours in Doha, Qatar, picking up where they left off Thursday when no deal was reached.The renewed push for an agreement comes amid fears of an expected Iranian attack on Israel in retaliation for the assassination of a Hamas leader, Ismail Haniyeh, in Tehran last month. The talks also happening as Gaza reached a horrific number of dead. More than 40,000 Palestinians have now been killed in the enclave since Israel launched its war on Hamas following the group's October 7 terror attack. Thousands marched in Tel Aviv on Thursday demanding the release of hostages still held in Gaza, some expressing fears this could be the last chance to bring home their loved ones alive. Now, after ceasefire talks ended for the day, Hamas reiterated that there will be no deal without a complete withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza.

      "sentences": "After hours of negotiations, those talks in Doha, Qatar, to try and reach a ceasefire and hostage release deal, they have ended for the night. But on Friday, those negotiations are set to resume once again. And so while we aren't getting many indications of the exact kind of progress being made inside that room, the thorny issues being sorted through, perhaps the most positive indication is the fact that those negotiations are indeed going to continue.And while we know that Hamas hasn't been in the room as these negotiations have been ongoing between Israel, the Qataris, the Egyptians, and the United States, we are being told that the Egyptian and Qatari mediators have been updating Hamas, are engaging with Hamas, and so that is also a positive indication. And I think it's important to note that we have seen this at various times. When the negotiations get at their most sensitive points, that is often when people clam up. I spoke with an Israeli source earlier this evening who wouldn't provide any details of what's in the room, and that just tells you how delicate things are and potentially how close these negotiations actually are. We know, of course, that there are major differences between Israel and Hamas, but we also know that they are perhaps closer than they have been in a very long time to actually getting to a deal. The question, of course, now is one of political will. Does the Israeli Prime Minister want to get to a deal? Does Hamas's leader, Yahya Sinwar, want to get to a deal as well? Now, one other key indication here is that the Qatari Prime Minister, who has been intimately involved in these negotiations, was in the room on Thursday. After those negotiations ended, he got on the phone with one key person, and that was the Iranian Foreign Minister, updating him on the progress of those negotiations and talking about what the Qataris described as the, quote, \"tensions in the Middle East.\" And that just makes clear that there is a linkage between these ceasefire negotiations and those overall tensions in the Middle East, as we are now more than two weeks removed from the assassination of Hamas' political leader, Ismail Haniyeh, in the Iranian capital, two weeks removed from Iran's vows of retaliation, and yet those have still not come. And so I think it's very clear that if there is progress in these ceasefire negotiations, clearly the implications will be far more wide-ranging beyond just Gaza, further reaching throughout this region.

I'm still convinced he does not, not want the deal. He does not want the deal because he needs prolonging the war. He needs a warlike atmosphere. The last thing he needs now is the war to effectively end and him not being able to declare a total victory or the cliche that he keeps on using.Now, there is another possibility here, and that is that Mr. Netanyahu will be forced through domestic tensions and pressures, which I'll allude to in a moment, and external pressures from the U.S. primarily, and reach a deal hoping, both him and Sinwar, that two, three weeks down the road, one side is going to be accused of violating it and the whole thing goes up in smoke. As for the domestic pressures that you asked about, this is a serious conundrum, Michael, because many, myself included, did not think that he would last this long and survive the calamity of October 7th. Yet the public pressure and the military pressure have been somewhat subdued. That doesn't mean they will not, you know, explode or implode, rather, in the next few weeks in the absence of a deal. I do see that in the absence of a deal that the Israeli negotiators and the Americans in the room think that Mr. Netanyahu is to be blamed or is responsible primarily for the absence of a deal. That may lead to that pressure or dissent that you referred to surfacing in a much more powerful and vocal way.",

There were mitigating circumstances, if you want to understand this, at the outset because the shock, the devastation and the agony of what had happened on October 7th were so deep and so broad and so overwhelming that the Israeli public became impervious or just completely shut down to what's going on in Gaza.But that explains the first two or three months after October. Since then, the devastation has grown, as you mentioned in that Haaretz report. Stories do permeate into the mainstream press. It's not like anyone is suppressing it. It's just that the media in general prefers not to, is reluctant to report, and the public is living in denial about this. Now, what you see on CNN and other networks throughout the world are things and scenes and stories that are rarely seen in Israel.

Now, he had a series of props around him, a bunch of different groceries, and really the point for him was to try and argue that Kamala Harris is responsible for the crunch that many Americans are feeling on their wallets. They also want to tie her to the Biden administration's economic policy. Part of that is because they know that Donald Trump pulled higher than Joe Biden when it came to that issue, and they believe that is a winning issue for him in November. Now, it was really interesting because Donald Trump really stuck to the script. He brought out a binder with him for these remarks. He put it on the podium, and then he read it line by line. However, once he started taking questions from the press, that restraint went out the window, and you really saw Donald Trump revert back to his well-worn playbook. I asked him specifically, you know, you have a lot of allies who are pressuring you, both privately and publicly, to stop with the personal attacks on Kamala Harris and focus on a more disciplined message, particularly when it comes to the issues like the economy, but also immigration and crime.

You know, with Hillary Clinton in 2016, there was years of built-up mixed emotions at best in the electorate that somewhat shielded him from misogynistic attacks on her, like, you know, looming behind her at the debate, for example. Harris doesn't seem to inspire quite the same emotions among voters, and there is a great risk that Trump will simply be provoking a lot of female voters into believing that he is disrespecting a woman, and a woman of color at that. You know, the other half of the press conference, that's what Democrats have to worry about. Most Americans think that they are not better off as a result of the policies of the Biden administration.

And the reality is that, you know, Trump is right. Most of the things that he was talking about today, groceries are up 20% cumulatively since Biden took office.Now, you know, that's a problem that's happened across the world, inflation post-pandemic. But I think most analysts would agree that the last round of big stimulus spending contributed to it. What Harris has to do is shift the debate forward, as I think she will try to do tomorrow in her remarks in North Carolina, when she's going to talk about efforts to control prices in a variety of fronts, and particularly of food and rent, leaning into her history as the Attorney General of California, suing corporations that gouge consumers. But there's also another asset she has leaning forward, which is that most economists say the plans that Donald Trump is unveiling for a possible second term are far more inflationary than anything that Biden and Harris are talking about. The combination of across-the- board tariffs of 10% on all products, which he's now saying may be 20%, plus 60% tariffs on China, coupled with mass deportation that would disrupt the labor force. There have been estimates by Moody's Economics Analytics, for example, that Trump's agenda would add a full point of inflation to the baseline projection of what the CPI would be. So if he can get the debate looking forward, that's better terrain for her than, I think, looking back over what had happened over the last four years, that I think Americans are genuinely discontented about.",

Her family is seen as powerful, at times divisive, yet has had a prominent role on the scene in Thailand for the last two decades.So as we watch this political transition taking place, it's happening, as you mentioned, very quickly after the former Prime Minister was ousted. We have some new pictures from Bangkok where, according to our CNN team on the ground, the voting is now taking place. And she will need more than half of members of parliament to support her. But when we look at the math, her party's coalition has a commanding presence. That coalition has said they will support her. So at this moment in time, it almost appears to be just a formality. Some interesting background, though, about Paetongtarn Shinawatra. She is 37 years old. As you mentioned, her father is a former Prime Minister. He was ousted back in 2006 during a military coup. In addition, her aunt also served as Prime Minister, the first female prime minister. So she is now in line to be the second female prime minister, as well as the youngest prime minister. And her appearance on the political scene is not something that necessarily happened overnight. She has been gaining in prominence over the years. A lot of people have said in the past that it was a long time coming because she had been seen by her father's side at a number of political events over the years, almost paving the way for this kind of elevated presence. She does face, though, a number of challenges in Thailand, including the economy. The economy in Thailand has been sluggish. And the previous prime minister really has made that or made that one of his priorities, one of his initiatives, a lot of effort on job creation and ways to spur spending. So it will be interesting to see if that is going to be one of her priorities. If this approval does go through, she will be able to pick a cabinet of her own. So it will be interesting to see which areas of emphasis she will choose to focus on. Michael, I should point out, it is just approaching 11:30 in Bangkok. This is the procedure that is now taking place. If parliament makes this approval, the king essentially will have to sign off on it. The term is a royal endorsement.
