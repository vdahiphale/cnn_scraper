We are told he also had a lot of social media posts that related white supremacy.Video obtained by CNN shows the gunman calmly got out of his car. He just opened fire on shoppers outside of the H&amp;M store. We froze that video right before he pulls the trigger. But in 11 seconds from the first shot fired, we counted at least 24 gunshots.

Is there a note? Get his phone, any computers, any saved media, because they want to go deeper into where was he going here?And, for instance, you know, from a behavioral science standpoint, what were the stressors in his life that might have been pushing him towards something desperate. Why was he out of the home into a transient place? Had he lost his job? What was his background in the army? Had they need to peel back the layers. But something really interesting, which is look at Louisville, lots of notes, nothing was released to the press about what he was saying. Look at the Nashville shooting, same thing. We're seeing a trend towards that stuff going to the experts for analysis, but not being put out because they're trying to remove the payoff, deny the objective.

It happened outside a homeless shelter that has been housing migrants. Police say driver has not been cooperating, instead giving authorities different names. Brownsville has declared an emergency after a surge of migrants over the past few weeks. CNN's Nick Valencia is there. Nick, have we learned anything at this point about the driver? NICK VALENCIA, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Phil, the fact that the driver is not cooperating with authorities is making it increasingly difficult to get to that motive. But authorities had initially indicated that this potentially could have been unintentional act. They've since backed off from that claim, saying now that their investigation into this violent crash continues. All of it was captured on surveillance footage with video showing the Range Rover that this suspect was driving, traveling at a high rate of speed before appearing to hit a curb and then appearing to lose control into a group of about two dozen migrants, some who were seated on a curb across from a shelter where they were staying at. Witnesses, however, though, described something a lot more sinister, saying they believe that the driver intentionally blew through a red light before veering into them and plowing into them. Investigators say that they will hold a press conference later this morning. All of this, of course, unfolding just days before Title 42 is expected to sunset, that Trump-era border policy, which is a lot of people anxious here about the incoming migration that will come in the coming days.

In fact, he won 49 states when he ran for re-election. Clearly, Joe Biden would like to replicate that, but it's not clear how you do that. I would also point out, just as a sign of the kind of political challenges that they have, is people who are wise and who are competent don't sit on national television and say that they are wise and they are competent.

And I think, like you, I looked at kind of the crosstabs in these numbers and thought, okay, this is perhaps more of an issue than they think it is, maybe the polls an outlier, all those caveats.What do you think the campaign wants to do, needs to do, thinks it should do related to this issue that they don't really want to address publicly all that much.",

But the poll shows problems with that argument, which is that only one -- I think it was 1 percent of voters thought just Donald Trump was too old. So, a big chunk thought just Joe Biden was too old. No, they would both be the oldest president. But that's not a thing that's resonated just yet. HARLOWWhat about, Errol, on and the economy? If it is the economy, stupid, if that's what people vote on, right, then it's not good for it's not good for Joe Biden. This poll shows, by a 54 percent to 36 percent margin. People think Trump did a better job handling the economy than Biden has done.",

I mean, we'll say, here, again, a political challenge for this administration because, you know, look, he has every right to turn around and say, listen, which part of the economy do you have a problem with it? Is it the 3.5 percent unemployment? Is the inflation, which, while troublesome, is now headed in the right direction, which is down? Like, what part of this are you upset about? We're back to pre-pandemic levels of employment in most regions in almost every state. So, he's got every right, I think, to sort of go out and tout his economic program.In fact, I think those age numbers really, in some ways are like a proxy that there's something that people are not happy about. There's something that has made people unsettled, whether it's the economy or something else. And they're maybe aiming it at age and saying like there's something wrong here. We're not sure what it is. We don't know if this is the guy that we want to steer us through this rough patch.",

But what we've seen is that this White House thinks that voters are going to blame Republicans for being too extreme. If you want to ask, what's the answer to the age question, what's the answer to the debt limit question, it's that Republicans are too extreme. They've branded them as too extreme repeatedly since the last two years. And so that seems to be their approach here.First they said they're so extreme by making any concessions. Now, they're saying the specific concessions, there will be some kind of an agreement they have to strike. The Joe Biden original stance that we're not going to negotiate is not going to be the long-term stance. He already has breakaway Democrats saying that's not going to work. So, they have to come to a table in some sense and find a way to meet the agenda Republicans have, which is something, to gain something and Joe Biden to raise the down limit. HARLOW:  Errol, let me just -- I wanted to pull this up to ask you about something that just crossed. Rockland County, which is just sort of north of New York City here, has declared a state of emergency because migrants are being shipped from a number of states, but in Texas, Florida, up to state cities like New York City. And now New York City says it will take some of those migrants and put them in Rockland County.",

The way it landed in those suburbs is like, oh, my God, they're sending all of these people here. We're going to declare a state of emergency.The reality is it's somewhat different from Texas sending a bunch of people here, where no health screenings, no clothing that's weather appropriate, just kind of dumping them at the doorstep. New York, right from the beginning, was suggesting that some of the upstate counties might be good places for these folks to end up and they're going to have to have a much better conversation. People should not be getting surprised in Orange County that all of a sudden 200 people, again, with all expenses paid and with services and so forth, are suddenly going to land on their doorstep. That's sort of making the problem that New York City has had for the last year, one that's going to spread statewide and it's going to get everybody riled up and upset. And I think if that's the only policy that we're going to have in New York and other places, what a mess, what a mess it's going to be.",
