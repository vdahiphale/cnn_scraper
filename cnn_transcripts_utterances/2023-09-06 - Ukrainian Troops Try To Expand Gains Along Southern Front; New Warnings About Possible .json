Well, the Kremlin appears to be looking to North Korea for artillery shells and anti-tank missiles in might be looking for manpower and new recruits from Cuba. Government officials in Havana say they've uncovered a human trafficking network operated by the Russians. No comments are now from Moscow. But our man in Havana is Patrick Oppmann. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) PATRICK OPPMANN, CNN CORRESPONDENT (on camera): The Cuban government says it has detected and is attempting to neutralize what it calls a human trafficking network, attempting to recruit Cubans to fight in Russia's war with Ukraine. According to a Cuban Foreign Ministry statement, these intermediaries, this trafficking network is trying to get Cubans to agree to go to Russia first. And then on to the frontlines with Ukraine is trying to track down Cubans to flight in the war, both in Russia amongst the large community of Cubans that live in Russia and here on the island. According to the Cuban statement, Cuba does not allow its citizens to become quote, mercenaries or to fight the full foreign armed services and wars that Cuba is not involved in, and that Cuba is not a participant in the Ukraine war. Cuba has supported though Russia's claims that essentially that the NATO and the U.S. are behind the war. And it's not Russia's fault that the war in Ukraine has gone on now into its second year. Russia has sent Cuba crucial aid ever since the war has begun as increased shipments of aid including food and shipments of crude oil, and the relationship up until the statement was released seemed to be closer than ever. So it's not clear yet if this is simply a way of Cuba, knowing what that Russia was recruiting its citizens and allowing for some deniability to take place to keep some distance between an operation that was bringing Cubans, perhaps in the hundreds to fight in Ukraine, or if simply Cuba, while supporting Russia does not want its citizens on the frontline of a warzone.

Now it's become much more difficult to leave the country, it's much more difficult to get out of being drafted. So that is a factor. But they need people. And they have made it clear that they're trying to get more. So, I think, you know, Cuba is -- has always been obviously very friendly, has good relations, let's say with Russia, it needs Russia right now, in an economic sense. So that it's a place where you might begin to think there would be people who number one would need money to work. And then you recruit them if this is the way it seems to work, recruit them to have a job like in construction. And then when they get to Moscow, they're given a uniform and sent or told that they should go to the front. So I think it's not particularly strange. And there actually have been some reports, John, of other places like Kazakhstan, where you're getting, you know, people who might be willing to fight, et cetera.

Cars being swept away, buildings flooded, many homes and one hospital have been forced to evacuate. Red storm warnings have been issued for a number of provinces, especially on the eastern coast. And it comes just days after fire crews contained the largest ever wildfire recorded in the EU. According to the government, this is the most extreme rainfall within 24 hours since Greece began keeping records. And there's more to come is CNN meteorologist Chad Myers. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) CHAD MYERS, CNN METEOROLOGIST (on camera): And unfortunately, that rainfall is continuing over portions of Greece, places that have already picked up somewhere between 300 and 500 millimeters of rainfall, it is very heavy here just now to the northeast of the low that's in the Mediterranean. And then that's bringing up all of that very warm humidity, all that very warm water just to the south of Greece and pushing it right up into the same areas that have seen so much rainfall just over the past 24 to 48 hours. So here for Meteoalarm, level three of three, four, the rainfall possibilities here. And yes, we're still seeing the pictures coming out of here out of Greece. But I know that some of these pictures are old, and they will be updated. But they can't get them out of there right now because there's just very little communication coming out of this area, especially video, some of them online, are quite disturbing, and the rainfall is actually continuing where's the gore now 528 millimeters of rain since this rain has started. And it's in the same place that it's going to rain more tonight and into tomorrow. This could not even be a 24 to 48 hour event already. And we could still have another 24 hours to go as the continuous rotation of the low pressure pushes that rainfall over the same areas of Greece that have seen so much rainfall already.

Nevertheless, this developing relationship between Putin and Kim Jong- un seems to be getting stronger. What does Putin get out of this, he gets much needed ammunition. The war of attrition in Ukraine cannot be won by him unless he has the firepower to keep landing artillery shells on the Ukrainian forces as they try to advance.

Launching and putting satellites into orbit. Potentially for nuclear submarines as well. He spends a huge amount of his budget on defense equipment. So the unintended consequences we've seen with Iran supplying drones to Russia. At what cost, what information, what technologies does Iran get for that.

Arabs make up around 20 percent of Israeli citizens. Many speak fluent Hebrew and also identifies Palestinian. But they say Israeli authorities are not treating their cases the same as Jewish ones. Qasidah says she blames the police, government and the law. Her son was set to be married soon.

If we go back to the buildup to the World Cup which saw ongoing unrest between Spain's players, Vilda himself, his coaching staff and the Spanish federation. It led to 12 of Spain's biggest stars actually missing the World Cup altogether. This amid reports of concerns over training methods and inadequate preparations for matches. Now in a statement from Spain's federation on Vilda's departure reading in part, \"The federation appreciates his work as the head of the national team and his responsibilities as the maximum sporting figure of the women's national team as well as the successes reaped during his term crowned with a recent achievement of the World Cup.
