Israel has been directing much of its firepower toward targets in southern Gaza and released a new evacuation map showing Palestinians where they should go. The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza says at least 178 people have been killed since the truce ended early Friday. Despite the resumed fighting, a U.S. official says talks to release more hostages are ongoing. The IDF believes 136 people are still being held in Gaza, including 17 women and children. The families of three more hostages have now confirmed their loved ones are no longer alive. CNN's Ivan Watson is covering this from Beirut. What's the latest on the fighting?",

And in the meantime, the IDF has distributed these maps -- that's the Israeli military -- these maps and leaflets that were dropped over the population in Gaza. They are purportedly interactive. They have QR codes that are supposed to indicate safe places that people can go to in the enclave. I do have to stress the fact that electricity is spotty there due to the destruction. People have spotty access to the interne. And also the U.N. points out that 1.8 million Gazans, that's more than 80 percent of the population, have already been displaced by the first 1.5 months of fighting. So basically you have displaced people who are under bombardment, being told to move from one place to another to try to avoid bombardment that is just colossal and ferocious. Again, more than 400 targets, the Israeli military says, struck in this small, densely populated area in a period of just 24 hours.",
