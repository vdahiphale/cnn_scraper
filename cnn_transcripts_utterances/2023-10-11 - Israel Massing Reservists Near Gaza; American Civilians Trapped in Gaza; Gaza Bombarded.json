The U.S. is now in talks with Israel and Egypt to help get Americans and other civilians out of Gaza.But, as that's happening, there is fighting right now on two fronts. Israel is responding to air and ground attacks from its north and its south. Right now the IDF says 300,000 Israeli reservists have been called up to fight and are, quote, \"ready to execute the mission.\" This is as new rounds of Israeli air strikes have been hitting critical Hamas targets in Gaza. But to the north, Israel is intensifying shelling inside Lebanon, while at the same time preparing for a ground offensive. Our CNN journalists are capturing the massive military presence that you've been seeing just there, is now staging itself just outside Gaza on the border in Gaza. Israel is making major advances it says as it prepares for its ground game. Overnight, the Israeli military says the system Hamas has been using to detect aircraft has been destroyed. Much of Gaza now in ruins as officials there say the city is expected to run out of power any moment.",

As we know, the Iron Dome system in Israel is very, very effective, but it is not 100 percent foolproof. And that is why we saw those hits on a residential building. There were, last time I checked, there were at least two confirmed injuries to individuals in the city of Ashkelon.And this is the reality. This is the percussive tempo, the sound track, if you will, of life along the Gaza Strip in these Israeli communities is that the sound of those rockets being fired, the Iron Dome missiles intercepting them, the boom in the air and then you see those plumes of smoke.

It looks very similar to the ones that we have been watching for the past several days now.We should also mention that we are just getting this in, the head of the Gaza electricity power company says that the electricity is officially out. There are people, of course, that have generators, hospitals in particular, but even the hospitals, we are hearing, are very, very low on fuel because all of these things have been cut off. Israel cutting off all of those things, electricity, water, food to the area as they prepare for a ground incursion. Jeremy, I think we're going to be going back to you where you are. You have been seeing all this. You're talking about seeing some of what appears to be a preparation for a ground incursion.

They cut off all electricity and water and there are Americans inside Gaza who are really desperate to get out, as well as, of course, other civilians.And so what we are hearing at this point is that Egypt, while they are willing to send medicine and food and other supplies into Gaza using a corridor, they are not willing to open a corridor going the other way, to allow civilians out of Gaza. And so right now the U.S. is working with partner countries to try to establish, of course, a pathway for civilians to get out. Americans have expressed a lot of frustration to CNN in interviews in recent days, saying that they don't believe that the U.S. has been able to help and that they are desperate for a way out as Israel continues to pound Gaza with air strikes and with other kinds of attacks. So, right now there are now - there is no timeline on when that corridor is actually going to be open, but State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller, he did tell us just this morning, quote, \"we're doing these discussions quietly like a lot of the diplomatic efforts we undertake. It is not productive to speak about publicly,\" he said, \"but it is something that the U.S. is trying to achieve.\"",

And they have issued several warnings to Hezbollah through intermediaries, including the Hezbollah aligned speaker of Lebanon's parliament, warning them to stay out of the conflict. France has also issued several warnings to Hezbollah at the request of Israel, we are told, telling them to steer clear of this war.Now, at this point, the U.S. is backing up its warnings with action. We saw that the U.S. sent an aircraft carrier to the eastern Mediterranean as a deterrence measure to try to deter any potential actors, including Hezbollah, from feeling tempted to enter the conflict. At this point, we should note, that administration officials do not necessarily see Hezbollah as eager to join this war. There are a number of political and economic risks that the administration does not believe Hezbollah is willing to take at this point. But, of course, that could change and things could quickly spiral and escalate. We've already seen a number of clashes on Israel's northern border between Hezbollah and the IDF.

There's only certain areas which would allow the speed and shock effect was what Israel would like to bring into that fight. Those positions now have been built up and they've got defenses. So, I think this - kind of the second thing that Israel had to get, besides President Biden's permission, or for logistics to come through, they have to soften up those defensive positions.

Let me draw the borders of Israel here because it doesn't really show up on our map. But you can see here, this is Israel. Down here is Gaza, where all the fighting has been recently. But an enormous amount of concern toward Lebanon because of Hezbollah, which has set up shop really in the southern part of that country.One of the things we learned from 2006, when there was fighting between Israel and Hamas in Gaza, was that Hezbollah has multiples more in terms of strength and forces and missiles. LYONS: Yes, tanks. They have anti-tank equipment and the like. It comes down to numbers, 170,000 active duty Israeli forces. They have to put at least 100,000 down here in order to have any kind of offensive operation there. And then they have to make a tough decision, whether they garrison it or whether they just leave it alone. And that leaves them 70,000 of active duty forces to focus in the north, which is why they recalled those 300,000. I have to think half of those reservists are going to be told -- their orders are going to be, get to the north and just stay there because this is where the greatest risk comes from. If Hezbollah recognizes that they've overcommitted to the south now, they're going to look at this as an opportunity that they - they'll never see again. They'll have the Israeli army somewhat on the ropes and now they can attack to the north and really put Israel in a bad way.",
