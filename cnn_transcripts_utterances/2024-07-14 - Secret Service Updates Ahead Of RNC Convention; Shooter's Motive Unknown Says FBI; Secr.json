They did not answer as to whether that meant anything for the president himself or his family, and also no changes to a perimeter, which of course, as they emphasized, in an open carry state like Wisconsin, could be very consequential. So Juliette Kayyem, Chief Charles Ramsey, obviously we've been talking to you throughout these couple of hours.

      "sentences": "Not really. I'll tell you, listen, I'm completely sympathetic with the police chief. He has a city to protect, but we're watching this because the former president was almost assassinated. It's not like we're going to just watch any security press conference. So two things I want to say. One is Governor Evers could do something right now. He clearly has emergency authorities. Any governor does. The police chief and the mayor's hands are tied about the open carry rules.The governor could do a four-day exception to the rule based on increased and exceptional evidence that there is a heightened threat and increase the rules or tighten the rules around open carry near the convention center. This seems relatively easy to do. It's not an exceptional power. So urging Governor Evers, and that might have been what they were hinting, to do that under, you know, emergency authorities would be absolutely appropriate at this stage. The second is, of course, the Secret Service. They have what they called an NSSC, a National Special Security Event. Those are the highest rankings. They come with months and months of planning. These conventions are on the calendar well in advance. They know what to do, and they are working with federal and state and local law enforcement to plan. But I am hard pressed to understand why you would create an NSSC that is not adaptable to the threat that we now know exists, right? So the Secret Service woman was saying, you know, we feel confident this is the highest security. A former president was almost assassinated yesterday. Surely you would want to look at the planning and possibly increase it for this convention and the next. The NSSC is not static in time. It adapts to different threats. And that's, you know, it was a confusing press conference. That's what I'll say.",

No operational changes are in the works right now.She says there's a comprehensive security plan that's been in place. We're ready to go. They've worked on this for 18 months and they're confident in the plans. Shimon Prokopis, you're there. You were listening to this news conference. That jumped out at me that even as a result of the drama that unfolded yesterday and the blunders that may have taken place that allowed this guy to show up about 150 yards or so atop a rooftop with a straight view of the podium, that no operational changes are being considered right now. What was your reaction, Shimon?",

They really said nothing. There was no reassurance here. There's no reason that -- it doesn't feel unsafe here, Wolf. You know, I don't want to give the impression that somehow it's unsafe here.[17:9:54] But the point of doing something like this, especially after yesterday, is to reassure the public that the Secret Service, which I think right now has a lot of questions to answer, as you said, a major blunder on their part here. This is their one job is to protect the former president. Something went wrong. And you would expect that at least in some fashion, in some statement, before she addresses the plans for the RNC, that she would have in some fashion said something about it. They had to know that they were going to get questions about it. I mean, they warned us before the press conference not to ask those questions because she wouldn't be able to answer those questions. But still, they should have been prepared to say something. And it's really interesting and it raises a lot of questions, really, why the director of the Secret Service hasn't done anything. There was a press conference last night, a very lengthy press conference in Pennsylvania last night with the FBI and the state police and other local officials. The FBI today updated the media on something they don't do often. It's very rare. But they went ahead and realizing the significance of what happened on Saturday. They decided to update reporters on their investigation and they provided a lot of information. And to this point, we are now a day out of this incident. And you would think that publicly, when the Secret Service comes before the cameras, that they would have something to say. And essentially, this press conference said nothing. They basically told us that nothing was changing. Look, it is very, very safe here, Wolf, right. There are fences everywhere. There'll be entire frozen zones and perimeter after perimeter after perimeter here come tomorrow. So certainly people that will be coming here should feel safe. There's a lot of security. There's a lot of law enforcement everywhere. But given what happened yesterday, things have changed. And I just feel that the Secret Service and I think many people feel this way, that the Secret Service publicly should have addressed this in some fashion and they failed to do that here. And it's very puzzling and that was why I asked them right out of the gate, you know, what were they thinking in that not having anything to say about what happened here, what happened Saturday in Pennsylvania? It's certainly very concerning. The local officials, they really had nothing to add either. They just say that nothing has changed. There are concerns about people being allowed under the law to bring weapons to the outside perimeter. They asked if there were going to be any changes to that. And because of the law, they really can't do anything about that, Wolf. But that is something that is concerning to the governor. That is something that is very concerning to other officials here. So, of course, Wolf, as to what happened Saturday, still a lot of questions and the Secret Service continues to not answer those publicly.",

What the FBI has said is that they have some insights into his communications, but otherwise determining the totality of his motivation, very much of that remains unclear. What we do know is that he was not known to the FBI. He was not in a database. The questions are, how did he obtain this firearm? And what we know is that it was an A.R. style 556 rifle that belonged to his father. So the big question is, how did he gain access to that rifle? The other thing that we know, Erin, is that this shooter did have rudimentary explosive devices in his home. Those materials are being assessed at Quantico. But beyond that, Erin, there is very little information at this point. We're still pushing our federal law enforcement officials for more details.

We have heard again and again that electing Trump is the end of democracy, that he's a convicted felon. All these points from the Democratic side. Right now, that's all quiet, but for how long?",

That -- that should be the theme from now through the entire campaign and beyond.So, I don't know how long campaign ads will stay down. I don't know how long people will not start bickering with each other back on Twitter like they do. But what I do hope is that for the next coming days, that both here at the RNC, that the temperament and the tone of all the speeches are not one of anger, but of one of how we move forward and how we run an election that is about the policies that affect the American people and not about hate and vitriol.",

      "sentences": "Right, Wolf. Laying out the timeline of events and the shooter's location, here's what we can tell you right now. What we know now is that the shooter was roughly 150 meters away from where President Trump was speaking. That's less than 500 feet away from where the former president was speaking.We also have new information from Michael Slupe, he is the sheriff of Butler County, spoke to CNN just a short time ago, said just before the shooting, law enforcement officers got word of suspicious activity around that location where the gunman was. They went to investigate. A law enforcement officer, according to the sheriff, hoisted himself up to the ledge of the roof. We presume it was right about here. He sees the gunman. According to the sheriff, the gunman sees him. Gunman points his weapon at that officer. And the officer, because he's holding on to the ledge, he cannot engage him with his weapon, the officer has to then drop to the ground to protect himself. The shooting then starts at 6:11 p.m. and 33 seconds. Remember that timeline. We're going to come back to that in a second. But what we also know from a senior law enforcement official is that the gunman, just before the shooting and the minutes before the shooting, was acting strangely around the area where the magnetometers were. Probably around these areas here where the magnetometers were. The question is, what was he doing then? Was he doing a recon mission? Was he probing for a shooting position? That will all come out in the investigation. We have other information also from a witness on the scene, Ben Macer, who told KDKA, a CNN affiliate, that just before the shooting and the moments before the shooting, he saw the gunman moving from roof to roof. Presumably, again, these are the roofs of the buildings that seemingly all are connected here at the shooting location. Here's some video of the gunman from TikTok, the gunman after he was neutralized. The gunman -- the first reports from agents that the gunman was down came at 6:12 and 16 seconds. That's less than a minute after the shooting started. This post-shooting video, we can show you now. Here's a scene here of the chairs and the debris here. When we get to this other video, I want to pause it here for just a quick second to talk about the deceased victim, Corey Comperatore. According to the governor of Pennsylvania, Josh Shapiro, Mr. Comperatore, he might have been either in this grandstand or in this grandstand, but he dove on top of his family to save them from the shooting. Hopefully, we'll get some more information soon as to where -- which grandstand he was in, but a very heroic act from the deceased victim, Corey Comperatore, saving his own family, according to Governor Shapiro, who spoke to his wife. And again, going to the scene here, what we're told is that the president has ordered an independent investigation. Our law enforcement analyst, Andrew McCabe, says the one thing in securing a site like this, especially outside, you've got to eliminate the sight lines to where the protectee is speaking. Why that sight line was not eliminated, Wolf, that's a key focus of the investigation.",

And again, this is where seconds turn into minutes. And I just remember looking around and no one is going down. So, I screamed, gun, get down. And I grabbed my mom and I anchored towards the grass because we were so low. And he was on top of an 80-year-old woman and I was on top of her. And I remember checking her for blood and everything, and four more shots rang out. And then people started screaming, man down from above us. And I remember looking up and seeing Corey and another woman that was hit. And they were just lying there. And next thing you hear, one last shot, which I'm assuming was them taking out the shooter. My mom at one point lifted up the fence because we were trying to see if Trump was okay. And eventually, we see him stand up and give the fist bump. And we were all screaming for a medic and no medics were coming to us, which was horrifying. D. HUTZ: We had a fear that there were more shooters there because if this was happening right in our section, we were the section that everybody sees on TV, that everybody is still sitting there and looking. Our section was down, other than people helping, you know, Corey and the woman shot. J. HUTZ: We had two people down in our section, so everybody was down. D. HUTZ: Yeah.",

We both -- we both said in the car on the way home, silently to ourselves. We both had it in the back of our minds going in there today. I was looking at trees, I was just looking around, you know, shoving away. He had his own thoughts about it. J. HUTZ: First three shots, I thought assassination. But in the video, there are five or six seconds before the next four shots, which I then thought was a mass shooting. Trump was already down at that point. So, like, what are they shooting at? D.
