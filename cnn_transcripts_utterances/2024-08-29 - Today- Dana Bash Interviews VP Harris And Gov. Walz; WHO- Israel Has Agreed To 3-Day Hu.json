The news as it stands at this hour. Vice President Harris is in the hot seat on a bus tour in Georgia. She's sitting down with our own Dana Bash alongside her running mate, Governor Tim Walz, in what's the first exclusive interview with the Democratic Party presidential team since the historic switch from President Biden. In an extremely close race every moment can and probably is pivotal and the polls show that the race is exceptionally close, with new battleground polling from Fox News showing no clear leader between Harris and former President Trump in the four major swing states, Arizona, Nevada, North Carolina, and where she is today in Georgia. So, now, we're watching to see, of course, what she's saying and what the interview well have CNN's Eva McKend has more. And, you know, we have a mixed, mixed feelings because on the one hand, she is the vice president. So she can put two words together without an um and ah and tripping over her shoelaces. But what do we expecting from her?",

They have kept her from doing these types of interviews where she it would face intense scrutiny for quite some time and doing that allowed her to build a lot of momentum across the country reinvigorate these key Democratic coalitions that were sort of sitting on the sidelines --",

We're getting more details every few hours, but essentially Arlington national cemetery is a place where its prohibited to take photos for political purposes, and Trump and his team went to Arlington National Cemetery to commemorate the Abbey Gate event, and those who died that day.And there was an altercation there. The Army, as he said today, said that there were -- that participants there was some kind of scuffle. I'm going to read a little bit of the statement. ANC is a national shrine to the honored dead of the armed forces, and its dedicated staff will continue to ensure public ceremonies are conducted with dignity and respect. Earlier in the statement, participants in August 26th ceremony and subsequent Section 60 visit were made aware of federal laws, army regulations, and DOD policies, which clearly prohibit political activities. Now, the Trump campaign and even its high command, including Trump's close advisers, one of whom is a veteran marine, have been pushing back that they did anything wrong. But this -- more recently, a statement from the sister of one of the family members at the near the graves that Trump visited had this to say: According to our conversation with our Arlington national cemetery, the Trump staffers did not adhere to the rules that were set in place for this visit to Staff Sergeant Hoover's grave sites in 60 -- in Section 60, which lays directly next to my brother's grave. We hope that those visiting the sacred site understand that these were real people who sacrificed for our freedom, and that they were honored and respected accordingly.

Secondly, they'll get paid by the amount of time that they are in the air, not sort of sitting around. And if your own reserve not flying, you don't make much money. What can be done to change that? NATALIE COMPTON, TRAVEL REPORTER, THE WASHINGTON POST:  Well, right now, the major flight attendant union is bargaining with 14 different airlines to answer just that. They're looking into increased wages. They are also trying to get that pay for when they are working either at the airport or at least during boarding. That's a huge fight for the unions, but it's a multi-front issue for these unions to try to improve working conditions for flight attendants.",
