Coming up thishour, celebration turns to tragedy is more than 100 guests at a wedding in Iraq are killed in a fire. North Korea says it will expel the U.S. soldier who made a daring dash into the country. Nearly half of all ethnic Armenians in Nagorno-Karabakh have now fled into Armenia and almost 9000 migrants crossed into the U.S. this week, we'll have a special report for you from Mexico. Checking on the markets for you, New York opens in about 30 minutes U.S. futures pointing to a higher open across the board after Tuesday's sharp sell offs. That was due to weak economic data and rising bond yields. Keeping an eye on that few the opening, bells of course, in half an hour's time. We begin with tragedy in Iraq. The Iraqi government declaring a three day mourning period after a fire at a wedding left at least 100 people dead and more than 150 others injured. Just a short time ago, we learned that nine people had been arrested in connection with that fire or authorities say the wedding hall did not meet safety requirements and that fireworks, candles and other materials used during the celebration sparked the flames. The father of the groom says his son and the bride are both alive and are in the hospital receiving treatment. For the very latest, let's get you to CNN's Salma Abdelaziz who is following the very latest developments for us from London, Salma?",

I mean, eye witnesses describe it essentially going up in a matter of moments. It was a tinderbox because again of that illegal building material, all of this taking place around 10 pm last night. Some 1000 people were gathered to celebrate that Christian wedding. And this is the context really behind this story. This is a community that had returned to post ISIS, post 2016 after U.S. back forces were able to liberate that area from the terror group. Buildings were being rebuilt in the area, the community was coming together. This is one of the buildings that were put up just in the last few years. Now of course we're finding out with materials that were illegal. The question that many of those victims are going to be asking is. Is corruption to blame and one other building that have been built in recent years since post ISIS also unsafe?",

      "sentences": "Well, Becky, what we've seen in the past when American citizens have been expelled from North Korea, there have beena couple of cases over the years. They have been sent to Beijing in China, and then have been sent on to the U.S. or there have been U.S. officials waiting for them there. So we don't know for sure how this is going to play out at this point. The statement from North Korean State Media KCNA was three sentences long it was short. It basically said they had an investigation into what Travis King had done. And they had said that he confessed to illegally intruding into the country. Now I have to point out this is all from state run media. This is not words from Travis King. We don't have any information on his well-being. We heard nothing from him since mid-July when he crossed the military demarcation line into North Korea. But State Media is also saying that that King had confessed to this and said that he had wanted to come to North Korea because he was disillusioned with the U.S. talking about racial discrimination in the U.S. and also an unjust U.S. society. Again, Pyongyang's words attributed to Travis King. So at this point, the question is when, where and how? And we're hoping those questions will be answered shortly. But it's worth reminding ourselves what did happen, is this was quite a remarkable case? It was mid- July. Travis King had faced assault charges here in South Korea. And he was actually spending and spent 50 days in a in a South Korean facility. He was then supposed to be deported to the U.S. he was taken to the airport itself. He was supposed to go back to Fort Bliss in Texas. But he managed to leave the airport the very next day he went on this civilian tour of the DMZ and then ran across the border into North Korea. So really quite a remarkable story and we heard from U.S. officials consistently that their priority was to make sure they got him back safely, Becky.",

But certainly, there will be great relief from his family the fact that he has now been returned to American custody, there will be relief from the American diplomats who would have been working on this and also the Biden administration. But of course, there are many questions still to be answered. Now there are a couple of potential options he may be in Beijing, he may be coming into to South Korea, across the DMZ of effectively the way that he crossed into North Korea. It's simply unknown at this point which route they have decided to take but we did hear just a few hours ago from North Korean state run media that they had decided to expel Travis King. They had said that they had done an investigation and that he had confessed to illegally intruding into North Korea. Now of course this is state run media saying this this is not Travis King's words themselves and he'll they also said through state run media that he said that he wanted to do what he did because of an unjust U.S. society talking about racial discrimination. Again, these are Pyongyang's words. Now, clearly we will hear more when we know more about Travis King's whereabouts we haven't even heard anything about his condition because he went across the border into North Korea in mid-July, and nothing was heard or seen from him until today. And since that point we know at this point is a U.S. official says he is in U.S. custody. So certainly welcome news for the U.S. side to hear that this has been finished in this particular way. But of course there are many more questions about his whereabouts, his well-being and how he was treated. Whilst in North Korea the wide assumption is he would have been extensively debriefed by North Korea. He was an Army Private t he wouldn't have been privy to any significant information, but he was still a U.S. soldier based in South Korea.

Today this announcement doesn't come as a huge surprise because Rishi Sunak the Prime Minister had already said that he would like to, \"max out\" the oil and gas reserves in the U.K. And this one's pretty big. It's going to be focused more on oil and gas producing up to 500 million barrels of oil. Now, the government argues that this will help improve the U.K.'s Energy Security and reduce bills now that may well play well with voters ever since the invasion of Ukraine of course, energy bills have skyrocketed. There has been an issue over energy security. But today opposition MPs, Climate Activists, campaign groups have really thrown cold water on this argument. One group called uplift. The Executive Director said Rosebank will do nothing to lower fuel bills or boost U.K. energy security. Most of this oil will be shipped abroad and then sold back to us and whatever price makes the oil and gas industry the most profit. Essentially, this oil will of course be sold on global market at global market prices. And the company the majority owns. This, as you mentioned is the Norwegian state owned Energy Company Equinor. Now uplift that campaign group does say they would like to launch a legal challenge against the government on this decision. Opposition MPs particularly the leader of the Green Party, the Scottish Nationalist Party, they are very much against the decision. But interestingly, Becky, the main opposition party, the Labor Party have said if they were to win the next election, they wouldn't reverse this decision.
