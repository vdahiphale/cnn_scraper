Does he occasionally say the wrong word? Certainly. On the way over here, I was talking in an interview with Neil Cavuto, I called him Steve. I have no idea why I did that. I know what his name is.

That will be difficult on the campaign trail, but as I've said before, President Biden may not be the best campaigner in the world.He's doing a good job as president.

The Supreme Court justices appeared to be poised to side with him, potentially by a wide margin. Now the now hard, settling the debate over state's power and the 14th Amendment and how soon they might do it, Super Tuesday less than one month away, and primaries, as you know, have already begun. CNN Justice Correspondent Jessica Schneider has the latest on this. Jessica, what do we expect and when do we, which is a harder question to ask, do we expect a ruling on this?JESSICA SCHNEIDER, CNN CORRESPONDENT (on camera):  Sara, I mean it could come at any point. We're probably talking a matter of weeks here because the justices understand the urgency. The primaries are well under way. You said Super Tuesday is about a month away. And the calendar really is barreling toward the general election. What's interesting is we have seen the Supreme Court move very rapidly in somewhat similar circumstances. It was back in the year 2000. The Supreme Court actually decided Bush Gregore (ph) one day after hearing arguments. Now, granted, that decision came during a very chaotic time with the recounts in Florida, which they halted. And of course, it was just weeks before the inauguration. So, there was a bit of a different circumstance there. But in this case, these nine justices also know that time is of the essence here, so we could see something really in a matter of weeks here when often these big decisions might take until June. It probably won't be that long. We saw from the arguments yesterday that it really does look like there would be a solid majority to rule in Trump's favor, to overturn what the Colorado Supreme Court did in taking him off the ballot there. There was a lot of pushback and skepticism from several of the justices, conservatives and liberals alike. And the skepticism in their view was that it's unlikely the 14th Amendment would really confer this kind of power on states to take individual people off the ballot that they themselves, the states, have deemed ineligible insurrectionists. So, here's more from the justices to see how they were agreeing. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ELENA KAGAN, SUPREME COURT JUSTICE (voice-over):  Why should a single state have the ability to make this determination not only for their own citizens but for the rest of the nation? BRETT KAVANAUGH, SUPREME COURT JUSTICE (voice-over):  These are difficult questions, and you look right at Section 5 of the 14th Amendment, as the Chief Justice said, and that tells you Congress has the primary role here. KETANJI BROWN JACKSON, SUPREME COURT JUSTICE (voice-over):  If there's an ambiguity, why would we construe it to, as Justice Kavanaugh pointed out, against democracy? (END VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "And really, Sara, the court doesn't even need to get to the court, if she's in this case, whether Trump engaged in insurrection, whether that would disqualify him from the ballot. Instead, there's a lot more off-ramps and narrow issues this court could decide, you know, like whether it's up to Congress to enforce this ban instead of the courts, whether this ban even applies to the President. So right now the justices will be deciding how they are going to, you know, write their opinion in what does seem like a win for Trump. Sara.",

Then the biggest headline now is the special counsel report exonerating President Biden, saying at least they will not press charges or bring charges with him handling the documents. But the issue is how he chose Robert Herr to explain why. Did he paint outside the lines, in your view, when he included what Democrats consider to be editorializing about the president's age?JEREMY SOLANGE, FORMER PROSECUTOR (MAN-NY): There was sort of -- a generous amount of editorializing, no doubt. But I'd rather be an indictment of my memory and ability to understand certain things than an indictment of a grand jury. There are differences here. No doubt the special counsel pointed to President Biden's age, his ability to remember things and that it would be convincing before a jury that, you know what, maybe this is a regular guy.
