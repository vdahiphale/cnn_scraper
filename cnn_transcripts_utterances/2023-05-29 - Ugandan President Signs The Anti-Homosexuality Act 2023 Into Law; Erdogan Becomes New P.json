There's fear, anger and sadness in Ugandaafter the nation imposed one of the world's harshest anti-gay laws in the world. We are going to die, says one activist. Many are fleeing the country. This, after Ugandan President signed the Anti-Homosexuality Act 2023 into law, defying international pressure. The bill passed through Uganda's parliament earlier this month, while LGBTQ rights in Uganda have been eroding for years. This law imposes a litany of punishments, including the death penalty for, quote, aggravated homosexuality. It criminalizes sex education for the gay community and stipulates a 20-year prison sentence for anyone promoting homosexuality, as well. CNN's David McKenzie has been following this story. He joins us live now from Johannesburg. So, David, going back a decade or even more, Uganda, as we all know, already had one of the toughest anti-gay laws in the world. It wasn't a safe place. It has never been really a safe place for members of the gay community. This law goes even further. Just walk us through what this law means for members of the gay community who are in Uganda right now.",

I spoke to several activists and lawyers in Uganda today and over the last several weeks anticipating this law being signed by President Museveni. They are living in fear, frankly. They are worried that, of course, that they might face direct jail time based on these laws, including a lifetime sentence for acts of homosexuality, and as you say for promoting homosexuality. And that is very broad. It means that those teaching in schools, sexual education could run afoul of the law. It is also a provision in that law to say that neighbors and family members need to out those who they believe are LGBT to the authorities, in some cases under punishment of the law. And there's also the worry that people will be blackmailed now because of this law and the general sense from the community that I've been speaking to, that people will just take the law into their own hands. And we've seen this happening in other countries, including Ghana, where a similar law has been pushed, if not yet signed, by the president. Zain.",

Turkey's opposition leader is warning of hard days ahead, after the country'spresident survived the biggest test of his political career to secure an unprecedented third term. Recep Tayyip Erdogan received 52 percent of the vote in Sunday's runoff election, while his challenger, Kemal Kilicdaroglu, won a nearly 48 percent. But the newly elected president faces some big challenges ahead, including a looming economic crisis. Critics, meanwhile, worry about Erdogan's increasingly authoritarian rule and his close relationship with Vladimir Putin. CNN's Nada Bashir joins us live now from Istanbul. So, Nada, we knew sort of going into last week that there was a strong possibility that President Erdogan would remain, would emerge victorious here, but this wasn't an easy victory for him. The fact that Kemal Kilicdaroglu came within striking distance of the presidency here must be cause for concern. What does President Erdogan change, if anything from this moment forward?",

BASHIR (voice-over): The challenges ahead for the president are many. Chief, among them, the economy. Turkey is in the depths of a severe cost of living crisis, with soaring inflation and a plummeting lira, caused in large part by Erdogan's own unorthodox monetary policies. Meanwhile, anger over the state's poor preparation and chaotic response to February's devastating earthquake is still raw, with more than 50,000 people killed and millions more displaced by the disaster. On the global stage, Turkey's strongman has cemented the country's place as an influential power broker in the region, sometimes at the cost of straining relations with the West. But at home, his leadership has stoked fears over the future of democracy in Turkey. Over recent years, Erdogan has doubled down on quashing dissent, centralizing his grip on state power and ensuring his near total influence over the country's media. Despite criticism, supporters maintain that this is a win for political stability. For opponents, however, Sunday's result has only deepened fears that the country could be heading ever closer towards authoritarian territory. (END VIDEOTAPE) BASHIR (on-camera): Look Zain, this is a real blow to Turkey's opposition. It's the first time we've seen them so unified behind a single candidate, six parties from very different ends of the political spectrum coming together. But when we spoke to voters and supporters of the opposition, they told us that while they did expect President Erdogan to win, in modest words, a disappointment they hope that this is a first step for the opposition, that this could well put them in a good place for the next coming presidential elections here in Turkey.",

On both sides of the aisle, the expectation is that they are going to lose some members on the Democratic side, on the left flank, some of those progressives, on the Republican side, from the right flank, some of those members of the House Freedom Caucus already expressing concerns, many of them saying that they will not vote for this proposal. So, the focus for leadership at this moment is making sure that they can find that coalition in the middle. There is a furious attempt today to whip these votes, both from Republicans and Democrats. The White House doing a series of very detailed briefings trying to help their members understand what these provisions are, including some of the provisions that are now updated so that there's a stricter work requirement on programs like food stamps. Like you noted, that is something that progressives are opposed of, something that they have expressed a lot of concern about. But at the end of the day, their votes may not be needed. There is already a key group of Democrats, the New Dems, which is about a hundred members. There's also another group of Republicans and Democrats who are already expressing that they are going to support this in large numbers. So, the key here is to get 218 votes, but that coalition is just going to look very different than what it typically looks like in the House of Representatives, where usually you have these votes passing along party lines.

This totally changes a lot of things. Before there was, I mean, there's still a law, the penal code is quite as harsh as it is. It's -- condemns and punishes same-sex relations which under the law is described as criminal knowledge against the order of nature, which is also under, you know, different other laws. So, what this current law does is pick it and take it an extreme notch higher. As much as the issue of identity was removed, I'm an activist. Activists like me are condemned by this bill that's even speaking to you, yourself and myself are criminalized under this law. Housing -- we already have a high rate of homelessness within the LGBTQ community because there's no employment opportunities. There's banishment from homes, from clans, from church. There's nowhere to go. And a country that is supposed to protect us is not protecting us. Yes, I've been arrested several times. I lost hearing at some point until surgery in my left ear because of being beaten at a police station. Several things have happened to me. Some of them unimaginable. But this law now makes those things legitimate. That today, as I'm speaking to you, if someone attacked me here and dragged me out of, you know, the space where I'm speaking to you from, you know, it's legitimized. The law legalizes any form of discrimination, any form of violence against LGBTQ persons and people who defend the LGBTQ community in any way, be it a parent, be it a teacher, be it a doctor, be it a media person who's trying to understand the plight of LGBTQ persons. Be it a lawyer, for instance, many people are talking about petitioning the law but that in itself alone can also be a criminal act because you're trying to speak positively or to defend or to protect a community that is being criminalized under this law. So, several things. The death penalty is just a shocker for all of us. We thought at least that would be dropped out. I mean the entire law, we thought it would be struck out. But as the hate grew, as the homophobia grew, we knew that the law is not going anywhere. But we thought maybe the death penalty would be removed. But that hasn't been removed.

I have my own ways of keeping safe but now those safety measures have been compromised with this current law. And it doesn't even take anyone knowing that you are a member of the LGBTQ community. It's just a suspicion. A lot of the violations that the community has faced has been based on what people suspect you to be. So, even that suspicion has been legalized that you can think anything of anyone, of effeminate men or male individuals or masculine presenting females. So, this is really a legalized witch hunt on the community or for anyone who looks different.
