And the special counsel's report pointed out that -- the many differences in the Biden and Trump cases. Meantime, the former president is another step closer to securing the Republican nomination for president. CNN is projecting Trump will win the Nevada caucuses, taking all 26 delegates. The vote was organized by the pro-Trump state Republican Party. Nikki Haley refused to take part, and it was not sanctioned by the GOP. Meantime, Trump appears poised for a big win at the U.S. Supreme Court. The official ruling is likely weeks away, but based on the questions, the justices seem inclined to overturn Colorado Supreme Court's decision to disqualify Trump from running for office, due to his role in the insurrection on Capitol Hill, despite spending very little time analyzing Trump's actions on January 6. CNN's Paula Reid explains. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) PAULA REID, CNN LEGAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): In one of the most anticipated Supreme Court cases of the year, the justices signaling they will side with Donald Trump on the question of whether he's eligible for the 2024 ballot. The former president did not attend Thursday's arguments. Most justices didn't address his role in the January 6 insurrection, instead, focusing on legal arguments around the 14th Amendment. Trump's lawyer, Jonathan Mitchell, an experienced Supreme Court advocate, argued Trump isn't covered by the so-called insurrectionist ban. JONATHAN MITCHELL, TRUMP'S ATTORNEY: A ruling from this court that affirms the decision below, would not only violate term limits but take away the votes of potentially tens of millions of Americans. REID (voice-over): And argued January 6 was not even an insurrection. Only one justice asked about whether it was. JUSTICE KETANJI BROWN JACKSON, U.S. SUPREME COURT: So the point is that a chaotic effort to overthrow the government is not an insurrection?",

In an ominous sign, the chief justice said Murray's arguments were at war with history. CHIEF JUSTICE JOHN ROBERTS, U.S. SUPREME COURT: That seems to be a position that is at -- at war with the whole thrust of the 14th Amendment and very ahistorical. The whole point of the 14th Amendment was to restrict state power. REID (voice-over): And question the consequences of a ruling in favor of Colorado and other states, then following suit. ROBERTS: It'll come down to just a handful of states that are going to decide the presidential election. That's a pretty daunting consequence. REID (voice-over): Even liberal Justice Elena Kagan, asked this. JUSTICE ELENA KAGAN, U.S. SUPREME COURT: I think that the question that you have to confront is why a single state should decide who gets to be president of the United States? REID (voice-over): It was Murray's first time arguing before the high court, and he engaged in several contentious exchanges with the justices and even got a scolding from Justice Gorsuch, who he once clerked for. JUSTICE NEIL GORSUCH, U.S. SUPREME COURT: No, no, we're talking about Section 3. Please don't change the hypothetical. REID (voice-over): And even though the arguments seemed to go well for Trump, he still wanted the last word, addressing reporters outside Mar-a-Lago.

And once he saw how violent it was, and they were marauding the Capitol and looking to hang his vice president, he didn't tamp it down. In fact, Trump sent an incendiary message in the middle of it.But I do think that the Supreme Court has decided as a group that they want an off-ramp. And I think that could be saying that he's not an officer, which is a remarkable constitutional interpretation. But that would be that, supposedly, the framers after the Civil War of the 14th Amendment meant an appointed officer. Or they may say this only had to do with the primary, knowing that no case involving the general election will ever reach the Supreme Court before the election itself. Or they'll say that it has to be decided by Congress. But where in the 14th Amendment or in the Constitution does it say it has to be decided by Congress? The Due Process Clause doesn't have to be decided by Congress. You have equal protection without Congress passing a statute. So in my view, this is farcical, but I do think it's the way the U.S. Supreme Court is going to go. And I think they're going to do it fairly soon. And I think they're going to put in a way that tamps down on all of these challenges across the country. So Trump, I think, will be on the ballot in all 50 states for the general election.",

I think don't really have much basis. And I think that it was very smart of the president to come back and to attack forcefully, like the claim that he doesn't remember when his own son died. He was outraged to be asked that question. He thought it was so unnecessarily personal and filled them with remorse. And the fact that he paused or supposedly equivocated in the answer, I think people can understand that that was way too personal and out of line. And I think that the president wanted to say that. But there's no comparison between Biden's keeping some of the records because his staff took them and put them in his garage, where they were never, you know, subject to anybody looking at them. They were never flaunted as Trump flaunted the records. But you also have to remember that he cooperated completely with the investigation. He gave an interview. You'll remember that Trump always wanted to give an interview to Mueller, but he never seemed to get around to ever giving him an interview. Biden sat down and gave an interview. And all he did was get smeared on account of it. But I think the public will see through this and see that Biden really cooperated. Trump obstructed justice, kept them, refused to return them, and that there's no similarity between the two cases, John. And that's why Biden is not being prosecuted, and Trump is being prosecuted.",

So from a factcheck perspective, if he wants to claim a record, I have no objection.I should point out, though. I mean, he did kind of a softer version of his usual election denial. He said, we need free and fair elections in this country. We don't have them. We have them. We have them. We had them in 2020. We had them before. And so, you know, in these magnanimous victory speeches, he tends not to say elections are rigged, you know. Rigged, and stolen, and so on.

And Putin kept trying to make this case that Ukrainians and Russians, well, they're all Russians. Here's the Russian president. Listen to this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) PUTIN (through translator): Suddenly the Ukrainian soldiers were screaming from there in Russian, perfect Russian, saying, Russians, do not surrender. And all of them perished.

And here was a way directly to -- with a high-profile interview -- to get to the American public and, I would say, to probably influence the upcoming 2024 election. Did he succeed on that? That's one purpose. I don't think so. I mean, when -- if you look the interview, the way it started, it went on for a half an hour with a, you know, detailed history of Russia going back about 1,000 years. There was one point where Tucker Carlson looked a little confused. And I think the date was 1654, and we weren't through it yet. So if Putin was trying to talk to the American public, they would be totally confused. You know, what was this history? It's important to Putin.
