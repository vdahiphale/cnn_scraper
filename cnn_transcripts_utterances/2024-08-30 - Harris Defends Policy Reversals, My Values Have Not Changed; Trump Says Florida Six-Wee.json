In Vice President Kamala Harris's first joint interview with Governor Tim Walz, she defended policy reversals on both fracking and immigration. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KAMALA HARRIS, U.S. VICE PRESIDENT, DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: My values have not changed. I believe it is very important that we take seriously what we must do to guard against what is a clear crisis in terms of the climate. We can grow and we can increase a thriving clean energy economy without banning fracking. We have laws that have to be followed and enforced that address and deal with people who cross our border illegally. And there should be consequences. I think the most important and most significant aspect of my policy perspective and decisions is my values have not changed. My value around what we need to do to secure our border, that value has not changed. My values have not changed. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

I think she's probably a liberal at heart, but her profession is acting. In 2019, she was reading scripts about banning fracking. In 2024, she's reading scripts about not banning fracking. And I guess what the American people have to ask themselves is, do you want an actor who will read whatever script someone puts in front of them as the president? Now, some people may like that, some people may not, but that's how I view her. So, how does that play going forward? Do voters want that? Do they believe that? Does that, is that the kind of person, is that the kind of politician that they want leading the country? On the change issue, Paul and I have been aligned on this for months. It is a change election. And on the economic stuff, she embraced, supported, defended, and promised a continuation of Biden's economic agenda. I don't believe that's tenable.

VANCE (R-OH), VICE PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE:  I think if you look at Donald Trump's full campaign appearances, and, yes, his social media appearances, what you see is two things, a guy with an agenda to lower prices and bring back American prosperity, and a political candidate who isn't stodgy, who likes to have some fun and likes to tell some jokes. I'd much rather have a candidate who's willing to go off script, who's willing to give every interview and is willing to tell some jokes. I do think that's how you lift people up.

The through line is the same. You can love it, you can hate it, but it is the same. And by some measures, he's more popular now than he's ever been, and his administration is looked upon more favorably now than it has ever been. It is Harris who we don't know really who they are. Is she the 2019 Harris who's describing, we have to ban fracking to save the earth for my nieces, or is it the Harris of last night who says my nieces apparently, their future doesn't matter anymore, I'm all for fracking.
