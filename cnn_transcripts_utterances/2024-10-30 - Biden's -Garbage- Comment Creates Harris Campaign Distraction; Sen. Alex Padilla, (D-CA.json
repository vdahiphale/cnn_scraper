I mean, come on, you know you love it, too. You know you do. That sweet CNN election.Both campaigns right now focused on just a handful of critical battleground states with former President Donald Trump, Vice President Kamala Harris both holding rallies in North Carolina earlier today. Harris right now in Pennsylvania. Tonight she heads to Wisconsin. Trump is also gearing up for another event in Wisconsin right now. As expected, with less than a week to go, we've heard both candidates speaking about issues such as inflation and immigration. Today, Harris and Trump have also both addressed these comments from President Biden, which have become a major storyline in the race. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

The White House is trying to clean up Biden's comments. They insist that he meant not that Trump's supporters are garbage, but that Trump supporter apostrophe s, as in one comedian who made the garbage joke rather than supporters with no punctuation. Either way, the most charitable interpretation of the Biden remarks is that he gave the strong impression that he thinks roughly 75 million Americans Trump supporters are garbage.The least charitable interpretation, which he denies he meant, is that he actually thinks that Trump supporters are garbage. The comments do underline why Mr. Biden is no longer the Democratic nominee. They underline why the Harris campaign is reluctant to deploy him on the campaign trail. And they underline why, even for some elected officials who are Democrats, there are questions about Mr. Biden currently occupying the Oval Office. The Trump campaign is now, of course, fundraising off of Biden's comments, and Trump is using the remarks to try to rally his base.

And that mandatory spending about is about 70 percent of our federal spending, and that's Social Security, that's Medicare, that's Medicaid. So yes, if you start to reform those or cut those, there's going to be pain. Now, I don't think that's what he's proposing because I know President Trump doesn't even support touching those programs.But for people from my generation, we're worried we're never going to have those programs because -- and there's for demographic reasons and mathematical reasons why that's true. So there needs to be a more serious conversation in America about what our spending is, where it's going. The truth about where it's going. You know, everybody wants to think that it's in a program that doesn't affect them, but the truth is, it's not. Most of our mandatory spending is indeed in the form of payouts to our senior citizens. And, you know, we decided a long time ago we want to keep those, but we have to make them sustainable. So look, there's so much devil in the details here when you talk about spending ways.

You don't necessarily know who's going to turn out and vote on Election Day. And so, I want to put in some simple stats for you. Get your audience to understand that polls are far from perfect.All right, so how much was the average state polling average missed by since 1972 in the key battleground states? Well, the average error is 3.4 points. My goodness gracious. All the polls right now are well within the -- the poll averages in the key battleground states. How about your, quote unquote, margin of error that your 95 percent confidence interval. It's even wider than that. Get this 5 percent of polls in the key battleground states, those polling averages, get this, missed by more than 9.4 percentage points. So even if you have say a 6 point lead in a -- in a -- in a key state, that ain't necessarily safe. But the 3.4 points I think is very key because I want to apply this 3.4 points to the electoral map right now. So let's say we have an average polling miss and the polls are understating Kamala Harris and she benefits from an average polling miss. Well, what happens? Well, she carries all these Great Lake battleground states. She carries the key states down in the Southeast. She carries Nevada and Arizona out here in the Southwest and she gets to get this. It's a blowout. It's a relative blowout, Jake. It's 319 electoral votes for Kamala Harris compared to 219 electoral votes for Donald Trump. Of course, we remember the last two times, right? We remember 2016. We remember 2020 when the polls understated Donald Trump. What happens if the polls do that again and we have an average state polling this that benefits Donald Trump? Well, get this, Donald Trump gets up to 312 electoral votes. He's the one that gets over 300 electoral votes. Why? Because he carries all the Great Lake battleground states, he carries the Southeast battleground states, and he carries Nevada and Arizona out here in the Southwest. The bottom line is poll after poll after poll have shown this race to be way too close to call. But polls are imperfect.

But she died of sepsis.ProPublica reports this was after hospital staff waited 40 hours to intervene in her miscarriage. They believed any treatment they gave her could potentially be considered a crime, according to Texas law. Here to talk more about this is Cassandra Jaramillo, who reported on this case for ProPublica. Cassandra, thanks so much.

And very quickly the doctors realized she was having a miscarriage and she was admitted into the hospital. And at that time, when she's getting evaluated, her cervix is dilated to 9 centimeters. It's a very complicated miscarriage happening.And yet at the same time, the doctors waited for 40 hours. By the next day, they knew that this was going to be an inevitable miscarriage. And the important thing to note here is that there was no saving that pregnancy in -- at 17 weeks, that fetus was not going to be viable. And we talked to more than a dozen experts who reviewed the facts of this case that said that when you have a patient in these circumstances, there's one of two things you offer, you either speed up the delivery or you provide an abortion to -- to take out the pregnancy tissue that's within the uterus. And that clearly did not happen here and led to a tragic death of a 28-year-old mother --",

So the Texas law does not specify this gray area of miscarriages.Now, after Josseli's death, the Texas Medical Board did provide some guidance with ectopic pregnancies and a condition known as PPROM, which is when a woman's water breaks earlier than expected. However, there's -- there's no indication even with the clarified guidance that that would have done anything for Josseli. Because again, that fetus still had a heartbeat.

The outbreak which has sickened at least 90 people, has many of you asking questions about foodborne illness. Thankfully, we have Dr. Sanjay Gupta on call to give us some answers. Sanjay, many of our viewers, such as Melissa, wanted to know how to decrease one's chance of getting a foodborne illness.DR. SANJAY GUPTA, CNN CHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: Yes, I mean, this is probably the most common question we got. No surprise again, given as we talked about yesterday, nearly 50 million people deal with this every year. It's an extraordinary number, Jake, if you think about it. The -- the basics really do apply here and we can tell you what some of those things are, obviously in terms of clean -- cleanliness, cleaning your own hands, cleaning fruits and vegetables, making sure you separate proteins versus vegetables. I think the -- the key is when you look at this to make sure that you remember that just a small number of bacteria can actually cause illness. And the longer the food stays out -- it really can sort of multiply exponentially these bacteria. So that's really the key thing to remember as you look at the list of things. One other thing, most foodborne illness that we find now, looking at the data, Jake, is occurring outside the home. It's in restaurants, delis, buffet -- buffet halls, things like that. There is such a thing known as the danger zone in the food preparation world. And that's really between 40 and 140 degrees. So, if you're getting cold food, it should be colder than 40 degrees. If you're getting warm food, it should be steaming hot, greater than 140 degrees. Do those things that will go a long way towards keeping you safe.",

But I guess you could see how all could apply and that really had to do with refrigeration. That -- that's the big concern.If you were pulling out oysters in the cooler months, they were less likely to actually become contaminated with a particular bacteria known as Vibrio bacteria. So people still develop this infection, although a lot less nowadays because of refrigeration. That goes back to the basics again, Jake, in terms of preventing foodborne illness.",
