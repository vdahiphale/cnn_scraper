However, we will see an appeal of this decision. The Justice Department has already noticed that it will appeal and this is ultimately a decision that could be determined by the Supreme Court. Of course, President Biden issued this executive order in August. It`s estimated that if it goes through, it would ultimately cost about $400 billion. The program though now in doubt, and it`s also been on hold for the past month because of another court decision out of a circuit court that put the loan forgiveness rollout on hold while all these legal challenges play out. You know, we know that about 26 million borrowers already have applied for this debt relief. The government had already approved million of those applications, but no debt at all will be canceled for the foreseeable future here because of these court challenges. The White House press secretary did however say that the Department of Education will hold on to the information of all of these applicants so it could be processed pretty quickly if the program is ultimately given the green light in court. But we`ll have to see how the courts decide this. If it does go all the way to the Supreme Court, it`s possible that the conservative majority on the Supreme Court could nix this program as well. You know this has been a majority that`s often skeptical of wide-ranging executive and agency action, so this debt forgiveness program could ultimately. Be deemed unconstitutional and if that happens none of these millions of people would get any debt relief. But for now this program is also on hold. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

So the lead team member on this expedition, the guy by the name of Mike Barnett, he had a friend who was a former NASA astronaut. He showed him this video and that made them convinced that this is indeed what they had found. They brought it to NASA and NASA confirmed it, announcing the findings just this week. And so, the big question now is what does NASA do with this? By law, any piece of a space shuttle is NASA property. So NASA is trying to find a way to do something with this 20-feet section to do something that would really honor the memory of these seven astronauts that were killed back in January of 1986, including Christa McAuliffe who of course would have been the very first teacher in space.
