      "sentences": "Absolutely, Wolf. This is the attorney general trying to at least speak out, perhaps for the last time that we're going to be able to hear from him because the election is in less than two months. And we know the Justice Department has a policy whereby he's not going to be able to do speeches after the beginning of October, so to speak.So, what the attorney general was trying to convey here was not only a rebuttal to what the attacks that you've heard from the former president and some of his allies. But also, from what you saw from the Supreme Court ruling back in July, which certainly made it OK for the former president to be engaging with his Justice Department to try to find ways to undermine the 2020 election. That's the other thing that is on the attorney general's mind in some of the remarks here, where he talks about the norms of the department and his effort to try to protect them. And really the warning is, Wolf, if the former president does regain the White House, and if he wins the election in November, and he carries through with his -- with his vow to weaponize the Justice Department to go after his critics, people including, of course, Attorney General Garland and anybody else on the Democratic side. What the attorney general is saying is that there are rules inside the department where anything that the former president tries to do will be known publicly. The career officials here inside the department are not going to just go along quietly. And so, that's one of the reasons why you saw those remarks today from the attorney general. Not only addressing the way things are supposed to work inside the Justice Department, but also the fact that, you know, people are under attack for simply doing their jobs. Wolf?",

They know that they need to appeal to some voters who may not be diehard Democrats but are also not entirely interested in Donald Trump.One advantage in their argument that they're trying to use is the governor's race here and tying the GOP gubernatorial candidate to Donald Trump. And in that way, try to get to more voters, especially as undecided voters. But another one of the top issues in the state of North Carolina is reproductive rights. North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper saying right after the debate that it was the moment that Vice President Kamala Harris spoke on reproductive rights and healthcare that were some of the strongest and could move the needle in his seat. And the campaign is trying to capitalize on those moments with a brand-new ad released just minutes ago. Take a listen. (PLAYING VIDEO)",

This is going to run in the battleground states. Again, another example of how the campaign is trying to use this issue to get to voters and make their argument, especially for those who are undecided.Of course, another important aspect of these campaign stops here in North Carolina today and in Pennsylvania tomorrow is that early voting is just around the corner. So, the campaign trying to get the vice president out and quickly after that debate.",

      "sentences": "It's so great to see you. Welcome to all of you as well. I want to start with where Priscilla left off, which is the Harris campaign is obviously leaning into this notion that she had a very good debate, cherry picking, first and foremost, the abortion issue, and her answer on that, which they're hoping that will help in some of these swing areas in the swing districts.And so that is a focus, but they're also obviously very happy with how she did. And just as an example. Her campaign tweeted late yesterday, our new ad just dropped, and if you hit the link, it's the entire debate. JEFF ZELENY, CNN'S CHIEF NATIONAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT: Right. I mean, they are hoping to capitalize on this debate, keep it front and center, fresh in people's minds. Obviously, people are not going to watch the debate again. Who knows? Some might, but a lot of people watched it the first time, some 67 million, and that is just watched it live. I mean, so many more moments are playing out. And I'm not surprised that A, she's in North Carolina as her first stop, and B, she's talking about abortion. We talked to a Governor Roy Cooper right after the debate, and he said, healthcare and abortion are going to move the needle in North Carolina. We shall see. You ask why North Carolina? A, it is the top example of a state where she can block Trump. It's also an insurance policy for her, if she doesn't win Pennsylvania. Without Pennsylvania, you can still hit 270 by North Carolina and one other state. So, a lot of reasons to go there. Ever since she's been on top of the ticket, they have seen new promise there, because of the 10 HBCUs across North Carolina, because of early voting. Barack Obama won in 2008 because of excitement and enthusiasm. I remember that campaign very well. It's a different state. A lot of new voters in there on both sides, but they see real promise there.",

      "sentences": "It's trench warfare right now. Six of the seven battleground states early voting starts either today or moving forward in the next week. The biggest thing to me is that Harris needs to get voters to back Harris and not just oppose Trump. So, the abortion ad, to me, is excellent. However, people know where she stands on abortion. That's a hotbed issue.What you just heard from those undecided voters earlier is they want to know more. And if I were advising Harris's campaign, she needs to separate herself from Biden. She needs to get out there more in these battleground states, do every interview possible. In that New York Times poll that came out over the weekend, 60 percent want change from Biden. However, only 25 percent think that's Harris. 58 percent think that's Trump. If that is not a telltale sign that she needs to separate herself, which she started to do in trying to be more moderate. She needs to get out there, do interviews. I know her campaign staff has not wanted her to do that. I'm not necessarily recommending more debates because she did so well, but she has to do more media interviews.",

It's interesting that apparently, when she said I called it the triangulation, I'm not -- I'm not him, meaning Donald Trump, and I'm not Joe Biden. I'm my own person that seemed to have done the best on the dials with focus groups during the debate.",

She tried to present Trump, not as a change agent, not as an insurrection person going against the status quo, but as a member of the status quo who has really soiled the American politics for the last nine years.She really tried to present him as someone who is exhausting, someone who has really coarsened our politics for a long time. And said it, we don't need to be like this. We need to turn the page. That was part of her message in trying to change those numbers, which those numbers do show that Trump is seen as a change agent. People are unhappy with the way things are currently in the country. And so, she has tried to take the first step of saying Trump is taking us backwards, and she says, we're not going back. But she also needs to show that she has a vision for the future that would allow people to have confidence that she would be different than Biden and not more of the same.",

      "sentences": "She did a very little, if any, back slapping of the Biden administration during the debate on policy. You know, whereas President Biden, his proclivity was to take a victory lap on the things that they had already done. And she did the opposite of that, where she really focused on her own policy positions going forward, saying, if I were in office, this is what I've already told you that I would be doing.And she's going to try to continue to make that case when she goes on this new way forward tour. But she has the potential for some hitches in the coming week, because they're going to be many more off the cuff media engagements in the battleground states, which as Gretchen notes, she hasn't really done before because of the condensed timeline. She's not going to have the multiple days to hunker down and prepare for all of these various engagements. She's going to meet the teamsters rank and file. She's going to be at NABJ. And they're going to be a lot of opportunities for some off the cuff moments and a lot less time to recover. But as Jeff was talking about early that the real strategy behind that schedule that she and Tim Walz are having over the next few days is because of early voting. 161,000 people have already requested absentee ballots in the state of North Carolina. That is more than double the number of votes that Trump won in 2020.",

And so there are people who are trying to create the feeling that Trump has a professional organization, people like Chris LaCivita and Susie Wiles. When you bring in someone like Laura Loomer, you blow that up. And it makes it very clear, as we saw in the debate stage that Trump is not going to have a professional approach. He's going to go back to his instincts, which is to blow things up. And Laura Loomer, someone who's helping with that. CARLSON: And he's certainly not trying to get any independent voters or suburban moms when they see this kind of behavior. Look, when you have Marjorie Taylor Greene saying that something's bad, you should really pay attention. He's invigorating MAGA only. And I think that's a huge mistake, dog whistling to the racist crowd. I guess he's banking everything on simply turnout of MAGA. We all know that independents have a lot to do with, you know, evaluating and solving elections, but maybe he's thinking that this is going to be a win for him because he's just going to invigorate them so much.",
