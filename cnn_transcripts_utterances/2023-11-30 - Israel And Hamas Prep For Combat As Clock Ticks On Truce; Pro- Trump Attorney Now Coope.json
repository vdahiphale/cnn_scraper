Plus, a story you'll see first here tonight. Nevada officials investigating the state's fake electors for Trump. So, we track them down, and wait until you see what they did next. And tonight, RFK Jr. gaining traction. We are live at his campaign rally. His supporters are going to tell you why it's Kennedy for them over Biden and Trump. Let's go OUTFRONT. And good evening. I'm Erin Burnett. OUTFRONT tonight, prepared to attack at any hour. That's what Israel is saying tonight, as Hamas says it is, quote, at high combat readiness. Both sides preparing for the truce to end tonight if a deal is not reached by midnight Eastern. Last night, the truce was extended 24 hours at the very last minute. And so today, what happened was eight hostages were released. Right now, this is a video of a group of six that just arrived back in Israel within the past hour or so. Two others were released earlier today. They have now been reunited with their families. But the reality of it is that so far, only women and children hostages have primarily been released. That was the deal made by Israel and Hamas. But by Israel's last count, there aren't very many women or children left in Gaza. But, there are 118 men and still being held by Hamas. So, to continue the truce, the parameters of the deal would obviously have to be changed. It was three Palestinian prisoners for every one Israeli hostage, and those women and children. And so, as we await word of the possibility of last minute deal, the reality is that violence is already underway at this time. Hamas claiming credit for a deadly shooting at a bus stop in Jerusalem. And you see the attackers get out of the car, they're in and they actually shoot people waiting for the bus. And you can actually watch that happen in that terror and fear in Jerusalem. Hamas tonight, saying it's celebrating attackers killed three people and injured seven more at that bus stop. In response, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu doubled down on his process to finish this war.

One, it could try to resume the time of operation it had done, in a launched in northern Gaza. That operation, honestly, it's difficult to tell, but does not appear to have been that successful.We know for a fact that the Israeli government, the Israeli military, essentially leveled large parts of northern Gaza. The number of bombs that were dropped in that tiny area over the last 45 days is more than the United States military dropped in years in Afghanistan. And yet, by the Israeli government's own numbers, they believe that they have killed 1000 Hamas fighters. Of the 35,000 they believe are around. So, if you do all of that, and you've killed 1,000 out of 35,000, and your goal is to destroy Hamas, it feels like either you're going to have to do a lot more. Remember, 14,000 civilians have died. So, are you going to -- are you going to go up to the same kind of kill ratios? It seems unlikely. So my guess, is they are looking at more-limited incursions into southern Gaza. And, those will be much narrower, more targeted. If feels again like the goal of completely destroying Hamas, remains elusive.",

And on, that he told Netanyahu, he says he told him that Israel has take further efforts to protect civilians in Gaza when it resumes military action.

But then, we're going to quietly and privately counseled them.They tried initially, the Biden administration, to get Israel not to launch the kind of all out air attack, ground invasion, the kind of shock and awe that Israel did in northern Gaza. That didn't work. But, they did succeed in getting these temporary truces. And, here we run up against another area where the Biden administration has had some success. Israel says it has two goals, destroy Hamas, and bring the hostages home. But the two are in some contradiction. Because the only way you get the hostages home, is by negotiating with Hamas. So, which is it? What are you trying to do, particularly in the short run. So, I think that the Biden administration is trying to press Israel to think hard about, surely the paramount goal is to get the hostages back. And then, you can try this much larger, more expansive goal, which as I say, so far they do not seem to be on a trajectory that they will accomplish.",

Today, Hamas released a brief hostage video, which in a sense highlight some of this contradiction. We're not going to show it obviously, Fareed, just one still image. The man in the video, Matthew Chance just referred to him, Yarden Bibas, he says that his wife, their 10-month-old, and 4-year-old children all of whom were taken captive, he says that they are now dead -- his wife, toddler, baby. And Hamas says they were killed an Israeli airstrike. They have not provided any evidence for that. Yarden in the video blames Netanyahu. Now, I want to emphasize, he's there, right? He's a hostage. This was filmed in Gaza, and released by Hamas. Israel is calling the video itself an act of psychological terror. But it touches on a crucial issue here, and how much impact do you think it has?",

And that was a strategy that was not one that all Israelis agreed with. That was a strategy that was very much part of a very right-wing government.

One of which was a motion to expel the Democrat Congressman Jamaal Bowman, who pled guilty to pulling a fire alarm. Will these efforts go anywhere for Santos? ZANONA:  Well, first of all, that resolution to expel Jamaal Bowman, that would be null and void of Santos is expelled. And I think a lot of these threats are just empty threats, from the congressman. I think he is just trying to project an image that he wants to go down swinging, if he is ultimately expelled tomorrow. And in a pen and pad with reporters, our colleague Haley Talbot also said that he would say that he would try to file some ethics complaints against the members. He was talking about his post-Congress life. He said he's going to potentially write a tell-all book. He did not rule out the idea of participating in reality TV, like \"Dancing with the Stars\". But there was a moment, according to Haley, where he said he is concerned and worried about the idea of going to jail. He said he's made peace with the fact that might be his ultimate, faith that he might be kicked out of Congress. And he did admit that he let down his constituents in some ways. So, a rare, tiny bit of introspection, and contrition there for the congressman.",

It is the latest in a long list of enemies of the Russian leader, Vladimir Putin, likely poisoned. Fred Pleitgen is OUTFRONT. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice- over):  Ukraine's military intelligence wages war in the shadows, but it is hitting the Russians hard, orchestrating cruise missile attacks on Vladimir Putin's Black Sea fleet, ousting Moscow's forces from oil and gas drilling platforms off the coast of occupied Crimea, in the daring, amphibious assault. And, attacking the Russian capital with a long distance combat drones. While maintaining deniability. The man leading the intelligence service GUR is Kyrylo Budanov, one of Russia's most feared enemies. I appeal to Russian soldiers, to those who got lucky enough to survive in destroyed trenches, he recently said, it will be even worse. You have a choice, die, or save your life. But now, Ukraine believes the Russians may have struck back. Kyiv saying Budanov's wife, Marianna Budanova has been poisoned by what they say is, quote, a heavy metal. A Ukrainian source telling CNN Budanova tested positive for both arsenic and mercury poisoning. Ukrainian officials believe the Kremlin could be behind it, like the foreign minister right here on OUTFRONT.",
