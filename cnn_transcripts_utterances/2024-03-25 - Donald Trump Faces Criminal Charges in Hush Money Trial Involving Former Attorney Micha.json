In one, criminal prosecution that could lead to possible jail time, in another, a nearly half-billion-dollar bond payment that is due today.First up, a hearing in the hush money case involving his former fixer, Michael Cohen, and adult film star Stormy Daniels. That will begin in the next hour. Today is also the deadline for Trump to come up with $464 million bond or possibly see his accounts frozen and his properties seized by the A.G., properties like Trump Park Avenue, Mar- a-Lago, his Seven Springs estate, and 40 Wall Street. Let's get straight to CNN chief legal affairs correspondent Paula Reid, who joins us from outside of the court. What do you expect to see today? And I know were getting very close to Donald Trump showing up.",

      "sentences": "Yes, sorry. This is a big day even by Trump standards. Today was supposed to be the first day of the first criminal trial against former President Trump. But instead, his lawyers will spend the morning in the courthouse right behind me with their client, and they're going to be arguing why this case should either be postponed further or dismissed outright after 100,000 new documents, pieces of evidence, were handed over by federal prosecutors.Now, this is a state level case. This new evidence came from federal officials related to their investigation and prosecution of Michael Cohen. And Michael Cohen is it really key in this case. The allegations here are that Trump paid hush money to former adult film star Stormy Daniels ahead of the 2016 election to stay quiet about their alleged affair. Now, Sara, there's nothing wrong with paying someone to be quiet about a personal relationship, but the allegation here is that this money was paid to help his chances in the 2016 election. And then he is charged with falsifying business records and trying to cover up why he was paying Michael Cohen back. Now, in terms of this new evidence, Trump's lawyers argue that it helps their client and they need at least its 90 days to review it. But the district attorney insists that there's only a small portion of it that's actually relevant to this case. And if it helps anyone, it helps them. So Sara, today, we don't expect this case will be dismissed, but we do expect the judge will give us some clarity on when this trial will go forward.",

This is related to the civil trial that he faced several months ago where he was found liable for fraud, both he, his two older sons, and the Trump Organization, the judge found, lied about their net worth to get better terms on loans and insurance rates.And in order to go forward with his appeal, he needs to post this bond while that appeal is processed. Now, at this point, he has not been able to post this bond. Dozens of insurance companies have declined to underwrite him. So unless he can come up with this money some other way, it is possible, Sara, that the attorney general could start seizing his assets. Now that's not something that will definitely start today. There is a process there that we know she has filed paperwork in Westchester County outside Manhattan. So that could be a place where she is prepared to seize assets if she needs to. But Sara, there's also an optics, a political question, right, about seizing property, if that's something that could potentially help Trump. So it's a huge day here in New York for former president Trump.",

He took $40 million cash out of the Trump Organization, his main holding company, and used it to pay other expenses of his, including a very large tax bill that he owed the federal government for $29 million, and including money that he needed to pay to E. Jean Carroll for assaulting and defaming her.So we've already seen his ability to take some of these assets that now belong to the state of New York to pay this judgment, unless he manages to win on appeal. He needs to actually keep these assets in place, according to that court order. He already violated that. So my feeling is, and I feel the A.G.'s office should be pursuing this, they should be looking to expedite these collection processes because he is -- he's already proven that he will find ways to make these assets disappear and to evade the judgment that's been handed down against it.",

They're not going to not pay attention to that court order. They're going to abide by that court order. So those liquid assets, that cash, that is something that can already be seized if he does not post the bond today.The properties take a bit longer to do.

Gallant is also slated to meet with Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and Secretary of State Antony Blinken while he is here in Washington, in part to talk about is Israelis military needs as they are continuing this campaign against Hamas. But then there is also a separate meeting that is set to take place, really drilling in on the potential operation into Rafah. This is something that the White House has been warning about for weeks, telling Israel that they should not proceed with an operation in this town unless they have plans in place to ensure the evacuation and protection of the 1.4 million Palestinians civilians who are there. Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu has vowed that he will move ahead with an operation there with or without the support of the US. Now, officials here at the White House are gathering top Israeli officials, including Ron Dermer, the former Israeli Ambassador to the US to talk about alternative plans for Rafah as they are hoping to avoid a catastrophic humanitarian crisis there. And so these meetings really will serve as a key test of how much influence the US has in Israel's operations at a time when we have seen the relations between the two countries really frame.",

You helped break the news on this movement. You've been following the negotiations for a very long time, very closely. Now, Israel had initially called the idea of handing over 700 to a thousand Palestinians for 40 Israeli hostages. Absurd. How did we get here? How did that change?",

Look at my relationship with Chuck Schumer and now everyone is looking at this relationship with Chuck Schumer and it doesn't look good at all. But if you want another sign of where things are going, and this is also connected to the US-Israel relationship, but also to the hostage deal and ceasefire. Two hours from now, the Security Council is going to convene and vote on a draft resolution put forward by several of its members that is calling for ceasefire during Ramadan, but also for the release of the hostages. The US, as far as I know from my sources, at the moment, is not expected to veto this resolution. And if this will happen, it will be the first time that a Security  Council resolution calling for a ceasefire will pass without the US veto since the beginning of the war, this will be a clear sign from the Biden administration that for Israel, time is running out.",
