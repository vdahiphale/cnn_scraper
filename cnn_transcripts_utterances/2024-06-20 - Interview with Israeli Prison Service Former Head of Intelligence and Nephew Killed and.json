Welcome to the program, everyone. I'm Christiane Amanpour in London. Israel's military appears to be countering Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's goals for the war in Gaza. In a TV interview, IDF Spokesman Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari has acknowledged what many observers have been arguing for months. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DANIEL HAGARISRAEL DEFENSE FORMERS SPOKESPERSON (through translator):  Hamas is an idea. Those who think we can make Hamas disappear are wrong. I'm not talking about the alternatives. This is a decision of the political echelon, and the IDF will implement. But the issue of eliminating Hamas is simply to throw dust in the eyes of the public. If we don't bring something else to Gaza, in the end of the day, we will get Hamas. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

That's because Israeli doctor Yuval Bitton wasworking as a dentist for the state prison service in the 1990s, when he met Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar. Bitton says they spent hundreds of hours together. And one day in 2004, when Sinwar faced a medical emergency, Bitton swooped in and saved his life. Sinwar thanked him when he was later released in the extraordinary prisoner hostage swap for Gilad Shalit. But on October 7th, Bitton's nephew Tamir was murdered by Hamas at Kibbutz Nir Oz. It is an extraordinary story, and Bitton tells us the lessons he learned about what drives Hamas and Sinwar, and what the Israeli leadership continues to get wrong. Since October 7th, Bitton has not spoken on international television until tonight. So, here's our recent conversation. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

BITTON (through translator):  I did not and do not engage in speculation. My nephew came out to defend the community and the country and the Gaza envelope. He fought in those terrible moments of the morning in Kibbutz Nir Oz. Hundreds of Nukhba terrorists infiltrated the kibbutz. They murdered, raped, and slaughtered and burned 50 people from Nir Oz. 50 members of Kibbutz Nir Oz and 75 other members were kidnapped, including Tamir's grandmother, Yafa Adar, the older woman on the scooter. Tamir fought as an emergency squad member. He was seriously injured during his defense of the community. There were only five of them. They didn't really stand a chance. And he was kidnapped while he was still seriously injured, unconscious, and died after a few hours in Gaza. So, it's irrelevant what I think about what would have happened if.",

Sinwar told me clearly in 2004 that they would be ready to sign a hudna, a truce, for 20 years because the State of Israel is currently a strong state. But he also told me that in 20 years, he estimates that we will be weakened because of internal struggles between us within Israeli society. And as soon as they recognize that we are weak, they will attack us. And they also said clearly that we, as Jews, have no place on these lands, on the lands on which the State of Israel is located. These are Waqf lands. These are Muslim lands. These are lands that do not belong to us. Therefore we, as Jews, have no right to exist on the lands. Therefore, there is no compromise. There is no compromise on the 1967 borders or 1948 borders. It's either us or them. Therefore, it's only a matter of time and timing that they will act against us and try to expel us from the place where we live. This is a worldview that they did not hide. He told me that explicitly. But his way was much more extreme than others. His thought that this conflict can only be resolved by force and the struggle they are waging against us, that Hamas is waging, is a religious struggle. The war is a religious war. It is not a nationalist war. It is not about establishing a Palestinian State alongside the state of Israel, it's all Palestine. He only said this more bluntly than other Hamas leaders in the West Bank.",

      "sentences": "Final question, you say that Sinwar and the other Palestinians learned a lot about Israel, they learned Hebrew, they learned about societywhile they were in prison. You learned something about Hamas, but did the government, did the Israeli security, intelligence, society learn anything about Hamas? BITTON (through translator):  Unfortunately, the Israeli leadership did not study Hamas, and a lot of people among us, even in the intelligence service, did not know and learn Hamas well enough. All we needed to do was listen to them. Our attitude towards Hamas was arrogant. We dismissed Hamas. And Hamas said everything it intended to do but we didn't want to listen. This is one thing. The second thing is there was a wrong conception. The conception with which we acted towards Hamas was wrong. Israel should have toppled Hamas in many opportunities. Since 2007, when Hamas came into power in Gaza, we should have toppled it. Hamas rule had to be toppled. And each time we didn't do it, we got an even stronger Hamas, strengthening its rule of Gaza and armoring itself for 2023. The mistake was to differentiate between Gaza and the West Bank, between Hamas and Fatah. It served Hamas. It didn't serve us. We thought that we could isolate Hamas, that we had the technological means to keep Hamas inside the borders of Gaza, and we will have intelligence to alert the enemy's intention to hurt us and that we would be prepared for it ahead of time. I think we established our intelligence too much on technology and less on human intelligence. And human intelligence could have recognized better the intention of the enemy, the intention of Hamas to do this criminal raid, and we could have known about it in advance, and we wouldn't have found ourselves surprised. So, our conception collapsed. Also, the strengthening of Hamas with Qatari money was a mistake. We made many mistakes, because our leaders and IDF and intelligence members were wrong about their conception or their understanding of Hamas.",

And if you look at the spine of Diane's life, here is a woman who was born out of the ashes of World War II, whose birth in itself was a miracle and who started a business at a time when women needed men to co-sign for something as small as a credit card. And her journey from Europe to America as an immigrant, starting a new business, being a single mother, it's an inspirational story off a woman who was trying to chart her own yellow brick road, and that is what I wanted to focus on.

There's going to be a ball that's going to drop at some point. As long as we pick it up and move on.

I'll never forget when we crunched the data and came up with how many cents in the dollar it was. I called up Ebony and I said, did you realize this figure? And we thought it was fascinating.

Sometimes you see someone at the forefront out there at the front of the line for the NAACP and you don't know their story, and he's lived a story of struggles. And one of the things that comes through when you follow his story is that he pushed inside the NAACP for change.

Louise and I are an example of this, because not only have we worked together, you know, on this -- at this book and we may appear to people with -- you know, with the visual eye that she is white and I'm black, but we also, you know, had to work through geographic differences to create this book.
