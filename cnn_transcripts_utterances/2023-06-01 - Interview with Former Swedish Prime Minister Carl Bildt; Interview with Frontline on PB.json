The German foreign minister says new admissions can't be allowed if that country is in the midst of a war.

So, what could all of this mean for the tide of the war? Former Swedish prime minister, Carl Bildt, joins me now from Stockholm to discuss. Mr. Prime Minister, thank you so much for joining us. You are the perfect person to navigate us into the first topic we're going to talk about now and that is Sweden's ascension into NATO. World leaders and NATO leaders are hoping that we can get some sort of resolution as soon as next month in Vilnius where you will have the latest NATO summit.

And President Erdogan is going to be re- inaugurated on Saturday. And after that, we would hope and expect Turkey to start moving forward. And I would hope and expect that Hungary will follow after that.

We have done so in Sweden, no question about that. I think the Turks acknowledge that. Now, this is not a one-off that is done just in half a day and something like. We have sort of changed the laws, we have taken action, but we have an independent judiciary and there is the rule of the law. So, it takes time. But there is no question that Sweden has significantly stepped up its activities against, in particular the PKK, which is the main source of concern. We had some catching up to do. That should be said in all honesty. So, the Turks had a point, but I think the assessment made by all of the nations that have been looking into this, I have heard what -- had reports about what President Biden said to President Erdogan the other day is that this has been done.

So, that's a small hurdle, notguaranteed, but expected that Sweden will become the 32nd member of NATO. A much larger hurdle is Ukraine's position. Obviously, you have President Zelenskyy who is saying that the time is right now, and you have other European leaders and NATO members who are saying, listen, that time may come at some point but now is not the right time, specifically given that the country is in the middle of a war. The German foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock, said this, NATO's open-door policy remains in place. But at the same time, it is clear that we cannot talk about accepting new members who are in the midst of a war. That is a reasonable argument given that once a country is as a member of NATO that Article 5 would be enacted and given that the country is in a war right now, you would have a lot of these countries now involved in this war and that is an escalation that no one wants to see happen at this point. But you are hearing other arguments and other ideas, namely from President Macron of France, who is saying, there should be a different path towards membership. He's advocating a new approach more similar to how the U.S. supports Israel. What is your stance on this issue in particular?",

I guess that President Biden would be uncertain whether he has two-thirds of the Senate, because that's what he needed in order to ratify NATO membership prior to the presidential election. I don't know. But what's critical. I think what President Macron has said is realistic in the way that he says that what they need and what they need now is security assistance. I think that should be the priority, give them the stuff they need in order to fight them with this particular war, repel the aggression. And then, security guarantees of some sort. That is sort of as close to NATO membership as you can be short-term and clearly a road to NATO membership, whether the -- that is next month or next year, that's going to be the discussion and prior to (INAUDIBLE), I guess.",

And it's interesting because in a lengthy interview with the economist, he really did a 180. Early in this war and leading up to the war, he was against Ukraine joining NATO. But now, he has a different view. And here, I'd like to read from what he said. He said, if the war ends, like it probably will, with Russia losing many of its gains but maintaining Sevastopol, it's Crimea, we may have a dissatisfied Russia, but also a dissatisfied Ukraine. In other words, a balance of dissatisfaction. So, for the safety of Europe, it is better to have Ukraine in NATO where it cannot make national decisions on territorial claims. He's arguing that now Ukraine, after the war, whenever it ends, will be one of the most armed countries in Europe and thus, it is probably safer for the alliance to have Ukraine join.

Kosovo ultimately got its independence in 2008, through it hasn't been acknowledged by several countries, including Russia and including Serbia, it never recognized Kosovo's independence. And now, we've recently seen a flare-up and unrest rise after Serbian nationalist boycotted local elections in Northern Kosovo. The majority of Kosovo, about 90 percent of Kosovo is ethnic Albanians, but about 10 percent in the northern part of that region are Serbs, and they boycotted an election, turning the election into just a 3 percent turnout up there. And Albania then instituted their candidates into that -- the contested elections there and put mayors into those regions, for our viewers that aren't fully aware and caught up on the latest headlines there, I just laid it out to you in a nutshell. There have been some protests. There have been some NATO Kosovo forces that have been injured. Some 700 additional forces NATO said they will be sending to the region.

In fact, here at CNN, when I was a corresponded and covered September 11th for the network. And in -- when we were doing that first interview in Caitlyne's bedroom, she shut down entirely.

And, you know, Caitlyne is -- seriously, she's an 11-year-old kid who is hilarious, funny, you know, she loves to be called Caitlyne the Slider Gonzalez, because she plays Little League. You know, she takes silly pictures and sends them to me. And so, I do have this kind of adorable relationship with now an 11-year-old. But like you, Bianna, I see the power. You called it international celebrity. I've never use celebrity for Caitlyne. But yes, I mean, she is an international hero now that people know all around the world. And so, for me, when I think of Uvalde, I think of Caitlyne and I think the tradition that Caitlyne is following, because Uvalde, of course, is known for much more than just this horrific massacre.",

I'm not sure why police would even advocate for people having access to this weapon when it is a weapon that can take out the law enforcement that is supposed to go to protect you. So, I'm trying to wrap my head around that. But the fact that it's very hard, Bianna, to investigate your way, like we as journalist, to investigate with data, with scientific findings with facts, you can't investigate your way out of the fact that you have men who were heavily armed, carrying assault weapons themselves who were afraid, afraid because they knew -- in fact, we hear it in our documentary, they -- we hear the voices when they were giving testimony in the investigation that we got access to, you hear them say, the first one in would have been taken out.

Why were they walking out? Because if a child was heard speaking Spanish in the classroom, they would get hit. They would get hit with a wet ruler on the back of their calf just for speaking Spanish in a place that is an hour away from the U.S. Mexico border that is now a majority Latino, Latino town. And so, as we hear in the film, from one of the people who protested when she was in high school then, she said, we reached our limit. And the kind of abuse that the kids of Uvalde we're facing, I mean, the discrimination was extraordinary. So, after that walk out, six weeks long, Uvalde was not the same.

I think that he's going todefinitely rile up young folks throughout the state that are just excited to see a message that's not what the Republican Party is giving right now, which I think is trying to take our state backwards, right? You know, Joe Biden and the Democratic Party offers a lot of hope right now. They offer a party that's thinking about the future, not thinking about the past and trying to take us back there. And for young people, I mean, we don't want less rights, we want more. And that's what this Democratic Party is fighting for. And so, I tell any young person right now, if you're confused about which direction you're going to vote in in 2023, in our municipal races in 2024, in our next year. You know, you want to vote for the party that's going to have your back and that's going to be fighting for your rights. And that's on the Republican Party right now. And so, the party that, you know, is inspiring change and wants to see more young people involved with it, that has a young Democratic Party chair that wants to see you take on a position of power within it is the Democratic Party. And that's the party that you need to be a part of right now, I think. So, that's going to be my message. But I definitely consider Joe Biden an asset coming through North Carolina. And I would love the opportunity to have some great young surrogates get up there and campaign with him too and provide that other supportive energy and excitement that young folks need to see right now.",

If I can look back after two years in this job and say that we have 100 strong county parties that are vocalized and getting out in their communities and trying to make good things happen in their own backyards, I'm going to have done my job. And if I see more young people involved with this party, then I have, over the last eight years on it, I've done my job, I think.",
