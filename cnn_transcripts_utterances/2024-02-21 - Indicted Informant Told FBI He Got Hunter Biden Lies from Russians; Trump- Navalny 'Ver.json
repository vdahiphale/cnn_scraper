That's what he's charged with. But there are also these other things that he was telling the FBI that are coming up now, because the Justice Department is concerned about him. They are concerned he might flee the country, and they wanted to keep him in jail.

Take a listen to how he put it last night at that town Hall. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP (R), FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT, 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Navalny is a very sad situation, and he's very brave. He was a very brave guy, because he went back. He could just stayed away and, frankly, probably would have been a lot better off staying away. It's happening in our country, too. We are turning into a communist country in many ways. And if you look at it, I'm the leading candidate. I get indicted. I never heard of being indicted before. I was -- I got indicted four times.

And he's also trying to argue that this is an effort by President Joe Biden to attack him and try to prevent him from running for president or potentially becoming president again. But he has received a lot of backlash from this, not necessarily from some of his top allies on Capitol Hill, but from his leading challenger, Nikki Haley, as well as a President Joe Biden, who said yesterday, quote, \"Why does Trump always blame America? Putin is responsible for Navalny's death. Why can't Trump just say that?\" And this is something that we've seen. You know, in the immediate aftermath of Navalny's death Donald Trump did not bring up Vladimir Putin, did not condemn Russia. And he's continuing due to try to argue that he is similar to Putin's top critic here, which of course, again, many people argue is just an absurd thing to state, as a former president and also the leading candidate to become the Republican nominee.",

I mean, it is a little -- it does put the FBI in a bit of a difficult position. It allows people to ask questions. Why would you be running a confidential informant for ten years? And when did you know he was actually under the control of the Russians? And how did you manage that information? So the fact that the FBI is saying that and the fact that it's extremely consistent, not to mention the fact that Vladimir Putin, of course, would favor somebody like Donald Trump to be the next president, as opposed to Joe Biden, based on nothing more than Donald Trump's positions about you know, Russia, Ukraine, and the rest of it.

And it was -- it is very different turnout than we had expected, because people just weren't able to go out and vote. It's a very dangerous strategy to say that you're not going to go vote by mail in this day and age. And I'm not sure what his angle is on it. I don't know if he's trying to set himself up already to have a conversation about voter fraud. But it really, I don't think, benefits the Republicans in any way, shape, or form to not encourage this form of voting.",

Work your way back from that, right? Nikki Haley wouldn't still be in the race if there weren't donors who were quietly, or not so quietly, supporting her to stay in. They don't know if, by some chance, Donald Trump might find himself on the other side of a jail cell. They don't know -- you know, he's a little long in the tooth, as well. So they're -- they need to have a candidate, since he's so volatile, since he goes against the RNC strategies. The fact that there's still very long-pocketed donors who are making sure Nikki Haley is still in the conversation, is -- should let us know that, as she says, Republicans aren't whole cloth with Donald Trump.

I think they have a little more than 8 million cash on hand.We saw once again Trump's outside groups are -- his leadership PAC is giving a ton of money to pay for his legal bills. Are their actual concerns about the money side of things for Trump? My assumption has been, like, there's going to be a billion-dollar per campaign race, no matter what. The money will be there.

I think right now, when you look at Biden's war chest, part of it is that he's really been able to take advantage of the DNC. and they've really been able to fundraise him.
