The rebels appoint a caretaker prime minister. We'll have a report from inside Damascus. Benjamin Netanyahu takes the stands in his own corruption trial, charged with bribery, fraud and breach of trust. The first time a sitting Israeli Prime Minister is facing criminal charges. And a wildfire burns out of control in southern California. Thousands are forced to flee their homes. The latest on weather conditions fueling the flames there. President Bashar al Assad's regime is over, and now Syrian rebels are facing a new challenge deciding how they want to govern the country. And that includes appointing a caretaker Prime Minister. Mohammad al-Bashir seen here, says that he will oversee the transition for the next three months. The rebels announcing they will soon name senior Assad regime officials wanted for torture. The U.S. is not currently reviewing the terrorist designation of the leading Syrian rebel group, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, but Washington could change the designation in the future. Meantime, many Syrians are celebrating Assad's fall from power. CNN's Clarissa Ward gives us a rare look from the capital. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) CLARISSA WARD, CNN CHIEF INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (on camera): The first couple of days we were here, the streets were pretty subdued. There was a lot of anxiety, and today, we're really seeing people are out and they are celebrating. Take a look behind me, all these young people, they are celebrating. They are posing for photographs, holding up their babies to show with rebel fighters, and I actually wanted to bring in, I've just been talking here with this young Syrian woman, Judith(ph). Tell me how this moment feels.",

So, the minorities in Idlib, they don't have representation in it and neither do women. So, while they might not be the Assad regime, which is totalitarian, the way that they ruled Idlib was still authoritarian. And then there's also the question beyond just the western part of Syria, where HTS is now controlling, but the east, where there continues to be fighting between the Turkish-backed Syrian national army and the U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces and this potential stability issues there, because the Islamic states still lurks in the background with a low level insurgency.",

And then if Turkey is allowing this, then HTS would be able to probably take over the SNA since there are certain factions within the SNA that are already pro HTS. But a lot of it, I think, will depend on the discussions happening behind the scenes now between Turkey and the United States.

If he is convicted and loses a potential appeal, he will have to resign. CNN's Jeremy Diamond has more from Tel Aviv. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JEREMY DIAMOND, CNN JERUSALEM CORRESPONDENT (on camera): Well, this is the first time that a sitting Israeli Prime Minister has taken the stand in his own defense in a criminal trial. It is an extraordinary moment, not only for the history that is being made, as the Israeli Prime Minister walked into this courthouse and then began testifying in his own defense. But also because of the moment at which it comes with Israel facing a multi-front war. That was part of the reason why the Israeli Prime Minister sought to delay this very moment of testifying in this case unsuccessfully, though, as the judges ultimately ruled that he would have to show up to testify in his own defense, a process that could take several weeks. We expect that the Prime Minister will testify as many as three times a week for as long as six hours per day, initially beginning with questions from his own defense attorneys who have been giving him a lot of running room here to make comments about foreign policy accusations against the media as he really tries to make his own case. But then the more serious cross-examination will come from the prosecution. And there are three cases that are involved in the trial that the Prime Minister has been facing for four years now. They are case 1,000, case 2,000 and case 4,000, all of them effectively boiling down to allegations of corruption that the Israeli Prime Minister offered favors to wealthy businessmen in exchange for more favorable media coverage or in exchange for lavish gifts. Some several $100,000 in champagne bottles, in jewelry and other gifts that these businessmen allegedly provided. Now, the Prime Minister and his attorneys, of course, maintain that he is innocent, and we have heard the Prime Minister already on the stand making his case, defending himself against these allegations, insisting that he is innocent.

And, Bianna, youhave the court according to our review of that video, you had it almost fully there. But let me read it back to you. We believe he says \"it's completely out-of-touch and an insult to the Intelligence of the American people -- its lived experience.\" This is the first time we're really hearing from Luigi Mangione ahead of this extradition hearing. We know that New York requested this extradition with a warrant earlier this morning, and now he's going to go in front of a judge. We understand he now has a defense attorney who might actually talk to us after this hearing is completed. But when he goes in front of this judge, of course, it's -- he will have the option to deny extradition and fight it or he can agree to it. And of course, then we know that the NYPD marshals are going to be there on the scene, ready to take him to New York to face the charges that were filed earlier today against him, including that one count of second-degree murder. And it's possible, if he decides that he -- you know, is going to agree with the extradition, he could come back as early as tonight or maybe even tomorrow. So, we're waiting to learn more about that. But look, we're not quite sure about that extradition hearing if it started just yet. There aren't any cams inside the courtroom, so, we're still waiting to hear from our reporter who is inside. But let me quickly just go over those new charges that he is facing. It is detailed in this complaint, really how investigators in New York were able to tie Mangione to what they say -- this -- he did in New York, this murder. And it really has a lot to do with the surveillance video that we've heard from police. They collected hundreds and hundreds of pictures and video and really scoured through it to try to trace what they say are his steps before and after the killing. We understand they were able to actually find that he checked into the Upper West Side hostel. According to this report on the 24th of November at night, he actually left that hostel about an hour or so before the murder was committed. And he also used that fake New Jersey ID, and that really was a strong connection according to this complaint. Because remember, that is the same ID that he gave to the officers who responded to that McDonald's in Pennsylvania when they got the call from that employee and the customer who spotted him. So, a little bit more detail of how police are connecting the dots. And you talked a little bit about motive, that's all still being pieced together as part of this investigation. But right now, we're just waiting to hear what happens in this extradition hearing, the next steps in this case, and getting Mangione back here in New York.",

But as we're just a month away from a transition into a new administration, what message is this sending? The message from Trump and now the fact that you have the head of Centcom visiting troops there and Kurdish forces?",

And then, following that, we heard from Secretary of State Blinken saying that the U.S. will recognize and fully support a new Syrian government chosen by the people that adheres to these four principles, that it should be led to -- by credible, inclusive, and nonsectarian governance that meets international standards of transparency and fully respects the rights of minorities, facilitates the flow of humanitarian assistance to all that need -- that in need, prevent Syria from being used as a base for terrorism or opposing a threat to its neighbors, and ensuring any chemical or biological weapons stockpiles are secured and safely disposed destroyed. Is that just too lofty of an ambition at this point, given that we have yet to see what sort -- any sort of governance will look like in Syria?",

But the unease here is no one's really quitesure what this amalgam of terror groups, former terror groups, rebels is going to look like. Syria hasn't had a real election in decades. So, it's very hard to understand how you would begin to establish a true, free, and fair election. And of course, there are many Syrians living overseas, out of the country. Some of those will be flowing back in. So, while I think that Secretary Blinken's goals, you know, sound right, they're pretty aspirational for the point we're in right now where we don't even know what kind of government might be formed over the next few weeks, much less a long-term elected government.",

And there are different interests given who Turkey is supporting versus who the United States is supporting. With Turkey and President Erdogan viewing the Kurds as a top enemy.

On the other hand, they have been bitterly fighting the Kurds. It's the Kurds who the U.S. hires to run the camps in which ISIS fighters and others are being kept. The U.S. is strongly on the side of the Kurds, as you can see with the visit of General Kurilla today. So, this is going to be pretty tricky. And it's going to require some pretty deft management.
