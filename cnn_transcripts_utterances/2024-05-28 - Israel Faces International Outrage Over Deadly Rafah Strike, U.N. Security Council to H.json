John -- is next hour on CNN News episode (ph). AMARA WALKER, CNN ANCHOR OF \"CNN NEWSROOM\": Hi, everyone, and welcome to our viewers all around the world. I am Amara Walker. This is \"CNN Newsroom.\" Just ahead, global condemnation is mounting over Israel's airstrike on a camp for displaced Palestinians in Rafah. This as three European countries officially recognized the Palestinian state. We will have the very latest developments. Then, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy continues his visit to Europe seeking military support. We'll tell you what his trip has achieved so far. Plus, closing arguments in Donald Trump's hush money trial will begin next hour. We are live outside the Manhattan Criminal Court, on what to expect. As Egypt is expected to host another round of indirect negotiations between Israel and Hamas today, Israel is pushing ahead with punishing strikes on parts of Gaza. At least six people were killed in bombings overnight and that is according to a Palestinian news agency, this amid an international outcry over Sunday's strike in Rafah that killed at least 45 people and injured more than 200 at a camp for displaced Palestinians. The Israeli military says, it is investigating the strike which it says killed two senior Hamas officials. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu calls the attack \"a tragic error.\" The U.N.'s main relief agency in Gaza says around 1 million people have fled Rafah in the past three weeks. The U.N. Security Council will hold an emergency meeting in just a few hours from now. Aid groups are also calling on the Council to enforce last week's ruling by the International Court of Justice, which ordered Israel to immediately halt its offensive in Rafah. Now, all of this comes as Spain and Norway formerly recognized Palestine as a state, with Ireland also set to do so. A lot of developments to get through, let's bring in CNN's Nada Bashir in London. Nada, I mean, so much outrage coming from around the world following this attack on this camp in Rafah. What is Israel saying and what do we know about people fleeing Rafah right now?",

      "sentences": "Well, look, Amara, we did hear yesterday from the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, describing this latest attack as in his words, a tragic error. But this was an area known to be housing thousands of civilians in these makeshift tents. This is an area that many displaced Palestinian had, of course, fled to and crucially, this it was not a neighborhood of Rafah that had received an evacuation order over the last few weeks from the Israeli military ahead of its expanded offensive on the city.This was supposed to be a safe zone for civilians. Clearly, that is not the case. At least 45 people killed, more than 240 wounded in this attack. And we have seen that widespread condemnation, as you mentioned, not only from humanitarian organizations, but also, of course, from world leaders here in Europe, a number of leaders have come out to express their condemnation of the attack. And of course, so has the U.N. We heard yesterday from the U.N. Secretary General Antonio Guterres condemning the attack, describing it as horrific. And we have also heard from the U.N.'s Humanitarian Chief Martin Griffiths, issuing a statement in response to Benjamin Netanyahu's comments on Monday, saying whether the attack was a war crime or \"a tragic mistake,\" for the people of Gaza, there is no debate. What happened was the latest and possibly most cruel abomination. Now, as you mentioned, Amara, U.N. Security Council is expected to hold an emergency meeting in the next few hours and all eyes will certainly be on the U.S. response. We've heard from the White House describing the attack as heartbreaking, but it remains to be seen whether or not this constitutes a red line for President Biden, whether we will see tougher action and reaction from the White House with regards to this latest attack on Rafah.",

We've also heard from the foreign minister of Norway and Norway confirming that they have now recognized the State of Palestine, saying that it is regrettable that the Israeli government shows no signs of engaging constructively, that this is a milestone in the relationship between Norway and Palestine. And of course, we are expecting a similar decision to be announced by Ireland later today.Now, of course, over the course of the war, there has been a continued push for a ceasefire agreement that could lead to a viable and lasting two-state solution. There are certainly the political will from many world leaders behind this motion. But of course, (inaudible) how that translates into practical terms. You heard Norway there, the foreign ministers suggesting that Israel has shown no engagement on this front. And in fact, what we have seen, particularly over the last seven months, over the course of the war in Gaza, is an erosion of the integrity of the occupied West Bank in territorial turns, when it comes to any viability of a future Palestinian state. We have seen the continued expansion of illegal settlements in the occupied West Bank. Just in march, Israel's far-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich announced a further seizure of land in the occupied West Bank for the intention of establishing further settlements. These are settlements which are considered by many in the international community to be illegal. So whether this can actually translate to a viable Palestinian state in the future is, certainly, still a key question. It does not seem as though the Israeli government has any will to do so.",

A White House official called the Rafah strike \"heartbreaking,\" adding the U.S. is actively engaging with Israeli officials to determine what exactly happened. Separately, a U.S. official tells CNN that Israel told the Biden Administration that an explosion from the strike ignited a fuel tank nearby, starting a fire which razed through the camp.

According to a U.S. official, Israel has told the Biden Administration that they carried out a strike that was not in the camp itself, but that then lead to a fire perhaps igniting a fuel tank that razed through the humanitarian camp, leading to at least 45 deaths and 200 injuries.The U.S., at this point, doesn't have an independent way of conducting its own assessment and determining the credibility of that explanation. Frequently, the U.S. has had to rely on Israeli explanations for incidents or events. But you can also see where the U.S. is placing the blame here. A National Security Council spokesman has called this \"heartbreaking,\" saying in a statement, the devastating images following the IDF's strike in Rafah last night that killed dozens of innocent Palestinians are heartbreaking. The question, of course, at this point, how does the Biden Administration choose to respond? President Joe Biden said a ground incursion into Rafah would effectively cross a red line and that there will be actions from the Administration if that were to happen. Now, this clearly isn't that. This is the result of an Israeli strike. And yet, it has led to exactly what the Administration was hoping to avoid and working very hard to avoid, that is innocent Palestinians, women and children have been killed as a result of an Israeli airstrike and wounded. This was the situation, humanity catastrophe, the civilian deaths that the Administration was looking to avoid and trying to get Israel to step away from in terms of the way it carried out its operations. So at this point, we now wait to see how the Biden Administration chooses to respond, but it is crucial to note again, the U.S. needs to rely generally in these situations on Israel to carry out an assessment, to give an explanation of what happened. It is incredibly rare to see the U.S. try to carry out its own independent assessment of what happened. So, Amara, big question, how credible does the U.S. find the Israeli explanation in this instance?",

For the Biden Administration though, the question is, what gets you faster to a ceasefire and to hostage release? And that as of right now, is a very difficult question.",

Thanks so much.A story that has dominated our coverage over the past couple of months is about to enter its final chapter, closing arguments in Donald Trump's hush money trial are scheduled to begin in just over an hour from now. Trump's defense team will go first and then we will hear from the prosecution. The closings are expected to take all day today. The judge will likely give the jury their final instructions tomorrow and then deliberations will begin. If they find Trump guilty of falsifying business records, he could face up to 20 years in prison. Let's get right to the courthouse in lower Manhattan, that's where we find CNN's Brynn Gingras. Hi there, Brynn. OK. So today, closing arguments. It is going to take much of the day. What do we expect to hear from both sides? BYNN GINGRAS, CNN U.S. NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Yeah, Amara, five weeks of testimony, 22 witnesses, two of which were the defense, 20 from the prosecution. This is the final culmination, as you have just painted for the viewers, of this historic trial. Like you said, the defense starts first and what we are expecting to hear is from them is for them to really focus on Michael Cohen. They say that the prosecution believes Michael Cohen is their star witness. He is the only one that ties Trump to these alleged crimes and they say he is a liar and they're going to continue to paint him as a liar to the jurors. We are also told they're going to focus on the people that weren't called to the stand, people's names that were sort of evoked by other witnesses that jurors heard, but never met. People like the former Trump CFO Allen Weisselberg, who of course is the one who allegedly made all those calculations for the hush money payments with Michael Cohen, people like Keith Schiller, the former bodyguard of Donald Trump, and the other -- and Dylan Howard, of course, who was with AMI. So, that is the focus for the defense and then it is the prosecution's turn, and we are understanding that Joshua Steinglass is not going to really just rely on Michael Cohen. They don't believe he is the star witness. They're going to tell jurors, look at all the evidence that we have put forward, not only through testimony, but physical evidence. Look at the 34 counts that Donald Trump is charged with and here are the documents when it comes to business vouchers and the receipts and the checks. And so, they're going to paint that story again for the jurors of finalizing their entire case. Amara, if I could give you a sense of what is going on here outside the courthouse, there have been people who have been sleeping in tents in the line, the public line, to try to get in for these closing arguments. Right now, that line is wrapped around this park which is right outside this courthouse. So, this is obviously a very critical moment in this trial. People anxious to see how it goes and then like you just said, then it is going to go to jury instructions and then to those 12 jurors, seven men and five women, to deliberate the fate of the former president.

      "sentences": "What is interesting about this whistle-stop tour of Europe is that it is happening a context where a number of the red lines of allies so far in the war in Ukraine are being actively reconsider it. Take for instance, the question of whether or not allies or Ukraine can use the weapons delivered by allies against targets inside Russia. Jens Stoltenberg has been actively pushing for allies to reconsider their positions. He says some NATO allies haven't placed restrictions on the sale, on the delivery of their weapons to Ukraine. Those that have, he believes need now to reconsider whether or not to lift those restrictions, given that this war is happening right up at that border, as active it is (inaudible) Ukraine to be able to defend itself goes Jens Stoltenberg's argument. It needs to be able to use the weapons actively across the border against Russian targets.The other line that is being shifted, the other important debate that so far had marked something of red line for European allies had been the question of boots on the ground. We know that President Macron had led efforts, the opening of the debate a few weeks ago about whether or not some western military personnel should be allowed inside Ukraine, for instance, to help train Ukrainian troops. We heard from Ukraine's Chief of the General Staff yesterday, General Syrskyi, that he believed French troops would shortly be arriving in Ukraine to help with the training with Ukrainian soldiers on the ground. And whilst France's minister for armed forces hasn't gone so far as to confirm if and when they will arrive, he has said that those conversations are actively ongoing to see what the Ukrainian needs are. And this would be significant, Amara, because you'd be talking about the first western boots on the ground in Ukraine, and that too would mark an important shift and no doubt an escalation. What Jens Stoltenberg is speaking to the question of whether weapons delivered by the west should be allowed to cross the border and be used on Russian targets said earlier today was, look, this was first of all, a war started by Ukraine and he feels that as long as the NATO allies stay short of putting NATO boots on the ground, that'll be OK. It is then, of course, up to the allies' independently decide whether they want to help with things like training. So an important shift to the debate of the lines that is taking place here in Europe, even as President Zelenskyy makes his way around its capitals, Amara.",

For instance, if there is a drug case and their sales to confidential informant that is on tape, you have a good idea what the jury is going to do. But here, Mr. Trump has so much notoriety and so much fame, and you had a few jurors that had read the art of the deal and that seemed to be fans of Mr. Trump.

Why can't the defense go last? Big advantage, very unfair. And to answer his question, that is standard operating procedure in these cases. There are going to be the hundreds of cases across the entire country this year where there are -- today, where there are closing arguments, where the defense will go first.

As you noted, Tyler Wenrich is expected to learn his fate when a judge hands down his sentence. Now, the 31-year-old, just like the other Americans, is accused of bringing ammunition into the country of Turks and Caicos. A fellow American, Ryan Watson, he is also going to be in court. Now, he is expected to decide whether he is going to plead guilty to his charges or if he is going to go to trial.Both of these appearance, Amara, comes just days after Bryan Hagerich was allowed to return home after a judge in the country there handed down that 52-week suspended sentence and issued him a fine. The 40- year-old, he was quick to board a flight back to Pennsylvania on Friday, just hours after the judge ruled that he found \"exceptional circumstances in the case.\" Hagerich told officials that he did not know that the hunting ammunition was in his luggage when he visited the country earlier this year. Hagerich's attorney is also representing Watson. That is the American who again is going to have to decide later today whether he is going to take a plea in the case. And now, over the weekend, his wife spoke to CNN and told us that the attorney is essentially going to present the same kind of argument, the same kind of case as they did with Hagerich, which is to say that Watson did not know that he had this ammunition in his luggage. And so, the judge in the Turks and Caicos Islands should use discretion. Going into this week, we now know that some U.S. officials that have been pretty critical of just how officials in the Turks and Caicos Islands have handled all of these cases. They were really quick to applaud the decision on Friday, saying that it was the right thing to do. And so, we could get a better sense of just how the remaining cases are set to play out when both of these men appear in court later this morning.",
