I mean, there's no question that these are the most cutting remarks that President Biden has made to date since this war began about the Israeli Prime Minister. But so far, he is refusing to tie that rhetoric to any kind of firm consequences for Israel in terms of the enormous financial and weapons support that the U.S. provides Israel. In fact, President Biden, in the same interview where he indicated that Rafah would be some kind of a red line. He also made clear that he would, quote, \"never leave Israel and never cut off its supply of weapons,\" particularly things like the Iron Dome missile defense system, which protects Israeli civilians here from Hamas rockets being fired in Gaza. And so, the question is, you know, beyond the rhetoric, beyond the kind of public feuding, is there more that the U.S. is willing to actually do to put its money where its mouth is in terms of trying to change the trajectory of this war in Gaza? Now, there's no question that the pressure is being felt here in Israel. There's a reason why the Israeli Prime Minister feels like he has to kind of push back as publicly as he has, making his case directly, in effect, to the American public, to other politicians in the United States, when he says that his red line is ensuring that October 7th cannot happen again and reaffirming the fact, which is quite true, that many of his positions in terms of prosecuting the war in Gaza are indeed shared by a majority of Israeli citizens here. So, certainly a lot of rhetoric, certainly a lot of public feuding coming to the surface. The extent to which it actually impacts the war itself remains very much an open question. Zain, Bianna.",

We knew that these crimes against those women, crimes that based on sexual violence, crimes against humanity happened from the released hostages. So, I can say finally, the world can see it through this report that performed by Pramila Patten with cooperation with the Family Hostages Forum and the Foreign Ministry. I can't even think about these possibilities to happen to my sister. And I truly don't think that we needed this report to know and to realize the danger that they're in only from the, you know, the ongoing stress and trauma that causes them since October 7th because they were kidnapped by those terrorists. Those terrorists had enough time to do whatever they wanted to the ones that they harmed on October 7th, knowing that our forces can come any minute. But to my sister and all the other 19 women, including the men that are still there, they could experience that every day, every minute without no one's coming for their help. No one they can scream or call to, to cry for help. And this is why I won't stop until everyone knows what is going on there and why it is so important to release them as soon as possible because it's not the fight to release those hostages. It's a fight of the free world against terror. So, it won't happen again anywhere else. The first move to prevent it is to release them.",
