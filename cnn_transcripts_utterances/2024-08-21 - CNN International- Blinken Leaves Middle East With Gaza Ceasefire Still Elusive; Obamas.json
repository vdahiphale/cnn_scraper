      "sentences": "It is 8After days of shuttle diplomacy in the Middle East, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken has now returned to Washington, though without a breakthrough in the ceasefire negotiations. Hamas rejected the bridging proposal presented by the U.S., Egypt, and Qatar, blaming Netanyahu for moving the goalposts. Blinken insists the Israeli prime minister agreed to the proposal, which included withdrawals of IDF forces from Gaza, but Netanyahu reportedly told the families of those still being held hostage in Gaza to Israel would not leave what's known as the Philadelphi Corridor along the border between Gaza and Egypt, and the State Department official told reporters traveling with Secretary Blinken that maximalist positions by Israel would not be constructive for the talks. Israel's defense minister says the IDF has defeated Hamas's Rafah brigade and destroyed more than 150 tunnels on and near the corridor. Timing of those comments is interesting. CNN's Jeremy Diamond joins me now. Jeremy, at the start of this trip, Blinken has said, in fact, he said repeatedly, this may be the last best chance and there was cautious optimism over the weekend that largely coming from the Israeli side. Now, I think it's safe to say that that cautious optimism has disappeared and impasse may be too strong a word but is it correct to say that beyond the difference, differences between Hamas and Israel, that there's daylight between the U.S. and Israel now?",

I mean, he certainly seemed frustrated with the state of affairs, frustrated with some of these reports coming out about what these really prime minister is saying behind closed doors to other people, other than the United States. And so, the Israeli prime minister seems to be certainly doubling thing down on this notion of Israeli troops remaining at the Philadelphi corridor, his office actually just released a statement saying that one of the goals of the war is to ensure Gaza never constitutes a security threat to Israel. And the prime ministers office statement says this requires securing the southern border.So, clearly, showing that they are not going to drop that key demand, which does appear to be he at least if not the single point of contention, then one of the major points of contention between Israel and Hamas at this moment.",

He's also in the camp and this is what I understand is that whereas Netanyahu says, look, its our security or its a hostage deal is kind of the way that he has framed this that at times, Gallant has been trying to make the case that Israel can achieve the goals of the war and can also reach a hostage deal to get the hostages back.And that was ultimately is fundamental point today was, look, we've defeated the Rafah brigade. We've destroyed over 150 tunnels. We can also maintain Israel security. We can continue achieving the goals of the war, and we can also bring these hostages home, while they're alive, critically.",

When you're talking specifically about Ukraine's incursion into Russia, into the Kursk region, there you see the Pentagon saying this was a surprise move, one that caught the Russians off guard and where the Ukrainians were able to occupy see some lens, some 400 square miles, and where they continue to push partially because they had that element of surprise, and were able to find a weak point that shows -- a weak point that shows the adaptability of the Ukrainian forces and how quickly they're able to take advantage of where they see a weak spot in Russian lines.Now that advance has slowed since it begun earlier this month, but it has shown Ukraine's different abilities with the weapons they're using. A different story in eastern Ukraine, where Russia is advancing there and that's where you hear the warning that Russian forces there are advancing faster than was expected. Local Ukrainian authorities warning civilians there to evacuate tens of thousands ahead of advancing Russian forces. So it's not all simply a great story for Ukraine as they've been able to push on Russian lines there. They are losing ground in eastern Ukraine. Still, it shows how difficult this fight it is and has been for such a long time now. In terms of the drone attacks they've been able to carry out Ukraine's ability to manufacture its own advanced drones and to use those against Russian forces. Ukraine has shown and the expectation is they'll continue to show that ability. In terms of what Ukraine will do with the land it has seized from Russia, there the Pentagon is being very careful in its wording, not supporting the Kursk offensive, but once we've pressed officials here, they instead say they support Ukraine's defense and Ukraine's territorial integrity. So, the Pentagon and the Biden administration is still being very careful in how they address Ukraine's incursion into Russia.",

And when the Israeli prime minister spoke before the U.S. congress, a couple of weeks back, he blamed the slow flow of aid into Gaza entirely on Hamas.

The big challenge that we face as organizations is multi-tiered when it comes to access to humanitarian goods.You initially have the challenges trying to get anything through the variety of Israeli restrictions. Some are official, some were notified about, sometimes you don't even know shipments just get rejected. And then you have the added challenge that has become increasingly difficult over the last few months, and that is this widespread looting and criminal activity that is taking place. The vast majority of it, Jim, actually happens on routes that the Israeli forces designate for aid organizations to be able to go and pick up the assistance. We're quite simply not able to travel those routes safely, which is why a number of humanitarian organizations have been calling for either alternate routes or for some sort of ability, capacity to be able to secure those routes. For example, to be able to use Gaza's police force at the very least to secure these convoys. But that has been attempted in the past. And those police ended up being on the wrong side of an Israeli strike. What this has resulted in, things like hospitals. Already barely limping along, not having any modicum of even the most basic things they need to treat patients. I was in Aqsa hospital yesterday. A few days ago, there is a girl who's a year-and-a-half, she needs a basic tracheotomy or something to, it's a piece of plastic and something that should be readily available in any ICU anywhere in the world. They don't have that piece. They can't stabilize her. And if this little girl survives all of this, she's going to wake up and find out she's an orphan.",

And he said as president, he will ask for the resignation of every officer involved in troop withdrawal from Afghanistan on day one.But he was also it was also very clear he's been closely watching the DNC in Chicago. Take a listen to what he had to say about President Obama's speech last night.

He was taking shots at your president, and so is Michelle. You know, they always say, sure, please stick to policy, don't get personal. And yet, they're getting personal all night long this people. Do I still have to stick to policy? (END VIDEO CLIP) CONTORNO: Trump went on to ask his audience if he should continue to stick to policy, or if he's allowed to get personal, the overwhelming response was that he should get personal and its further explaining their sort of campaign's point of view on this whole matter going forward. Senator J.D. Vance, his running mate earlier in this event, said that his in his view, the mantra going forward should be mean tweets and world peace -- Jim.",

Of course, he served his president for four years.And yet poll after poll show Harris making major gains in this race, that same poll has her ahead of Donald Trump. So what are the numbers tell us?
