Reforming the Supreme Court is one of these issues that's very hot with young people. And if Democrats pick up that mantle, it's a way to get on sides with the voters they need in the future.",

I'm Sara Sidner, with Kate Bolduan. John Berman is out today. This is CNN NEWS CENTRAL. (MUSIC) BOLDUAN:  Right. So new this morning, a stowaway discovered on a Delta flight moments before takeoff. Yes, another one. Same airline, different departure city and different destination. In case you were wondering, this time, it happened on Christmas Eve in Seattle. And Delta says the Honolulu bound flight left. The gate was taxiing when the person was discovered. Now, this is the second time in a matter of weeks that Delta is dealing with this. And you'll remember the saga just before Thanksgiving, when this woman was snuck onto a Paris-bound Delta flight and made it all the way to Paris, which then triggered weeks of drama to get her back to the states to face charges. CNN's Carlos Suarez is at Atlanta's Hartsfield International Airport. Carlos, what are you learning about this latest incident?",

This flight was from Seattle to Honolulu. It was delta flight 487. This passenger was able to get past the security checkpoint the night before this flight. And then the day of the flight, the passenger is able to get on board this plane without a ticket. Now, at some point, as the aircraft was taxiing out for departure, the crew there identified that this passenger did not have a ticket, and so they went back to the gate and somehow the passenger was able to get off the plane before authorities arrived there, though, they were able to take that passenger into custody in a bathroom at this airport in Seattle. Now, Delta, of course, was quick to put out a statement saying in part, quote, that as there are no matters more important than safety and security, Delta people followed procedures to have an unticketed passenger removed from the flight and then apprehended the passenger, whose identity has not been released, Kate, was arrested and charged with trespassing -- Kate.",

We already had some problems on the ground in Dallas yesterday because of some heavy rain. You had some ground stops at both airports.Today, expecting some problems across the South, could be some delays from New Orleans to Atlanta because of the storm. That will continue to swirl. And then the atmospheric river doesn't stop along the West Coast. We'll continue with some rain and snow from Seattle down towards Portland and San Francisco as well. The storm that we're watching across the South will continue to pump some strong and severe storms that will be possible. Right now, we don't have too much in the way of watches. A lot of these storms have kind of degraded on the overnight, but by tomorrow, we're really worried about this outbreak of severe weather. That's likely we have a level three out of five, enhanced risk of severe weather there in that bullseye from Louisiana into Mississippi. And then it switches east as we go into Sunday. You can see that bullseye across the southeast from Charlotte down towards the Florida Gulf Coast. Now, we're looking at that threat for tornadoes could be on the stronger side. We're talking about EF2 or greater possible. It is December, right. So we don't usually talk about tornadoes, let alone tornadoes this strong in December. When we're talking about, you know, tornadoes in December, it's not impossible. It is on the more rare side. But if you're going to get them, they are most likely along the Gulf Coast. Texas and Louisiana already had reported tornadoes from yesterday. If you look at from the entire year, December is one of the least likely months that we can get tornadoes. You can see averaging 43 in the month, much, much less compared to the nearly 200 over 200 in the spring months of March and April. And this year has just been so incredibly active. We've had, almost 2,000 tornadoes since January 1st, way above the average. So as we continue to go through the day today, those showers and storms will continue to fire up a line of storms that can bring you the damaging winds, the large hail, and some of those tornadoes that pushes east going into tomorrow. With that even greater severe threat, you can see those storms. Look at them blowing up and igniting. And a lot of that rain starts to push to the east. So by the weekend, we're looking at more of those problem spots up and down the east coast. As these storms continue to shift east, look at where we can find some moderate delays from Washington, D.C. up to New York by Sunday. Also notice the Pacific Northwest is nonstop with headaches because of the rain, the snow, and the gusty winds that continue as that atmospheric river really just doesn't let up -- Sara.",

But despite the new find, the CDC -- CDC still maintains that the risk to the general public remains low.Let's bring in CNN's Meg -- CNN's Meg Tirrell for much more on this.

This is a mutation that they've observed or a set of mutations they've observed in this hospitalized patient in Louisiana that seems confined to this patient in Louisiana. They did not find these this set of mutations in the birds from which they think that this virus was this patient was infected. And there is no evidence that this has been passed on. So that is the good news. The more concerning news, and that's using sort of CDC's term, they say this is concerning. This shows that the virus has potentially mutated in this patient to give it a better way to potentially infect the upper respiratory cells in humans. We haven't seen human to human transmission of this bird flu virus. And a big reason for that is it's not very good at infecting the cells in our upper airway, our nose and our throat, for example. And so what they're seeing is that in this patient who's been hospitalized, the virus mutated in this way to sort of gain these mutations. And these are similar mutations to ones seen in a patient who was hospitalized in Canada as well. And so this has not spread beyond this patient that we know of. So the CDC still says the risk to the public is low, but it shows that it can potentially do this. And we should be trying to limit the virus's spread to people from animals as much as we can.",

And on -- and in terms of tracking and trying to get in front of -- well, let's call it pandemics. You also have some really interesting new reporting about work that researchers are doing on the beaches of New Jersey to try and beat the next pandemic. What's this all about? TIRRELLSo our colleague Brenda Goodman did this fabulous report. It's on CNN.com. There's beautiful footage of these beaches where every May, researchers return because horseshoe crabs are mating and laying eggs. And what that does is brings hundreds of thousands of birds of all kinds of different species to these beaches in Cape May, New Jersey, where they poop a lot after they eat those eggs. And that poop, these researchers say, is really a treasure trove for research about viruses. And so they collect hundreds of samples from this bird poop, and then they sequence it in labs, and they figure out if there are flu viruses in there. Now they did this last May. They did not find H5N1 in those samples. However, they have been doing more research in ducks around the country, and they did find it in ducks in Tennessee in November and December. And all of this research really gives us an idea of where H5N1 is in birds, how its getting introduced into our bird populations in the United States as these birds travel really long distances in their migratory patterns. And so this really gives us an insight into what's going on with this virus that, unfortunately, is swirling all around us and unfortunately causing these -- these risks that scientists are quite worried about.",

CNN international correspondent Hanako Montgomery joins us now. What led up to what happened and then what happens next? HANAKO MONTGOMERY, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Hi, Sara. I mean, we're talking about two impeachment votes in the span of less than two weeks. I mean, this is unprecedented not only for South Korea, but also, frankly, much of the democratic world. Now, there are a number of reasons why the Acting President Han Duck Soo was voted to be impeached today. But what really stood out is actually what the main opposition party leader said during today's vote. Give this a listen.
