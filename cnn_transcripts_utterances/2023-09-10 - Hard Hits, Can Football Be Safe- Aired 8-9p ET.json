Whether you measure it by the blockbuster broadcast ratings or the billions of dollars in revenue it generates, football remains America's favorite sport. According to a Nielsen survey about 200 million viewers watched the last Super Bowl. That's 60 percent of all people in the United States. In addition to the NFL, there are now multiple pro-football leagues like the XFL which is co-owned by Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson and you'll hear from him shortly, but football also has more than its share of controversy and tragedy. Injuries are common. Some of them life- threatening. Is playing such a high contact sport worth it? Over the next hour CNN's Coy Wire who spent nine seasons playing in the NFL gives us an inside look at what football can do to a player's body and mind, and what's been done to try to make it safer. He also sits down with championship winning coaches, current and former players, and takes us to the sidelines to report on how the game has changed.
