JP Morgan and Barclays cutting their China growth forecasts amid concerns particularly about further weakness in the giant property market there. China's woes continue to help pressure Asia stocks and modest rise as you can see in SHANGHAI, but the HANG SENG now has fallen for five straight sessions. It's now down around 7 percent so far this year, and in fact, it's nearing bear market territory. So I'm talking about a 20 percent drop from its most recent highs. In the meantime, let me give you a look at what's happening on Wall Street green on the screen pre market after two days in fact of sharp losses driven in part by those interest rate concerns I think. And China, European shares, however remains near five week lows. Plenty to get to as always throughout the next hour, but we do begin in Ukraine, where officials say they're not expecting American F-16 fighter jets to be delivered this year. Ukraine's Air Force says progress is being made with pilot training. But it's not expecting to operate that F-16 this coming autumn and winter. Kyiv, of course has repeatedly asked Western allies to provide those jets. And in other developments the Russian missile attack left 10,000 people without power in the eastern Dnipropetrovsk region. And Nick Paton Walsh is there with more. Nick, what can you tell us about that attack?",

The hope that they could be expedited to the battlefield was times ambitious. Certainly it's a big technical challenge to train up Ukrainian technicians to be sure they can provide the extraordinary amount of servicing and repair that high tech jets like that require, then there was pilot training too, something I'm sure that was feasible. It doesn't seem though, that NATO has been able to put that together fast enough. And it is essentially what Ukraine is so deeply lacking on the battlefield here. The counter offensive slowed by the fact Russia has air superiority, but as we saw yesterday, they are still moving forward taking new ground. And we're on the outskirts of Urozhaine, which yesterday Ukraine announced had been recaptured. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) WALSH (voice over): There may be ruin around them but that direction is forwards. We're with the 35th Ukrainian Marines. The first report is to get to the outskirts of Urozhaine. Yet another village announced liberated Wednesday. The victories may be small.

And what's been called one of theworst days in Darfur was genocide-scarred history. Eyewitnesses spoke to CNN about a gruesome massacre that unfolded in West Darfur two months ago. Our Nima Elbagir has this exclusive report and I must warn you, some of the images that you're about to see are graphic, and the report does also include distressing descriptions of the conflict. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) NIMA ELBAGIR, CNN CHIEF INTERNATIONAL INVESTIGATIVE CORRESPONDENT (voice over): The streets of El Geneina in Sudan's Darfur region are eerily quiet, filmed at great risk by survivors. The video shows racist graffiti defacing walls and corpses littering the streets seen here in their own propaganda. Sudan's paramilitary Rapid Support Forces RSF occupied Geneina in June after a heavy shelling campaign and fighting in their war for dominance over Sudan's army. A CNN investigation has now uncovered some of the cost of the RSF victory here in Geneina. Survivors aid workers and body collectors described to CNN how. Together with their allies, the RSF gunned down hundreds of civilians in and around Geneina on June 15, in one of the most violent massacres to date in the recent history of this genocide-scarred Sudanese region. Using satellite images, eyewitness testimony and geo locating what few videos have made it through the telecommunications blackout, cutting Darfur off from the world. JAMAL KHAMISS, HUMAN RIGHTS LAWYER &amp; EYEWITNESS: I lost 8 members of my family that day during the escape from El Geneina to Chad. ELBAGIR (voice over): This man says he buried hundreds of victims in Darfur since April. But on that day, he couldn't even reach his slain relatives. The RSF troops are drawn from Darfuri Arab tribes and together with its leader Mohammed Hamdan Dagalo, aka him a deep are implicated in the year's long genocide in the region against African tribal groupings. It's unsurprising then that the war between the RSF and Sudan's military for control of the country, took an even more sinister turn here in Darfur. Mirroring the RSF previous tactics, forcing civilians to flee many were arriving in Geneina. That is until June 14 when the West Darfur Governor seen here at his arrest by the RSF was executed. The RSF blamed for the killing denies responsibility. As hundreds attempted to flee they were harassed and threatened. Even children joined in, a lucky few made it to Chad. SABRY MOHAMED, FORMER EL GENEINA RESIDENT &amp; EYEWITNESS: They were going into houses killing people. Snipers were everywhere.

      "sentences": "Well Julia, thanks for having me and thanks for the question. You know,Stablecoins sound funny, because all of the language of the crypto world sounds funny, but the concept is really familiar. I think to most of your viewers. The concept is just the modern internet iteration of things from past generations like traveler's checks, or as you say, prepaid cards, that the concept is the holder of this instrument has something that is a claim on dollars deposited someplace, and that instrument can be traded and used for payments for goods and services. And the recipient can redeem that Stablecoin for $1. So if you think back 50 years to when we used to take out traveler's checks if you and I are old enough for that. The idea was you would purchase a book of traveler's checks, and you could go anywhere in the world. And those traveler's checks, even though they weren't cash would be accepted as cash because the recipient knew that somewhere American Express had dollars on deposits. And that was a way that people abroad could access the dollar system. Stablecoins are just different because they're native to the internet. They don't require an underlying bank account. And that's why they become so important in countries where dollars themselves are readily accessible. Dollar equivalents that don't require a U.S. bank account. That's kind of a big idea.",

And not only do they provide a benefit to perhaps global citizens around the world that have, for example, high inflation economies. And are worried about their, own currencies and the value of them.

Governmentsaround the world are fighting dollar dominance. And we've all grown up in $1 denominated world since World War Two. We have a lot of luxuries and benefits that come from that fact lower borrowing costs, cheaper goods and services for people who hold dollars, and things that Americans enjoy every single day. Governments around the world for political reasons are trying to decouple from the dollar. The point about Stablecoins is the citizens of some of these other countries don't want to decouple from the dollar, because for all of our problems, the dollar remains one of the most stable and most widely accepted currencies. So the concept is Stablecoins are a way of allowing citizens of countries like Russia, India and Brazil. Those kinds of places, to hold their assets in dollars, and to maintain demand for our currency at a time when other governments don't want to do that.",

It gives them a protection I think that other countries don't enjoy. You can understand those that might not really understand what's going on and look at this and say, hang on a second. Developing, providing guidelines, regulating and promoting Stablecoins and other crypto as an example might detract from the use of the U.S. dollar. Why is that a spurious argument, Brian?",

      "timeStamp": "09:25:00",
      "speaker": "BROOKS",
      "sentences": "Yes, well, so, Julia, I think there are a couple of reasons. I mean, first of all, it's important that people separate the concept ofStablecoins, which really just are an internet enabled prepaid card. OK, from things like Bitcoin, which are an entirely different -- altogether, they have a different valuation framework. They trade more like stocks and bonds and less like cash assets that Stablecoins do. But Cryptocurrency Blockchains are what enables Stablecoins to be secure and to transact instantly on the internet. That's the first differences. It's really important here. But the second and more important point, I think, is, you're right when the debt downgrade happened just a couple of weeks ago, not very much happened in markets, which is why a lot of people might think, who cares? This is not that big of a deal. And my answer to that is, you know, 20 years ago, when the dollar was 73 percent of all reserve currencies, we had a big buffer. You know, we were very clearly the asset of choice globally, for any major transaction. We're now at just north of 58 percent. Somewhere between 58 percent and 50 percent is a rapid cliff that we will go over if we're not very careful. And so, yes, at 58 percent, we're still a solid enough currency to absorb those kinds of shocks. And you know, with the next fiscal cliff, depending on where it is, maybe we'll have enough buffers to survive that too. But we're getting awfully close to an edge that we should be worried about. And so anything that makes dollars more attractive, that increases the demand for dollars is ultimately good for the role of the dollar in the system.",

So I will say, you know, during my year as comptroller of thecurrency in the U.S., I worked very closely with Chairwoman Waters, and I found her to be very smart, very hardworking, and she understood the issues. The about face is just that it's an about face. And the rumor is that people here are that the White House threatened to veto the bill. So the real question is not why the Chairwoman or Former Chairwoman Waters abandoned ship, the real question is, why is the administration so opposed to all of this? And I think there are a couple of clues. One is its quite clear that this administration believes that the future of the dollar is Central Bank digital currencies. This is a whole another show that you and I've talked about before we can talk about again. But Central Bank, digital currencies do compete with private Stablecoins, because they're issued and cleared by the Federal Reserve. Their issues, why one wouldn't want those kinds of assets to be the dominant asset but right now, there's a competition going on. And the second thing is Stablecoins sit on top of Blockchains. And for whatever reason, the administration doesn't seem to be excited about Blockchains because they're permission less. They're private and they're not controlled by the government in the same way that the current banking and payment system is. And I think that scares some regulatory officials. So we have to get over that hurdle. There clearly are a number of Democrats who've already done that. The bill in the House the past two weeks ago out of a committee did have some democratic support. But I think the leadership at the moment is opposed for the reasons I've just said.",

You know, you think back to the era that brought us Dodd-Frank, and Sarbanes-Oxley, the era of things like WorldCom. And, you know, other sort of frauds of that era, Enron, for example. And nobody thought that we should close the stock market because there was a fair amount of scams going on inside of the public equities markets. I think here the issue is people are scared of technology, and things that are new and uncontrolled are things that frighten them. That again, is why the only way forward is through a credible bipartisan regulatory framework that creates confidence that this business is for real and isn't a bunch of people of the FTX variety.

The brands that we reached out to about having their ads show up on this page were shocked that their ads had been placed next to this kind of content. And the Internet and Television Association and Gilead Sciences, that they both immediately pause their ad spending on Twitter X, after we had alerted this, alerted them to this problem. The Internet and Television Association also said that they had actually been using some of the safety controls that are meant to avoid just this kind of thing happening.

So you know that gives you a sense of the ratio, most of the funds. And that's very much our focus, and its part of why we have that direct giving model. Most of our funds are going right out to those environmental partners.",

Do you have members from the gas and oil sector; by the way, would they be welcome? Banks is another great example that has exposure, perhaps to the fossil fuel industry? Are you willing to accept them as part of the deal? Because it gets sort of complicated in terms of, I guess, morals, ethics, what they're willing to provide? Where do you stand on those?",

And our goal is to have members at every stage of the journey. So some of whom their 1 percent commitment might be the first time they're stepping into taking environmental action. For others, it might be much farther along the path. And so, we don't have any outright prohibitions against any particular types of companies. That said, we do on a case by case basis, determine if a company joining would be brand damaging. So at this point, we don't have any companies in the oil and gas industry. I think if they were to approach us, we would have the conversation. And then we would see if we could be part of meaningful change and make a determination from there. Because one of the really important things for us is that, you know, seeing what's happening in the world right now, it's going to take all players, there's no one, you know, one agent who can make all the change happen. So it's truly collective action. And so, the more we can stay in the conversation with grassroots non-profits, with local government, with the big multinational companies and everything in between, the better, we can create that community of change makers, who are really seeing that we have to come together to create a resilient future.",

I just wanted to ask about Maui, do you have charities that support the efforts there or anyone that's working there?

And one of the things that we're able to do, because we have such a strong global network that shows up reallylocally is, when there are disasters like this, we are able to, you know, pretty quickly pull together a set of local non-profits that people can give to you, because that's, it's a very human response for people to want to be able to provide help. So, you know, for this particular tragedy in Maui, we have identified a number of non-profits that we've shared across our network and publicly, and I'm happy to list those here if you'd like.",

That's according to the World Bank. And while progress has been made in reducing poverty, growth is sometimes uneven and has slowed in recent years.
