The U.S. Juneteenth holiday well underway, but westill have the rest of the world to survey and a busy hour ahead on the program, including relations reboot, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Chinese President Xi holding the highest level talks between the two nations this year. Both sides citing progress in their attempts to break the diplomatic ice. Secretary Blinken describing the talks as candid and constructive and reiterating that the United States is not trying to contain China's economic growth, a live report just ahead. And today's meeting comes amid signs of economic slowing after China's initial post lockdown growth spurt and some disappointment at least for now over broader stimulus pronouncements. Goldman Sachs lowering its GDP estimates for the country to 5.4 percent this year. That's down from an early at 6 percent rise. And that brings Goldman Sachs numbers in line with the OECD the Organization for Economic and Cooperation and Development says its latest note that while the global outlook has improved. Risks remain including the impact of still high inflation and rising interest rates. Its views on China jobs and the potential productivity impact of artificial intelligence. Of course, we couldn't escape that one. Coming right up the OECD Secretary General Mathias Cormann will also discuss their new focus on women's economic empowerment. And in the meantime, a smattering of red arrows across China, Hong Kong and Japan today the NIKKEI leading the declines falling 1 percent but still sitting around those 33 year highs. Famed investor Warren Buffett denouncing after the close that Berkshire Hathaway will invest more money into Japan's five largest trading houses. Buffett's bullishness helped jumpstart the rally in Japanese Stocks earlier this year. And Europe softer after a winning week that saw the XETRA DAX over in Germany hitting record highs. Wall Street of course closed today for the Juneteenth Federal holiday, but certainly no day off the U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken. And the future of humanity hinges on China and the U.S. getting along. That's what China's President Xi Jinping told U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, according to Chinese TV, as the two superpowers tried to manage tensions and turn the temperature in relations down. For his part Secretary Blinken said both sides agree they need to stabilize their relationship. Earlier he met with China's top diplomat for around three hours. The State Department called it a candid and productive meeting. Blinken says a good relationship is in the world's best interests. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ANTONY BLINKEN, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE: We have no illusions about the challenges of managing this relationship. There are many issues on which we profoundly even vehemently disagree. We will always take the best course of action to advance the interests of the American people. But the United States has a long history of successfully managing complicated, consequential relationships through diplomacy. It's the responsibility of both countries to find a path forward. And it's in both our interests and the interests of the world that we do so. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Meanwhile, Italy has moved to protect tyre giant Pirelli's independence from China over the weekend. Pirelli told investors that the Italian government has blocked Chinese chemical companies Sinochem and taking control of the company. Sinochem is Pirelli's biggest shareholder. And at the same time, the Financial Times reports that drug maker AstraZeneca is planning to spin off its China Business to protect itself from growing tensions surrounding Beijing. The company said it would not comment on rumors regarding future plans. Anna Stewart joins me now. Anna, I'm not even sure what need you. I've given all the details there. But you're going to have to apologize for that. You're going to have to explain it. Let's get back to Pirelli and talk about what's going on there, because this is complicated from the initial investment. It was never a Chinese state owned company that originally invested in Pirelli. It then just got more complicated. So what's the Italian government saying on doing here?",

      "sentences": "Ultimately, this is the Italian government flexing some political muscle. I think stripping Sinochem which as you say,a state owned from having influence on strategy and leadership decisions at Pirelli, which actually means in many ways return to the status quo with Camfin, which is a private investment vehicle, which has a much smaller stake and for only 14 percent. It's controlled by Pirelli CEO, Marco Tronchetti Provera, and it will retain a lot of influence here. It's an example of a government using so called golden power rules to protect an asset of national strategic importance naturally, that is what the Italian government said last week in a release. They said this is all about Pirelli's Cyber Tyre, which uses chip technology to collect vehicle data. So they're protecting their interests by stopping the Chinese state from having any influence on this company's strategy. But, you know, there's also here of course, an issue of national pride. This is one of Italy's oldest, most successful internationally recognized brands Pirelli. It's been in a Pirelli family since it was founded. In fact, the current CEO married into the family, he took over from his father in law, who is the founder. And as politics, the Italian government is here showing a very strong stance against China. And as you say, the fact of the matter was, there was a very much a shift in terms of that Chinese stake and who actually owned it, it was Chem China that got swallowed up by the Chinese state company, Sinochem. So there has been a shift in the politics as well. There's a lot going on there, I think, in this decision.",

That's a Soviet era tank built in the years after World War Two. Now according to this account, the tank was crammed with 3.5 tons of TNT, plus 1000 kilos of explosives extracted from other bombs as well. According to this account, apparently a tank man got in the tank essentially pointed it in the direction of Ukrainian lines jumped out it went forward. It appears to hit a mine and also got hit by an RPG round fired from the Ukrainian lines. And then it explodes. The explosion is massive. Clearly, there are some huge quantities of explosives in that tank when it goes off. We don't know whether it actually succeeded in puncturing the Ukrainian lines. It appears to have been about 300 meters from the Ukrainian lines. And we don't know if they actually the Russians were able to push forward in that particular area, but it does represent a new if somewhat crude tactic.

But energy prices now, well below the peaks and will have started to go down. And, you know, one of our key messages to governments around the world is as growth picks up, as energy prices and inflation comes down.
