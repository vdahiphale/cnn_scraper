President Biden set to sign the U.S. debt ceiling bill into law after its passage in the U.S. Senate. Thursday night's vote taking the threat of a U.S. default off the table and will allow the government to begin raising much needed funds from the bond markets again. We've got a live report just ahead from Washington. Also today important jobs data just out in the U.S., the American economy adding a whopping 339,000 jobs last month much more than expected. There were big upward revisions for March and April too but unemployment is heading higher and wage growth is easing. Here is the market reaction U.S. futures have been solidly higher all morning as investors cheer -- on the debt ceiling lots to be happy about. And they are holding on to those games right now as you can see Dow Jones up around six tenths of percent S&amp;P also half a percent higher. And then in Europe, we've also got higher markets as well after a strong Asian handover. Now Hong Kong, the big winner in Asia was shares soaring around four percent hope for new stimulus in China helping the market mood there as well, the NIKKEI closing at 32 year high. Now, a busy day as always so let's begin with the latest jobs numbers that we've just reported on U.S. hiring, posting its best months since January, the new numbers share to pose fresh challenges for the Fed. Nela Richardson, the Chief Economist at HR and Payroll firm ADP joins me now, great to have you with us. I mean, we were expecting 190,000, we got 339,000 incredible numbers. It's not what we expected. I want you to take me through what you're seeing hiding behind and under the hood.",

There are three patterns that we're looking at when we lookat ADP private sector data and the over 25 million workers that we provide services for in the U.S. Three trends, one, that the market is incredibly strong, but also incredibly fragmented. So you do see pockets of weakness, or in certain industries like manufacturing, which is consistent with what consumers have done in shifting their purchasing this hiring is tends to be led by small firms. And importantly, in terms of the Fed decision, we are seeing a deceleration and pay growth, which means that wages are not pushing up inflation.",

They're not taking any direct responsibility for the invasion or raids being carried out by Russian nationals, who are badged effectively to the Ukrainian Armed Forces crossing into Belgorod region. But that's just what they have done with the local authorities in Russia saying two people have been killed in bombing or mortar attacks in frontline villages at the same time in Smolensk, and other Russian city North of Kyiv. The oil refinery has been hit by what is assumed to be a drone attack similar to the one that hit in Krasnodar south of the country. So there is a pattern emerging here on top of the pattern that is long preexisting, which is the systematic targeting particularly of Kyiv, particularly of civilians by the Russians inside Ukraine. Now this is having a strategic effect the campaign inside Russia with Vladimir Putin coming out today, saying that, essentially I'm paraphrasing here we mustn't get rattled, we mustn't allow them to destabilize Russia. But that's exactly what these relatively small scale attacks inside Russian territory are intended to do to destabilize the Russian efforts, with Ukraine, making all kinds of claims about the movement of Russian Special Forces into that area, which are unverifiable, but again, are intended, whether they're true or false. Discomfort and dismay among the Russian forces as they continue to threaten to prosecute a campaign, a counter offensive inside Ukraine to recapture lost territory, but I think we should see these campaigns inside Russian territory as the early stages of their counter offensive.",

It started in the 70s Nigerians see it as their right, but increasingly it has become very expensive. The state oil companies NNPC says it spends 867 million every month on keeping gas prices low for Nigerians. And it actually says the government owes its $6.1 billion. So the government is in a lot of debt, as you know, over $100 billion of debt. And they're borrowing effectively to keep this subsidy going.

And we fight what we believe is the most crucial enemy towards the climate, which is our pace of consumption. We buy for too many things too often that end up being garbage before we know it. So extending lifecycle is key for us to be able to test our products in the fiercest environments, whether that be you know, north of the polar circle, or down in Africa. It's crucial viability to actually support durability and extend the lifecycle. So that's the main reasons to do these, you know, all the excursions, I would say, while doing good.",
