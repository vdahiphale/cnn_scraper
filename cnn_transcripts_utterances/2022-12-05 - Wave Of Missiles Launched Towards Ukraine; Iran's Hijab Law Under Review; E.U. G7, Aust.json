It's really been heating up in the Donetsk region, with Bakhmut being Russia's target number one. According to the spokesperson for the Ukrainian Eastern group of armed forces. Basically, Russian units have been trying to push west, trying to demonstrate some battlefield success after a series of humiliating defeats. And they're coming up against a very, very sturdy Ukrainian force. That is -- that is with great difficulty holding their own at the moment. They say this situation does appear to be under control at this hour. We know that support inside Russia according to public opinion polls for this war continues to erode with at least two new polls talking about more than half of the Russian population calling for peace talks. Whether that means that the Russians will slow down fighting as the United States put it both sides possibly wanting to regroup, retool and prepare for a spring offensive or counter offensive remains yet to be seen. Of course, the Eastern Front is just one frontline, Lynda, down south. People have been in during Russian shelling and civilian apartment buildings and homes were hit over the weekend with at least one person killed there.

Thanks so much to you in Ukraine and stay safe.Well, as I just mentioned, the west is trying to put new limits on the Kremlin's ability to fund its war in Ukraine. And to that end, a price cap of $60.00 a barrel on Russian oil agreed to buy the E.U., the G7 and Australia has just taken effect. And the E.U.'s ban on Russian oil input shipped by sea also now in effect. And be its part, the Kremlin says it won't recognize that price cap. Market watchers say the West's tighter sanctions could spark more uncertainty over energy supply. And right now, oil prices are higher. CNN's Clare Sebastian is looking at all of this and joins us now live from London. Clare, good to have you with us. So, Russia says it's going to refuse to sell oil at this $60.00 a barrel price cap. It's already been getting around at selling to China, to India, to other Asian countries, right?",

This is a mechanism that can be reviewed and tightened. It's said to be reviewed every two months, starting from January where the E.U. and the GG7 and Australia will sort of assess the market conditions and make sure that the cap is still effective. And that really is designed to sort of gradually up the pressure on Moscow. First, they want to make sure that the sanction actually works and then they can increase the pressure. So, I think that is another reason why it's critically important to see how Moscow responds to this because of course, there are other loopholes here, there's a report that Russia has been amassing, for example, a fleet of sort of a shadow fleet of old tankers to try to get around this band, Lynda.",

And while fusion surrounds reports that the country's morality police are being abolished. These potential moves come amid protests that have engulfed Iran since mid-September. They were sparked by the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini in police custody. She was detained allegedly for not wearing her hijab properly. I want to get some clarification on this developing stream.

And this wasn't something that was wanted by the majority of people. This could be seen as the government responding in a way to that, but we don't know the substance of what this review will lead to. We don't know if he said this, just to create the illusion that this is being considered and they will just settle back down in the same old position. Further confusion, obviously, when he was asked a question about the fact that people are not seeing as many morality police on the streets, he was asked that on Saturday and saying that the morality police would be abolished. That's been walked along way back by state leader in Iran. But was that connected at all to this review that he was talking about? None of that is clear.

You don't know until the actual moment if it's going to be live or if NASA is going to have to send these images back after the fact because hey, this is very far away. In order to beam these images back to Earth, you have to rely upon a network called the Deep Space Network, which is a series of telescopes and satellites out in space to relay those signals back to Earth. So, we'll see. But you can see, it has been beaming back some images of this close approach. Some spectacular images that we've seen of the Moon and the Earth throughout this, what in total will be a 26-day mission. And so, now Lynda at the big critical test, there's two left. One is this burn, which is essentially the engines or the thrusters firing to move the spacecraft back to Earth a bit more. And then the other big test is going to be on Sunday, the test of the Orion heat shield which is what protects the astronauts which are not on board now, only mannequins. But in a future mission it would -- it would protect those astronauts from the very high temperatures that the spacecraft would endure on reentry.

Market watchers say the West's tighter sanctions could spark more uncertainty over energy supply. And right now, oil prices are higher. CNN's Clare Sebastian is looking at all of this and joins us now live from London. Clare, good to have you with us. So, Russia says it's going to refuse to sell oil at this $60.00 a barrel price cap.

So, I think that is another reason why it's critically important to see how Moscow responds to this because of course, there are other loopholes here, there's a report that Russia has been amassing, for example, a fleet of sort of a shadow fleet of old tankers to try to get around this band, Lynda.",

But it is notable because -- I think because of the chronology that you had a little bit more than a week ago, these protests erupt first in Shanghai and then spreading to Beijing and more than 20 Other cities over the course of several days after that. And within days, the Chinese government started signaling that it was not going to revamp its zero COVID strategy which has left people -- millions of people trapped in their apartments for months at a time, you know, rationing food unable to get quick access to emergency health care in some cases. But instead, is incrementally lifting some of the restrictions. As you pointed out, more than 20 cities now don't require you to get a negative PCR test for COVID to ride public transport. That is a fairly big deal. Take a listen to what several Beijing residents had to say about the changes they're seeing. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator): Public transport is no longer restricted. That is more convenient. This might be the first step towards the reopening of this pandemic. UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator): For me, my company requires a 24- hour COVID test, because it is a public place. There are still high requirements on us. So, we have to continue to do COVID tests every day. I have yet to feel a very noticeable change. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And if all goes well, that will mean it's ready to bring astronauts onboard for admission to the lunar orbits scheduled for 2024. I want to bring in our space and defense correspondent Kristen Fisher who joins us now live. Good to have you with us.

The first one happened on the way to the moon. Now Orion is heading back to Earth. And so, we're hoping to perhaps get some live images of when this happens. But it's kind of hit or miss. You don't know until the actual moment if it's going to be live or if NASA is going to have to send these images back after the fact because hey, this is very far away. In order to beam these images back to Earth, you have to rely upon a network called the Deep Space Network, which is a series of telescopes and satellites out in space to relay those signals back to Earth. So, we'll see. But you can see, it has been beaming back some images of this close approach. Some spectacular images that we've seen of the Moon and the Earth throughout this, what in total will be a 26-day mission. And so, now Lynda at the big critical test, there's two left. One is this burn, which is essentially the engines or the thrusters firing to move the spacecraft back to Earth a bit more. And then the other big test is going to be on Sunday, the test of the Orion heat shield which is what protects the astronauts which are not on board now, only mannequins. But in a future mission it would -- it would protect those astronauts from the very high temperatures that the spacecraft would endure on reentry. And then of course, splashdown in the Pacific Ocean sometime on Sunday. So, those are the two big tests ahead but Lynda, we are hoping to get some pretty cool images of this very close approach to the moon a little bit later today.",
