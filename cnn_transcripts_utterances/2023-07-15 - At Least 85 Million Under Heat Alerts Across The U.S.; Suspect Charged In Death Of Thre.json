I mean, it's really an extraordinary act that the Republican leadership of the House decided to well push through these really extreme measures.I mean, you got to keep in mind, Victor, the military, the men and women in the service, they're not some foreign group. I mean, they're drawn from all 50 states. They're reflective of the nation. And this is a nation that a few decades ago went through multiple revolutions, the civil rights revolution of women's rights, LGBTQ rights, and they're not going to just sort of sit back and watch all of this get rolled back and neither are their representatives. This is dead on arrival in the Senate. There'll be a lot of hard bargaining but the idea of stripping rights away from active duty service members and their families, it's simply not going to fly. It's very unlikely that this is going to pass. And you got to keep in mind, they only got it passed by a couple of votes. So, they had to pull out every stop just to get this extreme agenda passed. And I think it's DOA in the Senate, the White House isn't going to give them very much help. I think something more rational is going to come out of all of this.
