I'm Jake Tapper.We're going to start today with our 2024 lead, because in just one week, right here on CNN, you will see the most important event yet of the 2024 race. Next Thursday night, President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump will take the stage in the first presidential debate before the general election. I will moderate along with my friend and colleague Dana Bash. Now, not only is this showdown consequential, it also will be historic. This will be the first debate ever in American history between a sitting president and a former president, both of them vying for the White House. And yes, presidential nerds, in 1892, Cleveland and Harrison did not debate. But back to today, CNN's amazing reporters are getting brand new details about how both candidates are preparing behind the scenes. Let's go straight to CNN's Kayla Tausche, live at the White House, and here with me in studio, CNN's Alayna Treene, who's covering the Trump campaign. Kayla, to you first, how is President Biden preparing for the big night?",

His top aides will be there with him for several days of what was described as intensive preparations that could last right up until the day of the debate, with the White House preserving the possibility of traveling right to Atlanta from Camp David, depending on how much practice still remains.Now, the format will evolve over the next few days. Sources involved in the preparations say that they'll start with more informal discussions going through binders of potential topics, questions, responses, and prior Trump rhetoric. And it will culminate in formal mock 90-minute debates in the next few days with President Biden on his feet of preparing for what that event will actually be like in Atlanta, a week from today. Now, the Biden campaigns long-held theory of the case is going to be tested with the debate. They have always said that voters are disengaged. They're tuned out. And that once they start paying intention to the election, they'll realize the stark choice at hand and the danger that they believe Donald Trump poses to democracy. And now, with the lion's share of likely voters planning to tune into the debate, they're trying to retread old Donald Trump material that they think didn't register with voters previously. And one of those comments that they plan to highlight is Trump's comments in December 2023 that he would not be a dictator, just on day one. Now, President Biden is a creature of habit. This is the first time he will be debating in four years since the last election. And he's going to be surrounded by pretty much exactly it is same aides. His former chief of staff, Ron Klain, who's been a Democratic debate coach for the last 30-plus years, will be leading the preparations from Camp David. He'll also have his deputy chief of staff, Bruce Reed, who's been charged with going through all of the hours and reams of material to help prepare him, as well as Anita Dunn and Mike Donilon, two of his longtime communications advisers, will be on hand as well. And as for who will be the stand-in for President Trump, I'm told that it's likely that Bob Bauer, the president's personal lawyer who stood in for Trump back in 2020 will be reprising that role, Jake.",

One of the things here, Jake, that's made it difficult for prosecutors here to bring charges, is that the cameras inside Hamilton Hall were covered. Remember the protesters got in there smartly covered all the cameras and as a result, they just don't have the evidence, prosecutors say, to pursue charges against these individuals.

And then he said they spoke about the case. He said they did not utter the words Trump, but he said that it was clear they weren't talking about the Mets. So, it's this capturing of this conversation that Trump's lawyers are challenging here, saying that the judge is not allowed to have any conversations about the case with anyone, not involved in it. Now, at the time, a spokesman for the judge had told NBC that their word no ex parte, as they're known, communications between the judge and the lawyer about the case. Today, when we've reached out to them after this motion was filed, they declined any further comment on this. I've also reached out to the real estate lawyer who said that he talked to the judge about the case. He did not get back to us, but this is the latest attempt by Trump's team to try to move the judge off the case as this goes up on appeal and as the judge continues to have a role overseeing a monitor, he put in place to watch the Trump Organization's finances, Jake.",

So it's actually quite a boon to the space station commander right now to have a couple of extra to workers.

You can deal with it, but they don't want it to get worse.The other thing is they had not all the little thrusters that help you maneuver some of them kicked off. But we think it was a software problem, not an endemic problem with the thrusters themselves. There's one that's not working out of a whole bunch. So, that's a little problem. The shuttle used to have thruster and helium and hydrogen leaks all the time. And we had to work around it on a regular basis. So I don't think that's a real concern, but, of course, they're docked to a safe place. Their docked to the space station, if there was a serious problem with it the vehicle, they could stay and come back on another vehicle. But I really don't think that's going to happen.
