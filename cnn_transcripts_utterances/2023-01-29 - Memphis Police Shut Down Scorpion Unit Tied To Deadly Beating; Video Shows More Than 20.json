We begin with a major shift in Memphis just a day after horrific video showed the brutal police beating of Tyre Nichols. The city's police department announcing its permanently deactivating its so-called SCORPION unit.All five officers charged in Nichols' death were members of that unit and the move is coming after Nichols' family and protesters around the country demanded it be dissolved. The attorney for Tyre Nichols' family, Benjamin Crump, telling CNN This Morning that the decision is a positive step. But the work is far from over. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BEN CRUMP, NICHOLS' FAMILY ATTORNEY: In communities of color, they often have different types of police in them, many of our white brothers and sisters have in their community. And this video illustrates it that is this culture that says it doesn't matter whether the police officers are black, Hispanic or white, that it is somehow loud for you to trample on the constitutional rights of certain citizens from certain ethnicities and certain communities. And we have to have a larger conversation about this. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And when it was learned that these five officers were part of that SCORPION unit, many of the community members and, of course, Nichols' family all came out asking that the police chief disband this unit. Now what this unit does is that they drive around and unmarked cars aggressively fighting crime, and some of their tactics have come into question.And because of the concerns raised by the community, the police chief said that she met with officers in that unit and they all decided that in the interest of trying to heals the wounds here and try and help some of the work that the police department and the community knows they're going to need to do to try and win back their respect, she is going to disband it.

The familiar sense of nationwide anger and warning can be tough to process, even if we're far removed from the event itself.And I want to bring in Dr. Deepak Chopra, to help us find ways of navigating these mounting tragedies. He's a clinical professor of Family Medicine and Public Health at the University of California, San Diego. He's also an author and the founder of The Chopra Foundation. Dr. Chopra, it's always lovely and wonderful to talk to you and so insightful. On an individual level, I wonder where we begin to kind of hold the heaviness of what's happening in our country, because I think there is this collective grief that we've been going through for years now and it continued. Just -- it's this incident after incident and after incident, how do we hold that? DR. DEEPAK CHOPRA, CLINICAL PROFESSOR OF FAMILY MEDICINE AND PUBLIC HEALTH, U.C. SAN DIEGO: So Jessica, what we're looking at is the pathology of both personal trauma and collective trauma. So what we call anger is the memory of trauma, hostilities, the desire to get even. And then that leads to fear, anxiety, which is the anticipation of trauma again. Some people blame themselves, they blame others, this leads to guilt, shame. And ultimately, the loss of energy of all of what I've said is depression. Right now, what we're seeing is collective trauma, persistent recycling of this trauma and new cycles, social media, distractions. And again, we're also, you know, have the collective fear right now of an impending recession, inflation, loss of jobs, and then what's happening in Ukraine. You know, we see this all the time and we get traumatized. And so, one of our basic needs as humans in the hierarchy of needs, the base of the pyramid is safety, security. When a society loses that, that's when actually we have a crisis, and we have a crisis right now. And so, I can only suggest that we, first, grieve collectively. This is a moment of grief for all of us. To be in denial is actually going to increase the anger and so on. We need to grieve. We need to create safety networks with families, friends. I use the four As, attention, deep listening, affection, deep caring, appreciation, deep gratitude and acceptance of what is. We have no choice. And what I found in my personal life is that no matter what the crisis is, if you ask yourself, close your eyes, you know, in your stillness, you ask yourself, what am I grateful for? Notwithstanding what happens, notwithstanding what is happening. That feeling of gratitude removes all hostility, allows you to get in touch with your deeper self, and opens the door to healing.",

The Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announcing a series of steps in response to what turned out to be two shooting attacks, the one on Friday night that killed seven and then one that on Saturday morning that injured two.The most immediate is an increase in the deployment of security forces. And as you noted, plans to seal and then ultimately demolish the homes of both attackers. This is something that is the Israeli officials often do. They say they call it deterrence methods for terrorists. And then further on, what Benjamin Netanyahu wants to do is one of the issues. He actually wants to increase the number of gun permits to everyday Israelis. He says that the more civilians who are carrying guns around on the streets, he says the more protected they will be. He wants to issue thousands of more gun licenses, something that's much more difficult to obtain in Israel than it is in the United States. And then another issue he wants to do that will be much more controversial, he says he wants to revoke the Israeli identity cards and residencies of families, of terrorists and those that support terrorism. Now, the Palestinian Ministry of Foreign Affairs condemned these actions, saying that collective punishments will only increase regional violence. And they also note that there have been dozens of seemingly retaliatory attacks by Israeli settlers in the occupied West Bank, saying that they burned dozens of cars and damaged plenty of buildings. Tomorrow, the U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken will be here for a pre-planned trip to both Israel and the West Bank who couldn't come at a more important time. The sense of urgency is incredibly high. I spoke to a former Israeli officials, military officials and others who say that Secretary of State Antony Blinken will really be needed to help ratchet down the pressure and especially try to restore the security coordination between the Palestinian Authority and Israel. The Palestinian Authority cutting off that security coordination on Thursday in the wake of that deadly Israeli military right in Jenin, that Thursday, ended up being the deadliest day for Palestinians in the West Bank in over a year. So a lot of pressure on these meetings between Blinken and Israeli leaders. He will then also be going to Ramallah to meet with the leadership of the Palestinian Authority. A lot of hopes that this visit will really help to calm the tensions here because the former officials and experts I've been speaking to say that the atmosphere, the temperature on the ground is so high, that they just don't know what will be that spark that will really completely blow up the entire situation.
