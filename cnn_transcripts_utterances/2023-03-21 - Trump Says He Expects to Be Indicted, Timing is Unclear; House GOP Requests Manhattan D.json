We should note, so far we have no indication that it's actually happening today. The timeline on a potential indictment is unclear, but security fences still going up around the Manhattan district attorney's office and the U.S. Capitol this morning.

Three committee chairmen yesterday fired off a letter to Alvin Bragg. They are seeking both documents and his testimony by March 23rd. They want to know whether federal funds were used to investigate Donald Trump over this hush-money payment to Stormy Daniels. And they also want to know whether there was any communication between the Manhattan D.A. office and between the Department of Justice. I want to read you part of a letter where they explain some of their reasoning. They wrote, \"Your decision to pursue such a politically- motivated prosecution requires Congressional scrutiny about how public safety funds appropriated by Congress are implemented by local law enforcement agencies.\" Now, Republicans admit they don't have any knowledge of whether federal funds are actually used in these sorts of cases. And they also admit they don't know the full scope of the charges that Trump might be facing.

Scott Perry, the chairman of the House Freedom Caucus, told me they don't need to wait, because they see the writing on the wall here.

And so, in some ways these two leaders have been forced together into this relationship. And they're -- and they're deepening it as much as possible. There is that issue of military aid that China has stopped short of providing Russia so far. It's not been discussed openly, but I expect that behind closed doors that's something that -- that's being talked about.

The con, though, is does that spook international markets, that there's something out there that the Fed sees that means they have to slow down on their -- on their rate hike campaign? So the consensus is a 25 basis point rate hike. It shows the Fed is serious both about inflation and about financial stability. They can do both at the same time, right? And then I guess there's a small, small chance they could be like the ECP, the European Central Bank and say, No, no, inflation is so important, and we believe in our banking system. So we're going to raise interest rates 50 basis points. Goldman Sachs is out here saying the stress on the banking system is -- is just too much. They need to just take a pause in the inflation fight. And so what do we think? What does the market think? The market thinks they do 25 basis points today.

The Fed should have known that this was going to be a problem.She's also criticizing the Fed because, look, all of these rate hikes, remember way back when we were talking about transitory inflation, the Fed chief, also the treasury secretary. And a lot of chief economists for big banks thought that inflation was just going to be temporary. It wasn't. That was a fatal flaw in their calculation, which means they started raising interest rates too late, and then they started going too aggressively here. And that's what's caused the turmoil in the market overall. So you know, he's going to have to restore confidence, I think, Don, to answer your question, by transparency.
