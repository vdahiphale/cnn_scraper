It becomes kind of a frustrating refrain in speaking with some of his surrogates. What impact do you think that has on how Trump and/or Harris are operating this -- in this campaign now that we see what -- we hear from Biden? MATT GORMAN, REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST, FORMER SENIOR ADVISER TO TIM SCOTT'S PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN (via Webex by Cisco):  Yeah. I think the biggest thing that is a tell for me is when Biden and Harris -- when that switch happened suddenly that democracy argument -- and it was one -- look, I think it had a dubious effect electorally as and issue when Biden raised it -- has kind of been jettisoned by Harris. I think that tells you a lot of the efficacy of this. Now look, Joe Biden is going to say what he wants to say. I think he might be a little bit remiss that he's not getting headlines and he's not part of the excitement for the Democratic Party.

Round in the final turn in fourth place, about five meters behind the leader, face full-on stream, gold grilling on. It looked like he was going to fall flat on his face for the last 100. But when the other runners ran out of gas, Quincy Hall was running on fumes full-throttle over the line for the win -- 43.40 seconds. Now the 26-year old first-time Olympian from Kansas City has a gold medal to match that gold grill -- epic. And coming up tonight, as Kate mentioned, the newly crowned 100-meter champ Noah Lyles will put it all on the line for a chance at the elusive and dreamy double.

This, another one right here on the Pender-Sampson County border. Again, you can see that storm as it rolls through. But, yes, the potential is there for today as well. You can see this tornado watch in effect for portions of Virginia as well as North Carolina. That is valid until 1The greater threat though in terms of more widespread is going to be the flooding still. Look at all of these counties in red. That indicates a flash flood warning. This one right here with a white outline, a flash flood emergency. They've had up to eight inches of rain fall in this area in just the last few hours. Unfortunately, more is on the way. Again, you look at this, the estimated rainfall. Just in the last 24 hours this area has taken a lot of rain, not to mention the days leading up to it getting some of those outer bands. So there's still the concern for a high risk of flooding today across portions of North Carolina and stretching into Virginia. Tomorrow the threat shifts a little bit farther into the Northeast, so areas of New York, Vermont, and stretching down into Pennsylvania under a moderate risk. Because that's where this system is going to hit. We finally are going to start to see this thing make some actual progress moving away from the Southeast and giving those folks a break. But it's going to take all that heavy rain right along with it through the mid-Atlantic and up through the Northeast. So you're talking widespread. A lot of these areas up to four inches. Some spots could still pick up six, seven, maybe even as much as eight inches of rain before it finally heads out to sea. So here's a look at Thursday. The good news is by the time we get to tomorrow morning, just 24 hours from now, it's hovered over the mid- Atlantic. And then by Friday night and Saturday morning, out to sea.",

They're accusing the company of gross negligence and claim that the crews were aware that they were going to die before dying. According to the lawsuit, the Titan dropped weights about 90 minutes into its dive indicating that the team had aborted or attempted to abort the dive. Experts cited in the lawsuit say they would have continued to descend though feeling -- and this is a quote from the lawsuit -- \"the terror and mental anguish of their fate,\" according to the filing. All five people on board died during that dive. They were trying to head to the Titanic wreck site back in June of 2023.
