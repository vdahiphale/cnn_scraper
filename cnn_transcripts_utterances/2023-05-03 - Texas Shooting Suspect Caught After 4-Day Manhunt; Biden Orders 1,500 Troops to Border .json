      "sentences": "Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin on Tuesday approved a request by the Department of Homeland Security to send an additional 1,500 active duty U.S. troops to the U.S. border in anticipation of the expiration of a pandemic era law that allowed the administration to expel migrants more quickly.Now, the administration is expecting that when that law expires on May 11th, a surge of migrants are going to try to cross the border into the United States. So, the Department of Homeland Security asked the Pentagon if they would be willing to send an additional 1,500 troops to support the Department of Homeland Security's efforts there to help manage that expected surge. Now, importantly, these troops are not expected to perform a law enforcement function at the border, meaning they will not be out on the field day to day, engaging with migrants. But they are expected to help CBP, the Customs and Border Patrol officials, as well as DHS, kind of free up resources so that that department can then perform its law enforcement function. So, what does that mean? That means that essentially these troops will be doing administrative tasks. They will be doing things like data entry, warehouse support, logistics -- things that will essentially keep them behind a desk. But still, the fact that the Department of Homeland Security requested this support really underscores just how concerned the administration is about a potential major migrant surge on May 11th, the day that that Title 42 pandemic law is set to expire. We should also note that these troops are only expected to be there for 90 days. And the administration, the Pentagon, I should say, is trying to figure out a way to kind of rotate to some of those troops out and replace them with national guard troops that those active duty service members don't have to be on the border for the full 90 days.

Wait until after the borrowing authority is increased for the federal government. Republicans say that the House passed a bill, the GOP house did to last week. That included a slew of spending, cuts other Republican priorities, and they say that there is going to be some negotiation at least to include spending cuts in the final deal. Now, the White House plans to have a meeting, Joe Biden does next week with the four top leaders in both chambers from both parties, but it is unclear whether any deal could be, or come of that. Earlier in the day on Tuesday, I asked Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell whether he would intervene in this debate between the House GOP and the White House, and he made clear that the Senate would take a backseat to the House. SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL (R-KY):  It should be clear to the administration that the Senate is not a relevant player this round. They have got to have a measure that can pass the House, how does it pass the House? It has to have the support of the speaker and I am behind the speaker.",

Christine, the cease-fire has not been a cease-fire at all in this conflict so far. Both sides have promised, they said that they will stop fighting, but the fighting continues. And this latest cease-fire, which was broken by south Sudan who calmly said that both sides had said to sit and meet, and agreed to seven days where they would stop fighting. But heavy fighting still heard around the presidential palace in Khartoum this morning in the capital. So it's just more of the same, Christine. And Saudi Arabia reporting that one of its offices where its cultural attaches were staying, and they have been evacuated, was attacked. No reports of casualties in that, but we also had reports of six people being killed today in the capital. So the violence continues, there is no ceasefire, and there is just a really desolate situation where people need to have humanitarian assistance come in. But these heavy fighting really hampers the efforts, and the U.N. this morning tweeted that he arrived in the port of Sudan to see how they could start operations in the safer parts of the country, to make sure that these desperately needed aid does get in -- Christine.",
