The Philadelphi Corridor is 14 kilometers long, about 100 meters wide, and according to Israeli officials, where 20 tunnels have been found which crossed into Gaza and were used by Hamas to smuggle weapons into Gaza. Egypt, though, disputes the Israeli claim, saying all tunnels in that area were destroyed earlier by the Egyptian military.The IDF has released these images of what it says are rocket launchers and other terrorist infrastructure found in the area. More now from the Israeli military spokesperson, Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) HAGARI (through translator): Hamas took advantage of the Philadelphi Corridor and built these infrastructures a few meters away from the border with Egypt so that we would not attack them. It was in the vicinity of between 10 to 40 meters from the border so Israel in such way would not attack near the border with Egypt. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

You might die at any moment anywhere. Multiple Israeli strikes on camps for displaced Palestinians in recent days have made that point with deadly clarity. None more so than this strike in northwestern Rafah on Sunday night, which killed at least 45 people and injured hundreds more, according to Gaza's Ministry of Health. The Israeli military has said it did not expect civilians to die and has launched an investigation into the strike, which killed two senior Hamas militants. But at least three people can be seen on the road outside those structures moments before the strike. The Israeli military targeted these two container-like structures, just steps away from structures housing displaced civilians, which were also destroyed in the blast or the subsequent fire. Four weapons experts tell CNN the weapons used in the strike were U.S. made bombs. They say these remnants found at the site of the attack are pieces of a GBU-39 small-diameter bomb carrying a relatively small payload intended to minimize civilian casualties, but dropping them in densely populated areas can still have devastating consequences.",

It goes all the way back to more than three years ago in January of 2021, when 47 pro-democracy figures were arrested in a dawn raid. They were charged with conspiracy to commit subversion, a very serious crime here in Hong Kong. Under the National Security Law, which is punishable by up to life in prison, they're accused of staging an unofficial primary vote, which was deemed illegal by authorities here in Hong Kong. Now the National Security Law was imposed by Beijing on Hong Kong in 2020 in the wake of a massive anti-government protests of 2019 and critics say it has dismantled the opposition. Supporters say it restored law and order. But Chinese authorities adding that it's a matter of national security and that they warned against any foreign interference.

Prosecutors alleged they were and the testimony the jury has asked for supports that in the form of David Pecker, then that would constitute one of those unlawful election influence crimes by wrongful means.

JOKER (through text translation): We have ammunition for direct tank to tank battle. Much more often we work as artillery. We take apart a tree line or a building. Once we fired 17 rounds into a house, and it was still standing.",
