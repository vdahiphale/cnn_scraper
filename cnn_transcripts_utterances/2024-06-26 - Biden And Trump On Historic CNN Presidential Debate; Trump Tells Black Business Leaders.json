We're getting new behind the scenes details on how the candidates hope to impress voters and attack one another.We're also following a breaking story the United States Supreme Court reportedly tips its hand briefly posting a draft ruling on a pivotal abortion case. We're breaking down the apparent decision and how it was mistakenly released. Welcome to our viewers here in the United States and around the world. I'm Wolf Blitzer in Atlanta, and you're in the Situation Room. We're coming to you live from CNN studios in Atlanta, the backdrop for the first debate between a sitting president and a former U.S. president in the history of this country. President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump now in the final stages of their very different forms of preparation for tomorrow's critically important debate. CNN's political team is here in force working their sources just ahead of this unprecedented event. Kristen Holmes, I want to start with you. You've got some new reporting, I take it, on the Trump team's plans and how they're going about what's about to happen.",

And one of the things that I had noticed was a real shift in how the Trump team was discussing the format. Now of course, unsurprisingly, they were complaining about it originally talking about how this was actually going to hurt Donald Trump, because he didn't have an audience to work off of that muted mics might hurt him. But now what I've started to hear from the Trump team is that they're hoping that this actually helps him talking about this idea that particularly because there is no audience that Donald Trump can't get distracted. I mean, what we have seen over and over again in these various rallies is Donald Trump really feeding off of his base, feeding off of their sometimes enthusiasm to go on these rants, which is exactly the opposite of what they want Donald Trump doing.What they really want Donald Trump to do is to focus on three key issues the economy, particularly inflation, immigration and crime, because if you look at recent polling, those are the areas in which he outperforms President Joe Biden. So even if there are questions and they're preparing him for, questions on abortion or on democracy, what they want him to do is figure out how to pivot to those three -- to those three issues. And what they're hoping is that this lack of audience will help with that.",

But the reason that this debate is the earliest in presidential campaign history is because both sides see an imperative here to kind of up in this race, to unstick this race, if you will. But for President Biden, I think beyond anything to show that he is not only in control, a strong leader, but he is capable and fit to serve a second term.That is one of the questions when you talk to Democratic voters and others. How's he doing? So I think his appearance is going to be -- and his stamina will be central to this, but it's also his record. He's done many debates over the course of his time, but never one like this, never one where his sort of own stewardship and record of the economy of inflation is going to be agenda item A here. So yes, I'm told by one advisor he wants to remind people what the Trump presidency was like, sort of chaotic and the like, but also he'll be defending his own record, which he hasn't done a lot of. So win for him is looking strong. But I think for the former president, a win for him is being calm and saying, look, are you better off than you were at the beginning of my term or right now economically speaking?",

President Trump will enter from the left side of your screen. The podiums are eight feet apart directly across from them. The moderators, CNN's Jake Tapper and Dana Bash. Now, a reminder, this is a television studio there's no audience. Candidates will have two minutes to answer questions and one minute for responses and rebuttals. At the moderators discretion there may be an additional minute for follow ups, clarifications or responses. So how does a candidate know how much time is left to speak? Attached to the cameras in the studio and in the candidates' field of view are the timing lights. When the light show yellow, there are 15 seconds left in a candidate's answer or response. When the lights flash red, there are five seconds left. And when the display is solid red, the time is up. At that point the candidates microphone will be turned off, and the other candidate will have their microphone turned on. My colleague, Victor Blackwell, has more on that.",

And frankly, it looks like it's surreal thing with probably some modifications that will occur over the next couple days. But if indeed it is surreal thing, and there's no reason to completely doubted. It said Idaho will not be able to enforce its ban on abortions for all women, except if to prevent a death. What the justices did was ensure that a federal law that dates to 1986 that guarantees emergency room treatment for needy patients, including someone who might come in with complications from a pregnancy and require an abortion to preserve her health. That was where the split was if an abortion can be done in emergency situations, as opposed to only to prevent death as the Idaho law said. Now, Wolf, here's the key thing. According to the draft opinion that's been put up by Bloomberg News, it looks like the courts split 63 to dismiss the case. Six justices said that they had intervened too early in this matter, and indeed the merits are still being resolved in lower court hearings. But this is a -- while this is a win, as you've noted in the introduction, for the Biden administration at this stage, the liberal justices pointed out that this is no permanent victory for women's reproductive rights. Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, according to a partial dissent, that was part of the opinion that Bloomberg posted said that, you know, do not think of this is a victory. While the court dawdles and delays women have this uncertainty over exactly how abortion bans nationwide are intersection with this guarantee of emergency room treatment. And let's just remind everyone that it was two years ago this month that the Supreme Court completely reversed constitutional abortion rights and several states including Idaho enacted bans. It's one of 14 states. So there's a lot of uncertainty out there about whether this federal law can at least preserve some abortion access in emergency room situations. And for now at least things will stay, Idaho will allow that for women, but more to come down the road, Wolf.",

You know, the one thing I would say is the Court just from a perspective of managing a mistake, the Court issued a statement that said it would release the opinion in due course.

And where it is still the law based on a separate lawsuit that is still pending in Texas, that actually doctors cannot perform emergency abortions, except when necessary to save the life of the pregnant woman.So, Wolf, I think we have to be very careful about what this means, all that the Supreme Court seems to be doing if this is the ruling we're getting is kicking the can down the road, maybe six months, maybe a year, not coincidentally, to the far side of the presidential election, where the only folks who will benefit in the short term are pregnant women in Idaho, in every other state in the country.

It also was important not just to him, but for the institution of the presidency. The obstruction case is also very important from the perspective of it would -- if the decision were to go against the use of the obstruction charge in the way that the Justice Department has prosecuted it, it would affect former President Trump by having if the charges against him go away, and it would affect potentially hundreds of January 6th defendants. So a ruling against the government in that case really would be something against how the Justice Department has prosecuted many of the January 6th cases.",

And it begs the question, why didn't the court actually just release it today? What that suggests, Wolf, there's something that you and I have talked about before, which is that maybe the justices actually are a little bit strategic, not just about what they're saying in these decisions, but about when they're coming down.Maybe they're well aware that the first presidential debate is tomorrow night. And so we're not going to get an immunity ruling or a January 6th ruling tomorrow, maybe not even Friday. And what that really underscores, Wolf, is that this is an institution that even though it says, even though it swears six ways from Sunday, that it's above politics, it's actually right in the middle of it. And maybe the more that it were to be candid about that, the easier it would be to see how its decisions should and should not be shaping our political debates.",

He was eight years of vice president for Eisenhower.He's the first -- that's the first debate in U.S. history, not just televised first presidential debate, period, Lincoln-Douglas of 1858, was about Illinois. And he gave Kennedy the opening. I don't think without those -- if Nixon didn't debate, Nixon probably would have won in 1960. I think history is going to look on why are we doing this debate in the spring. So it's a big deal for CNN, it's a giant moment. But the thing that, you know, we usually wait until September for this. So we're going to be looking at also a lot of body language now.

His head shaved, the 32-year-old Wall Street Journal reporter looked calm. But he faces a sentence of up to 20 years if all likely when he's found guilty.

A new statement from the U.S. Embassy in Moscow says Evans did not commit any illegal acts and should not have been arrested at all. This trial isn't about the presentation of evidence due process or the rule of law. We're talking about the Kremlin using American citizens to achieve its political goals, the statement ads. With the conflict raging in Ukraine, Russia began a crackdown at home on free speech and silencing dissidents or forcing them into exile. It's against this backdrop that Gershkovich was arrested on a reporting assignment in the Russian city of Yekaterinburg. This is video from the website of the tank factory there were Russian Prosecutors alleged Gershkovich acted, quote, on the instructions of the CIA to collect secret information.
