We love having the children of alumni who deserve to be on campus and most of the ones who come do deserve to be there.

It is most likely we will hear from the Fulton County grand jury before the Republican debate -- Fani Willis about looking into election interference by Trump in that state. So are there plenty of opportunities for Donald Trump to say never mind or I have other things to do? Yes. But the people around him say despite him sort of leaving it out there -- I don't need to be there -- that they do expect him to be at the first debate as of now, in part because we all know Donald Trump. He loves that spotlight. And he's likely to skip the second debate. That one is scheduled at the Reagan Presidential Library. He has a long-running feud with the people who run that library.

If all these other candidates -- if there are five, six, seven, eightcandidates on the ballot in Iowa, New Hampshire, and beyond and Donald Trump stays at 37 percent, Donald Trump will be the Republican nominee. A long way -- I talked about 39 days to that first debate. We have 180 days until anybody votes, so we have a long way to go here. But right now, in the upside-down defied political gravity world that Donald Trump has his -- has us in for years now, he short-term benefits from this.

That is a -- it is proof, to your point Abby, about the power of the Trump effect. How he has redefined the Republican Party. I would say this, though. Chris Sununu on the ballot in 2024 probably has to be a little more careful about what he says if he was running for reelection in a presidential election year. Now he's a free agent.

On Saturday, in North Dakota, a woman suffered injuries to her stomach area and foot when bison charged at her. Then on Monday, a bison gored a woman in Wyoming. Both were sent to hospitals to be treated for their injuries and investigations into the attacks are ongoing.Joining us now with more insight into this is Yellowstone wildlife safari guide, Grant T. Johnson. Grant, wow -- this sounds really scary and both of these incidents are different. But I wonder -- I mean, are people just getting too close to these animals, or is something else happening here? GRANT T. JOHNSON, YELLOWSTONE WILDLIFE SAFARI GUIDE (via Webex by Cisco):  So, overwhelmingly, the incidences that we see between bison and people are a result of people just getting too close to the animals. And right now we have a bit of a convergence of two big contributing factors. First, we have the beginning of the bison rut. This is the beginning of the bison mating season so both the male and female bison have elevated levels of hormones and that makes them a little bit more agitated and a little bit more competitive on the landscape. Secondly, July is the busiest month for people to be visiting the national parks. And so the risk of being attacked by a bison or any other animal is outrageously low. With this many people in the park it's not surprising that this is the time of year that these types of things happen.",

And so, my initial question as I've seen these reports is this like a social media thing? Is this people trying to take pictures of themselves?Why are people going so close to them, based on your experience? JOHNSON:  So I think it's a bit of a few factors. I think, for sure, social media has been a negative influence. People are trying to recreate photos they've seen or get a new photo that no one has ever seen, and doing risky behaviors is a way to get that done. Also, I think a lot of people do not have familiarity with real, authentic wildlife and when they come into these areas they think that they're essentially visiting a zoo. And this is not a zoo. These are national parks. These are true, wild, authentic wildernesses and these animals are wild and they're potentially dangerous if we push the limits with them.",

This is the law in the national parks.If you're in your car there's essentially no risk as long as you're pulled off the side off the side of the road. You can stop. You can enjoy the wildlife. You can take photos and enjoy the experience. If you're outside of your car, whether that's walking, hiking, or just standing on the side of the road, you need to stay certain safe distances away from the animals. Bears and wolves -- that's 100 yards, and all of the other animals, including bison, is 25 yards. If you see the animal drastically changing their behavior because of your presence, you are too close even if you're beyond those limits. So, with bison, they are nice enough to give us warning signs that they are getting agitated. You will see this exaggerated head bobbing. You will see them kind of scratching and stomping at the ground. And most distinctly, you'll see their tail go up. If you see any of those factors happening, back up, increase the amount of space between you and the animal, and let other people know, too, that they're getting too close.
