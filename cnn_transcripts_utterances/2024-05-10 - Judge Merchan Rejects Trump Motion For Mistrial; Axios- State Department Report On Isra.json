Donald Trump's criminal hush money trial resumes this morning after seven hours of testimony from Stormy Daniels and another motion for a mistrial from the former president and his team. Judge Merchan rejecting that motion, as well as a request by Trump to have his gag order amended. The former president's lawyers claiming the case should be tossed out because they say Stormy Daniels keeps changing her story. She has said she has not changed her story. The defense tried to undermine Daniel's credibility yesterday in this exchange. Quote: You've acted and had sex in over 200 porn movies, right? And there are naked men and naked women having sex, including yourself in those movies, right? But according to you, this is again, Susan Necheles, talking the Trump lawyer, seeing a man sitting on a bed in a t-shirt and boxer shorts was so upsetting that you got lightheaded? Daniels replied with this: Yes. When you are not expecting a man twice your age, to be in their underwear. With his gag order still in place, Trump had basically one target available after the court. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT &amp; 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: This judge is corrupt. He's a corrupt judge. This judge, what he did or what does ruling was is a disgrace. Everybody saw what happened today. He's a corrupt judge and he's totally conflicted. And I got to get back on the campaign trail. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

She was surprised, felt threatened, basically by the fact that Trump was on his in his attire, right?

They wouldn't amend the gag order because the judge said, really can't trust you to do that.How it pleased with the jury? This is a reminder of how of this whole episode, and that potentially could be harmful. But listen, it's very clear to me when you see the former president there and the presence of Senator Rick Scott, their to defend him, that the jury -- the jury that he's more concerned about are the ones not in that courtroom, it's public opinion, it's voters.

The report from the State Department is supposed to examine whether Israel has violated international humanitarian law. And it comes amid rising tensions between or at least some tension between the U.S. and Israel. Earlier this week, President Biden warned Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu against launching a full-scale operation in Rafah. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  I made it clear that if they go into Rafah, they haven't gotten in Rafah yet -- if they go into Rafah, I'm not supplying the weapons that have been used historically to deal with Rafah. I've made it clear to Bibi and the war cabinet, they're not going to get our support if in fact they go on these population centers. We're not walking away from Israel's security. We're walking away Israel's ability to wage war in those areas. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

That wasn't the case pretty clearly. But has gotten better, even though there are still a huge amount of problems and not enough aid is getting in.So, you know, the -- the big worry for Israel in this report would be if they've broken that agreement or seemed to be broken that agreement. We're not to wait to see exactly when it comes out, but I think it's highly likely -- unlikely that the U.S. is going to say Israel broke this agreement because then they'd have to effectively cut off all military aid to Israel. It seems very unlikely that that would be the case. But the same time they cant have a report that says everything's gone perfectly and were very happy with the way Israel has conducted there. So I expect there to be some really big criticisms in this report, but it won't cross the line into saying that Israel has broken this agreement.",
