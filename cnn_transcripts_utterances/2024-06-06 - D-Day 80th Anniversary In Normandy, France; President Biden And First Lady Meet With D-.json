It is a sunny day here in Normandy -- nothing like the low-slung cloud cover of 80 years ago that allowed the Allied forces to conduct the invasion that became D- Day that we are commemorating today.You saw Biden is meeting with those veterans, honoring their heroics in that battle as well as in World War II more generally. You mentioned that this is likely the last major milestone for many World War II veterans. That's one of the reasons why organizers here have gone all out for today's celebration. Thousands expected to meet in attendance. The official U.S.-led commemoration ceremony is expected to kick off in just a few moments. But there's special resonance for another reason today, and that is who will be participating. Vladimir Putin, of Russia, will not be here at the request of France. But Volodymyr Zelenskyy, the president of Ukraine, will be here with world leaders, attempting to signal a show of force from the West to continue helping Ukraine defend itself in this modern war on Europe's front lines. That is going to be a major theme in the speeches that we hear from leaders today and in the coming days, and you can expect President Biden to touch on that as well, Kasie.",

Donald Trump has visited Normandy around the 75th anniversary. There was some controversy because he did use that visit to sort of directly swipe back at political rivals and political opponents.

And, yes, it's important for -- to learn in history class and for public officials to talk about the lessons that have shaped and held up and threatened democracy, but if people have never faced fears like that in their own lived experiences -- if those are not the fears that they confront, it gets much more difficult to remind them of the stakes. It's just something you heard about in the history book the way we might have heard about the colonial era or the Civil War. It seems very far away.

We've let campaign season become the dominant force in how we set policy in this country, and it just seems like that's too cheap of a way for us to actually make a difference in this country. Certainly, we need to have our political arguments and we need to arm wrestle through the -- through the individual policies and nuances and issues, but we need to come back to the table as Americans.
