Growing fears about just how bad the humanitarian and economic crisis could get in the United States when this Trump-era immigration policy expires in just hours. The Biden White House surged thousands of reinforcements to the U.S.-Texas border -- I'm sorry, the U.S./Mexico border, from homeland security officials to U.S. troops ahead of tonight's deadline, 11:59 p.m. Eastern, when Title 42 officially ends. Title 42, as you might recall, allowed the U.S. government to quickly remove migrants from the U.S., to deport them for the last three years, using the pandemic as an excuse. But starting tomorrow, every migrant encountered by border agents will have to go through a much longer processing procedure. That's expected to cause a serious backlog, not to mention much more illegal immigration. In recent days, the U.S. has already seen a huge jump in migrants. Homeland security official says border authorities encountered more than 10,000 migrants along the border yesterday, already surpassing government estimates. On the other side of the border, U.S. officials estimate that more than 150,000 migrants are currently camping out in northern Mexico just waiting for the policy to officially end in a few hours. Now, this is not just an issue that will affect U.S. cities near the southern border. Brownsville, Texas, official says migrants are requesting transportation to get to Chicago and Dallas and Houston and Brooklyn and Denver and Miami.

Look, we know that there are many thousands of migrants, you know, in Mexico and along the transit routes coming north, you know, seeking to access our border. We have been working, you know, closely with our regional partners, including the government of Mexico, in order to, you know, increase enforcement on those routes. We have been averaging about 10,000 encounters a day. The last few days, you know, this is, you know, what we have been planning for, frankly, the better part of two years.

We have over the last two years been adding holding capacity at the border, you know, the CBP facilities hold 7,000 more people today than they could two years ago. So, we have been preparing. I would point out that we asked Congress for $4.9 billion to help preparing for the lifting of Title 42. We got less than half of that from the Congress.

But these are the costs of a fundamentally broken immigration and asylum system. You know, the president has asked Congress on day one of this administration to come together and work on a bipartisan basis on immigration reform. We have not seen that from Congress, and as one of your correspondents noted you have seen surges in migration happen under presidents of both political parties who have tried to deal with this through executive action, as we have.

You know, we have been, you know, through our executive authorities, you know, doing very innovative things to try to address this problem, both by overseeing an historic expansion in the lawful pathways that are available for migrants to come directly to the United States and also through imposing new consequences for those who insist on crossing irregularly between ports of entry.

That's a new record for dealing encounters. So as they return to that decade-old protocol, it becomes how do youprocess all of these people with, frankly, an outdated system? Under Title 42, for example, it took about 30 minutes to process them because they were quickly expelling them back to Mexico or their origin country. When you are processing under Title 8, it can take hours. And so, that is what is front and center. And top of mind for officials is how to get through the number of people that are coming through. Now, of course, the flip side, it carries higher legal consequences and the hope among administration officials I talked to is that will discourage people from crossing. For example, if you return, you under expedited removal, you could be barred from the U.S. for five years. So the administration is leaning in on enforcement to the point actually of introducing new policies that almost have echoes to the Trump-era by, for example, largely barring migrants who have come through other countries from seeking asylum at the U.S./Mexico border. Now the argument from the administration is that they are opening lawful pathways to the United States, ways in which people can stay where they are and apply to come to the U.S. But all of this really becoming a challenge -- Jake.",

And that is the real aim of this proposal, to restart the progress on the border wall the southern border with Mexico as well as provide new restrictions on asylum seekers, reinstate the so-called stay in Mexico, remain in Mexico policy for those asylum seekers, change how the so-called E-Verify process works for employers to check their immigration status. But even though the bill has been part of this negotiation among Republicans getting most Republicans onboard, the chance this is -- there is significant dividing lines between Republicans and Democrats. In fact, the vote just wrapped up, Jake, and the final vote passing the House 219-213. There were two Republicans who voted against it. Democrats, 213 Democrats voted -- or the Democrats who were present, I should say, voted against this as well. So there were two Republicans who voted against it.

They are not only going to countries that have Russian spies in their custody, but also going to close U.S. allies to see if they can come up with some creative ideas to gin up Russian interest, things that the U.S. could use at leverage at the negotiating table because we know that they want to get out both Gershkovich and Paul Whelan at the same time.",

Now one of the last people to see her alive is being brought to the United States. Joran van der Sloot, who is already serving time for murdering a different woman in Peru, he faces extortion and fraud charges in the U.S.And CNN's Jean Casarez is now going to explain how this is all related to Holloway's disappearance 18 years ago. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JEAN CASAREZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  Eighteen years after Alabama teenager Natalee Holloway vanished on a school trip in Aruba, the prime suspect in her disappearance is being extradited to the United States. Joran van der Sloot, who was one of the last people to see Holloway alive and twice detained in connection with her disappearance, will finally face federal charges in the U.S. for extortion and wire fraud.",

Papers were signed. A total of $25,000 was given to van der Sloot. And Holloway's attorney flew to Aruba. Van der Sloot took the attorney to a house, saying her body was buried within the foundation. Soon after fleeing to Peru with the $25,000, he e-mailed the Holloways saying, quote, he had lied about the location of Natalee's remains. Extortion charges were filed a short time later. In May 2005, the 18-year-old Holloway was last seen leaving a nightclub in Aruba with van der Sloot and two other men. All three were charged by Aruban prosecutors in 2007 for involvement in manslaughter, but a judge ordered their release, citing a lack of direct evidence. Her body was never found. Beth Holloway said in a statement she would be 36 years old now. It has been a very long and painful journey, but the persistence of many is going to pay off. Together, we are finally getting justice for Natalee. After the U.S. legal proceedings conclude, van der Sloot will be sent back to Peru according to a statement from Peru's judiciary to a Peruvian prison where he is serving time for the murder of 21-year-old Stephany Flores. She was murdered five years after Holloway's disappearance. CNN was allowed exclusive access to van der Sloot's cell shortly after his arrest, and in 2012, he was sentenced to 28 years in prison for that murder. (END VIDEOTAPE) CASAREZ (on camera):  And the attorney for Joran van der Sloot is telling CNN tonight that he is vowing to fight this request for extradition, saying that he believes that the charges are too old. But there is that extradition treaty between the United States and Peru. It was signed in 2001. And as I read it, I do not see a date. And Jake, you know, I was in Peru for a month when Joran van der Sloot was being arrested. I was in his cell when they took him out. The prison Castro-Castro that he was in is a very violent prison, and he will have a wake-up call when he comes to the United States because Jake, they can wear their own clothes in prison, they can carry knives in the prison and you can make a meal and take it to the prisoner anytime you want.",
