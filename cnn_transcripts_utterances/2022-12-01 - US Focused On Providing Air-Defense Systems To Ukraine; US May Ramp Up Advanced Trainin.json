But with stockpiles running low it may need to rely on more arms from the Soviet era. China claims it's entering a new stage of COVID controls hoping to calm public anger and anti-lockdown protests. And heavy rains trigger flash floods and landslides in Brazil leaving dozens missing and a huge mess behind.Ukraine is calling on NATO to supply the country with everything needed to defeat Russia's invasion as quickly as possible. Ukrainian foreign minister delivered the message in-person, Wednesday, on the second day of talks between NATO foreign ministers in Bucharest. Now, he thanked the block for pledging more aid to Ukraine, including for its energy infrastructure, which of course has been heavily damaged by weeks now of Russian attacks. And Ukraine welcomed additional military aid including armored vehicles, artillery, and, of course, those all important winter uniforms. America's top diplomat, meantime, Antony Blinken, tells CNN the US is very focused on providing air defense systems to Kyiv. The Ukraine's foreign minister says there is one specific system they need more than all others. Listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And that very fact has made it really difficult for the West to resupply Ukraine. Ukraine is using weapons at a very high rate. It's using ammunition of course as part of this. And then the other thing that we're confronted with is the barrels of the various artillery pieces are overheating because of overuse. So that's a major issue for the Ukrainians and for the West, especially if the West wants to continue to help the Ukrainian and help the Ukrainian stop the Russians.",

So they're used to this, they've been trained on this, and even if they've had a break in service you between their initial military service and their call up for this war, they're so familiar with these weapons systems. So in that sense, it makes sense to do that.But on the other hand, these systems are old. They are not as effective as their western counterparts, especially the modern Western counterparts. And the Ukrainians would be better served if they could receive the Western systems, and they could be trained on them. So that's a big end. But that is one of the key things that would need to happen in this case. So I think that requires a lot of creative solutions, using the old Soviet equipment but also ramping up the training for modern Western equivalent to be used by the Ukrainians themselves.",

And, you know, we do understand that the US is working in conjunction with the Ukrainians and with NATO partners, especially Germany, to train a much greater volume of Ukrainians on a Western systems.So if that happens, it can be done but it also requires the Ukrainians to leave their country and leave their fighting posts in order to come in, get some training and then come back. So it's a bit of a tough haul and it's certainly very concerning. And basically, the clock is running out in multiple directions.

The letter was addressed to Ukraine's ambassador to Spain. A separate letter bomb was also delivered to a company that reportedly made some of the weapons Spain has sent to Ukraine. A device was safely deactivated. The Spanish official says the second envelope apparently came from Ukraine and investigators believe that may be the case with the first one as well. She says both letters had the same return address.And we go to China now which may be ready to make some adjustments to its zero COVID policy. Beijing's top COVID response official says the country is entering a new stage and mission in controlling the pandemic. Some of the more notable changes are happening in the southern metropolis of Guangzhou, which has seen days of protests. The man who shot this video, in fact, is yelling unsealed as authorities removed those blue and orange barricades. The city is lifting lockdowns in some areas ending district wide mass testing, and letting some close contacts of COVID patients isolate at home rather than in quarantine facilities. And there are now similar reports of those kinds of moves in Shanghai as well, where there's obtained video from that city showing people pushing and shoving police in hazmat suits although it's not clear when this footage was actually recorded. CNN has in fact been able to verify at least 20 protests in 15 different cities right across China since the weekend. Now for more on all this, we want to bring in our Anna Coren, who has been tracking developments in the region. And, Anna, how much is this a subtle move or will it be more pronounced?

Now, the Brazilian meteorological agency highlighted on Wednesday the southern portions of the country to experience flash flooding. The highest likelihood of flash flooding as well as landslide possibility. The heavy rain just soaked into the soil. Gravity ultimately won.

Garbage piling up in the hallway. The factory plunged into chaos. Videos showed workers scrambling, fighting to get enough food and supplies. Then came the exodus. Masses of workers walked miles along highways to escape the plant. Analysts estimate this factory produces more than half of Apple's iPhones. Apple already warned customers they will need to wait even longer to get their new products because of China's COVID lockdowns. So to attract workers, Foxconn promised higher pay and bonuses. New workers signed up. But when they got to the factory, the pay package was worse than what Foxconn advertised. A Foxconn employee said workers felt cheated, leading to thousands of people protesting. Foxconn later blamed the payment discrepancy on a quote, \"technical error\". And said text messages to workers offering to pay them $1,400 to quit and go. Soon after, videos showed long lines of workers boarding buses to leave the factory.

I mean how serious of a threat does this pose to Elon Musk and Twitter. And, you know, his feed if you look at it is full of references to free speech.
