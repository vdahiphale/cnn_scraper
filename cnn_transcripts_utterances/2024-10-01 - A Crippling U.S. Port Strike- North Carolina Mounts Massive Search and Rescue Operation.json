And what we have seen in Asheville here, where we are, is many streets like this one behind me, covered in mud. There`s debris everywhere, and people trying to cope, because it`s been very difficult for officials to deliver the aid that is badly needed by people. Governor Roy Cooper from North Carolina said that they`re trying to get to those communities, not only here, but communities in the mountains, around here, some of them are inaccessible because the roads are impassable. And one alternative, and this is what the governor is, says that they`ve been doing is airlifting water and food and basic necessities to those people. And so they have developed a system by which they bring all the supplies here, and from here they distribute those things. Now we have been talking to people here that tell us that for the time being, they`re OK, but as time goes on, is going to be more and more difficult to find food. There are many gas stations, there`s one right next to where we are, that are not operational. There are others that are running out of fuel, and many people desperate, going to different places try to get the fuel. And the reality is that these people it`s going to take a while to get running water. Officials say that they`re trying their best to bring the water system back up and running, but they were trying to fix water main breaks before they can stabilize the pressure -- the water pressure in the system, and then the third step would be to actually turn the system back on. Also power remains a problem for most of the population, and we have learned that at least two cell phone carriers are bringing satellite trucks that are going to provide relief because people are unable to communicate with loved ones who live in other parts of the country and other states to let them know that they`re OK. Just to give you an idea, the governor said that more than 1000 reports of missing people. That`s what authorities have received in the last few days alone. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

In Florida, Tampa General Hospital is using technology called an AquaFence. The hospital is in a uniquely vulnerable position to storms, surrounded on three sides by water. And it`s the area`s only level one trauma center for some of the most in need patients who can`t be moved. The hospital`s water impermeable AquaFence is engineered to withstand a storm surge up to 15 feet above sea level. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

But the barrier worked as Helene madelandfall in Florida, the aqua fence kept the storm surge back and the hospital stayed dry. Pop quiz hot shot. What forest animal`s name is an aboriginal term meaning no water or no drink? Panda, koala, wombat or orangutan? If you said koala, put your hands up. The word originates from one of the Australian aboriginal languages. The majority of a koala`s water intake comes from eating fresh eucalyptus leaves. Australia`s iconic tree-hugging koalas have been on the endangered species list since 2022, and experts say their populations have continued to decline. As their habitats are encroached upon by humans, koalas are increasingly being found in places that put them in danger, like near busy roads or up power poles, even in some people`s backyards. See how some folks are dedicating their time and energy to keeping these marsupials safe. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",
