Right now, Kamala Harris is holding a rally in Las Vegas with the actress and singer, Jennifer Lopez. Live pictures coming to you from the venue, yet neither Lopez nor the vice president has spoken yet. We will bring that to you live when it happens. The Puerto Rican superstar's appearance comes just days, of course, after a comedian at Donald Trump's rally sparked outrage by describing Puerto Rico as a floating island of garbage. Earlier, Harris campaigned in Arizona and in Reno, Nevada. She promised to focus on a host of domestic policies, including passing a middle-class tax cut and lowering consumer prices. Harris drew a contrast between her plans and what she says will happen if Trump becomes president again. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KAMALA HARRIS, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, 2024 PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: And look, we know who Donald Trump is. Because we all know he is not someone who is thinking about how to make your life better. And this is someone who is increasingly unstable, obsessed with revenge, consumed with grievance, and he's out for unchecked power. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

For the last nine years, Kamala and her party have called us racists, bigots, fascists, deplorables, irredeemables, even Nazis. And now I'm being accused of being Hitler by these lunatics out there that have lost control of our country. Our country is a --we're riddled with crime.

When I am elected, I will walk in with a to-do list on behalf of you. On behalf of you. And at the top of my list is bringing down the cost of your living. That will be my focus every single day as president. I will give a middle-class tax cut to over 100 million Americans. I will enact the first ever federal ban on corporate price gouging on groceries. I will make housing more affordable by building more homes and by taking on those corporate landlords who unfairly buy up all those properties and then jack up your rent.

He's not even pretending to try to balance the books. And as a result, you have the biggest fiscal giveaway, I think, in American political history.

Basically, he wants to trade off a little bit less in income taxes for a whole lot more in tariffs.Now, that sounds like it's a swap. But the thing about it is the tax cuts all go to the rich. Tariffs -- tariffs are a tax on all of this. Pretty much like a flat tax. And so, what you get is tax cuts for the rich, paid for by higher tariffs, or import taxes, on the working and middle classes. And as a result, it could be that he cuts taxes on average. It still raises taxes for 95 percent of American families.",

He says he'll cut $2 trillion from the federal budget, but he doesn't understand the federal budget well enough to know that that's essentially impossible. It's easy to talk about cutting waste and fraud, but actually, most of what the federal government does is not pay people to do nothing. It's actually send out checks to people.

But there is this sense and polling among voters that Trump will somehow be better for the economy, despite nearly two dozen Nobel Prize-winning economists saying Harris will be way better. A hundred other economists wrote in \"The Wall Street Journal,\" again, that Trump's plans, the ones you've been talking about -- tariffs, budget cuts, deportation -- will hurt the economy. Why do you think there is this perception among some that Trump would be better than Harris on the economy? And what should Harris be doing to change that perception?",

So, historically, for better or worse, whether it's true or not, American voters have tended to think that Republicans will be better for the economy than Democrats.What's striking, actually, is how narrow that differential is in this election. So, another way of saying the exact same statistics is that Harris has done a far better job in closing that Republican confidence on the economy lead than any previous Democrat. And I think part of what's happening here is people are listening to what Trump's policies are. It's absurd to be running for president having been on the -- on the national political stage for nine years, and your health care policy is quote, \"concepts of a plan.\" It's crazy to be running on a tariff plan, and from one speech to next, say it's 10 percent tariffs, and the next, say that it's 20 percent tariffs.

Just have a look at those images. They are just staggering images coming out of Spain. This coming after a year's worth of rainfall came down in just a matter of hours early this week, causing rivers to overflow and course through entire towns, doing the type of damage you just saw. Emergency workers are working to rescue people who are still trapped while operations are underway, also, to recover bodies and clear that enormous amount of debris. Atika Shubert reports -- reports from the worst-hit region. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ATIKA SHUBERT, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): A dramatic rescue in Spain's Valencia region. A young baby hoisted to safety from the floodwaters below. With the country still reeling from the worst flooding in decades, emergency services are still battling to find survivors. As the water subsides, the scale of the damage here is only starting to be revealed. The littered vehicles piled up like garbage, an indication of the ferocity of the floodwater that tore through these streets. A massive cleanup operation now underway as many remain without power or water. Many roads are totally blocked, hampering relief efforts. As residents pick their way through what is left of their towns, now slick with mud, one question remains: how could this happen? So much water, so fast with seemingly very little warning from authorities.",

And I saw on the TV the cars floating on a nearby street. And I thought the water must be coming my way. I went out onto the balcony, and I saw the wave coming. SHUBERT (voice-over): The death toll here is expected to rise as recovery teams scour for bodies. Many, like this woman, searching the streets for their loved ones. The Spanish prime minister, visiting the region Thursday, warned the threat from the storm was not over yet. PEDRO SANCHEZ, PRIME MINISTER OF SPAIN (through translator): To the citizens who live in the provinces of Valencia and also Castellon, please. The damage continues and please stay home. SHUBERT (voice-over): The severity of the flood seemed to catch everyone out, with a year's worth of rain falling in just a few hours in some places, according to Spain's meteorological office.
