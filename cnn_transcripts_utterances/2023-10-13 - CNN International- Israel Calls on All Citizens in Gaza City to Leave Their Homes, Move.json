These are people who have survived the Nakba, the 1975 mass expulsion, ethnic cleansing of Palestine and they're not about to go anywhere right now.But in terms of what people are feeling, I used to live in Gaza. I have many friends there. They're sending me messages telling me that this might be the last time that we message one another. They're telling me that they love me. And they're telling me to just keep telling the world about what is happening to them. Because this is not only a humanitarian disaster, but these are massive war crimes. It's not the first time that Israel has done that. It keeps doing it over and over again and. It's the result of 56 years of military occupation, the denial of freedom. It's time for the world to step up and stop Israel rather than give it this blank check and allow it to continue to go ahead.",

So no, these this is just simply rhetoric designed to get people to somehow think that Israel is being humane. There are rules that Israel is supposed to be engaging in, and it's not.

Where are they supposed to go to? Just the first couple of days when people fled to go to Rafah, Israel bombed Rafah, the border crossing. So there's no where for people to go. There's no place for them to go. And instead it's just going to lead to mass chaos in the streets of people trying to flee within this short window of time. They're effectively -- it's like Israel is, as the saying goes, you know, shooting fish in a barrel, that's what they've been doing. They've been carpet bombing, parts of Gaza, mass bombing parts of Gaza. And all of this with the complicity and the support of the United States and other countries around the world.This is not a solution. And what I'm left with is what does a win look like for Israel? What does Israel look like after all of this is done? What does Gaza look like after all of this is said and done? And nobody has an answer because the sole intention is simply to wipe out Gaza, it's not Hamas. It's to wipe out Gaza. That's why we see that approximately half of the people who've been killed, our children and women. And remember, this is more -- this is in in five days Israel killed half of the number that it killed in in the in the bombing attack that it carried out in 2014 which lasted 50 days.

Kayla Tausche has more.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) KAYLA TAUSCHE, CNN SENIOR WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: The Biden administration now says 27 Americans have been killed in violence in the region, 14 remain unaccounted for, and there's still a handful of Americans being held hostage, though officials say their condition is not known. There are also thousands of Americans who, just in recent days, have registered their interest in being evacuated from Israel. That's why the State Department is now chartering flights beginning Friday to destinations across Europe and that's a departure from its previous strategy, which was to direct travelers to commercially available options. But the White House remains adamant and says it's Israel's preference to that there be no American boots on the ground in the country. And the administration is also continuing to walk a very fine line when it describes Iran's sponsorship of Hamas. It is all part of the challenge that President Biden and his team are now facing. Present a show of force in the region, but also don't draw other rogue actors into the conflict. The President also deeply affected by what he has seen there, is trying to channel and harness widespread outrage for the atrocities that Hamas has committed there. But President Biden raised some eyebrows this week when he described some images of babies that had been beheaded, which the White House later clarified he was referencing unconfirmed reports and comments from Israeli officials. But when asked about the importance of accuracy and the proliferation of misinformation among this war, John Kirby, a spokesman for the National Security Council, told reporters. It's important to focus on the bigger picture. JOHN KIRBY, U.S. NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL SPOKESMAN: It's obvious what Hamas has proven willing to do to innocent Israeli citizens. We're going to -- we're not going to shy away from talking about the grotesque, grotesque nature here of what these terrorists have done. But I also think it's important that we all -- and I'm not and I don't mean this in a chastising way -- but we all have to keep the larger picture in mind here of what's going on. And how important it is for Israel to be able to eliminate this very real, very tangible, very demonstrable threat to the lives of their own citizens.",
