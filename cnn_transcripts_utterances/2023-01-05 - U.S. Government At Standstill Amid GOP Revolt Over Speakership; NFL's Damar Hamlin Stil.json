McCarthy has already agreed to major concessions that could likely erode his power if he eventually actually becomes Speaker of the House. CNN's Lauren Fox is joining us now this morning. Lauren, I know they broke overnight. They were going to come back at 8:00. They did adjourn.

Those concessions, the big news overnight, Kaitlan, and here is why.One of them would lower the threshold of what it would take to ask for a vote to actually oust the speaker. A month ago, that was the majority of the conference. A week ago, it was five members of the conference. Last night, McCarthy offered just one member. That's something that moderates have been warning would erode a future speaker's power and would make it almost impossible to govern the House. Think about all the things that they have to do. They have to raise the debt ceiling. They have to fund the government. They have to pass a farm bill. If Kevin McCarthy is looking over his shoulder knowing just one member can threaten his speakership, that is going to be a major problem. Other concessions he made -- and this one's really important -- he offered Freedom Caucus members more positions on the Rules Committee. They are the committee that governs the House floor. They decide which bills come to the floor, under what rules those bills come to the floor, and how many amendments each of those bills are going to get. The Freedom Caucus arguing this is about process. They want the House to work. But this might actually make the House really inoperable.",

That's according to a statement from the Bills. Tim Graham is with us -- Buffalo Bills reporter for The Athletic. Tim, it's great to have you And that's really good news -- signs of improvement. I just wonder is there anything else you know about his condition this morning? TIM GRAHAM, BUFFALO BILLS REPORTER, THE ATHLETIC (via Webex by Cisco): No, not much more than has been decimated by the team, by the NFL, and by family spokesmen. He is in critical condition at the UC Medical Center in Cincinnati still. He is sedated. He is on a ventilator and he will be brought back to consciousness slowly. The main concern from what I've been told is lung function. And then, of course, as he is brought back to consciousness out of his sleep, we will learn more about what the effect of his cardiac arrest had on his brain.",

I've seen catastrophic injuries take place. I have seen people being brought out of a ring on a backboard off to the hospital never to return because they die in the hospital from a brain bleed.These are the types of things that have been legislated out of football. And I think there's a belief by the players that this will be taken care of. That head injuries are being legislated out by both penalties and technology, et cetera. But this is not that. I think that there has been a fear over the years that we may actually see somebody die on a football field in front of our eyes, and we didn't think it was going to be from a heart-related incident. So this puts a totally new category of fear into the minds of everybody who plays this game. Of mothers and fathers, even at the very lowest levels, as to whether or not they going to allow their children to play the game. To have this play out on the big stage of \"MONDAY NIGHT FOOTBALL\" -- a huge game that everybody was looking forward to, on your Fantasy Football Championship week, and all these things -- so many eyes were watching this game for a lot of different reasons. And this strikes fear into everyone because this is something we didn't anticipate.",
