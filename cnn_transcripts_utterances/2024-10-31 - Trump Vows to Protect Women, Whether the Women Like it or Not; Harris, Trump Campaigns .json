I'm Jim Acosta in Washington.We begin with a stunning news statement from Donald Trump out on the campaign trail last night, when the former president said he would be the protector of women, quote, whether the women like it or not. The comments could backfire for Trump, who has faced decades of allegations of abuse from multiple women, and, of course, it was the former president who placed three justices on the Supreme Court, which overturned Roe vs. Wade, sending the question of abortion rights back to the states. Here's what Trump had to say. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP (R), FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT, 2024 PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: Four weeks ago I was saying, no, I want to protect the people. I want to protect the women of our country. I want to protect the women. Sir, please don't say that. Why? They said, we think it's -- we think it's very inappropriate for you to say. I said, Why? They said, Sir, I just think it's inappropriate for you to say. I pay these guys a lot of money. Can you believe it? I said, Well, I'm going to do it whether the women like it or not. I'm going to protect them. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Of course, that may also remind Puerto Ricans that a Trump campaign-approved comedian recently called the island garbage.

It's no surprise he's going to double down on the crazy, going to double down on the offensive, and going to double down on the things that are going to rile up his base. Because what he needs right now is to get every single one of those people who voted for him in 2016 dropped off in 2020. And that's in Pennsylvania, that's in those blue wall states, and all across these battleground states. They will come out. The crazier he gets, the more offensive he gets because that's what they need to hear.So, that's his formula.

If you hate Donald Trump, you're going to listen to that and say he is terrible, he hates women, he's a misogynist, this is more evidence of hate. If you love Donald Trump, you're going to hear that and say, you know what, that's just Trumping Trump. And I understand you're trying to talk about something different.

But there's another unknown factor. Donald Trump is really gutting after young men in a way that we haven't seen, sort of record numbers of young men are registering to vote. They're not going to be likely voters because the first time they're going to vote. And we don't know what kind of turnout we're going to have there. So, there is a huge gender divide.

The thing we don't know is how many voted before this happened, before he said this, and that will have an impact because a lot of people, as you have noted, have gone out and voted early. And I was listening to one Puerto Rican man saying that that he had voted early. This changed his vote. He was sorry he had, but he was now calling all his friends to say, if you haven't voted yet, this remark should push you away from Trump.And the other thing is on the polling, we haven't captured any of those people who did register right after Kamala Harris became the nominee and are still registering. There's no way to capture them. So, we really don't know what's going to happen on Election Day and who is turning out for whom. But I think a lot of what we see, and I wish we'd stop talking about this, playing this thing about the, what the comedian said, it was so bad. And, oh, by the way, it was let go through. He was allowed to say that by the Trump people, because, apparently, there were some worse things he was going to say that they took out of his routine. So, they knew what he was going to say, and they were okay with it because it's the language that Donald Trump has been using right along. And we need to remember that. That's who you -- what you see is what you get. And my hope is that a lot of people are going to see that the positive message we're getting from Kamala Harris put aside the Joe Biden remark. I mean, that was unfortunate. It shouldn't have happened, but pete sakes, anyone who knows Joe Biden knows he doesn't think that way. And that that was a one-off when you have the present presidential nominee of the Republican Party saying it every day in 100 different ways.

But when I look at Donald Trump, one of the things that -- I've been trying to figure this out for a long time, like how do people still love him when he says these kinds of things? You just talked about some of his rhetoric. You played a clip. People actually like Donald Trump because he's a bully, because he says the tough things, because he's going to rage against the machine, because he's going to fight back. So, this language is baked into what he says.Joe Biden and Kamala Harris have promised a very alternative view. They said that they're going to be the party of unity, that they're going to talk to everybody and everybody is included. And many Trump supporters question whether or not they mean that. And a lot of Republicans say, you know what, they mean it for everybody except for us. And so the garbage gaffe actually does have an impact because it makes you seem not like you don't -- you know, that you're going to be a very inclusive party for everybody except anyone who supported Donald Trump. It's very similar to the basket full of deplorables comment. It's taking hold. It's going viral. Before Donald Trump showed up in the garbage truck, people were talking about Halloween costumes being garbage.

I worry about freedom of the press, should he become president, when you have two major newspapers whose independence was overridden by their owners because they're afraid of retribution should Trump become president? Is that the kind of country we want to live in? I mean, there's a whole lot at stake here, and I think that we should move on from the garbage.We've done it. That's out there. It's been communicated to those people who feel really offended by it, which should be, frankly, all of us. I mean, I do. And look at some of the other things that are being said.

So, they are kind of placeholders and this Pennsylvania effort sort of follows in that tradition.And, Jim, what's important to remember that in 2020, there were 64 court cases filed by Donald Trump and his supporters. None of them succeeded in providing the evidence that you need to actually make the case. And it looks like we've got a repeat of that playbook. And so the relevant part is what evidence is there. In the Pennsylvania investigation so far, it is noteworthy that the counties that were the subject of the false registrations caught it and are prosecuting it.
