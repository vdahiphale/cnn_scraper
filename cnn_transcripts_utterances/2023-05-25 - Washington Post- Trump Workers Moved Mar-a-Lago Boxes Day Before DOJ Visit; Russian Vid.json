This is according to \"The Washington Post\", and it points to even more evidence possible obstruction by Trump. Former Trump White House attorney Ty Cobb is my guest. Plus, Putin tonight caught in a lie. Russia is denying a prized ship was attack. But new video into OUTFRONT shows a Ukrainian drone slimming into that ship. And vaccine skeptic Robert Kennedy Jr. tonight polling at 20 percent in a new CNN poll. So who are his supporters? And should Biden really be worried? Let's go OUTFRONT. And good evening. I'm Erin Burnett. OUTFRONT tonight, Trump's mounting legal problems. \"The Washington Post\" with significant new reporting this hour. Two of Trump's Mar-a- Lago employees moved boxes of documents at the residence, Trump's residence, just one day, one day before the FBI and a prosecutor visited his home to retrieve classified documents. So, just let me give you a sense of the timeline here. This was in June 2022. It was after a subpoena had been issued, right, and it was the day before the FBI was scheduled to come and get documents. Sources familiar with the matter telling \"The Washington Post\" that investigators believed that that timing is suspicious, and a sign of possible obstruction. Sources also revealing to \"The Post\" that Trump and his age allegedly carried out a, quote, dress rehearsal for moving sensitive papers he didn't want to turn over to the feds. There is also evidence, according to the post, indicating that Trump had classified documents in his office that were both visible and at times shown up to others. Which would, of course, appear to contradict what Trump said during the town hall earlier this month. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

That is apparently the last time the grand jury investigating Trump's handling of classified documents met. That would be the grand jury's a longest break since December, which could signal that we are almost at some sort of a finish line here. We'll see. CNN has reported the special counsel appears to be in the final stretch of the classified documents probe, a probe were Trump's former White House lawyer Ty Cobb predicts an indictment is imminent for Trump and tie will be OUTFRONT in just a moment.First, though, I want to go to Perry Stein. She's one of the reporters who broke this story for \"The Washington Post\" and she's up front. So, Perry, look, this is -- this is information that the special counsel would have, the grand jury may have seen. This is important information that you have. That you report that Trump's Mar-a-Lago employees moved boxes out of storage and returned them just before the FBI showed up. Now, are your sources suggesting, I just want to be very black and white about this, that someone took the boxes, went through them, maybe removed to hide documents from the FBI, and then put the boxes back? PERRY STEIN, JUSTICE REPORTER, \"THE WASHINGTON POST\": Yeah, I mean, that is a suggestion in this. I mean, we know that when investigators searched his home, with the search warrant, this was the unannounced search on August 8th, this was after they were supposedly -- gave back everything in compliance with subpoena, they still find lots of classified materials, documents marked as classified in his home. So, I mean, I think you're exactly right. That is the implication here that in moving these boxes, they potentially removed things, and that is why during the search, the unannounced search months later, they did still find classified materials on his Mar-a-Lago property.",

Two weeks of training.This is stunning. And this is Putin's army. Fred Pleitgen is OUTFRONT in Kyiv tonight with more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice- over): Just as the Ukrainian military say their forces are retaking ground on the outskirts of Bakhmut, Wagner boss Yevgeny Prigozhin says his mercenaries are moving out. That's it, moving out intend in 10 to 15 minutes, he tells these tankers. Everyone leaves before June 1st. We'll rest, prepare, and then get a new task. Wagner's exit could mark a turning point in one of the bloodiest battles in Europe since World War II. The mercenaries assaulted Bakhmut for months, often using human waves to try and storm Ukrainian positions. Prigozhin trying to prove to Putin his hired guns could get the job done where regular Russian units fail. Even during the withdrawal, a swipe at Russia's defense minister. Prigozhin joking that he would leave two scrawny fighters behind to help the army when they take over Wagner's position. That is Bieber, and that's Dulik (ph), he says. The moment that the military are in a tough position they'll stand up and block the Ukrainian army. Guys, don't bully the military. While the Ukrainians tells CNN that they cannot confirm Wagner is really pulling out of Bakhmut, they believe that a withdrawal could give them a boost in Kyiv's quest to retake the city. SERHII CHEREVATYI, UKRAINIAN ARMED FORCES (through translator): Compared to other units of the Russian army, Wagner did fight better and conducted more offensive actions. But this was literally due to bloody discipline and threats of execution.",

Obviously, as Fred shows, it has never been through the times he said it before. But Ukrainians are saying they are seeing -- they are seeing a real decline in the number of Wagner troops visible on those front lines. What do you make of this announcement now? BRIG. GEN. PETER ZWACK, U.S. ARMY (RET.): Well, Yevgeny Prigozhin, a warlord and a firebrand, and have formally up Putin crony, is increasingly working his own narrative. And it's divisive for the Russian, for the Kremlin, the military, the position on the ground, and whether they pull out on the 1st of June, it just creates confusion on the other side. The Ukrainians have a measure. This was not a -- this was not a turning point battle at all, though it was gruesome for both sides, worse for the Russians.

How did you do it with such a razor-thin margin, that one seat majority in the Senate? GOV. TIM WALZ (D), MINNESOTA: Well, I think, Erin, it was courageous legislators understanding that you don't get political capital to think about the next election. You burn political capital to improve lives. And these are very popular things. Access to reproductive and abortion services, universal meals and our schools, expansion of health care to anyone who's in Minnesota -- these are things that we know that improve lives, and they make us more competitive. In response to Republicans on this, no, I am not going to be partisan in your hate and bigotry. I am not going to pass legislation like we see to our neighbors to the west that are worried about bathrooms and worried about some woke culture war. We are going to pass things that move people's lives. People have a right to be home with a sick relative.
