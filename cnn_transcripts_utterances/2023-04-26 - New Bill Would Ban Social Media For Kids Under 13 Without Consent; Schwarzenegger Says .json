And when you take out the synchronicity, and the in-person dynamic, of social interaction, our discourse becomes more coarse.

They're just generally -- think about -- think about your Twitter feed, Michael. You'd never say these -- people would never say these things, to you, in-person. And I don't care if it's orcas, or dogs, or humans. We're mammals. When we are isolated, from each other? What is the most severe punishment other than capital punishment, in America? It's isolation, in our prisons. We are mammals. We're meant to see, touch and feel each other. And when we don't, we literally go crazy. Or, in this instance, when the number of teens, who sees their friends, every year -- every day, has been cut in half, you have skyrocketing mental illness. [21:10:00] And what's even more -- the most disturbing thing, about Professor Haidt's study, is that there's a cohort effect, because the natural solution would be to reduce the amount of time, kids are spending, on social media. But what he's found is that when kids are spending so much time, on social media, when one person gives it up, or their parents take it away? They too become depressed, because they are ostracized, or isolated. So, we're talking about a generational impact, on social media, or the depression, of social media, not just amongst those who are using it, but everyone in that cohort.",

And his nemesis is one of the biggest companies, in America. Disney today, suing Florida's Ron DeSantis, accusing the State, of retaliating against the Empire, for speaking out against legislation that bans schools, from teaching about sexual orientation, and gender identity. DeSantis and his office say there's no legal right, for a company, to operate its own government, or get special privileges. Speaking, of course, about the benefits and the breaks that Disney gets, for its monumental presence, in Florida. But is it a war worth taking on, politically? Peter Thiel is a tech billionaire, and a Republican megadonor. He's donated $35 million, to 16 candidates, in the last election, 12 of whom won. He was an early supporter, of Donald Trump. But Thiel says he's not giving a dime, to Republican candidates, this election cycle. Why? Because he says the party is now too obsessed, with culture wars, issues, like abortion, transgender bathrooms, book- banning, critical race theory, and now Disney. Potential 2024 rivals, of DeSantis, if he chooses to jump in, don't think it's a good fight for him. Take Nikki Haley, today, for instance. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) NIKKI HALEY, (R) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: If Disney would like to move their hundreds of thousands of jobs, to South Carolina, and bring the billions of dollars with them, I'll let them know, I'll be happy to meet them, in South Carolina, and introduce them, to the Governor, and the Legislature that would welcome it.

Remember, Trump was quite the innovator, on this front. He used tax policy, tariff policy, anti-trust policy, government procurement, to try to use the power of the State, to crush his political enemies. [21:20:00] Whether it was, in some cases, CNN, right? He supposedly intervened, to try to block a merger that involved a parent company of CNN, or other media companies, or any other companies that had crossed him. So, this is not particularly original to DeSantis. In some ways, I think this is sort of a facsimile version of the Trump policy. And it does seem like there are members of the GOP base, who like it, who like this sort of grievance politics, not governing in the interests of what's most economically efficient, or what promotes public welfare.

What a privilege you just had! I've been in his company before. And he is really interesting. DANA BASH, CNN CHIEF POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT, CO-ANCHOR, CNN STATE OF THE UNION: No question about it, and especially, on this topic. He invited me here, to Los Angeles, to USC. He has the Schwarzenegger Institute set up, there, to focus on public policy. And broadly, about bringing people together. His focus, lately, has been about combating hate. He called this forum, today, a \"Terminating Hate.\" I'm sure you get that. And the whole idea was to bring people together, like a former skinhead, which he did, and a rabbi was there, to have a conversation, across lines, among people that don't normally have these conversations. And his personal connection to this was fascinating. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

If it is the fight against the fossil fuels, and to create a clean environment? If it is motivating people, to get up, and to go and become successful? Or if it is prejudice and then hatred that I have seen over the years arise. So, it became kind of alarming to me. Anti-Semitism (ph), if you note, you don't have to just sit there, and watch this whole thing. I think that you can get involved, and use your platform, to kind of speak out, about that, and how wrong it is, because of my history. I come from a country that was part of the Second World War, Austria. I mean, Hitler himself was part Austrian. And it's all because we let this grow, this anti-Semitism, and this hatred, during that time. And so, anti-Semitism, where I come from a place that this has been done, once, before.
