Jean Carroll defamation trial. And he still managed, still managed to say something that got part of his testimony stricken from the record. Now, before the jury even got into the room, there was a, well, one describing as an agitated Trump. He was erupting his own lawyer, insisting, I never met the woman, I don't know who the woman is, I never met this woman, unquote. Then you met an agitated judge who told Trump to pipe it down. Then Trump takes the stand, raises his right hand, swears to give truthful testimony. His attorney, Alina Habba, asked if he stood by his earlier deposition in the case. 100 percent, yes, Trump replies. Habba then asked Trump, did you deny the allegation because Ms. Carroll made an accusation? That's exactly right. Yes, I did. She said that like I considered a false accusation, totally false, Trump replies. The judge then cuts him off saying, everything you said after, yes I did, is stricken. Why, you might ask, well, because each of Carroll's accusations have already been proven to be true in yet another case. Now, this one we're talking about today is one about him continuing to defame her. Back to the testimony. Habba's final question to Trump, did you ever instruct anyone to hurt Ms. Carroll in your statements? Trump's reply, no, I just wanted to defend myself, my family, and, frankly, the presidency. So, did that three minutes on the stand help him or hurt him with the jury? By the way, he will likely be back in court tomorrow. Let's talk about all of it. It will take longer than three minutes here on this particular show. I want to bring in CNN Legal Analyst and former Federal Prosecutor Elliot Williams, as well as White Collar Federal Criminal Defense Attorney Rebecca LeGrand. I'm so glad both of you are here. First of all, it took longer to argue about what he would talk about in the parameters at trial than I'm actually testifying today. And, of course, it was less than five minutes.

And that may narrow the issues that come out with witnesses. But as it stands right now, there will be witnesses subpoenaed in. I'm sure there'll be testimony about trips taken and money spent and all those things that are raised in the motion, which I think, frankly, again, distract from the case and probably could be put to bed fairly quickly if the district attorney and Mr. Wade, if there's any truth, that we don't know that, I don't know that, but if there's any truth to the motion, they could probably put this to bed pretty quickly by simply stepping back from this particular case.",

And, frankly, at the same time, I don't know that even the personal allegations have much merit anyway. I mean, at this point, that may be something for another place, another venue. This has nothing to do really with this case.What matters is whether or not there may have been some money and some benefit received, for instance, money that was paid out to a prosecutor who was keeping the case going and suddenly the district attorney to appoint that prosecutor may have received some benefit from it. That's going to be the hook, I think, at the end of the day. It's not going to be about the other allegations in there. So, that is the problem that she's facing. And as a prosecutor, what she wants to do is have a case that has clean optics because you want people, even the detractors of a case, to be able to have confidence in what happens and not have to second guess every decision you make. But essentially now, if these allegations are true, they have given them the stones to throw at this case. So you're going to have people say, well, it's politically motivated. It was done to enable the relationship, or to help send some money to somebody that she had a relationship with, and they have given them the tools to attack it. So, to kind of keep the case protected, to recognize your duty as a prosecutor, even though I do not think it frankly rises exactly to the black-letter law textbook definition of a conflict for a prosecutor, I also think it has the appearance of impropriety. And so prosecutors have a duty to make sure that that doesn't get in the way of the pursuit of justice in a courtroom. And that, unfortunately, is what happened. That's what the judge is going to have to deal with. This is not the first time we've had an incident like this. We had the issue with the fundraiser thrown back some period of time. You know, back earlier, Judge McBurney basically said, you're kind of out of this and the optics here are awful. Well, those optics were bad. These right now are probably indescribable.",

He was convicted of murder for the 1988 killing of Elizabeth Sennett. Just a few years later in 1992, the conviction was overturned on a procedural issue.It wasn't until 1996 when Smith was retried and convicted with a recommendation of life in prison. A judge overruled the recommendation and sentenced him to death. But it wasn't until 2022 that the state even attempted to carry out the execution. That attempt failed. Just a year later, an Alabama court ruled execution by nitrogen gas would now be acceptable. There were two last minute appeals to the Supreme Court. His lawyers arguing a second attempt at execution, this time by nitrogen gas, might run afoul of the constitution's prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment. Both of those appeals were denied. The last such denial happening earlier tonight with the liberal justices saying that they would have paused the execution.

And even without that, I don't believe that the state of Alabama should have been permitted to attempt a second execution. We have to remember that 14 months ago, Kenneth Smith was told that he was going to die on a certain day, at a certain time. He was then strapped to a gurney for four hours waiting for them to kill him. Then they began stabbing him with these needles, trying to find a vein. At one point they put him in a stress position, lifted him vertically so that his arms were spread out like someone on a cross and they were jabbing the needle into his neck. And they finally stopped the execution when the warrant expired. That was traumatizing. That was horrific. And we don't think that a state should subject someone in that condition to a second execution without something radically different happening. And that didn't happen in Alabama. They just changed the amount of time they had to carry out the execution. And that was the thrust of the argument, is that he had already been tortured in a way that is unacceptable in our society.

That's because we believe that the integrity of the law means that we have to do better than the worst offenders in our society. And so, it's not enough to say this person committed a violent crime.

In Mr. Smith's case, the jury that heard the evidence that convicted him returned a verdict of life. It's only in Alabama that Mr. Smith could face the execution. The elected judge overrode the jury's verdict of life and sentenced him to death. There's not another state in the country where he would have been facing execution. So, if we care about the jury's perspective on what should have happened, he would have never been in this situation. And I think the Eighth Amendment questions are important because the integrity of the death penalty, when for every nine people we've executed, we've identified one innocent person on death row who's innocent, it's a shocking rate of error. It would not be accepted by food safety administrations or airline safety. We wouldn't tolerate that kind of error, but we continue to tolerate it in the death penalty. It's a punishment that is disproportionately applied to people of color and the poor. And so, that raises the bar when you start asking questions about is this punishment meeting our Eighth Amendment a guarantee to avoid punishment that is unusual or cruel? And I think subjecting someone to an execution process that extends over 14 months, where it begins on November 22nd, 2022, and doesn't end until January 25th, 2023, with a lot of anguish and a lot of torture, I think that's unacceptable. And I think we can, and we should do better in this country. If we're going to have a death penalty, we can't do what we did to Kenneth Smith.",

And I want to just note that there were federal judges in all of the appeals filed by Mr. Smith who said this execution should not proceed. And the 11th Circuit just a few hours before Justice Jill Pryor said that she would grant a stay. Mr. Smith's case execution was stayed in 2022 by two federal courts. This current U.S. Supreme Court seems to be really prioritizing, allowing states to have their way, to have access to these executions. But there has to be a limit, or we're going to see a continuing downgrade in the quality and the standards. And I think the fairness that people in America are expecting.",
