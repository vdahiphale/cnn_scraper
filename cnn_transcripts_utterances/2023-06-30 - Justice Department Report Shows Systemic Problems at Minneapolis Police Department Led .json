In the weeks, months and now years since Floyd's murder, lawmakers on Capitol Hill have called for police reform.

I led the legislation. It took over a century to get that done. But I'm not thinking it's going to take that long.

And just when we thought the screening was about to start, we got a surprise. That's legendary composer John Williams conducting the famous theme music from the \"Indiana Jones\" franchise. All of us in the audience were thrilled to watch him in person leading a symphony orchestra.His work has played a big role in decades of movies from \"Jaws\" to \"Star Wars\" to \"Schindler's List\". Earlier this year, I sat down with Williams to talk about the difference music makes to a movie. Spielberg says that the two of you had a performance, an appearance, in a concert where you played a scene from one of the Raiders movies without any music and that frankly he says it was long and boring and then you played it with the music, you played it live with the orchestra and it was a totally different experience.",

And it seemed like the train, the one you referred to is I think about four minutes. Running it without the music it will seem like six minutes.So, it's almost like riding a horse. If your tempo is exactly right you don't feel it. If you're fighting the editorial rhythm of the film, metrically, one way or another, too fast, too slow, you don't have that liquid synchronization that you want.",

He doesn't know quite what his next project is going to be. Also, I would find it very hard if he says to me, I don't want to do this without you. I don't know. So, I, Chris, I'm just happy to and grateful to be working in music.There's one thing I would say about working in film. A film like \"Indiana Jones\" can take six months. It's hard to, it's that complicated a process. Six months when you're 91 is a long time. So, you're asking someone to make a commitment for a large percentage of the time, earthly time you may have left, you know, another aspect. But right now, I feel healthily flexible whether or not it would be my last film I can't say. If he should turn around tomorrow with another \"Schindler's List\", you probably have to fight me to keep me away from it.",
