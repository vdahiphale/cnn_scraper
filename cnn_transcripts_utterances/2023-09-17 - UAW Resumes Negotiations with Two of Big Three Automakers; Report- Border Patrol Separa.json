I'm Fredricka Whitfield.All right, there is a new round of talks today between striking auto workers and representatives from two of the three Big 3 automakers. The historic strike is now entering its third full day. Today's talks are expected to be with Ford and General Motors. The UAW said it had reasonably productive talks when it met with Ford yesterday. And for the first time ever, workers are striking at plants from GM, Ford and Stellantis all at the same time. Workers say they want big raises -- pay raises and other benefits after years of concessions during rough times for the industry. The carmakers say despite big profits in recent years, the raises being demanded would drive them out of business. CNN's Vanessa Yurkevich is at a Ford plant in Wayne, Michigan.

Vanessa Yurkevich in Michigan, thank you so much. We'll check back with you. All right, let's get more analysis now on the strike, and the hope and the negotiations. I'm joined now by Cindy Schipani. She is a professor of business law at the University of Michigan's Ross School of Business. Professor, great to see you. I think Rose put it really succinctly there about what is behind the demands, and why she doesn't believe it's unreasonable at all. So how is this being interpreted if you're one of the Big 3 automakers? CINDY SCHIPANI, PROFESSOR OF BUSINESS LAW, UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN'S ROSS SCHOOL OF BUSINESS: Well, her comments really go to the big pay disparity between the CEO, the high level executives and the rank and file. And I think that 40 percent number comes from the amount of raises that the executives were enjoying over the last four years or so. So I think that kind of locked in to that on if they can get it, you know, why can't we in the rank and file where, as I understand it more like six percent over that period of time? And this really brings up an issue that I think is burning in the popular press, in financial press, in academic circles, should the pay gap between top executives and average workers be so high? We're running about 300 times -- the CEOs are earning about 300 times the salary of the average worker in the United States and that's a pretty big number. So how do you close the gap? Should you close the gap? Are we comparing apples and oranges? In some ways, we really are; in other ways, when the rank and file sees that the company can afford it for the top executives, sort of like, why not us?",

So on one hand, you have -- you want to get the best talent for your executives, and you have to pay a market rate for that, and you're comparing the market. No executive wants to be at the low end of the pay scale, so you've got that competition.Companies want to roll out that we've got the best, the brightest, the most talented, so there is really pressure on the high pay scales for that. We've got the SEC trying, I think to roll it in a little bit. In 2018, they required companies to publish this pay ratio, but afraid that actually publishing it, it tells the executives what everybody else is making, and it may end up feeding the increase along the way.",

      "sentences": "Well, Fred, this episode really highlights the humanitarian and logistical challenges facing the Biden administration as there has been an increase in migrant families coming to the US-Mexico border, and it comes at a time that many of these facilities that are housing these migrants aren't intended to house people for long periods of time, and it's leading to strains like overcrowding.Now, this report that was filed with the court found that a pediatrician named Dr. Paul Wise visited several facilities over the course of the summer and at one of those facilities in Donna, Texas, he found that there were children who had been separated from their families, some of these children as young as eight years old and some not seeing their parents for four days. Now, the Border Patrol officials say that the reason for this is due to overcrowding. Typically, they have families, single adults and unaccompanied minors in separate areas and they have acknowledged, a CBP official, that there are limited times where they temporarily have to move children from their parents. In a statement from the Customs and Border Protection spokesperson, they wrote: \"The health and safety of individuals in our custody, our workforce and communities we serve is paramount. DHS and CBP prioritize keeping families together at every step of the immigration process and have protocols to that end. CBP appreciates Dr. Wise's oversight. We will continue to review the report and associated recommendations, and we'll respond as appropriate.\" Now, it's important to know that this is different than the policy from the Trump administration, which was separate children from their parents and at times, even deport parents back to their native countries without their children with them. But it does highlight some of the strains that the administration is facing, as they have seen this increase in individuals coming to the border. Recent numbers have found that more than 7,000 migrants are coming daily. That's pretty close to the numbers back in the spring when Title 42 had been lifted. And of course, Republicans have tried to make this issue of the administration's handling of the border into a campaign issue for President Biden. So this is one of the challenges that they're facing, not just today, but leading into the election next year.",
