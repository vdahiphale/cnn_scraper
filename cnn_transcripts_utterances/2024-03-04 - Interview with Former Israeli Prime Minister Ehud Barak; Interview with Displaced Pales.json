Welcome to the program everyone. I'm Christiane Amanpour in London. Desperation in Gaza shows no signs of abating. In one of its main cemeteries, there's no more space to bury the dead, according to its caretaker. A Palestinian-American doctor in Rafah says the health care system is \"completely destroyed.\" This as Israel refuses to send a delegation to the ceasefire talks in Cairo, where Egyptian, Qatari, and U.S. mediators are meeting. Meanwhile, the Israeli opposition leader, Benny Gantz, has flown to Washington for meetings with the vice president of the White House as well as other senior Biden administrator officials. Gantz is also a member of Netanyahu's war cabinet. Here to discuss all of this is Former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak. He's been a prominent critic of the government's handling of this war, and recently he's called for early general elections in Israel. He's joining me from Tel Aviv.

Because until now, you know, in spite of impressive, significant achievements of the IDF, the full reaching of the objective to make sure that Hamas doesn't reign in Gaza, doesn't -- cannot threaten Israel in Gaza, is still probably many months afar. So, that's the time to release the hostages and to do whatever could be done. I cannot dive into detail because I don't know. It's a commitment, moral commitment, and formal commitment. Those people who are now hostages were abandoned, deserted by our own government. And we cannot afford now -- after deserting them, now sacrificing them for whatever objective. So, it's clear to me that the hostage issue is not more important than getting rid of Hamas rule and military capabilities, but it's clearly more urgent. If we wait another few months until an objective, military objective are achieved, they probably will be brought back in coffins, and that's not our dreams. So, we should show certain flexibility and readiness to go and listen and to be ready. It would not achieve without certain compromises from both sides. And there is a heavy feeling that probably, in our government, the man at the top, for sure he wants to see them released, but he has a personal necessity to appear as being strong, surrounded by softer people like (INAUDIBLE) Gantz or like the heads of the secret service of the army. And in regard to achieve this picture that he was the one who -- by his tougher position twisted the arm of Hamas, he's ready to risk the very achievement of a deal and indirectly the fate of the hostages.

This is a Jordanian flight with more countries looking to join the aid effort, among them, the U.S. But this isn't a good news story. On the ground, a glimpse of how much more is needed to keep starving Gazans from falling into famine. Air drops are inefficient and expensive. You just can't drop enough food for a starving population. To stave off famine, you need thousands of trucks filled with food flooding into Gaza. But that's not happening.

They did not, by the way, rule on what would have been an even bigger victory for Donald Trump, which is he wanted -- his lawyers wanted the Supreme Court to say he wasn't an insurrectionist. The Supreme Court didn't go there.",

So, their criticism was basically saying that the majority of the court went too far in the ruling on the mechanism by which it can be determined to knock somebody off the ballot. And they really were very scathing. And I think what we're seeing right now is Donald Trump putting yet another institution of American government, the Supreme Court, under tremendous internal stress. You can see the fractures here.

And this has been possible in large part because we've been convinced that people who've committed very violent acts are permanently dangerous. And we've made them invisible. And so, we can be persuaded of this sort of fear mongering ideas. But in fact, our ideas about who poses a violent threat, how long a murder sentence should be, how much interaction an incarcerated person should have with the free world, those are all ideas that have changed radically over time. And I'm looking at time periods when there was a different kind of common sense when governors use their clemency powers much more robustly.

And one of the things you pointed out is that this is not exactly new. This is actually a return to the way things used to work. So, what changed?

And this is the era of mandatory minimums and truth in sentencing. And it's also an era of lots of anti-welfare rhetoric and a lot of sort demonizing of the racialized poor and of drug users. And so, the idea that people could be released early was something that was portrayed as an undue risk. And this was basically a successful propaganda campaign based on sensationalizing very exceptional cases. For example, the Willie Horton case or the William Horton case of the late 1980s.",

      "sentences": "Yes. So, William Horton was one of thousands of people who was released from a Massachusetts state prison facility in the late 1980s on afurlough program that was extended to even people serving life without parole. William Horton was someone who actually did work in a nearby mental hospital, taking care of people who were mentally disabled. But on his 13th or so furlough he absconded and he was involved in a violent crime and was captured and used as kind of a symbol of soft on crime, and Dukakis was portrayed as someone who was willy-nilly giving murderers weekend passes to go out and maraud and pillage. But in fact, furloughs were common in all 50 states. They were successful 99 percent of the time. In fact, in 1971 someone who went out on furlough in California shot and killed a police officer, and another, then-Governor Ronald Reagan said, well, that's a mistake and that's a failure, but it's a risk worth taking because we understand that furlough is an essential rehabilitative tool. So, Ronald Reagan did not sensationalize that event. But by the 1980s, late 1980s that tide had begun to turn and sort of the propaganda machine was able to cast this case of Willie Horton as typical rather than exceptional. And the idea that people were perpetually dangerous and incorrigible came to take hold, and that seemed to justify these extremely long sentences without ever any chance of release, even temporarily let alone permanently. And I would also add that because of the anti-welfare rhetoric of the time, prison conditions were increasingly portrayed as too cushy. And there was this idea of country club prisons that are coddling criminals and encouraging more crime because they're just going to want to go back. And so, instead of just giving people longer sentences, there is this idea that their conditions should be meaner, should be harsher. And so, educational programs were taken away, family visitation was taken away. And so, this is a process that I call the hardening or the thickening of prison walls. And when incarcerated people have fewer opportunities to interact with people on the outside, we can much more easily surrender to the belief that they're permanent demons. And that's actually not the case.",

And so, it's not entirely even. After Massachusetts decided to question its furlough program, Mississippi corrections officials said, well, we're not going to discontinue this program just because of one sensational case in the news. This is a good program. And they kept on at it. And so, the demise of these programs was rather staggered. But if you were to take the longer view, it's around the 1990s, the same year as the crime bill of 1994, the same period as three strikes laws, the same time period as welfare reform, there's a kind of austerity in the free world and also an austerity that's applied to the -- within the walls of the prison itself.",

Well, just to support the premise of your question, the media in the past often supported clemencies and commutations and wroteabout Christmas leaves in the American South, heralding the largesse of the governor for letting so many hundreds of people out for Christmas. And even Governor Ross Barnett was covered positively when he exercised his clemency powers to free dozens and dozens of people. And in the 1980s, when Governor Winter in Mississippi used his clemency powers to reduce a prison overcrowding crisis, he defended the practice and the media supported it. And so, there was this absolute turn. And I do think the turn has something to do with the civil rights movement itself. I think we understand that, to some extent, mass incarceration is a response to the freedom struggles of the '60s and '70s. And I think people who want to stay in power often find new mechanisms for containing and absorbing people that they find disorderly or threatening. And I think that as people became more isolated from free society, it becomes easier to demonize the singular case. And what I'm trying to do as an historian is just to sort of disrupt that common sense and ask us to think at -- to times and places in the past when there was a different sort of common sense. And I don't want to romanticize prison conditions from the 1960s and I'm not uncovering some kind of golden age. But using a historical perspective, which is, I think, what we need here is an attempt to restore a memory when there were different kinds of common sense. And this can open our imagination to different possibilities and allows us to unlearn ideas that have become so hardened in our consciousness.",

It's a human quality to be able to forgive and be forgiven, that nobody wants to be shackled to the worst moments of their lives, and that people do change over time. And the research shows that people who've been convicted, even of the most violent crimes, if they've been incarcerated for 20, 30, 40 years, if they're over 50 years old, their chance of committing any new crime, let alone a violent crime, is unbelievably low. It's lower than 1 percent, and studies bear this out. And while it's hard to convince someone who feels in their heart that revenge needs to motivate punishment, if we think instead about risk and public safety, I think that it's actually serves public safety to have these incredibly transformed people back into our communities.",

But to really get at the core of mass incarceration, we have to address the massive number of people who are currently incarcerated. There are right now over 200,000 people serving life sentences or virtual life sentences in this country. And that is a larger number than was in the entire prison population in the United States in 1970. Many of those people are ready to get out. They are doing work to demonstrate this, and I think we have to change our ideas of risk. Right now, politicians have convinced the American public that we're entitled to a feeling of zero risk, of an entirely crime free society. And that is a standard that is not met in any human endeavor, and it's not expected in any human endeavor. There are traffic fatalities every single day. We do not take cars off the road. So, I think the idea that public safety and risk are opposites or are mutually exclusive, it's a false choice. Public safety is something that can be served by allowing people inside more interaction with the outside world. And corrections officers and corrections professionals and academics and wardens and governors knew this not that long ago, that it's a public safety measure to begin to integrate people who are incarcerated back into our communities, that this can actually reduce crime and make us more whole.",
