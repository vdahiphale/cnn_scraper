Why the sudden shift, as even Kevin McCarthy is admitting, his Republicans have not yet proven, any wrongdoing, by the current President?Plus, panic on the court. One of the biggest names, in college basketball, in the hospital, before he's ever even played a game. Bronny James, the 18-year-old son of LeBron James, suffered cardiac arrest, and is now, thankfully, out of the ICU. But fear and questions remain, about his condition. And 15 months, after he was freed, in a prisoner swap, a U.S. Marine veteran has been injured, in Ukraine. What we're learning more, at this hour, about what Trevor Reed was doing, in Ukraine, and what this could potentially mean, for other Americans, who are being wrongfully held, in Russia. I'm Kaitlan Collins. And this is THE SOURCE. Tonight, Donald Trump is on the campaign trail, in New Orleans, as his legal team is bracing, for a third potential indictment. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

But we're learning more about that investigation, who exactly it is, that investigators are speaking with. Tonight, the top election security official, who was fired by President Donald Trump, in the weeks, after the 2020 election, because he refuted Trump's claims about election fraud, Chris Krebs, is confirming to me that he spoke, to the Special Counsel's team in early May. This is the first time that he is confirming publicly that they spoke, and that he sat down, with Jack Smith's investigators. What's new and notable also is obviously the timing. This happened in early May. We know, as part of this broad investigation, that's been happening here, Smith's team has been asking about Krebs' firing, and the timeline surrounding it, for months now. As Trump's legal liability is growing, meanwhile, in this 2024 race, his Republican challengers are struggling to catch fire. In fact, the man, who was once thought to be potentially his strongest competition, Florida governor, Ron DeSantis, is facing new questions, about the strength, of his own campaign. Sources tell CNN that he is cutting more than a third of his team, to rein in spending, amid concerns about cash, coming from donors. While DeSantis' team is now promising a leaner and meaner organization, his poll numbers have been slipping. Meanwhile, here in Washington, the House Speaker, Kevin McCarthy, as I noted, is facing enormous pressure, to show support for Trump, in the 2024 race. He has yet to endorse any candidate. And he is now making his most explicit threat yet on impeaching President Biden. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY (R-CA): All of this continues to unravel it rises to the level of an impeachment inquiry. What that simply provides is that the American public has a right to know, and this allows Congress, to get the information, to be able to know the truth. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Who will I call as a witness? Is that person credible? Was there a problem in the grand jury, where the grand jurors, who are allowed to ask questions in that room, are they kind of taking a step back and saying, this is not the guy or woman you want to have on there?\" Also, remember, an indictment is not necessarily final. It can be superseded, meaning, they could add a charge or two, except that the grand jury is not supposed to be a trial prep vehicle, or tool. It's supposed to be, when you indict, you had all the investigative material, and really the weight of the government, on your side. You're supposed to have what you need, as a closed universe.

But also, Jack Smith knew, this time, Trump's playbook, which is you send a target letter, what's Trump going to do? He's going to tweet about it or use this, whatever it's called social meet -- whatever his social media thing is called, and alert the world that way to it.

But on the other hand, this is still a serious allegation that's even looming, not only in Manhattan, of course, which is considered maybe the lesser of the indictments, possible, the one in Miami, or as in Southern District of Florida, the one that might be looming in Georgia. But unlike, for example, the last trial, he had, when you had E. Jean Carroll, and the lawsuit, he actually has to be present, for whatever comes, next, meaning, he has to be off the campaign trail. He has to factor in whether voters want the weight, and the exhaustion, and possibly, fatigue, of all. And he has to guard against a documents case, which is far easier, if you are Jack Smith, than say a more tangled web of January 6th, either you had the documents or you did not. So, at all fronts, every individual prosecutor can focus on their case. His attorneys, who are all shared counsel, have to cast the net out, widely, and be prepared for all of it.",

Obviously, this is a consequential shift, in what he is saying publicly. And it comes as you're seeing other Republicans urge McCarthy, to take action, on what they allege, is this connection, between President Biden and his son, Hunter Biden's business dealings. I should note, as Kevin McCarthy himself has acknowledged, today, to CNN, there is no direct link that Republicans have been able to draw, from their investigations, to President Biden yet. For more on this, let's bring in CNN's Chief Congressional Correspondent, Manu Raju, who is up on Capitol Hill. Manu, obviously, this is a shift, from McCarthy. And I know, he's kind of behind-the-scenes, drawing a distinction, in an inquiry, and actually going forward, with an impeachment vote. But why this shift?

But there's recognition, among Republicans, that there simply is not enough time, to move forward, with such, with multiple impeachment proceedings. Remember, an impeachment inquiry, and followed by an actual vote? That is an all-consuming event. And that would require enormous political capital, in order to get Republicans, to get behind this, push something through. And now, there's an expectation that perhaps their best and biggest target, Joe Biden, might be the one, to go after, this, after some of those allegations have come forward. One of them being that unverified allegation that Joe Biden was involved with some sort of bribery scandal, as part of when he was the Vice President of the United States.

That's according to a statement that the family put out today.He is a basketball star in his own right. He was gearing up for his freshman season, with the Trojans. And as we've seen, since that statement came out, from his parents, today, well wishes had been pouring in, from across the sports world, including from Buffalo Bills player, Damar Hamlin, who obviously knows this better than almost anyone. Remember, it was last fall that Hamlin suffered a cardiac arrest, in the middle of a game, on Monday Night Football. He was hospitalized, for more than a week and, luckily, is doing great. Joining me now, to talk about this, Dr. Jonathan Kim, the Director of Sports cardiology, at Emory University. He's also the Team Cardiologist, for Emory Athletics, and for the Atlanta Falcons and the Atlanta Braves. Also here, tonight, former NFL Wide Receiver, Donte Stallworth. Dr. Kim, let me start with you. Because, of course, I should note that you did not treat Bronny James, yourself. And we're still learning a lot of specifics, about what happened, and what the treatment was. But obviously, cardiac arrest, among an athlete, this young, is rare. I mean, what is your sense of, of just how common it is, and how this would happen? DR. JONATHAN KIM, DIRECTOR OF SPORTS CARDIOLOGY, EMORY UNIVERSITY: Well, first off, thank you for having me on your show, Kaitlan. And I just want to note that our thoughts and prayers are all with Bronny, and his family, as he recovers. It's really good news that he's out of the ICU. And indeed, sudden cardiac arrest and death is rare, in young, competitive athletes. But these cases are tragic. And they do occur. There are nuances. We know that based off of sex, self-identified race, even sport type, risk can differ among different athletes. But it is important to note that thankfully, these cases are really quite rare.",

They're impossible to fully not allow to happen.But focusing on that emergency action plan, immediate recognition, of SCA, CPR and, likely, defibrillation and then, of course, transfer to the tertiary care center, really saved his life.

He was released, from a Russian prison, back in last April of 2022, so just a couple months into Russia's invasion of Ukraine. That was part of a prisoner swap. In exchange for Trevor Reed, the U.S. released a Russian cocaine smuggler, who was serving a 20-year prison sentence. As for what Reed did in the meantime?
