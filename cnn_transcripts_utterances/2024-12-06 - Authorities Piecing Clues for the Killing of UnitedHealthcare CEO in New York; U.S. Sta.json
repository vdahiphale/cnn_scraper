This image shows him smiling at a female employee at a hostel he stayed at before Wednesday's attack. A law enforcement source tells us she asked him to lower his face mask while flirting with him, which revealed his face for the first time. He was wearing a mask in all other videos we've seen so far, but the man reportedly paid for it in cash and used a fake I.D. at the hostel, so it's not clear who he is. Now this new footage shows him just blocks away from the scene, apparently walking to the site where he would carry out his attack. The CEO of UnitedHealthcare, Brian Thompson, was gunned down on a sidewalk as he was headed to an investor conference. Sources are also telling us the suspected gunman arrived in New York on a bus that came from Atlanta. He said he also spent some time in the city, apparently preparing to carry out his plan. Brynn Gingras has the story. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BRYNN GINGRAS, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): New chilling images of a person who may be the focus of a massive manhunt, a person of interest to police seen here smiling. These pictures put out by the NYPD and sources say they come from an upper Manhattan hostel where it's believed the shooter may have stayed before the Wednesday morning murder of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson. You can see this person has no mask on. It's a clear image of his face and police hoping this, along with a collection of photos released, will help name him. New York City Mayor Eric Adams commenting on the case. MAYOR ERIC ADAMS (D), NEW YORK CITY: Pieces to the puzzle, but they are still coming together. We feel that we're moving at a steady pace and we're going to have someone apprehended. GINGRAS (voice-over): Sources say they believe this person tried to hide his identity by wearing a mask for most of his visit, even while rooming with two strangers. But for this one moment at least, at the hostel's front desk, police were able to obtain this image. The new development comes as investigators continue tracing the known movements of the gunman before and after the murder. Authorities say they have video of the suspected gunman on New York City's Upper West Side early Wednesday morning, then later exiting the 57th Street subway around 6:15. He enters a nearby Starbucks roughly two minutes later, where sources tell CNN he bought a water and two power bars. And at 6:30, this surveillance video from a nearby garage shows the suspected shooter on the phone, walking down the street toward the Midtown Hotel, where minutes later he carries out the brazen attack.",

But any notion that could happen again was ruled out by South Korea's special warfare commander earlier today, who said he would defy such orders. But it is certainly clear, Kim, that Yoon's own party is now perhaps prepared to impeach him. And you just have to look at his approval ratings. They are at an all-time low at 13 percent. A recent poll has found that 70 percent of Koreans think that Yoon should be impeached. So you have this groundswell against the president. We understand the national police have launched an investigation into Yoon and the former defense minister who allegedly encouraged Yoon to declare martial law. And we're also hearing a large number of labor unions, they've gone on strike saying that they won't return to work until Yoon is impeached. You know, those threats could expand to other unions. And this obviously has economic ramifications for Asia's fourth largest economy.

CNN's Ben Wiederman has been tracking the offensive and has this report.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BEN WEDEMAN, CNN SR. INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: The rebels have seized control of the central Syrian city of Hama, the country's fourth largest and one of huge symbolic significance. Yet the latest stinging defeat for President Bashar al-Assad's increasingly beleaguered regime. After several days of clashes around the city, the rebels, led by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, entered Hama Thursday and the regime forces pulled out. According to a statement from the Syrian army, the pullout was intended to avoid civilian casualties. The rebels took control of an air base, complete with multiple warplanes, and freed inmates in Hama's notorious prison. Hama has long been a hotbed of opposition to the Assad dynasty. It was in Hama in 1982 that Bashar al-Assad's father, then President Hafez al-Assad, crushed an uprising killing anywhere between 10,000 and 25,000 people, according to Amnesty International. Last Friday, the armed opposition quickly seized control of most of Aleppo, Syria's second largest city. The next city on the highway south, Homs, is just 40 kilometers away, a critical crossroad linking the capital Damascus with the Mediterranean coast, home to the Alawite minority, which is the main bedrock of support for the Assad regime. And if that regime was looking for help from its old ally Russia, well, it may not be immediately forthcoming. Thursday, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Moscow is monitoring the situation and will decide on military aid depending on how the situation evolves. Hardly a full-throated declaration of support for a friend in need. I'm Ben Wedeman, CNN, reporting from Rome. (END VIDEOTAPE) CNN's Jomana Karadsheh is the first Western journalist to report from Aleppo since the rebels took over.

The situation must be understood in its historical context. There was a massive war in Iraq that deeply stirred people's emotions, prompting many to go there. The circumstances of that war led people to various places and my path led me to one of those locations. Given my level of awareness and my young age at the time, my actions evolved to where I am today. I didn't go to Iraq with those intentions. I went to defend the Iraqi people. When I returned to Syria, I didn't want to bring what happened in Iraq into Syria. That's why there were disagreements between us and ISIS.",

French President Emmanuel Macron is vowing to appoint a new prime minister in the coming days as the country's political crisis deepens. Macron went on television on Thursday to address the shake-up in the government, a day after Prime Minister Michel Barnier was ousted in a no-confidence vote. Barnier officially resigned on Thursday. CNN's Jim Bitterman has more from Paris. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JIM BITTERMAN, CNN SR. INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: In a brief speech to the nation, less than 10 minutes, Emmanuel Macron explained to people exactly what happened and came as close as I think we're ever going to hear a mea culpa from him for having dissolved the parliament in the first place, which was what started this at the beginning of the summer. Nonetheless, he struck out in a very sharply critical tone against his opponents on both the extreme-right and extreme-left. He said, I'll never accept responsibility or the irresponsibility of others, especially the members of parliament who consciously chose to bring down France's budget and government just a few days before Christmas. It is the opposite of their program. They have chosen disorder. And to those critics on both sides of the aisle who have been calling for Macron to step down, he explained that it is not going to happen. EMMANUEL MACRON, FRENCH PRESIDENT (through translator): The mandate you have democratically entrusted to me is a five year term and I will exercise it to the full. My responsibility is to ensure the continuity of the state, the smooth running of our institutions, the independence of our country and the protection of all of you.",

And what is happening right now as a civil defense force that comprises of armed groups that are supportive of the government and that have been defending al-Fashir and as a result of their shelling have been forced to retreat into the camp according to the RSF. So the RSF right now then is shelling the Zamzam refugee camp and saying that it's doing so because there are armed elements there and that these elements are at risk to the RSF themselves.
