Ahead of the vote, no one really knew what the outcome was going to be.In fact, there was some positive signs this morning for Santos after all top Republican leaders said they were going to vote against expelling him. But we're learning about a new development that occurred this morning that helped impact some votes and flipped them to support expelling George Santos. Max Miller, an Ohio Republican, informed his colleagues in a letter this morning that Santos stole from him and his family. So Max Miller decided to donate to Santos when he was a congressional candidate. Miller is Jewish and said he thought at the time he was supporting another Jewish candidate. Because as you remember, Santos lied about being Jewish. But earlier this year, Miller learned that Santos had charged his credit card and his mother's credit card above the legal limit, thousands of dollars more than what they authorized and without their knowledge. And Miller had to spend thousands of dollars in legal fees clearing it up. Our Manu Raju caught up with Miller after the vote. Here's what he had to say. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. MAX MILLER (R-OH): This was just another example of a Republican who can't lead. And that's really shameful. The speaker and everyone in leadership knows that this man is a crook. Mr. Santos took not only my credit card personally, he took my mother's credit card personally, and he swiped them both for an additional $5,000 marking it as an over-donation. I have it by the FEC. And I have the document in my office. And what I can tell you, within that document -- I won't disclose any other names -- but he defrauded over 350 people for hundreds of thousands of dollars on undisclosed amounts. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

So I think this was a particular case where Santos did not make many friends on the way out. He's saying the hell with this place. And he's saying I've got the receipts on people. He's very vindictive. So I think, in addition to the list of things that the committee, the Ethics Committee came up with, there was also a sense that this guy doesn't belong in Congress.
