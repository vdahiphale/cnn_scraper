He posted this video to his Truth Social platform at the start of a holiday weekend for the millions of Americans who do celebrate Easter. This video. It shows a sticker of President Biden on the back of this second truck that's about to drive into the frame, hog-tied, right? Yes, you can see it there. We're going to be very clear, this is not video we're showing. This is something Trump reposted. Trump indicated that the post was filmed on Long Island on Thursday while he was attending the wake of NYPD Officer Jonathan Diller. Republican Congressman Mike Lawler was asked about this by our own Dana Bash over the weekend. Here's what he said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. MIKE LAWLER (R-NY): I think everyone needs to tone down the rhetoric, the language. And, you know, obviously, social media has become a vehicle by which to bludgeon people. I just think, at the end of the day, the former president, current president and on down, all of us have a responsibility to check our language, to watch what we're saying. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

You were asking members of Congress on The Hill, right? I think what I would say is, I think there are better ways to go at Joe Biden on - there's plenty of issues that he can go at him on, but it goes back to what we were discussing earlier. A lot of the stuff he has been doing since 2016 that his rhetoric is a little heated. But you heard Ron Brownstein talk about it a while ago, a Democratic pollster said, one of the worst things they hear is, they, you know, people are - and polling shows - this people separate the man and the rhetoric from the policies out there. If you look at the polling, he is still tied neck and neck with Joe Biden, and in some cases beating Joe Biden out there. So, it is really - we can have this discussion all day long, but voters, right now, it is not seeping into them and they're - many of them are perfectly happy voting for Donald Trump.",

But I think, moving forward, they will. And the more that they're presented with this rhetoric - and the fact of the matter is, is that Donald Trump, who is he trying to activate here? Who is he trying to motivate? Because he is actually going to need independent voters. He is going to need Nikki Haley voters. He is going to need some of these Latino and black voters who, again, might like his policies but not like a man.
