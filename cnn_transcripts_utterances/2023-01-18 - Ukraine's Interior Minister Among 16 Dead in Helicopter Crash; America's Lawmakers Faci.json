But we've been talking to a lot of people in the area and the visibility was terrible this morning. One man told us he was outside smoking a cigarette and he could hear the crash but he couldn't see anything because of the fog. Another woman told us that after she heard the crash, she ran down to the kindergarten and saw children being taken out of the building, some of them still literally on fire. So, this is an absolutely horrifying attack, clearly having a big impact on so many people around here. There's been a constant stream of people laying flowers, taking a minute to come and pay their respects. And you can see those rescue workers still going through the rubble, trying to ascertain how this happened. They've been picking out large chunks of debris, parts of the helicopter, that I think, from what we understand, sort of clipped that initial part of the kindergarten there and then crashed just over on the other side where we were earlier this morning. We saw at least four bodies covered in those gold foil blankets. But as we said, just a tragic day, 16 people dead, among them at least three children, Don.",

The agency's police chief says that number is still too high and that the threat of political violence in Congress and beyond is obvious from the headlines. Starting with four elected Democrats in New Mexico, they were alleged targeted by Solomon Pena. He's the failed Republican candidate for state legislature that was arrested by a SWAT team this week after being accused of orchestrating shootings at those officials' homes after he visited them. There's also that attack on Paul Pelosi after police say a man broke into their home three months ago, attacked with a hammer while looking for then-Speaker Nancy Pelosi. In June, it was Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh. Police arrested a man carrying a pistol, a knife and zip ties , who is threatening to kill the justice over that leaked draft opinion on abortion. A pistol-carrying man was also arrested outside of Congresswoman Pramila Jayapal's home over the summer, according to The Washington Post. She said she heard voices, yelling threats late at night.

The 54- year-old singer and songwriter died last week after being hospitalized following an apparent cardiac arrest.CNN's Chief Medical Correspondent is, of course, Dr. Sanjay Gupta, he joins us this morning. Sanjay, good morning to you. We don't have a lot of details on her specific case but, in general, why might a cause of death be deferred? DR. SANJAY GUPTA, CNN CHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT:  Well, it's because there wasn't a really obvious cause of death on the initial physical autopsy, typically. And let me preface, I'll show you what some of those things might be, but preface by saying, typically, they will find a cause but it can take a while, even weeks. These are some of the things that are often detected on initial autopsy, a trauma, obviously, major bleeding, something like a significant stroke, infections, significant infections, like a pneumonia, blood clots, pulmonary embolism. Those are the types of things that if you see those and they're obvious that within the initial physical autopsy they may come back with a cause of death. But then there are things that are deferred. It can be for all sorts of different reasons. They may want to evaluate more medical records, get more history, find out more, but they're also looking for other potential things, like drugs, alcohol intoxication, other toxic substances perhaps, underlying conditions, heart conditions, preexisting heart conditions, things that might require to look at the tissue with a microscope, certain liver diseases, for example. So, these are the types of things that may take a while in order to get those results back. Again, they typically, they will get those results, but with the blood tests and the toxicology tests, those can sometimes take weeks.",

If you look at overall diseases that are attributed -- deaths that are attributed to heart disease, there's some 382,000 in men, this is from 2020, 314,000 in women. So, it's a leading cause of death for men and women alike, heart disease. Keep that in mind. So, you really do have to think about heart disease for both men and women.But to your question, chest pain is still one of the most common symptoms in both men and women, shortness of breath, but also you can get other what can be classified as more atypical symptoms that are more likely to happen in women, nausea, vomiting, for example. You wouldn't directly attribute that to a heart problem, underlying heart problem, back pain, for example, or just fatigue or jaw pain. Those can be things as well that can be sort of the precursors of having a more significant heart problem. So, it's, I think, a really important message. Like you say, we don't know and we hopefully will find out in a few weeks what exactly happened here.
