Even though Speaker McCarthy says that they have not made an official decision to launch an impeachment inquiry, the belief among Republicans that I have talked to, that my colleagues also have talked to, is that it is almost certain that they will go down this route in the fall because of what they believe is a pay-to-play scheme involving Joe Biden when vice president with his son Hunter Biden while -- Hunter Biden's business dealings.Now, they have not been able to corroborate the very provocative claim but they have been able to show some allegations about Joe Biden's ties with his son, namely about that came out during a private interview last week with Hunter Biden's business partner showing that Joe Biden was on the speakerphone some 20 times with Hunter Biden and his foreign business partners back in the time when Joe Biden was vice president. Now, that same business partner, Devon Archer, said that no business was actually discussed in those 20 or so interactions. But Republicans believe this is all underscores the effort by Hunter Biden to use his dad's name as leverage to try to score foreign business dealings. And Republicans say they're going to try to prove that Joe Biden was influenced in some way while by those actions and may have profited from them. But they have not come up with that evidence yet to -- that would be central to their inquiry. Now, what they are saying is they need to launch an impeachment inquiry in order to obtain some of that very critical information that could be difficult to obtain unless they are in that aggressive posture, oversight posture with an impeachment inquiry. And leading part of that push is House Oversight Chairman James Comer, whose committee held that interview that Hunter Biden business partner last week and indicated to us over the weekend in Kentucky that more interviews were to come as they try to get more bank records to try to corroborate their claims. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. JAMES COMER (R-KY):  This next week we will release more bank records. We'll do our third bank memo, where we show some interesting wire transfers and some suspicious bank activity that I think the American people will have a lot of questions about. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And this developing overnight, the judge is preparing to schedule a hearing to decide whether to issue a protective order in that case. The special counsel is trying to block Trump from disclosing evidence to the public and potentially undermine the case before it even goes to trial. Meantime in Atlanta, Georgia, there are signs indictments could be imminent for the alleged scheme to overturn Joe Biden's victory in that state. The state's lieutenant governor and CNN contributor, Geoff Duncan, you see him often on this program, we've learned he's been subpoenaed to testify to the Fulton County grand jury.

Now, the use of this term, co-conspirators, is really significant by prosecutors because you only use that term if you believe you can prove that these people were in on the crime and part of it. But the big question, of course, is will they be charged? Now, we know, because we just heard from Tim Parlatore, who represents Bernie Kerik, the he went into the grand jury, he was questioned about co-conspirator 1, Rudy Giuliani. Parlatore says he doesn't think Rudy Giuliani is going to be charged. Tim knows this case better than I do, but I'm going to respectfully disagree with him on that. We will see. One of the big questions, if Jack Smith does choose to indict any or all of these co-conspirators, does he include them, add them into the existing indictment against Donald Trump or does he bring a separate indictment? If it's my decision, I'm doing it separate. Because if you add them into the Donald Trump indictment, you are setting the stage for this thing to be pushed back and delayed. We know that's a continuing strategy of Donald Trump and his team to get it pushed back past the election. So, what do these co-conspirators going to do? Are they going to be charged? Are they going to cooperate? We have got to watch and see.",

Officials say those missile strikes happened within 30 to 40 minutes of one another. The second missile striking right as first responders arrived to help people.There's also this new CNN reporting this morning on Ukraine's counteroffensive just weeks into it. Western officials tell our colleague, Jim Sciutto, they're concerned the assessment of the battle to regain territory is increasingly sobering. Illinois Congressman Mike Quigley just recently returned from meetings in Europe with U.S. commanders training Ukrainian forces told CNN, quote, our briefings are sobering. We're reminded of the challenges they face. This is the most difficult time of the war. Joining us now, retired Army Major Mike Lyons. Do you agree with Quigley's assessment? I mean, he was meeting with the people that are training the Ukrainians. MAJOR MIKE LYONS (RET.), U.S. ARMY:  Yes. So, it's two months to the day since the counteroffensive started. They've gained maybe ten square miles or so, not a lot. But, you know, attacking frontal fortifications reinforced by minefields without air superiority, not a lot of times in history you can show that's been successful. I think we set the expectation high for what the Ukraine military can do but they're not fighting a combined arms fight. They're not fighting a counteroffensive the way that historically shown has been successful. Not their fault but they're doing the best they can. So, I'm glad to see we have got some sober reality with regard to the situation there.",

And the way tanks are deployed effectively is when their used for shock effect. And if you're Russia, you're seeing where those tanks are going to go because that's exactly where the offensive priority is going to be at that time. And what you'll do is you'll move troops there to counterbalance them.There're only 30 tanks or so showing up. They're not going to that much of a difference maker. There's huge logistical tooth to tail ratio that goes with those tanks. Will they make a difference? They're going to allow more Ukrainian crews to survive but those tanks still don't have any more capability to go through minefields or do other things. So, again, without the combined arms, without the air superiority, I think this is still going to remain a stalemate.",
