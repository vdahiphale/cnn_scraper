In fact, they are quite coy about it.And today, an adviser to the Ukrainian presidency, he came out and he once again didn't admit that the Ukrainians were behind any of these things, but he also warned the Russian population that the intensity of such strikes was going to increase and the number was going to increase as well. The message there is obviously very clear, the war is coming to the Russians. If you look at the Kremlin, they are also saying they're quite concerned about the situation. In fact, Dmitry Peskov, the spokesman for Vladimir Putin, earlier today, said that they found the situation, especially down in Belgorod, alarming. Now of course, the Russians are saying the reason for that is that civilians are being hit there. You talk about some of the casualties that happened, that large strike that happened in that border region, and we are looking where exactly that is. It's in a village called Shebekino, which is right on the border. But one of the things we have to keep in mind about that region as well, Jim, as we both know, is that there is a large concentration of Russian military in and around the Belgorod region. The town itself is a huge hub for the Russian military. The border area was also one of the main staging areas for Russia's invasion of Ukraine, both the initial one and also the subsequent ones, when they tried to roll into the Kharkiv area. So certainly, there's a good amount of Russian military there. And therefore it's probably no coincidence so many of those strikes are happening in that area itself. You mentioned earlier those hits on the oil refinery that happened in Krasnodar. That's obviously something that would be very important for the Ukraine's to try to take some of that fuel away from the Russians. But in total, if we look at that border area, it is a very, very long border and those attacks are happening in a lot of places, down in the south and across Krasnodar, in Belgorod and further north in the Bryansk region where the Russians say there was a big drone attack. So certainly you can feel the Russians definitely coming under a lot of pressure on that border -- Jim?",

She's been in prison for more than 50 years for taking part in the 1971 murders of a supermarket executive and his wife. CNN national correspondent, Natasha Chen, is live for us. Natasha, what makes the court think she's no longer a threat to society? NATASHA CHEN, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, Boris, the court, in its brief, explained that, in recent risk assessments done every few years since 2007, they found that there is low risk for her to commit future violence. They also say that she's taken tests and her scores are below the threshold commonly used to identify anti-social or psychopathic behavior. In addition to that, she's got a clean disciplinary record, for the most part, for the -- like you said, 50 years, participating in councils and organizations within the prison system, getting herself a master's degree. And she's also been well spoken and given thoughtful answers according to the board during parole hearings. Here is part of the brief where the appellate court talks about Gavin Newsom's refusal to accept: \"The governor's refusal to except Van Houghton's explanation amounts to unsupported intuition, fails to account for the decades of therapy, self-help programming, and reflection Van Houghton has undergone in the past 50 years.\" This brief also quotes Van Houten from her recent risk assessment in 2018 where she talks about how sorry she is for having taken part in the murders of the LaBianca's. She says, quote, \"I feel it's very important that I not try to forget what happened. Learning to live with what I did is important. In my head, I had it like we were going to war.\" And she's referring to going to war because she explained that Manson, at the time, was under the belief they were about to witness a worldwide race war. And that these killings would spark a revolution, that she was under the influence of LSD and, of course, these beliefs that she now says she's very ashamed of following. Now there will be a 30-day period after which the State Supreme Court can review this case. And that is where Governor Newsom and the attorney general could file a petition for the State Supreme Court to take another look at this -- Boris?",

More people on a plane makes it harder for the airlines to evacuate a plane if something terrible happens.But I just spoke to Senator Tammy Duckworth about this. She said it's all about safety. Although, we shouldn't skirt around it. The unintended outcome of this could be a federal regulation that makes it so the airlines can't make seats any smaller on a commercial airliner. Let's just go back in history here. Back in the 1960s, the regular seat size, the pitch, which is the distance between your seat -- it's the leg room -- and your knee was about 35 inches. Today, on average, it's about 31 inches. Although, people have gotten a lot bigger. According to the CDC, men have gotten taller by an inch. They have gained on average 30 pounds. So this really --",
