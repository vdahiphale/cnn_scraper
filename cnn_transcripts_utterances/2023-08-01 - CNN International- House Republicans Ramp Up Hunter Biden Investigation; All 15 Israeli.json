      "sentences": "Well House Republicans are turning up the heat on Hunter Biden. The House Oversight Committee on Monday held a deposition with Devon Archer. He is a former business associate of Hunter Biden. He served on a board of a Ukrainian energy company along with Hunter Biden. And Republicans wanted to bring him in because they thought he could reveal key information about President Joe Biden and whether he was involved in any of his son's foreign business deals. That is a link the White House has seriously denied and link that Republicans have yet to establish.But one of the things Republicans were particularly interested in was whether President Joe Biden ever spoke with any of Hunter's business partners. Democratic Congressman Dan Goldman was present for that deposition, and he confirmed that Hunter Biden did put Joe Biden -- who was vice president at the time -- on speakerphone, around 20 times in the presence of his business partners. But Goldman that was adamant that no business was discussed, and those conversations were casual. Take a listen. REP. DAN GOLDMAN (D-NY): There is still no connection of any of Hunter Biden's business dealings with President Biden. Hunter may have put his father on the phone with any number of different people. They never once spoke about any business dealings. As he described it, it was all casual conversation.",

      "sentences": "And a source also told my colleague Zach Cohen, that Archer testified that Hunter was selling the, quote, illusion of access to his father but never provided any evidence linking Joe Biden to any of these business deals. And the same source also said that Archer testified he had no knowledge of allegations about a bribery scheme involving Joe Biden and a foreign national.Now Republicans say they feel vindicated after this testimony, and that the speakerphone calls along with a dinner where Joe Biden was president, is proof that the president was more intimately involved in his son's business deals than was previously known. They say Biden lied to the American people, and they are vowing to continue to dig into the issue. In fact, a trio of chairmen also launched a probe on the same day, looking into the Department of Justice plea deal involving Hunter Biden. They want documents. They want a briefing. A clear sign that they are not letting up on any of these probes anytime soon. Melanie Zanona, CNN, Capitol Hill. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

That reverses a decision by former President Trump to move the command to Alabama. Officials say the Air Force secretary also recently recommended to Biden that the headquarters we moved to Alabama. But we're told Mr. Biden ultimately followed the advice of the head of space command. He said the headquarters will be fully operational in August and moving it could jeopardize military readiness.In a historic move all 15 judges of Israel's Supreme Court will take part in a hearing challenging a controversial new judicial overhaul law. In September, the legislation passed by the Israeli Parliament last month would strip the courts of its power to declare government decisions unreasonable. For more let's go to journalist Elliott Gotkine who joins us live from Tel Aviv in Israel. And this presumably is making the decision, the court has to make as credible as possible.",
