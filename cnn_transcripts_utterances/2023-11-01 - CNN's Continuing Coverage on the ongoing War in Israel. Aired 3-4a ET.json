I'm Bianca Nobilo in London with our continued coverage of Israel's war on Hamas.Some 80 Egyptian ambulances entered Gaza's Rafah border crossing this morning to receive injured Palestinian patients. An Egyptian border official told CNN that at the border crossing, if the patients cross into Egypt, they will be the first Palestinians allowed out of Gaza since the war began more than three weeks ago. CNN's Scott McLean is covering this live from London. Scott, what more are you hearing about these ambulances?",

      "sentences": "Yeah, so the fact that there are 80 or so ambulances at the border is about the same number of Palestinians that we had been told yesterday by the medical director of the Al Shifa Hospital in Gaza that would be leaving Gaza for Egypt. He said that there were 81 badly injured Palestinians who would be able to or would be transported to the Rafah border crossing with the understanding or with the plan that they would be able to cross through the Rafah border crossing and then get medical attention in Sheikh Zayed city, which is basically the first major community that you reach outside of Gaza and inside of Egypt on the Sinai Peninsula there.This is obviously significant for the reason that you mentioned, Bianca. This would be the very first time that any Gazans at all would be let out of the territory since the war began. Two Israeli citizens were allowed out through the Rafah Gate, two hostages were allowed out through the Rafah Gate earlier on in this war. But in terms of Palestinians, they have all been trapped under the Israeli bombardment for several weeks now. We also know that hospitals by and large, despite many of them being told by the Israelis to evacuate south, have been refused to evacuate. They say that their patients are simply too sick, too frail. There's no way to safely transport people out. And we know that many people are also taking shelter inside of those hospitals. With these 81 patients, what we've been told is that they require surgical interventions that simply are not available in Gaza. And so the idea is that they can get that medical attention in Egypt. The big question, of course, is will this be a sign of things to come? Will more injured Palestinians, and there are a lot of them, be allowed into Egypt to seek medical treatment? The Egyptians have been extremely reluctant to take on any Palestinian refugees on Egyptian territory. They don't want the burden of refugees. They don't want the conflict to spread onto their borders either. And of course, obviously, if Gaza were emptied out, it would make things a lot easier for the Israelis, obviously, to move in and take that territory, Bianca.",

As you said, they said 11,000 targets have been hit since the outset of the war, which just goes to show you how the volume of the strikes that we are seeing, it is absolutely relentless.We know that the Israelis have said, look, most of the action is going to be in the northern part of Gaza, which is why they have told people to evacuate south. But the other reality is that even central Gaza, even southern Gaza, they are far from safe places either because we continue to see strikes carried out in central Gaza, in southern Gaza, even not far from the Rafah border crossing. You have seen Israeli strikes as well. There are also now troops on the ground, Israeli tanks on the ground, and it seems that nowhere at this point is really safe. And it was really telling in Paula Newton's interview earlier with this IDF spokesperson just the cost benefit analysis that Israel is doing here when it comes to civilian casualties. The IDF says that look, they have called off strikes in the past because they figured that the civilian death toll would be too high. But the implication is that it believes that the civilian death toll was justified or worth it in the case of this Jabalia strike despite the very high numbers of civilians who were killed, though we don't have the final number. Israel obviously believes that killing the Hamas commander and the others was worth it. Bianca?",

And in addition, I think, the attacks on Israel on October 7th have dealt a body blow not only to Israeli public confidence in their military leadership, but also in the political leadership. And what we're seeing now is, in effect, two campaigns.First, the Israeli campaign against the Gaza Strip, and second, what I call Operation Cover Your Ass, where all of a sudden we have political and military leaders coming out of the woodwork claiming, you know, that they warned against precisely the scenarios we've seen earlier this month. You had the well-known incident a few days ago where Netanyahu tried to shift blame to the military and intelligence leadership, which caused outrage, even though technically he was right because Israel didn't have any intelligence about what happened but nevertheless it was seen as trying to shift blame away from himself in the middle of a crisis. NOBILO: So this sense that he is essentially preparing the ground for an inquiry and trying to shore up evidence and support for himself, presumably that is not going down well in the public at large, and how strong are the feelings too that perhaps the intelligence services or the government may have been distracted by the other controversial plans that the Netanyahu government was trying to push through reforming the judiciary. I mean, how credible do you think some of these sentiments are in terms of explaining why this intelligence failure may have occurred? How much blame does rest with Netanyahu?",

Having said that, there's not much to distinguish Netanyahu's policies towards either the Gaza Strip or the Palestinians more generally from those of his predecessors.I do think, you know, that those who were critical of Netanyahu will see the political crisis of the past year within Israel as having made the situation that much worse. But having said that, we also need to remember that Netanyahu is the longest-serving prime minister in Israel's short history. And the reason he has that distinction is because he was repeatedly voted into office. So I think it's also important to recognize that he does have a significant reservoir of popular support among the Israeli public.",

When they cross into Egypt, they will be the first Palestinians allowed out of Gaza since the war began more than three weeks ago. They're expected to receive medical care in Egypt.Aid workers in Gaza say the stories coming from the Jabalia refugee camp are horrific. The Israel Defense Forces targeted the heavily populated camp with airstrikes Tuesday saying they killed a top Hamas commander. But the strike killed an unknown number of civilians and laid waste to parts of the camp. We caution you that the next images are graphic, taken inside a Gaza hospital. Doctors Without Borders says that young children came to the hospital with deep wounds and severe burns. One man just 100 meters from the camp says he saw children carrying other injured children, bodies hanging in the rubble and hysterical dazed civilians. Disturbing accounts keep pouring in from the Jabalia refugee camp in Gaza. One eyewitness told CNN that he saw, quote, \"children carrying other children,\" as we were just saying, and that other children were running and that they were injured. And he also said that he saw distressed mothers who didn't know whether to cry for losing their children or run and look for them.

These things must be provided for every single child in the countries if they need and wherever they are needing, apart from their safety. Thirdly, we have to ensure that other vulnerable people should also be given safe passes, and there should not be any barrier in sending humanitarian aid to them immediately, because the news is very, very horrifying. They should not starve of food and water and other things. So this is another thing. But we, as Nobel laureates, saw that the world is getting divided every day and that is going to have long lasting impact in the entire society. It's a complex issue combined with policy, diplomacy, politics, religions, faith and so on history. But what we believe that the issues of children is the only unifying factor. If we are able to ignite compassion for children, for our children, because both countries' children are our children then we are able to move forward in terms of demanding and building peace. So, it is just the beginning. We wanted to start with the issues of children and wanted to make sure that we should end the situation as much as possible. And we kept ourselves quite neutral because we know that the active neutrality and impartiality has its own power of paving the way for dialogue and eventually for peace. And that's why we have come with very strong notion that no child should be killed, remanded and kidnapped. And we repeat again and again that they are all our children.

The Iran-backed Houthi militant group in Yemen says it launched the attack, and the world is watching now to see how Iran may exert itself through proxies against its sworn enemy, Israel. Fred Pleitgen reports.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SR. INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Iranian-backed Houthi fighters in Yemen with a show of force. While only hitting U.S. and Israeli flags in this exercise, the Houthis say they've also launched a massive, long-distance attack on Israel using ballistic and cruise missiles as well as drones. The Yemeni armed forces affirm that this operation is the third in support of our oppressed brothers in Palestine, the spokesman says. Israel confirms the attack, saying its defense forces managed to thwart it using modern air defense system. But both the U.S. and Israel have long accused Iran of providing the Houthis with long-range weapons. We got a rare chance to film some of Iran's drone and missile arsenal at a military fair in Tehran in 2019. As the Israel-Hamas war continues, the Iranians are now also flexing their own military muscle. A recent large-scale exercise aiming to show Tehran's defense capabilities, but one of the commanding generals also making clear the Islamic Republic's goal is to destroy Israel. Regarding the message to the Zionist regime, he says, in fact, we announced the destruction of this regime, and God willing, we will witness it soon. Iran's military is not nearly as modern as the U.S.'s or Israel's. Many of its weapons are U.S.-made from before the Islamic Revolution in 1979, like these Vietnam War-era Cobra attack helicopters. But Iran influences or controls scores of militias around the entire Middle East, which Tehran says it can mobilize to not only attack Israel, but U.S. assets throughout the region. In an interview with Al Jazeera, Iran's president threatening escalation. The events we're seeing in Gaza are all red lines that are being breached by the Zionist entity, he says. The killing of women and children, the killing of more than 3,000 children is not something that any human being can reasonably or by conscience accept. Israel maintains it does not target civilians in its campaign against Hamas in Gaza. And the U.S. has sent two carrier strike groups and additional surface-to-air missile batteries to the region, the Biden administration warning Iran to back off.

FELLOW FOR ISRAELI AFFAIRS, MIDDLE EAST INSTITUTE: From the onset of the Hamas terror attack on October 7th, I think it was a priority both for Israel and for the U.S. and other Western allies to prevent the spillover of this war to other fronts. Since then we have seen tensions also on the Israel-Lebanon border by Hezbollah now coming from Yemen. I think the response now is a defensive response, so Israel with the support of the U.S., but also in the Gulf with the support of the Saudis, you know, in interception a missile that went through their territory, reportedly. It's defense mode. There's no interest to increase the France and whenever those France do increase, I think those indicate to many in the region that this war is actually something between two axes to which many Arab countries are actually on the side of Israel in the U.S. will also be very concerned of what Israel is doing to the Palestinians. So it's kind of a pro-Palestinian approach but an anti-Hamas anti-Iranian access approach combined.",

We have crossed several thresholds that, according to speculation, may have been important ones to see what Iran and how Iran reacts.And the reactions until now are limited. I think that is partly perhaps because of the strong messaging coming from President Biden and the U.S. military, the deployment of forces. The hope is that will continue. So there will not be intensification. We are probably in line for a prolonged battle in Gaza. It will have ramification in terms of regional relationship. But people are trying to already begin looking for the regional reconfiguration after the war, in which some international mechanism should be established, in which regional countries will have an important role to play. And we already see them having a role. We see Qatar doing mediation for these Israeli hostages related together with the Americans. We see the Egyptians now taking care of people that are injured within the Gaza Strip. So, regional countries want to find a way to play a constructive role rather than to be dragged into a war that they do not want to be part of.",

      "sentences": "That of course is very promising and might exert a powerful amount of leverage. Talk to us more about how those other countries might be involved and perhaps if you could elaborate on Saudi Arabia in particular. Obviously, we've heard from the Saudis in response to the Jabalia attack, condemning it in the strongest terms possible, but still relations with the U.S. are attempting to be built further between Saudi Arabia and Washington. So what role could they play?",

      "sentences": "I think the messaging coming from the Saudis and their interaction with the Americans is an important one, because, yes, there is condemnation of what Israel is doing in Gaza, and that is not surprising.But there's also a very clear messaging about the Saudi interest in looking for ways to advance Israeli-Palestinian peace and a two-state solution after this war is over. And there's also indication about the willingness to continue the process that began earlier of finding a new type of relationship between Israel and the Saudis with American involvement. We are also hearing from the UAE about their commitment to the Abraham Accords. So I think those indications mean that the regional architecture that was set in recent years that totally changed the dynamics between Israel and the Arab world currently is resilient to what is happening on the ground. Countries that are more pressured to act may be Egypt, that is concerned about the refugee flow to Sinai, and Jordan, that is very much concerned with what happens at the West Bank and whether it will spill over somehow to domestic unrest in its territory. So I think Egypt and Jordan are the countries that will be maybe pushed to react more quickly than the gulf states that have an interest at play and have a more forward-looking approach also to their role in reshaping the Palestinian leadership in the day after Hamas and maybe toppled in Gaza.",

In terms of proportionality, there's obviously been a huge amount of criticism, thousands of Palestinians have been killed, disproportionate impact on women and children. Is there a risk that, you know, if Israel violates theoretical red lines of these Arab nations and some of the Gulf states that architecture that you're talking about will simply break down because it's not sustainable?",
