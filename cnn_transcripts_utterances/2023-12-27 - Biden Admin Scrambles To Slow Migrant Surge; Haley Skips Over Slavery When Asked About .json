Obviously, that's a no go. Regulations prohibit walking around those designated trails or boardwalks off of those, I should note. The Park Service says that water in and around the hunt springs can cause severe or even fatal burns. No kind of MI-6 training, of course, could even help with that. I should note Pierce Brosnan has been ordered to appear at the Yellowstone Justice Center on January 23rd.In 2021, a park-goer faced similar charges -- who was facing similar charges was sentenced to seven days in jail.

I'm Abby Phillip in Washington. And today, a meeting with massive consequences, America's top diplomat, Antony Blinken, making a day trip to Mexico for a two-hour high-stakes sit down with that country's president. The topic is immigration, the immovable object of American politics. The latest pressure point is a migrant caravan winding its way through our neighbor to the south. The Border Patrol was already overwhelmed before this month and then this month broke records for illegal crossings, 10,000 humans in a single day at the southern border on multiple occasions. Now, if you live in New York City or in Chicago and you go for a walk right now, you'll see the ripple effects of all of this, migrants, men, women, and children stranded on the street corners, food, a question mark, shelter, another question mark, what next, a question mark. Democratic mayors say that they are desperate for help from President Biden. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MAYOR BRANDON JOHNSON (D-CHICAGO, IL): Without real significant investment from our federal government, it won't just be the city of Chicago that won't be able to maintain this mission, it's the entire country that is now at stake. MAYOR ERIC ADAMS (D-NEW YORK CITY, NY): The federal government said to New York City, we're not going to do our job. You do our job.

      "sentences": "Well, Abby, what U.S. officials are hoping for is for Mexico to do something to stem the flow of illegal migration. That's the bottom line. And what we were expecting U.S. officials to ask Mexico for is for them to move migrants south.Now, that's code for upping law enforcement. We've seen this in the past during prior surges when some of these talks have happened in the past. And what Mexico usually does is they start chartering flights from Northern Mexico to Central or Southern Mexico or they up deportation flights or buses and send these migrants directly to their home countries. We're also expecting U.S. officials to ask Mexico to control their railway. That's how migrants move very quickly from Southern Mexico to Northern Mexico through something called Laressia (ph). That's what they call the railway. And in past surges, what Mexico has done is they've installed checkpoints that don't allow migrants to get onto those trains. And then, finally, we're expecting the U.S. to ask Mexico to provide incentives for migrants to stay in Mexico. Now, I've got to tell you from experience, from talking to a lot of migrants, migrants don't want to stay in Mexico. But bottom line is that whatever Mexico does or doesn't do impacts the number of apprehensions at the U.S. southern border. Now, here's the reality. Yes, the numbers have dipped in the past few days, no question. Earlier this month, a seven day average for migrant apprehensions was at about 9,600. On Tuesday, apprehensions were about 6,000. But here's how you've got to look at it. If your home is flooded five feet and, yes, the water level drops about two, three inches, yes, that's some relief. But your home is still flooded. That's exactly what's happening on the border right now. Border Patrol is still overwhelmed. They're stretched thin. Yes, they've gotten really good at decompression and that's why we don't see 15,000 migrants under a bridge. But that doesn't mean that there are no gaps in border security. There are gaps in border security, and that's what keeps border patrol agents up at night. Abby?",

They're coming from the south, from Guatemala. They don't want to stay in the southern part of Mexico because there's really no industries or anything for them to get jobs. But they want to reach Central Mexico and Northern Mexico and stay there, nine out of ten.So, these caravans never reach the United States. They dissipate because Mexico is very long. It's a thousand miles between the southern border with Guatemala to the southern border of the United States. So, they never reach the United States with these caravans.

The great many of us that have tried for years on end to save the party from what we have seen to be imminent death have soon realized that, you know, maybe the party doesn't want saving from itself. Maybe it wants a character like Trump that's going to be bold and brash and not say what should be conventional wisdom, like the answer to what was the reason for the Civil War. Trump would never come out and say slavery was his country's original sin. But you know, guess what? We are a country that can, has, and will strive to be a more perfect union like our founders wanted. That's an answer that Nikki Haley should have given. Chris Christie, I believe, would have given that answer. So, you see in this mixed bag of candidates, this clown car that still exists on the right, this inability to get serious, this inability to get past this party that wants to do nothing more but talk social issues, talk about fear, and an illegitimate fear, I must add, of the unknown and the changing face of America, the anger about that. Those are what defines the Republican Party today. And I think when we talk about these internal spats between Trump or Vivek or Trump or Nikki or between Ron and Vivek, none of it matters.

You know, it's pretty clear that it's basically harassment.They are trying to provoke a law enforcement response to your home in an effort to terrorize your family, to potentially provoke a lethal incident or to even just communicate that they know where you live and they can kind of reach out and exercise some sort of power over you. And I can tell you from personal experience recently, it is terrifying and it's incredibly disturbing. And particularly to your family members you have to go through with it.

And it seems the process now, they focus on a much more subtle response, at least initially. I can tell you my own situation. Maybe two officers in separate cars show up initially. They try to do an assessment of the house, of what's going on in the area, to try to see if they can perceive if there's anything that seems amiss. And then they make contact with the occupants of the house to say, if you can get the homeowner or the spouse on the phone to say, are you okay? Is there anything going on in the house? We're outside. And if all the questions are yes and positive, then they'll say, okay, come to the front door. I'm standing on the front door, come and talk to me. So, it's a way of assessing what's going on and responding, but in a way that's less likely to provoke a lethal mistake or response where somebody could really get hurt.",
