In that time, Gaza's ministry of health says more than 33,000 people have been killed.Gaza's infrastructure and largest hospital have been destroyed and now more than 1 million Palestinians have taken refuge in the southern town of Rafah. Meanwhile, the U.S. is warning Iran not to use Israel strike on Tehran's diplomatic mission in Damascus on Monday as a reason to attack U.S. personnel and facilities. The U.S. State Department says the warning is a response to a message from Iran. Iran says it warned the U.S., quote, \"not to get dragged into Netanyahu's trap,\" end quote. The World Central Kitchen is calling for an independent investigation into the Israeli strike that killed seven of its workers. The IDF released a report on Friday, saying errors in decision-making led to the strike. And the Norwegian Refugee Council says aid flowing into Gaza for new crossings offer a glimmer of hope. Israel has approved a plan to allow aid to flow through the Erez crossing and to the Israeli port of Ashdod. Israeli officials tell CNN that will happen tomorrow.

U.S. and Israeli officials are saying that this attack by Iran is basically inevitable and that the two governments have been working together furiously to prepare for such a scenario. Though, even as of Friday, officials are not entirely clear on exactly when and how Iran would carry out this attack. We're also told that, after that Damascus airstrike by the Israelis that took out those Iranian officials, Iran actually sent a message to the U.S., blaming the U.S. for that attack. And that the U.S.' response was to say that the U.S. had no involvement in the attack, didn't know about the attack ahead of time and that the U.S. also warned Iran against coming after U.S. personnel and U.S. assets, an exchange that certainly highlights how volatile this current situation is -- MJ Lee, CNN, at the White House (END VIDEOTAPE)",

After the vehicles left the warehouse where the aid had been unloaded, one of the commanders mistakenly assumed that the gunman were located inside the accompanying vehicles. In a separate briefing, adding more detail and specificity to the public report, the IDF told journalists that they had misidentified, something slung over the shoulder of one of the passengers, mistakenly thinking it was a weapon. On closer examination, they discovered it was a bag. They also described in harrowing detail how the aid workers had fled from the first vehicle when it was hit to another vehicle, only to be killed seconds later. ROBERTSON (voice-over): World Central Kitchen have described the report as cold comfort for the outrageous killing of their staff, whom they say the IDF acknowledges followed all proper communications procedures. Adding video, the IDF showed them fails to show any cause to fire on our personnel. The United States withholding judgment on the report.

This poses a huge challenge when it comes to transporting aid in and around northern and central Gaza.

Of course, the hope is that this will provide some respite. There has been growing calls for further land crossings to be opened up. We've seen, of course, the establishment of a maritime corridor. We've seen airdrops of aid. But the repeated message that we've been hearing from aid organizations and world leaders, is that we need more land crossings. This is the most efficient and effective way of getting humanitarian supplies in to Gaza. But of course, it remains needs to be seen how successful this will be.

That came a day after Russia launched a so-called double-tap strike on Zaporizhzhya, killing at least three people. Ukraine says one wave of attacks drew first responders to the scene before they were hit by a second wave 40 minutes later; 19 people were injured, including two Ukrainian journalists. There's no word yet if first responders are among the victims. Ukraine has reportedly launched its own back-to-back strikes, targeting Russian airfields. Ukrainian sources say the attacks went after military airports in Russia's Saratov and Krasnodar regions on Friday, which came on the heels of similar strikes on an airfield in the Rostov region. One source told CNN at least six Russian fighter jets were destroyed and about 20 service members killed or wounded. We cannot independently confirm those claims. Russia says it shot down dozens of Ukrainian drones in those regions but it's not saying anything about the airfields. Mexico says it's breaking diplomatic relations with Ecuador.

I think the first thing it means that if the Fed had to decide right now to make an interest cut, rate cut, they wouldn't. So that means the numbers in inflation is still cooling but not as much. And with wage growth still pretty high, about 4.1 percent, it's not the time that inflation is still out of the woods.

The Biden administration also was able to inject $60 million in emergency aid so that we could start to begin to repair a lot of the damage but also start to look at what is the impact to the workers in the Port of Baltimore. And mainly the workers that we saw here on the bridge, many people like them, how are we going to support them as we start to rebuild this very vital lifeline, which was the Key Bridge and the Port of Baltimore?",

We know that, if we were to go back to the Trump administration, we would not be able to make progress on this very vital issue. We, in February, had a potential comprehensive deal when it came to our national security spending.
