Under the new guidelines, that ban would extend all the way to 12th grade. And teachers who violate the rules could lose their license.",

      "sentences": "Well, there are a number of terrible things that are a part of this proposal.Number one is that it targets individual educators. If you remember, last year, when we were debating the initial law, we were told that this was really narrowly focused on holding school districts accountable. But as proposed, this new state Board of Education policy would actually make teachers individually liable, putting their professional licenses on the line. This comes at a time when we already have 8,000 vacant teacher positions in the state of Florida, largely because they have undergone character assassination over the last couple of years. And it's interesting that the commission, education commissioner there, Manny Diaz, talked about clarifying things. Because what the state Board of Education and the Department of Education, as a whole, has refused to do is clarify the vague language that's originally in this law that has led to books being banned. That has led to censorship of rainbow safe space stickers in classrooms, that lead to places like Miami-Dade, refusing to recognize LGBTQ history month. They've been asked to define what classroom instruction on sexual orientation and gender identity means and they have refused to at every step of the way. But instead, they're going to impose new restrictions, are going to impose new liability on individual educators threatening their livelihoods for something they themselves refused to define in law.",

      "sentences": "Well listen, I think everyone wants parents to be deeply involved in education. I know my education was at its best when my parents were deeply involved, were showing up to after-school activities and parent-teacher conferences.But ask yourself what those words actually mean, \"sexual orientation and gender identity.\" And what a blanket prohibition on any instruction, incorporating those topics might look like. Does that mean that, for instance, Romeo and Juliet will no longer be allowed to be discussed in classrooms? What about any other book that features, you know, a mom and a dad or two moms or two dads? You know, think about the first grade reading book that's been recommended by the state of Florida that includes Benjamin Franklin and talks about his relationship with his wife. When you start to talk about a blanket prohibition on acknowledging that people fall in love with other people, and that people have families, you can see why we've ended up in a place where you know there are upwards of 100 or 200 books being challenged in in school districts across the state. You can see why we're in a place where a book like \"And Tango Makes Three,\" which is the animated retelling of a true story from the Central Park Zoo of two male penguins raising a chick together, why that book has been challenged and banned in a number of school districts across the state. You can see why, in a free state, as Ron DeSantis likes to say it, like Florida, people are concerned about banning books and censoring history and curriculum. Because when you put in a blanket prohibition on topics of sexual orientation and gender identity, what you're really saying is that teachers can no longer or should no longer feel comfortable talking about the realities of our society and our families.",

I'm frustrated for parents and families in Florida who've been lied to for a year who've been gaslit.In the very beginning, we were told that this bill was narrow in scope, that it was only intended to do a handful of things. But that the language had to remain vague and broad on purpose. And as a result, we've watched, as again, Miami-Dade County refused to recognize LGBTQ history month or, you know when we saw yearbooks trying to be censored in Orange County, when we saw teachers in in Orange County being told to hide family photos in their desks. All of that, all of those chilling effects have been in direct response to this law, which the State Department - which the Department of Education refuses to clarify the language of. And then comes out and says not only will we not clarify the language, but we're actually going to expand the prohibition, k to 12th grade, and put legal liability on individual educators.",

They're angry, they say, over the decision by the Macron government to force through the legislation last Thursday against what they feared would be a loss in favor of it at the national assembly. In other words, they didn't think that they would get it onto the statute but without presidential fear. This has sparked what is now the sixth day of demonstrations. This was an organized demonstration by the unions. According to the interior ministry, a million and 89,000 people came out onto the streets across France. This demonstration, the authorities say, had about 120,000 people in it. There has been some violence and burning of kiosks and chucking of rocks at the police. The police have responded with tear gas. And at this stage, though, the demonstration appears to be coming to an end after a lot of kind of back and forth between the demonstrators and the police. There is a rump element always at the end of these demonstrations, who perhaps have come out more for a fight, than to make their political views known. But that is also not to undermine the widespread anger that exists about these reforms coming across France. Regular opinion polls show about two-thirds of the population are against Macron's reforms. But he said in interviews recently with the French media that there was going to be no U-turn, that this reform of the pensions, whatever happens on the streets here, is going through, according to Macron.

ELIZABETH COHEN, CNN SENIOR MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: You know, most of the experts for us will tell you that it's not because autism itself is going up. They don't think that's the issue. What they think is the issue - and this is actually in some ways a good thing - is that doctors are getting better at diagnosing it. They're getting better at diagnosing autism, and they're getting better at diagnosing it earlier. And they're also getting better at diagnosing it in children of color. This has been a real problem with autism - there was clearly children of color with autism who were being missed for all sorts of reasons. And doctors have been told to get better about this, and, in fact, those numbers are, indeed, getting better. But still, it's thought that autism does get missed in general and children of, you know, throughout the population. So in a way, seeing these rates tick up in some ways is a good thing.",
