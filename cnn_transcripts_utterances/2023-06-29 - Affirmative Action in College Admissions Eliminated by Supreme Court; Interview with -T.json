And white suburban independent voters, specifically, that this is something where they think they can broaden beyond their base, and now they have a 6-3 court decision here to bolster that argument.KATE BOLDUAN, CNN NEWS CENTRAL CO-ANCHOR:  All right. David, stick with us. We're also getting -- there's a lot of reaction coming in, a lot of news coming in with regard to this very, very momentous decision coming down from the Supreme Court from our colleagues, Arlette Saenz and Kevin Liptak, over at the White House. They're reporting an administration officials says that the Biden administration from the White House to the Department of Education is now reviewing the affirmative action decision from the Supreme Court. You can be sure we're going to hear much more from White House and the Department of Education coming up on that. But I want to get back over to Jessica Schneider.

There's a passage that jumped out from a -- from Justice Sotomayor's dissent, this is at page 47.

Republicans hailing this decision and praising what came down from this conservative majority on the Supreme Court.Just a taste of what some of the members have said, it just didn't matter (ph) in the last few minutes. Chuck Schumer, the senate majority leader said that, the Supreme Court has been, \"Giant roadblock on our country's march towards justice.\" He said, the consequences of this decision, he says, will be felt immediately among people applying in the next admissions cycle. And they'll have, in Schumer's words, fewer opportunities than their siblings did just years ago. The Congressional Black Caucus which is, mostly, just Democrats in the house, Democratic caucus, members were African American in that Congressional Black Caucus, a very large block in that -- in the House said that, by delivering a decision on affirmative action so radical that to deny young people seeking education. They said that the Supreme Court has thrown into question its own legitimacy. Now, Republicans have a much different view. Virginia Fox, the Republican who chairs the House Education and the Workforce Committee said that, no longer will academias, ivory towers be able to divide and promote preferences based on the color of one's own skin. And we just got a comment from the Speaker of the House, Kevin McCarthy, who said that no American should be denied educational opportunities because of race. He goes on to say that, students will be able to compete based on equal standards and individual merit. And the college -- this will make the college admissions process fairer and uphold equality. So, so much on Capitol Hill along the party lines, this is no different. This is a -- this major, major case that could upend how the selection process occurs in colleges and it could have a significant impact on diversity in those college campuses. The reaction on the Hill coming down pretty much along party lines. Democrats expressing grave disappointment. Republicans hailing it. Unclear whether there will be any sort of legislative action. I talked to one Democratic Senator, Peter Welsh, just moments ago, about whether they'll keep things -- the Democrats in the Senate, where they control the majority there should try to move in any way to try to change -- to curtail this in any way. He said that it's really unclear what they could possibly do. Of course, they have to contend with the Republican House. So, unlikely, for any congressional action.

      "sentences": "Right. Well -- so, initially there was a drop in California and in Michigan. And then they instituted a number of race neutral (ph) alternatives. Now, if you read the Amicus briefs that those universities filed that -- they would suggest to you that this has been a disaster. That, you know, that they haven't been able to recover. But if you look at what the admissions numbers at those institutions, particularly at places like UCLA, they now have a higher black population representation today using things like socioeconomic disadvantage than they did in the days when they were able to use race in admissions. So, it -- it's much more expensive, that's the rub here. Universities will tell you, there's no way we can get racial diversity without using race because it's much easier and less expensive for them to bring in upper middle-class and wealthy individuals of all races than to do the hard work of admitting working-class students, low-income students of all races.And I want to be clear, you know, I think we have a lot of -- we have a horrible history on race in this country that we have to address. There is ongoing -- there are ongoing questions of racial inequality that are important to address. But you can do that through the socioeconomic factors in particular by looking at things like wealth. It turns out that, you know, there's a huge wealth gap between black and white individuals because of our history of slavery, segregation, red lining. And so, if universities shift to considering those types of factors, they can, you know, comply with the U.S. Supreme Court which says, don't use race, but they can also implicitly recognize our history and ongoing realities with race. and I think that's important to note. So, we're not ending affirmative action, we're shifting the basis of affirmative action to something that is going to be much more popular. The public broadly supports giving a leg up to economically disadvantaged students of all races. There are strong opposition to race -- using race per se. So, in that sense, this decision is very different than the abortion decision. In that case, the Supreme Court was rubbing up against public opinion. In this case, they actually have public opinion on their side.",

      "sentences": "Right. Well, I -- I mean, I think the safest thing for universities to do is to primarily emphasize the, you know, the socioeconomic factors as a measure of, you know, of true merits. So, you're looking at the academic record, all the other, you know, extracurriculars in light of what obstacles the student has overcome. And there, I think it is relevant to consider the race of an applicants in overcoming obstacles.So, if a student writes in her essay about the way in which it's, you know, it's been very difficult being the only black student in an A.P. class, that that should be something that is considered not in terms of just diversity, but rather adversity. They've overcome adversity. And I think that will be a way that universities can continue to make sure that their classes are racially diverse. On Berkeley, just very quickly. So, Berkeley and all the elite universities that can't use race, are fighting for talented black and Hispanic students with one hand tied behind their back. So, if you get into Berkeley and you're an African American student, and you get in without consider of race, you probably also get into Stanford where they can, you know, until today, have been able to use race. And where are you going to? So, it's remarkable that Berkeley has been able to do as well as it has. The other thing to note is that Berkeley does not use wealth in admissions, which I think that they should take a look at because that is the most highly racialized socioeconomic factor that's out there. And it's completely unfair to black and Hispanic students not count being from a low wealth family. And I think Berkeley should do that, and if they do, they'll do better on racial diversity.",

It's, you know, affirmative action in reverse.And I -- it was astounding to me when I testified in the Harvard case, I said, one of the things Harvard should do is get rid of legacy preferences. And they came back and said, oh, no, no, we can't do that. We have to build relationships with our alumni. And they furthermore said that, having -- this is unbelievable to me, having legacy preferences promoted diversity in their view. Because the dean said, you know, having students who've had more experience with Harvard interact with students who've had less experience with Harvard makes them better citizen leaders because they learn from one another.

They're based on a lot of different things. So, it's been mentioned, if you get a violinist who happens to be really, really good or a jazz musician that happens to be really, really good, that could make a difference in college admissions. So, the thing that students might -- that thing that lawsuits might end up trying to challenge is the extent to which whatever benefits a person had by virtue of the high grades or scores somehow justified their admission over somebody with lower scores, that's going to be really hard to prove given the fact that diversity is a lot -- about a lot more than race.",
