CNN has reached out to the IDF for comment on this strike, but has not yet received a response.Displaced and desperate, thousands of Gazans are yearning to return to their homes. And as CNN's Jomana Karadsheh tells us, some of them undertaking a dangerous journey to get there. A warning, some of the images you're about to see are graphic and may be disturbing. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JOMANA KARADSHEH, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Their day started with rare excitement and joy. After months of hell, they thought they were returning to the homes they were forced out of months ago. On foot and in carts. Thousands of displaced Palestinians on the move again, some with their most valuable possessions. They said we can go back home to Gaza City today, the Elan (ph) says, with her son and cats she took to the road. No one knows where the news came from. There was no official announcement from the Israeli military that civilians would be allowed back into Northern Gaza. But a rumor enough for those left homeless shattered by war. Now facing a looming Israeli offensive on Rafah where the majority of Gazans have been pushed into. People here say they don't even know if they have homes to go back to. Little Hamad (ph) holds his tiny brother's hand and carries a bag of flour. Our house is gone. I'll live in a tent, Hamad says. I just want to go home. If I die, so be it. Death has become a reality. The longest here have been forced to accept. And on this day, they've had to accept that there will be no going home. The crowds were turned away. Fear and panic as people run back. They say Israeli soldiers opened fire as young men tried crossing the checkpoint with women and children. Several injured among them five-year-old Sally (ph). She was in her mother's arms when she was shot in the head. Two young men tried to cross with us her mother's Sabrin (ph) says. Soldiers started shooting and firing everywhere. My daughter was so scared I was holding her. Then I put her on the ground to walk. She wasn't responding. Then I saw all the blood on my hands. The Israeli military is not commented on Sally's injury. They said the north remains a war zone and returns not permitted. Sally clings on to life unconscious on the hospital floor with the muffled cries of another injured child next to her. And at a hospital nearby another young boy back from a different nightmare when no child should ever endure. Eleven-year-old Nimr (ph) was out getting aid for his family when he says he was shot and detained for two weeks, taken to Israel where he underwent surgery, still in pain and shock he shows the camera his horrific scars. The day they took me the soldier kicked me with his boot he tells his mother over the phone. My head still hurts. He kicked me with the metal tip of his boot. I was shot in the stomach lying on the floor. He hit me with no mercy. I'm waiting for the day to grow up, to be a resistance fighter and hit him like he hit me. The Israeli military is not responded to CNN's specific questions on Nimr's account. This is the first time in 15 days he's hearing his mother's voice. I've missed you so much, he cries. They didn't let me see you. I wish I hadn't come back, Nimr says. I wish I had died. Jomana Karadsheh, CNN, London. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) PAULA REID, CNN SENIOR LEGAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): The Supreme Court's conservative majority appears likely to toss a criminal charge that hundreds of Capitol rioters and former President Donald Trump have faced a decision that could deal a significant blow to the Justice Department. Today's case centers on Joseph Fisher, a former Pennsylvania police officer who is charged with multiple federal crimes for his role in the January 6th attack. According to court documents, even texting, take Democratic Congress to the gallows and can't vote if they can't breathe. LOL. He is challenging a federal law that makes it a crime for anyone who otherwise obstructs, influences or impedes any official proceeding. Arguing the law passed in 2002 in the wake of the Enron accounting scandal is not meant to apply to January 6 rioters.
