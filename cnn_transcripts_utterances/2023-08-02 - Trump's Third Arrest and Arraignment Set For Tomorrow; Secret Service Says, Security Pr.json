Stand by for new details on his court date tomorrow, less than 48 hours after his January 6th indictment was unsealed.Also tonight, we're tracking new security concerns and potential threats just ahead of Trump's expected court appearance here. CNN is over at the courthouse where by federal and local law enforcement officials are now under way. And many GOP lawmakers are still defending Trump tonight, even after his third indictment. I'll speak with a vocal critic of Trump and his actions, Republican Presidential Candidate and former Congressman Will Hurd. Welcome to our viewers here in the United States and around the world. I'm Wolf Blitzer. You're in The Situation Room. We begin with Donald Trump on the brink right now of being arrested and arraigned for a third time. The former president is set to respond to that grave new federal indictment accusing him of orchestrating a plot to try to overturn the 2020 presidential election. Let's go right to our Senior Legal Affairs Correspondent Paula Reid, she is here with me in The Situation Room. Is it your understanding that Trump will appear actually physically at the courthouse here in Washington tomorrow?",

So, it's not clear if we'll even get to see him at all because he has the option to enter through an underground garage.Now, once he's inside the courthouse, he is effectively under arrest. He'll be processed like any other defendant. But we don't expect that there's going to will be a mug shot. He's one of the most famous people in the world. If he was to go on the lamb, they know what he looks like, so they don't need that. When he's in the courtroom, he'll have the charges against likely read to him. He'll have the opportunity to enter a plea. We would expect that to be not guilty. This is a pretty quick procedural hearing in front of a magistrate judge. And he knows what to expect.

They're discussing a national security issue, but they suggest Trump hold off on doing anything because inauguration day is coming, and the defendant allegedly said, yes, you're right, it's too late for us. We're going to have to give that to the next guy. Just one example of how they're trying to show that he knew these election fraud claims were untrue.

I think it's fair to say a bid to perhaps rattle NATO members. We also saw comments -- stark comments from Polish top officials today saying they were deeply concerned by what they said was a Belarusian brief incursion by two military helicopters into Polish air space. Belarus, of course, a key Russian ally in this. These two incidents possibly not coincidental, frankly. We maybe seeing Russian President Vladimir Putin finding himself certainly under pressure here in the south and maybe making escalatory steps like this to sort of feed the narrative that's being pushed inside Moscow that Russia's in fact at war with the entire NATO bloc. Not true, NATO is supplying weapons and training to Ukraine, but not in the fight. Certainly, though, many concerned about another possible night of attacks by Russia inside Ukraine.
