He has been trying to give us the U.S. administration reaction to what has been going on in terms of our breaking news that Hamas says it has agreed to some type of a ceasefire just to recap on what Mr. Miller said regarding the U.S. administration reaction, they say that William Burns, the CIA director remains on the scene, that he is evaluating this in real time. They do not want to characterize this peace agreement. So far, just to see if it can work or at camp, they do not want to prejudge. But at this point, they say they are looking at it, and we just want to bring you right up to date that what the developments are to this hour, we have learned that Hamas is now saying that they have agreed to some type of a ceasefire. A member of the Hamas political bureau in fact, tells CNN that Hamas is waiting for the Israeli response. And that was after the group agreed do a ceasefire and hostage deal proposed by Egypt and Qatar. Now, a source says mediators convinced Hamas to accept the deal after a meeting between the Qatari Prime Minister and U.S. CIA Director William Burns. The Israeli Prime Minister's office has declined comment as of now. We've learned though that the Israeli government is reviewing the Hamas announcement. It's unclear whether Hamas has agreed to a framework that became public last week that called for the release of 20 to 33 Israeli hostages over several weeks in exchange now for a temporary ceasefire and the release of Palestinian prisoners. What is key there is a temporary ceasefire. All of this comes as refugees in Rafah, of course, have been ordered to evacuate by the Israeli army. Eastern Rafah is where an expected ground invasion could happen at any moment. It's a desperate situation as you can imagine for tens of thousands, perhaps even hundreds of thousands of Palestinians already crowded in this potential war zone. Meantime, world pressure is mounting on Israel not to invade Rafah. The U.S., Germany, Britain, Egypt and other nations have expressed concern about the looming humanitarian crisis, and we will add that President Biden had a phone call with Netanyahu not too long ago. Again, expressing his rejection of this plan for Rafah. Joining me now is international diplomatic editor Nic Robertson live from London. So much to get through and to update everyone on. Nic, can you bring us right up to date on what appears to be the Hamas acceptance? Now, look, this does not mean that it is anything that Israel can accept, but do you view this at least in some measure as a good step forward?",

We've seen a lot of protests in the past year-and-a-half under the judicial reform, and since the war broke out with Hamas in Gaza after the October 7th massacre. But this will be something of another scale because he will be seen as potentially being the person to stop it. But if he does agree to the deal, and he releases and he stops the war, gets the hostages released, he potentially loses his coalition. We already saw a statement released by Itamar Ben-Gvir; one of the more far-right members of Mr. Netanyahu's coalition saying, no, we need to go into Rafah right now, and I think that this is what makes Netanyahu in a very complicated situation at the moment. And why he probably definitely politically-speaking, and I would say probably also from a security standpoint, it wouldn't make sense for Israel today to agree to say the war is completely over. You still have 15,000 Hamas armed men in Rafah, you have four battalions there. We saw just yesterday that they have the ability to fire rockets and mortars from Rafah into Israel, killed four soldiers.

Just a few days ago cutting off trade that Israel's had with Turkey for -- or more than 70 years since we were established as a country. But there are other players in this region. The Saudis are a key player. The Emirates are key player. The Egyptians with which Israel has had peace since 1979 is a key player.

That is John Kirby, National Security Spokesperson, trying to bring us right up to dateon what is going on with the proposed ceasefire between Hamas and Israel. What we know now is that Hamas has agreed to something, the White House refusing to comment on exactly the details of that. What is interesting, though, is that John Kirby said that this is at a critical stage and that these negotiations are sensitive, and that, again, the CIA director, William Burns, is dealing with all of this in real time, and that although the U.S. President Joe Biden and Benjamin Netanyahu spoke, when they spoke earlier, they did not know that Hamas would come back in acceptance of this deal. What is interesting here is that we still have no details, the White House not offering any. Again, though, the White House being very clear of what seems to be imminent or perhaps even ongoing this hour is any future Israeli military operations in Rafah. They said they do not support them. This is at issue because we heard an aid worker earlier in this hour tell us that as celebrations were breaking out in Gaza over this proposed ceasefire deal, that he could still hear airstrikes overhead. We want to get some analysis on this. I want to bring in our Jim Sciutto, who is following this from New York. And in the region are Paula Hancocks, who is in Abu Dhabi. Jim, to you first, just your impressions about what you heard, especially the detail in terms of the timing here. It seems that William Burns and John Kirby wanted to make this clear, that he believes that Hamas accepted something, whatever it is in terms of detail. But that was as a result of the CIA director still speaking to all players on the ground there.",

As he said, he doesn't want to speak publicly about the details. He called this, as you mentioned, Paula, an extremely sensitive time. So, we know the U.S. is reviewing the Hamas response, and it's our understanding that Israel is reviewing the response as well. That does not mean that Israel will accept those terms as described by Hamas. And when we look at some of the details as described publicly by the Hamas spokespeople, there are things in that agreement, including in the second stage, a complete Israeli withdrawal from Gaza, which seems far further along than we've certainly heard the Israelis willing to go. But at least the U.S. view at this point is there's something here, the U.S. and Israel examining it, and then we'll decide next steps from there to see if it is actually a deal. To your point about Bill Burns, he's been highly involved in the -- in these negotiations, but also the previous successful ceasefire negotiations. He typically does not fly out to the region to meet the players unless there is something possible, and he's been there now for some time. So they believe there was at least a serious opportunity. Of course, Paula, we have to inject some skepticism here, just because we've been close before and haven't gotten that deal across the finish line. But this is a key point here where, well, it's possible they might make some progress.",

Obviously, as I said, we just had in the last hour at CNN a heartbreaking interview with one of the mothers of one of the hostages. They want this done. They want to be able to hug their loved ones. Paula Hancocks, look, I just reported the fact that Israel certainly continues some kind of limited operation in Rafah right now. You know Rafah quite well. You know Netanyahu's plan. He is saying that, look, if we don't go into Rafah, we cannot be done with Hamas once and for all. How do you view all of this in terms of how it's coming together in the region? The fact that Hamas did seem to say, look, we'll accept this. Obviously, the devil's in the detail.",
