A Japan Airlines plane bursting into flames as it touches down at Tokyo Haneda Airport. That's according to the national broadcaster, NHK. CNN's Will Ripley is live for us in Tokyo. Will, this just happened. Information is still coming here to CNN. What can you tell us at this hour?",

      "sentences": "Hi, Kasie.Well, the headline here is that all nearly 400 people on board this plane, as horrific as these pictures look, they walked away. They evacuated safely after this, what appears to be some sort of a collision between two planes on the runway at Haneda Airport, about 20 minutes from where I am here in Tokyo. This is an airport that sits right next to a Japan coast guard base. It's right in the same area, right along the bay. And what national broadcaster NHK is reporting, and CNN's working to confirm independently, is that as this Japan airliner from the power, which is a popular tourist destination this time of year in Japan, which is why the plane was packed with 367 passengers and 12 crew members, it touched down at Haneda Airport right around 6:00 local time. It was actually scheduled to touch down about 20 minutes earlier, however the plane might have been running a bit behind schedule. So, as this plane touched down, there's actually video of this. You can see a second plane kind of coming from the same area, and then the two planes had a collision, burst into flames, and then separate it apart. They're large a learning basically was with its engine touching the ground, basically a fire that began with the engine in the back of the plane, as well. It continued to spread in a matter of minutes. The entire plane was engulfed. But, what Japan airlines is saying is that the crew members were able to safely get everybody on board, all the passengers, all the crew members, around 400 people off that plane safely. Now, the Japan coast guard, according to NHK, they are still trying to determine the status of the half a dozen or so people who are on board that much of smaller coast guard aircraft. We're working to confirm details about that right now. We don't know their conditions, but it looks a very bad for both planes, frankly, and the fact that this pact airliner, this Japan airliner, an Airbus A350, which such a dramatic fire, just minutes after this instance got all the passengers of. They've been posting videos on social media, Kasie, from inside the plane where you can see the engine on fire. You can hear people in the cabin realizing that something had gone terribly wrong, obviously reeling from the jolt of the impact with another aircraft, and yet, they were able to somehow pick themselves up from that, get off the plane, get off safely. That is a truly extraordinary and certainly a piece of good news that Japan badly needs right now, especially after the earthquake that rattled the west coast of central Japan just hours after ringing in the New Year and the death toll from that earthquake continues to tick up. The fact that this story has a different ending, Kasie, is something that people across Japan can certainly take comfort in during these difficult times for this nation.",

It's also where our CNN Tokyo Bureau is located. I've flown into Haneda Airport many times. It is busy, it's a lovely airport, and they are very meticulous about safety at Haneda, which is why they are going to be really digging into what exactly caused this. Was it some sort of miscommunication with the air traffic control tower? How did these two planes, in such a safety conscious nation that has never even had a single fatality for the bullet trains that they've been running since the 1960s and has one of the best safety records for public transit in the world, despite the earthquakes and all the other natural disasters that Japan has to endure, how did this happen that these two planes ended up in the same place, colliding in such a violent manner? Those are going to be some very hard questions that Japan is going to be asking. If past disasters tell us anything, Japan will do everything they can to learn exactly what happened from this and take very, very detailed and specific steps to try to prevent it from happening again. That's how it works here, that's why it's so safe here most of the time. And, frankly, it's probably why the passengers and crew of this packed airplane that has now in flames as we speak, we're able to get off safely. Because at a really, when you get on board as Japanese airline, that safety video. They are in the aisles, all airlines are diligent when it comes to this, but they are particularly so here in Japan. And it seems as though those efforts certainly would have paid off. This is an extraordinary situation that is unfolding before our eyes tonight.",

Here's a little bit more video of what may have happened on landing here. You can see out the window there of this plane as it touches down at Haneda Airport.

Yet, granted, that is a very short clip. So we are, of course, already at the airport, hoping to speak to whatever passengers we can. We have a crew over there.Because one of the questions that arise in my mind, what was it like inside the cabin? That short clip, that video, you didn't hear a huge amount of panic. But, of course, the video stopped abruptly. Actually, the rules are in Japan, you're not supposed to ever record on your phone during an evacuation. I remember that from the safety video that I watched on my flight, which landed just a few hours ago at a different airport, at Narita Airport. This incident happened at Haneda Airport, which is probably my favorite airport in Tokyo. The two major airports that service Tokyo, because it's so convenient. And for these passengers that were coming from Sapporo, likely a lot of international tourists on that flight because Sapporo in northern Japan is always a popular place to visit, especially during the winter months. People love to ski, they love to go and take tours of the Sapporo bureau, they love it to experience the beautiful nature up there and basically these flights will come from Sapporo to Tokyo, Haneda, one of the major airports that they transit and move on to other international destinations. So, it will be interesting to see who is on this plane, where did they come from, what are their stories? A lot of questions for these people who really survived to something that looks on the surface like it would have been unsurvivable. Yet they are all, almost 400 of them, they are all alive, Kasie.",

But at this point we don't know the specific circumstances as to why this news briefing, this news conference has been canceled. But as you have seen, this video is a very dramatic. And Mr. Lee is a very well-known politician here in South Korea. He is a household name, although, at times, controversial. He's now the target of an investigation, but he is the leader of the opposition party, the Liberal Democratic Party. He has been on the campaign trail helping other politicians gain prominence as South Korea enters its general election. As we have seen in this video he was walking with a group of people, some reporters nearby, when a man in his 60s went up to the side of him, ask for an autograph, and then was attacked by a knife. We saw one image of him lying on the ground with someone applying what appears to be a handkerchief to his neck, perhaps to quell the bleeding. As far as this man in his 60s, this accused suspect, we don't know his name, we do not know any kind of motive of what would perhaps prompted this. As far as this election, this is a very contentious time in South Korea and both parties have condemned this attack. They don't want this to be politicized, Kasie.",

And, more than 35 aftershocks of a 2.5 magnitude or greater of his Japan after the powerful earthquake struck its west coast New Year's day, triggering multiple tsunami warnings. Officials removed all tsunami alerts last night. Our weatherman, Derek Van Dam, joins us now with the latest on this. Derek, happy New Year. Good morning. What is the latest there? DEREK VAN DAM, AMS CERTIFIED METEOROLOGIST:  Yeah, it's a tumultuous start to 2024 across Japan, to say the least, with all the breaking news coming out of that country today. But we are still following this mega 7.5 magnitude earthquake that struck yesterday and we have course have had so many aftershocks that have registered about 2.5 magnitude or higher. We've had roughly a 38 since the original 7.5 struck, again, occurring late last night and overnight. That forced, of course the tsunami warnings. We are recovering this across the Ishikawa prefecture that is in the western side of the country should. You can see some of the resulting damage left over from the tsunami that brought in a wave of water into Suzu, Japan, in that area. We anticipate more aftershocks to continue, a potential here for some larger aftershocks, maybe 5.5 or 6.5 or greater. Unfortunately, to make matters worse, there is some wet weather or even some higher elevation snow anticipated across, near and around the epicenter. That is something that we're monitoring, as well. And, hey, you know, Casey, I'm not sure if you felt this, but we've got to -- we got to mention this. This is a far cry from what happened in Japan, but nonetheless, it is noteworthy. There was an earthquake just northwest of D.C. overnight, actually occurring about 12:51 in the morning. People in the D.C. suburbs actually reporting that their house and windows shook for roughly 10 seconds when this 2.3 magnitude earthquake struck the region. It was a rather shallow depth.
