That's the dire warning coming from the united agency -- United Nations Agency working in the enclave, as Israel continues its bombardment. Then Russia fires a barrage of cruise missiles at Ukraine for the first time in weeks. We're live on the ground with the latest. Plus, Hunter Biden lashing out at house Republicans after being hit with a number of new federal charges. That story, coming up. The U.N. Agency for Palestinian refugees warns that Gaza is in its darkest hour, quote, \"on the brink of full-blown collapse\". U.N. officials are pushing again for an urgent ceasefire in the Israel-Hamas war. Security Council members are meeting in an extraordinary session after Secretary- General Antonio Guterres invoked a rarely used power to convene them. The council could vote on a ceasefire within hours. But that effort almost certain to fail as the U.S. wields veto power. Guterres warns that Gaza is staring, quote, \"into the abyss\". (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ANTONIO GUTERRES, SECRETARY-GENERAL, UNITED NATIONS:  I deeply regret to inform the council that under current conditions on the ground, the fulfillment of this mandate has become impossible. The conditions for the effective delivery of humanitarian aid no longer exist. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And so, the bombing of Gaza continues.Israel says it struck 450 targets over the past day. That's the highest number since its short-lived truce with Hamas collapsed. And vast parts of Gaza are now laid waste. The Hamas-run Health Ministry says nearly 17,500 people have been killed, mostly women and children. Thousands more I believe buried under the rubble of crushed buildings and homes. Meanwhile, human rights groups are condemning disturbed images that have emerged of stripped detainees in Gaza. The pictures circulating on social media showed mass detentions of men, some kneeling and sitting while blindfolded in the sand. Others crowded into the back of a truck. The exact dates and circumstances of the detentions are not clear. An Israeli government spokesman says they were apprehended in Jabalia, in what he called other Hamas strongholds, and will be questioned to determine if they're terrorists or not. Let's bring in Ben Wedeman now live in Jerusalem for more. Ben, I want to start with the broader message here, well, from the United Nations, which is that Gaza faces its darkest hour, and yet what we see is Israel stepping up its campaign in the south to devastating effect.",

What we're seeing is that living conditions for the 85 percent of the population that has been displaced are getting worse and worse. And you see the spread of disease is jumping in ways that nobody had ever -- has ever seen before in Gaza. And therefore, I think this was the impetus behind the U.N. Secretary-General invoking Article 99 and calling this emergency meeting of the Security Council is that the situation in Gaza is indeed catastrophic. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

And it really all boiling down to just a few minutes where the university leaders, they struggle to answer what a lot of people thought would have been a simple question. And that's why they're under fire. And you know, the University of Pennsylvania, which is one of the most prestigious schools in America, there have been a whole series of developments in just the last 36 hours that point to significant pressure building on the leadership there. We heard from six members of Congress from Pennsylvania, calling on the school to fire Liz Magill. The Warden board of advisors, which is basically a who-is-who list of power players and business, they called for the school to have an immediate leadership change. And for the first time, the former U.S. Ambassador, Jon Huntsman, coming out and saying that the school needs a leadership change. Let me read you what Huntsman told me. He said, and I'm quoting, \"we are anchored to the past until the trustees step up and completely cut ties with current leadership\", full stop. \"At this point, it's not even debatable, just a simple IQ test.\" So, strong words there.

If the president and the Congress could explain to the American people why Ukraine feeding Russia is in our best interest, then I think most people would understand this is not an either/or, you know, our border or Ukraine. This is all about American security and American prosperity. Russia's attack on Ukraine has jacked up food prices and energy prices. It's disruptively reliable to these flows.

And it's not going to happen next year, but the Russians are on the path to rebuild their devastating losses they've suffered so that they could be ready in another three or four years. But, of course, what's happening here is not isolated, the Hamas attack on Israel was not a coincidence, that attack backed up by Iran, which is Russia's best and really only ally, is a gift to the Kremlin. Hamas did in one day what Putin could not do in two years, which is to make us forget about Ukraine. And so I think the West has got to demonstrate that we can get organized, that our combined political will, industrial capacity and military capability that we can help Ukraine defeat Russia.
