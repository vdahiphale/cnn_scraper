He should be sharp, precise, and energetic just like he was in the debate.\" Now, Donald Trump is certainly just stirring the pot with this social media post. But look, when we talk to people near and around his campaign, they believed that his easiest path to victory is for Joe Biden to remain in the race. So, perhaps what we're seeing here is some restlessness from a former president as this story and focus remains on Joe Biden now for a second week especially with so many key important dates on horizon for Donald Trump. [06:05:09] He has a rally on Tuesday in South Florida. Another later in the week. He is going to name his vice president any day now. And a little over a week from now, he will hold his convention in Milwaukee. So, perhaps the question is, how long can he allow for this story and this focus to remain on Joe Biden?

He's very clearly not as well connected to House Democrats. But the -- this time around we're not really hearing Senate Democrats come out and do events in hordes. They're not, you know, banging at the doors coming to defend him. And I think that that is very telling. This week is going to be really interesting in the House and the Senate. Tomorrow they're coming back. And again, they can't escape the questions when you're asking them in person. So again, we only see Mark Warner with this report that his aides have not denied.

I think we've heard several Democrats say that the only person who could decide is Joe Biden himself, and he remains very steadfast in the know. But I think at some point, again, they need to regroup. For the House Democrats, they've been out of the Hill for a couple weeks now. Senate is kind of still waiting to hear from even Chuck Schumer, who hasn't really publicly spoken about this too much. So, there's this feeling that they're seeking unity but also that the nervousness that it's trickling and, you know, drip, drip, drip.

She didn't talk about the debate. She didn't talk about the concerns. She didn't talk about, you know, Senate -- Mark Warner or anything. She didn't mention any of that. She also didn't really talk that much about Joe Biden himself. She just talked about what they did together as president, vice president. She talked about all the results that they delivered. And then she specifically focused on the threat of Donald Trump. She has not really, you know, come out and -- I mean, she has in the last few weeks, but she didn't really come out at this big speech to clear the air in any way in terms of what the future of the ticket is.
