      "sentences": "Reversion to the mean, I'm Michael Smerconish in Philadelphia. Think about it. One month ago today, Donald Trump looked invincible. He had a successful debate against President Biden, survived an assassination attempt, he was presiding over a unified and well-choreographed Republican convention in Wisconsin, and all the polls were in his favor.A \"New York Times\" Siena poll found that Trump was leading Biden in five of six battleground states. James Carville earned the wrath of some in his party when he wrote in the \"New York Times,\" \"The jig is up, and the sooner Mr. Biden and Democratic leaders accept this, the better we need to move forward.\" David Axelrod said that Biden was more likely to lose in a landslide than win at all. For three nights, Trump sat pensively, speaking little and watching the RNC when he spoke on the final night, victory seemed assured. And then came Kamala Harris, and Trump reverted to the mean, the real mean. He called the vice president a bum, said that she was evil, called her crazy, stupid, an incompetent socialist lunatic, and even questioned whether she was truly Black. And then he sat silently when an interviewer said that second gentleman, Doug Emhoff, was a quote unquote, \"crappy Jew.\" Trump added that Harris herself doesn't like Jewish people. He even claimed that Harris's huge crowds were actually an AI creation. And so what happened? Trump's numbers dropped, Harris's numbers rose. Today, she leads Trump in five of the six battleground states, and according to the cook New Political Report. Plus, just this morning, breaking news from the \"New York Times,\" Harris has stormed into contention in Arizona, Georgia, Nevada and North Carolina according to their new poll. They put Georgia in that mix, although Trump leads in that state, as David Frum observed, the Trump campaign has now entered the please shut up phase. Bill Galston, writing for The Wall Street Journal, said that Harris just had the three best weeks in political memory, Trump just had the three worst weeks in political memory. He wrote this, \"Mr. Trump, meanwhile, has appeared out of sorts and off balance. Rather than confront Ms. Harris on substance, he has resorted to a familiar litany of personal insults. The result has been a dissonance between his campaign ads which are mostly issue oriented, and his public comments which dominate the news and distract from his case against Ms. Harris.\" Similarly, Aaron Blake, writing in \"The Washington Post,\" put it this way, \"Recent days have featured a familiar sight, a coterie of Trump allies taking to broadcast outlets such as Fox News, seemingly to send a message to Trump in the apparent belief that this is how you get through to the cable news junkie former president. They've practically begged him to change it up. They sought to push him away from talk of crowd sizes and personal attacks on Harris, and toward policy.\" But whether he refuses to or can't, that message is going unheeded by the audience of one. Trump has been unrepentant when asked about his conduct at Thursday's presser, he blamed Harris for the weaponization of the government against him, and he said, I'm entitled to personal attacks. It sure seems like there's a causal connection between Trump's reaction to Harris and her rise in the polls, but on my Sirius XM radio program this week, Mark Halperin offered a different take.

Stop talking about stop engaging in personal insults, stop talking about things that that are off the main subjects, and just, you know, talk about the Biden-Harris record on immigration, inflation, crime, and America's role the world.Would he be doing much better? Everybody thinks so. But I'm not so sure, in part because of the press coverage, in part because she's doing quite well, and in part because there's just the natural dynamics of by not being Joe Biden, by not having the infirmity questions associated with her, she was going to be springing up.

      "sentences": "Halperin added that Trump was hit by a hurricane, whether he put up the protective covers or not, the house was still going to get blown away. Of course, whether the Harris hurricane last is another thing. Kamala Harris is not indestructible. She has served as an undistinguished, nearly invisible vice president. There appears no accomplishment she can point to for her most important responsibility, addressing the origin of the border crisis. [09Second, she picked a nice guy from Minnesota in Tim Walz, but he might turn out to have as many warts as JD Vance. And I don't mean the allegation of Stolen Valor. He spoke sloppily in that instance, but I don't think there's much there there. But the CNN KFILE report of his congressional campaign deceit over his DWI is a real and embarrassing issue. As usual, the cover up was worse than the crime. It's still too soon to know how much she might regret not picking Josh Shapiro. And third thus far, Harris has had a free ride. She's not given any media interviews. Hasn't faced voter questioning. When asked recently, she said that she would give an interview by the end of the month. She said that on August the eighth, no doubt she wants more time on the clock to prepare answers as to why she's flipped on health care, fracking, weed and the death penalty, to name just a few. Sooner or later, she's going to be held accountable and face pressure that she has thus far largely avoided. Just yesterday, her first substantive economic policy proposal, it received mixed reviews. Bernie Sanders loved it. He called her idea a strong progressive agenda, but \"The Washington Post\" said that her proposals were gimmicks. CNN's analysis said that her plan could create more problems than it solves. You'd think that she enjoy another week of positive coverage amidst the DNC, which will feature three Democratic presidents, but with passions inflamed about Israel and Gaza, there is an air of unpredictability as to what will happen in Chicago. As I like to say, still to come, events we could never foresee and individuals whose names that today we don't even know. It all brings me to today's poll question at smerconish.com between now and Election Day, who will make fewer big mistakes? Kamala Harris or Donald Trump? Joining us now, James Carville, the Democratic strategist, David Axelrod, the former senior adviser to President Obama and CNN senior political commentator. I'll ask you both this question, David, beginning with you, was her ascendancy guaranteed? Or is it because of Trump's self-destructive behavior?",

The first party that dispatched their octogenarian candidate was likely to profit from that.But it's also true that Harris got out of this -- out of the gates very quickly, and she did -- you know, she consolidated the nomination very quickly. Her performance was very strong coming out of that. And so she added to the momentum. And listen, I think she'll have a good week here. And then you hit the Labor Day, and then you have a debate one week after Labor Day. And if she does reasonably well in that debate, she could extend this momentum right into when, you know, the voting period begins. She's in a -- you know, she's in a good spot. But I -- listen, the fact that a month ago, things were the way they were. And the way they are now should be assigned to people that these things are not to be taken for granted, and things can happen that can change the scenario. It's going to be a very close race. And one of the variables, Michael, is, can Trump get control of himself? I think he's freaked out because he thought he had this one, and now he doesn't necessarily have it one. And he's looking at a woman who's telegenic. You know, he has the eye of a casting director. She's getting bigger crowds, and he's getting her poll numbers.

Trump plus nine against Biden, still plus nine against Harris. Now, however, if you take a look at Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and Michigan, put that up on the screen, the divide grows even further.

They're going to get all of this intense focus. And I frankly feel sorry for them because they're going to get inundated over the next three months. And it becomes oppressive when it's all this negativity. Why the other side is evil, and why they're enemies not just opponents. And specifically, it's the younger men versus the younger women. The divide gets smaller and smaller as you get older and older. Once you are aged 60 and older, the divide actually isn't insignificant. The biggest divide is among younger women who see in Harris themselves at some point in the future. And younger men who like Trump's rough and tumble approach to politics. You even see within the Black community, younger men under age 35, a third of them were voting for Trump over Biden. And older women in the Black community it was 95 to three in favor of the Democratic nominee. So, the divide isn't just gender-based. It's also generationally based.
