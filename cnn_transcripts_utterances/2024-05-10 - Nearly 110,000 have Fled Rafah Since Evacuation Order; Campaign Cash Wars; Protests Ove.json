Also ahead Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says his country will stand alone if it has to. That's after U.S. President Joe Biden said he would stop sending Israel certain weapons if the IDF launches a full scale invasion of Rafah. And the Eurovision Song Contest becomes the latest target for activists protesting Israel's conduct of its war against Hamas. When angry and defiant Benjamin Netanyahu says Israel will go in alone and fight with its fingernails if necessary to eliminate Hamas in Gaza. The Israeli Prime Minister responding to U.S. President Joe Biden's warning that a full scale invasion of Rafah would result in a shutdown of some American weapons deliveries. Well in an interview on an American talk show, the Prime Minister remains hopeful that the two leaders could find common ground. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

The framework that Hamas has agreed to voicing with the Israeli delegation voicing its objections to that framework listing several of the key points of disagreement and also making clear I'm told to the mediators that they were going to continue those military operations in Rafah. There is simply an enormous disagreement at this stage between the United States and Israel over that operation in Rafah, but also on the impact that operation could have on the top. The Israelis very much believe that the increased military pressure on Hamas and Rafah is what will lead Hamas to compromising further at the negotiating table that is not necessarily the sentiment of others involved in these negotiations. And so for now, it appears that the major gaps between the two sides have not been bridged. The key parties have left Cairo. Negotiations will still continue efforts among the mediators in particular, but it doesn't appear that any kind of breakthrough is imminent, and instead a major Rafah offensive seems much closer to happening, Becky.",

DONALD TRUMP (R), FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT AND 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: -- you'll see some very revealing things today. SCANNELL (voice-over): Trump's lawyer Susan Necheles spent over two hours attacking Daniels' credibility during Thursday mornings cross examination. Necheles pointed to Daniels' history of making pornographic films saying you have a lot of experience making phony stories about sex appear to be real. Daniels responded, Wow. That's not how I would put it. The sex in the films is very much real. Just like what happened to me in that room, referring to her alleged sexual encounter with Trump, which he denies. Daniels previously testified that the night of their alleged affair she felt faint while she saw Trump posing on the bed in his T shirt and boxers. Necheles question why that scene would be so upsetting since she appeared in about 150 sex films. Daniels testified it was because she was not expecting a man twice her age to be naked. Necheles -- are you Daniels gained publicity from her story and media appearances, like her interview on 60 minutes.",

He's somebody who the defense attorneys are going to try to undercut and undermine the credibility of and yet every witness that has come forward has really reinforced this complication to the jury, so they like Stormy Daniels should be prepared to hear Michael Cohen's testimony. And ultimately, the prosecution is going to try to get the jury to listen to the facts as they come out of Michael Cohen's mouth. Obviously, the defense attorneys are going to try to highlight his unpredictability and unreliability as a witness. So this is really the moment though, this is the person who alleges to have first-hand knowledge of the reimbursement scheme at the core of this indictment, and he's the only one who can testify to that firsthand knowledge that we've seen so far.",

That was something that judge said that he preferred did not come out in court and the jury did not hear, but the defense attorneys failed to object and Stormy Daniels was allowed to testify about those details. And ultimately, this does come back to credibility, right. This comes back to a window into Canada defense attorneys convinced the jury that witnesses like Stormy Daniels, or witnesses like Michael Cohen who may be complicated or not credible, and we're going to see if they're able to do that more successfully with Michael Cohen, because it does appear that prosecutors were successful in having Stormy Daniels come off as a credible witness despite some of the salacious detail around her engagement with Donald Trump.",

And I think they've done a fine job of doing that up to this point. I think that they performed well. I think the defense performed as well as they could with two major problems that have been created and were exposed yesterday. Number one, in the opening statement, Mr. Blanche made a huge error by denying that there ever was in a relationship between Stormy Daniels and Mr. Trump. Thereby opening up the road for all of the testimony that Stormy Daniels testify to all those salacious specifics of what occurred and all that happened inside that room on that particular evening, to try to substantiate that there was such a relationship. And that was a huge error on his part. The second error on their part was that they then did not object to certain things that were coming in that had been excluded by the judge then tried to move for a mistrial saying wait a minute, she said those things in particular, the thing about Mr. Trump using a condom. And at that point, the judge had to step up and say, wait a minute, you had a chance to object, you objected to a lot of things. You did not object to that, on top of which you've now gone into all of that on cross examination. Therefore, waiving all of your objections, I cannot grant a mistrial on something that you did not preserve air on. And so therefore, your motion is denied. And those were two huge errors.

But when you ask how Biden built up this sizable cash advantage, one of the reasons is he ran mostly uncontested in the Democratic primary. So he and his team kind of had the democratic donor base to themselves as President Trump was competing in a Republican primary. And the Republican donors were sort of scattered about him and his rivals and the President's team, President Biden's team really used that time to their advantage really building up this campaign war chest and when you look at the numbers that we have the last numbers available are from the end of March. President Biden had twice the amount of cash that President Trump had in his campaign coffers, President Biden had $85 million, and Trump had $45 million. Now as the Republican nomination contest ended, as President Trump consolidated support, you do see him starting to catch up. He has held these fundraising events at Mar-a-Lago that raised you know, tens and tens of millions of dollars in the last month in April, he has told donors that he raised $76 million, which is catching up with President Biden, I think the real difference that you're going to see is how they spend this money. President Biden, as I said, spent it on campaign ads. He has staffed up in the battleground states. Part of what the money that Trump is raising is going to, are his legal fees. He's sitting in court, those lawyers are very expensive and his supporters and his political committees are spending a lot of the money that they're raising on those legal fees.",

And Wall Street's high in early trading building on Thursdays rally. Well for a look at the growing popularity of medications like Ozempic now. A new survey finds one out of every eight adults in the United States that's 12 percent, has now taken these prescription drugs meant to manage diabetes or heart disease but often used for weight loss.
