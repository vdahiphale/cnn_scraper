      "sentences": "Those comments from one New Jersey mayor as weeks of mysterious drone sightings across the Garden State are prompting new security concerns. Where did these drones come from? Who's controlling them? And why are they spending time over U.S. Military sites, not to mention Trump's New Jersey golf course?Plus, President Biden setting a new record commuting the sentences of 1500 people in one day. But some Democrats argue Biden still is not going far enough in using his sweeping clemency and pardon powers granted him as president of the United States. And there are some glaring injustices that he can correct if he sees fit. We're going to start this hour, however, with breaking news. Authorities have executed as many as three search warrants in New York as part of the investigation into the killing of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson. That's according to sources who tell CNN that one of those warrants was for the burner phone found near the shooting scene, although it's not clear if investigators have yet been able to crack the code to get into the phone. Let's get straight to CNN's Brynn Gingras. And Brynn, what more do we know about these search warrants?",

      "sentences": "Yes, right, Jake. So this is all part of the investigative process. We know from sources telling Kara Scannell and myself that at least three search warrants have been conducted in New York as part of this investigation on evidence we have already learned about. You just mentioned at least one of those pieces of evidence, which is that burner phone, which again, authorities found on that getaway route where they say the suspected killer went as they left the scene of that Hilton hotel in midtown Manhattan. As you just said, it's unclear if they were actually able to get into the phone or what sort of information they were able to glean from that burner phone.We already have reported they got a partial fingerprint which yesterday the NYPD commissioner said they were able to trace back to Luigi Mangione's fingerprint that they took there in Pennsylvania. Another search warrant was conducted on a backpack. If you remember, that backpack was found in Central Park. We know inside that backpack, which they would have needed a search warrant to do to get inside, was monopoly money and some clothes. And we also know searches have been conducted. We knew one was happening inside Brian Thompson's hotel room where he was staying, the victim, of course, in this case at a hotel across the street from the Hilton Hotel. And we knew there was one conducted to get all that great surveillance video, that money shot, as they called it, from that hostel where they believe Mangione stayed on the Upper West Side before the killing. So again, this is all part of the investigative process. And what we are also learning now, according to ABC, is that the grand jury is starting to hear evidence in this case. If you remember, there is a felony arrest warrant issued from New York. But now the DA here in Manhattan needs to secure an indictment. So evidence is now going in front of the grand jury, including some of this evidence that we just laid out for you here. It's possible they might also learn about that fake ID. They might also learn about all that surveillance video, might even hear from a witness. If you remember that alarming video of the morning this shooting happened, there was a person who was seen sort of leaving the frame of that video as that shooting was happening. It's possible grand jury might hear from that person. It's very unclear. What we do know, though, Jake, is the next time Luigi Mangione is going to be back in court, that hearing has been set now for December 30. So, we will learn more about when that extradition might take place in really just a couple of weeks.",

It will probably include a charge of second degree murder and other charges. That indictment will then be signed by the Governor of New York, Kathy Hochul, who will lodge something called a governor's warrant, send it over to Pennsylvania. That will be the basis on which they'll have the extradition hearing. When that extradition hearing happens, all prosecutors have to show is this is the guy who has been charged.

And then a miracle happened. Those people went home and didn't get in trouble. It turned out those people probably shouldn't have been -- probably shouldn't have had all those old sick people there in the first place. And so now he's just doing what's obviously correct, which is to say people who've been out of prison, who haven't done anything wrong, people who've gone back to school, people who are -- who are taking care of -- of business, who are starting jobs, who are coaching kids should be able to stay home. That's a great first step, building on the First Step Act from the Trump administration. But there is a lot more that Biden could and should do, because the hope was there would be a Second Step Act, and that was called the EQUAL Act. And the hope was that we would continue that bipartisan momentum to get more people out of the system who don't belong there. These crack cocaine charges are nuts, and yet nothing has been done yet. And so I think there should not be any kind of stigma on helping folks who in the 80s and 90s and early 2000s got caught with some crack cocaine.
