I think that contrast is such a benefit to Biden, because what you see is Trump kind of being vintage Trump, right? It's like he can't help himself. There's always the speculation. There was a sense coming out of the -- the early state contests. You know, is he going to be more disciplined? Is Trump going to be -- you know, is he going to be the better version of himself?And then, you know, you see him out campaigning in a critically important state, coming out of Joe Biden having a really strong State of the Union, a moment where you would assume that Donald Trump would want to, you know, really make his kind of best case, you know, and he's mocking Joe Biden's stutter. So I think he's reminding people of what a Trump presidency feels like. He's reminding people of the hatred and the personal ugliness. And those character issues, those accrue to Joe Biden's benefit. So you know, on substance, I think there were, obviously, very important contrasts. I think Biden has really found -- he's found an aggressive and kind of forward-leaning vision and message that I think he articulated very well. You know, but there's really -- there's nothing -- for the Biden campaign, there is nothing better than Joe Biden, Donald Trump split screen, because you know, that kind of performance from Trump is not what the key swing voters -- it may be great for the MAGA base, but the MAGA base is not enough to get Donald Trump over the finish line.

And you know, the center of this, you know, challenge. We heard from the president over the weekend, saying -- talking about the fact that he regrets using the term \"illegal\" at the State of the Union to describe the man that killed Laken Riley. Do you think that was the right move on the president's part? REP. RAJA KRISHNAMOORTHI (D-IL): I would have used a different term. But I think that it does go back, again, to the bipartisan deal that Donald Trump tanked, because the guy who murdered Laken Riley was let out, because they didn't -- ICE didn't have the detention facilities to be able to keep him. They didn't have the resources to keep him detained. And I think it -- I campaigned for Tom Suozzi in New York 3, and that race was super tight, until Donald Trump tanked this bipartisan deal.

I, as a conservative, I actually do not agree with that, because I think there are far more better ways to disagree with individuals on the other side than having a strongman in power. So I would caution the former president, because you do run the risk, because he's already having trouble, with those moderate Republican; maybe even some conservative-leaning Democrats.

You think about what happens when you get into that tunneling effect in some of the skyscrapers, downtown New York, perhaps into Philadelphia and Boston, really funnels through that area. Gusty winds, over 50 miles per hour. Also means that it's going to be difficult to drive, let's say, an SUV, a truck, or difficult to get in and out of the major airports. So you can see the winds picking up through the course of the day, kind of working up towards a crescendo by the middle to second half of the day. Look at that, 3 p.m. Monday evening, Boston. And then we start to relax those winds as we head into Tuesday morning. It's all thanks to a departing storm system that brought some squally snow showers to the Northeast. If you were there, you probably experienced it this weekend. Intermittent whiteout conditions for many locations across upstate New York, Vermont, New Hampshire. We still have our winter weather advisories and winter storm warnings in place, because we've already clocked in over half a foot of snow. But this storm exits pretty quickly, and then we clear things out and warm up our temperatures. Spring is on its way.",
