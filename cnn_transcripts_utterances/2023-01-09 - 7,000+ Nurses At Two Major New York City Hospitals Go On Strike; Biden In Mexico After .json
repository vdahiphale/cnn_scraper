FRAN CARTWRIGHT, CHIEF NURSING OFFICER, THE MOUNT SINAI HOSPITAL: Thank you, yes. So, I'll first just -- I just want to also comment before we talk about what the staffing is here. That, you know, at 1:00 a.m. this morning, our NYSNA executive team walked out on negotiations, rejecting the financial packet of the 19.1 over the life of the contract, and also rejected the governor's call to lift this strike notice so that we could work with arbitrators. And we received the strike notice ten days ago, and at that point we started to look at all of our specialties across all of our patient populations so that we could plan appropriately. So today we have nurses. We have agency nurses as well as other clinical staff that are working to support our nurses to practice at full scope as well as nonclinical staff. So, we are providing safe care to our patients. We are keeping our E.D. open for emergency cases, and those that come into our E.D. will be the vulnerable, the sickest of the sick and we do have the staffing to take care of them as well as in our O.R. to take care of emergency cases. We are diverting. We are transferring patients to other sites. We look forward to our NYSNA executive team agreeing to come back to the table, and we will enthusiastically meet them there when they do.",

      "sentences": "So, one of the major concerns is not just the pay which has been discussed. At Montefiore we know they're getting back to negotiations there. But the staffing shortages as we've heard from the previous nurse and from you as well. Why is it so difficult right now to staff these hospitals? We know that some have left during the pandemic, but nursing schools are seeing students come in. Why do you think that there is this challenge now? Four of the major strikes we saw in 2021 were focused on just this. CARTWRIGHT Yes, so we're in a work force crisis because of thispandemic in the nation, and it's across -- and it's especially in our academic medical centers and it will take some time to be able to strengthen the bench. What we are also disappointed, I must say, is that we submitted to our NYSNA executive team, a very robust staffing enforcement plan. We had been working on this. We've met more than 40 times -- more than 35 times, I'm sorry, since the negotiations started in early September, and we've been breaking apart pieces of this staffing enforcement, agreeing on a lot of the items in it, but needing to finish some critical elements of that. We were waiting for our NYSNA executive team to send us back that document with their edits when they walked -- when they walked off last night. So why is it difficult? It's as you said, post-pandemic, a lot of our experienced nurses who were anticipated retirement decided to retire. Some even ten years early. Others went into becoming travelers. Others decided to go back to their community and work in community jobs. And to still other decided that they wanted to leave nursing and leave health care. So, we are working to develop innovative models of care to support our nurses, to practice at full scope that so we can fill all of our positions, and we agreed that our grids are very strong across the hospitals once we fill those positions, but we need to fill them. That's correct.",

I don't want to get ahead of the president or what he'll be able to speak to at the end of the meeting. He'll have a chance to talk publicly about that tomorrow, so I'm going to leave that for him.But clearly, they're going to be talking about ways both in terms of improving capabilities at the border, and we're grateful for the additional commitment that Mexico has made for -- to take another 30,000 illegal immigrants and keep them in Mexico after they have attempted to cross that border. And we'll let Mexico speak to what additional commitments they might or might not be willing to make. But it's also going to be a key opportunity, Alisyn, to talk about getting at the root causes of migration. We are going through a historic level of migration in this hemisphere. Many, many -- Millions of them are on the move for various reasons, whether it's corruption and crime at home, food insecurity, political instability, and there doesn't seem to be a let up to that. And so, we've got to make sure that regionally we're taking a comprehensive look at what the root causes are. That's one thing Vice President Harris has been so focused on, and I think that that will be a key part of the discussion tomorrow as well. [15:45:00] CAMEROTA: Admiral let's also talk about what's happening in Brazil. So, as you know, there was this riot on the capital there. It was basically a copycat horror movie that we've seen here in the U.S., of course, two years ago. Former President Bolsonaro who lost is now in Florida. We've just gotten the word that he has been admitted to the hospital for injuries that he sustained two years ago. Obviously, the U.S. will not force him to leave the country while he's having some sort of medical crisis, but after that, would President Biden consider expelling Bolsonaro?",

She denied those attempts and then from there, it became violent. As you mentioned, several days of this man allegedly striking her. Even using a screwdriver point. Investigators say that when she was found that there were bruisers around her eyes, all over her body as well, as cuts to her neck and nose as well. And then it was on five days later, December 29th that according to these court documents, Mills left his apartment to go visit his dad and that's when the victim was able to escape. Mills' attorney says that people should not rush to judgment in the case. That they should let all the facts play out and hear his side of the story in all of this. But regardless, he's expected back in court in early March. He's out free on bond on a $50,000 bond. Bumble says they are shocked and saddened to hear about this horrible crime and they also go on to say they have a dedicated team of law enforcement that is available to answer questions and to work with law enforcement agencies investigating this matter.",
