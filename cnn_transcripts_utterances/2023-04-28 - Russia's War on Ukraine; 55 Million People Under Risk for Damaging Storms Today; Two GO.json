These big diggers have been pulling out rubble for hour after hour, ten hours now since the missile impacted here. They've been pulling out bodies. It appears as if they may have found another. Now the police have been giving us an update here before. Three children among the dead here. They're working, as you see, recovering. Unfortunately, this is the death toll that we're witnessing right here, right now. We are witnessing the death toll, this horrible scene, and this apartment building here in Uman that was hit overnight very tragically by this missile, the death toll you're witnessing here climbing. But what the police and the rescue services are telling us here is that when they get cleared at the low level, they're going to move higher up. Dave is going to tilt up now, and we're going to take a look at the collapsed apartment building up there on the eighth floor. And we have bad in -- bad news about what they may find up there. We were speaking to a lady here, her friend lived up on the eighth floor there. Her friend got out, the husband was injured, but their seven -- their 13- year-old daughter, their 7-year-old daughter are still missing, and they're feared to be up there in that building. The police say they're going to continue and keep searching through the day until they've absolutely done everything they can. There are a lot of people standing around here, relatives, friends of people who lived in this building, desperate to know what's happened inside. We spoke to one of the first eyewitnesses on the scene. He said he got here in the early hours of this morning, about 5:00 a.m., people were asleep in their apartments. He said he could hear women and children screaming. He said they managed to pull one woman out of the rubble and get her off to hospital, but he said unfortunately she died. And a lady in the apartment right next to us here. She told us she heard the missile coming in. She heard that whoosh. She put her kids in the bathtub. She said, put pillows and blankets on their head. She thought it was their apartment that was being hit because the whole building shook so much. She said she had no idea if they would survive or not. Everyone here is traumatized and in shock. But the rescue and recovery operation still underway.

That is where we have our greatest risk of severe storms that could produce that large monster-sized hail and the potential for a tornado cannot be ruled out. Here it is, greatest probability of hail today. And look at the quarter to baseball to softball sized hail, this is off the charts large, the potential there, again, to repeat what we saw earlier in the week.

As you can see in this video here from State Senator Megan Hunt after what was being called the Heartbeat Act. It failed a critical test vote in the state legislature. That bill would have banned most abortions after about six weeks of pregnancy. And then in South Carolina, the five women in the State Senate, three of whom are Republicans there.

Now, of course there are male Democrat counterpoints who have joined them as well as three male Republicans yesterday, but they made impassioned speeches on the floor. And they did talk about the current climate and a potential for political backlash. But what they really tended to focus on was things like biology, and legislative priorities, and sexism, and the idea of control. Take a listen to this from state senator, a Republican, Sandy Senn.

SANDY SENN (R-SC): There is not a single thing that I can do when women such as me are insulted except to make sure that you get an earful, and you need to blame this earful on following that leader blindly off the cliff for the third time on abortion.

And we also know that there was a judge who looked at this. Looked at the possibility of Pence testifying in this as the vice president who was presiding over that activity on Capitol Hill on January 6th. And that judge said that he would have to speak to the grand jury under oath about conversations where Donald Trump may have been acting corruptly.
