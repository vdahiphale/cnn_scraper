Abby Phillip is outside the court in New York for us.Right now, Trump's former lawyer and fixer Michael Cohen is back on the witness stand. Prosecutors are trying to clean up some of the damage to their star witness' credibility after Cohen admitted earlier today to stealing tens of thousands of dollars from The Trump Organization. Abby, you're following some of these breaking details. You're just outside the court. Update our viewers.",

The prosecution, they are in redirect right now and they just played for Michael Cohen a video clip of Michael Cohen talking to Keith Davidson. He's the lawyer for Stormy Daniels and for Karen McDougal.And in that video clip, it's actually quite lengthy, but the part that they are trying to, it seems, highlight is where he says, \"I can't even say how many times he said to me, I hate the fact that we did it. My comment to him was every person that we've spoken to tells you it was the right move.\" He, in that clip, is Donald Trump, and this is what Michael Cohen just testified to. And he's talking here about the payments that Keith Davidson made on behalf of Trump or, I'm sorry, that Michael Cohen made on behalf of Trump for the Stormy Daniels agreement. Why do you think, Paula, that this might be coming up here, frankly, again, because it's not the first time we are hearing this piece of evidence?",

And then Cohen goes on to talk about the fallout that this had on him, the fact that his entire life was turned upside down, he lost his law license, his business, his financial security. And this is actually, I'm just reading live updates from inside the court, I may be getting - no, actually, on par with the sidestream for once, redirect is over. So that's how the prosecutors chose to end their redirect of Cohen, to remind the jurors of the fallout that Trump had regret and the fallout for Michael Cohen from making this hush money payment.And Todd Blanche, the attorney for Donald Trump, is back at the podium, we'll be seeing exactly what he'll be saying shortly. But one of the other things that happened a little earlier in the redirect was Susan Hoffinger, the prosecutor, asking once again to Michael Cohen, would you have done anything, would you have paid $130,000 to Stormy Daniels if Donald Trump had not explicitly authorized it. And Michael Cohen said no.",

Donald Trump didn't actually have to tell him to do anything.Now, I do want to note again, because I cannot stress how important this is, the entire link between Donald Trump and this case rests on Michael Cohen. And that's why you've seen so much in the cross- examination here of him by Todd Blanche, them trying to undermine him, to discredit him, and that's now what they're trying to do on redirect, is to re-credit him. That's why they're going to end on this kind of emotional testimony from Michael Cohen, saying his entire life was ruined by this. That is also why you saw, on the other side, the defense ending their examination with you would lie to someone you were loyal with. You would lie on the stand, essentially. And so this is just the key witness here. It's really been interesting to see how they both try to paint him as a completely different person.",

He says that I did it to help him. But when you really parse out the specific things that he has pleaded guilty to, they also include some things that had nothing to do with Trump, including issues that he had with the IRS, issues that he had related to his taxi medallion business.So that's the point that Blanche is making here. They're saying, look, like, you lost your law license because of Trump. No, a large part of that is what you did. This has been a common theme throughout their cross-examination.

Blanche saying here - he's confirming with Cohen that if you are convicted of any felony in New York, you automatically lose your law license. Cohen still blames Trump for losing his.

And number two, nothing really changes the defense's central argument that Michael Cohen spoke about something other than Stormy Daniels, spoke about this fight with this 14-year-old kid. Whether Donald Trump was photographed with Keith Schiller prior to that doesn't really change the defense's argument.Now, what - and Elie and I were talking about this in the break, how this helps prosecutors is that prosecutors can now almost make this a \"Perry Mason\" got you moment of sorts, saying, well, look, we have the photograph of them standing together. Therefore, the defense's argument isn't as strong as you thought it was. Now, again, it doesn't negate or change the defense's argument. It doesn't change what the record of text messages that cast doubt on what Michael Cohen might have spoken about.

The argument is what you talk to them about was the 14-year-old kid and not the hush money payment to Stormy Daniels. And again, it's worth noting - I mean, so prosecutors say, aha, Keith Schiller was with Donald Trump, so he must have talked about both. But that's not really the point of the defense argument.The bigger point also the defense makes is you, Michael Cohen, never told - breathed the word of any of this to the grand jury or on your direct testimony. So it takes a little bit of the sting out, but 10 percent of the sting out.",

One thing you don't want to do, as you guys have repeatedly said, is waste the jurors' time.So they wonder - we're sort of going over this old ground again. Blanche is asking Michael Cohen if he lied to Congress. They've already been over his lies, but I guess they want to leave that in the mind of jurors that Michael Cohen is a liar.

If, by the way, the defense says we rest now, it's over. We're going to close. I mean, the judges said closings won't happen until next week. But this means the prosecution believes it has met its burden of proof. They're done. Here we see Cohen is off the witness stand.And so the next step will be, does the defense have any case to put on? Now we're going to get the question about - the answer to the question about, will they call Robert Costello, will they call this election expert, will they call Donald Trump.

Cohen tried to downplay how often they spoke, but it was revealed on cross-examination that they actually spoke, it looks like, about 75 times. Michael Cohen insists that there was no retainer agreement, therefore Costello was never formally his attorney. But they had a lot of conversations.

They talked to Michael Cohen when they were first originally questioning him, saying, you know, what did you think of Bob Costello, you had Michael Cohen really trying to downplay it, saying at one point he thought he was sketchy. He was trying to hold his relationship with Rudy Giuliani and former president or then-president Donald Trump over Michael Cohen's head. But again, then it was revealed that they spoke - here he goes - as the record shows that there were 75 calls between Cohen and Costello, answered and unanswered in April, May and June of 2018.

BRYAN LANZA, DEPUTY COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR, TRUMP 2016 CAMPAIGN: First of all, thank you for having me, Abby. Listen, I think the reason they hammered down on Cohen is that the only reason this is any type of felony or any type of crime is Cohen controls their relationship or the conversation that took place. He's saying it took place and it's about President Trump, Trump's saying it's not. So it all hangs on Michael Cohen. And the reality is, you know, this is a man who stretches the lengths of credibility. He's clearly out for revenge. He's clearly lying. He's clearly making money about it. So I think you always have to attack Michael Cohen. Attacking anything else that doesn't make sense, because the only thing that makes this an actual case is Michael Cohen's words against everything else. And I think that's the challenge that the prosecution has, and that's been the ease of the defense, because almost every door you open up, you find a Michael Cohen lie. Almost every door you open up, you find a Michael Cohen venture to make money off of this prosecution.
