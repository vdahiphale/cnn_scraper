Investigators say this all happened simply because those neighbors asked him to stop firing his gun late at night near their home while their baby was sleeping. This is the suspect, Francisco Oropeza. Law enforcement, including the FBI, says it has zero leads on his whereabouts at this hour. They have warned the public he is armed and dangerous. More than 250 officers are on the case and an $80,000 reward is being offered. CNN's Josh Campbell is joining us now live with more on this. No leads, zero, not a good look this morning.",

Overnight, the government took control of First Republic Bank and its $233 billion worth of assets. And then, shortly after that, JPMorgan Chase is now stepping in as the buyer.First Republic is based in San Francisco. It has offices all over the country, largely on the coast, including branches in affluent areas, like Beverly Hills, Silicon Valley, Palm Beach, New York, Greenwich, Connecticut. Now, all of these branches reopening today as JPMorgan Chase. CNN's Vanessa Yurkevich is outside one of these locations in New York City.

He said that they were not looking for this deal but it made sense financially. The FDIC held an auction with this by 4:00 P.M. Eastern Time, JPMorgan clearly the winning bid. It took 800 JPMorgan employees to make this deal come to fruition as well as other employees at FDIC and the Treasury Department. But the key thing for customers to know is that, as a part of this deal, JPMorgan has assumed $92 billion in deposits. That means that if you are going to the bank today to First Republic, your deposits are safe. Also they are taking about $173 billion in loans as well as paying the FDIC $10.6 billion to close this deal. And I think a lot of the questions that we are starting to hear is what does mean for the potential bank failures in the future. Well, Jamie Dimon spoke about that very issue on the media call just moments ago. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JAMIE DIMON, CEO, JPMORGAN CHASE (voice over):  This is getting near the end of it. And, hopefully, this stabilizes everything. The American banking system is extraordinarily sound. And, obviously, going forward, you have recessions and rates going up and stuff like that, you will see other cracks in the system, but that has to be expected. The system is very, very sound.

Senate Majority Whip and Judiciary Committee Chair Dick Durbin joins us now. Welcome to CNN News Central, Senator. SEN. DICK DURBIN (D-IL):  Good to be here. BERMAN:  So, Speaker McCarthy is in Israel right now, and a little bit earlier today made a quip about the fact that President Biden and Prime Minister Netanyahu haven't really communicated much over the last several months. And Speaker McCarthy said, quote, \"President Biden hasn't talked to me about the debt ceiling for the last 80-some days. So, I think he, the prime minister, might be in good company if he treats me the same way.\" On the debt ceiling, if no one is talking, how does this get solved?",

It's shaping up to be the largest mayday protest France has seen in years.Now, today's demonstrations over labor rights, they come after months of protests against President Macron's controversial overhaul to the pension system, which includes raising the retirement age there by two years.

But as you can see, the march continues, really, still at the very front of it. These, again, the black bloc protesters that precede the trade union march, which will be happening a lot more peacefully, no doubt, behind us.Ahead of us, what's been happening is that two groups of those black bloc protesters have now been cordoned off by the police as they are try and limit the amount of chaos out on the streets of Paris today. And I have to say that compared to the last few weeks, Kate, when we had seen some scuffles with the police, we had seen a lot of incidents of trash that had lined the streets of Paris being burned in these protests, a lot of confrontation with the police. Really, what we've seen in the course of this mayday protest does feel like it exceeds. A lot more black bloc on the streets today, a lot more direct confrontation early on and some fairly chaotic scenes. What we have also seen, Kate, as a result of that chaos is some pretty indiscriminant police attempts to draw fairly random people off of the street. There was a lot of chaos back there. And all along this march, basically, what happens is, as we head away from Republique and on towards the march's destination, all of these streets are lined with riot police that regularly face off with the protesters. And that's what you're likely to see continue over the course today. This is an important barometer, of course, for the protesters here to show the popular anger that there is about this pension reform. It's also important on the part of the authorities, I should point out, Kate, that this, in a sense, draw a line under these protests. This reform is going through. The government hopes that will be one last venting, and then after that, life will go back as it was. The point about the protest today is they want to show, by their anger, by their numbers, by their determination, that beyond this particular reform, that so much of their anger, focused as it is on the French president, they indent to make the rest of his term as difficult and as ungovernable as they can. And I think that's behind a lot of this great show of support for the movement today, backed up as it is by 62 percent of the French who are opposed to this particular raising of the retirement age, Kate, from 62 to 64.",
