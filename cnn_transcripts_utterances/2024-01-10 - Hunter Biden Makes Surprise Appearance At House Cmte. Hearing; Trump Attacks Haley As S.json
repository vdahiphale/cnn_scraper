We have just five days until the Iowa caucuses; 13 days until the New Hampshire primary, 299 days until Election Day. This is today's State of the Race. All right. A shock on Capitol Hill today, Hunter Biden, the President's son, making a surprise appearance at a House Oversight Committee hearing. That hearing taking up the question of whether to hold him in contempt of Congress. Our panel is here today. Mark Longabaugh, Democratic Strategist who worked on Bernie Sanders 2016 campaign; Charlie Dent, former Republican Congressman, and Leigh Ann Caldwell, the author of The Early 202 at The Washington Post. It has been quite a morning. Charlie Dent, you're the perfect person to have with us to help us understand all of this. First, though, I just want to show you a little bit of what unfolded. I mean, I've covered Capitol Hill for many years. There are definitely days like this, but this one is up there in terms of sheer surprise, sheer mayhem, the level of political theater, really pretty high there today. Take a look. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. NANCY MACE (R-SC): First of all, my first question is, who bribed Hunter Biden to be here today? That's my first question. Second question, you are the epitome of white privilege, coming into the Oversight Committee, spitting in our face, ignoring a congressional subpoena to be deposed. What are you afraid of? You have no balls to come up here and -- REP. JARED MOSKOWITZ (D-FL): Mr. Chairman, point of inquiry.",

But, this takes place against the backdrop of a presidential campaign, right, where Donald Trump is embroiled in a host of legal problems. The Trump campaign would like to focus on this.

What the Committee members want is him to appear behind the scenes in a deposition where Hunter Biden and his attorneys say that those transcripts -- just a one-sided argument will be released from those transcripts. So, what they're worried about is that there isn't continuing to be no evidence that ties Hunter Biden to President Biden for any wrongdoing that President Biden profited off of Hunter Biden. But, getting back to your previous political point about how this muddies the water for the public, if Donald Trump is in the middle of a court case after court case after court case during this campaign, which he is likely to be the Republican nominee, meanwhile, there is an impeachment going on against President Biden, it confuses voters to dismiss what perhaps the allegations are against Donald Trump. And so, then it maybe equals the playing field and minimizes and detracts from President Biden's argument that it is Donald Trump that brings chaos.",

Mel, I've been in chaotic hallways like the one you had to navigate this morning. Can you just kind of take us behind the scenes to how it felt this morning?

Mel, briefly, I couldn't help but notice that it was Marjorie Taylor Greene who was cut off when Hunter Biden got up and left. She was the one who was taking the microphone. She was very clearly not happy about it. And all of the cable networks cut from her talking to Abbe Lowell talking and trying to figure out what was going on with Hunter Biden in the hallway.

First of all, Marjorie Taylor Greene hasbeen one of the sharpest critics of Hunter Biden. She at one hearing was displaying some nude photos during a hearing. She has just been a real thorn in Hunter Biden's side. But, to your point, the fact that he got up and left, the attention did strategically turn to Hunter Biden and the statement that his lawyer made outside of the hearing room afterwards. And so, I really think you can view Hunter Biden's actions today as probably both a PR and political move in terms of the messaging and trying to make the point that, hey, I'm here. I'm not scared of the Committee. And then, there is also the legal element. It's going to really be up to DoJ to determine whether Hunter Biden made every effort to try to comply with a subpoena. And we should also note that when he did have that scheduled closed-door deposition that was back in December, he also had showed up to the Capitol and did a press conference outside of the Capitol, making a similar message. So, ultimately, again, it's going to be up to the DoJ to determine whether or not they're going to prosecute the President's son and hold Hunter in contempt of Congress.
