The U.S. Vice President and former president brought their campaigns to Wisconsin on Wednesday, a Midwestern state won by Joe Biden four years ago and Donald Trump in the 2016 election.Kamala Harris speaking in the state capitol, Madison, where she briefly lived as a child and home to the University of Wisconsin. And Trump visiting Green Bay, the city best known for its NFL team, the Packers. The latest CNN poll shows the race remains neck and neck in the battleground states that make up the so-called Blue Wall. Harris is holding a slight lead in Wisconsin and Michigan, but in must-win Pennsylvania, it is a dead heat. And all the figures you see here are well within the margin of error. Well, meanwhile, Donald Trump showed up for his latest campaign event wearing an orange safety vest, similar to those worn by garbage collectors and he loudly mocked his Democratic rivals. CNN's Kristen Holmes picks up the story. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) KRISTEN HOLMES, CNN U.S. NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Former president Donald Trump in Green Bay, Wisconsin, continuing to seize on president Joe Biden's remarks, calling his supporters, quote/unquote, \"garbage\". Donald Trump has tried to use this as an opportunity to change the media narrative earlier in the evening, even taking questions from sitting in front seat of a garbage truck. He also addressed those comments once again for the third time or more in day while he was at this rally. Take a listen. DONALD TRUMP (R), U.S. PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Crooked Joe Biden finally said what He and Kamala really think of our supporters, he called them garbage. No way. No way! My response to Joe and Kamala is very simple. You can't lead America if you don't love Americans. That's true. You can't be president if you hate the American people, which I believe they do.",

They are clearly sticking to this stick.Now, the important thing here is that this isn't just because Donald Trump wants to seize on this or change the narrative. It's also because they believe that this playbook has worked before. Remember in 2016, after Hillary Clinton said that Trump supporters were a basket of deplorables, they try to use same thing then with supporters. They believe this kind of rhetoric could actually motivate people to go to the polls to back Donald Trump. Now whether or not that's going to happen, it's just not something that we're going to know until election day, but it is certainly something they are doing to really ramp up that enthusiasm.

And at this point, everything and everyone is sort of waiting to see what the results will be because the outcome of that election might dictate, provide options for Prime Minister Netanyahu of Israel, options that he doesn't see as viable at the moment, but might be different, let's say, under a Trump presidency than under a Kamala Harris presidency.

So their vulnerability has been exposed and Israel has demonstrated can fly in and fly out penetrate airspace do what it needs to serve Iran for it to then escalate again even further opens itself up now to again possibly greater a response from Israel, including if there is a President Trump emerging victorious after next week, the opportunity for Israel to strike Iran's nuclear and or energy facilities, its oil facilities, which would be the most severe blow to the country.",

So it's, again, it's I think it just underscores the disarray that Hezbollah find itself in with its leadership structure, having been decimated it's defensive and offensive capabilities have been weakened severely, and now it's finding itself having to explain to the Lebanese people why they the non-Shia Lebanese population are having to suffer as a result of Hezbollah's decision to join Hamas in its attacks against Israel.

But still, the last time we have seen three or more typhoons hitting this island in one season was back in 2008. That's why the authorities there are taking no chances. You mentioned flights have been canceled. The market has been shut down. A lot of schools and offices throughout the island have also been closed as well. And in addition to civilian first responders, the government there has placed more than 34,000 soldiers on standby to respond to aid in any potential rescue operations because the fortunate news here is the typhoon landed on the eastern side of the island which is less populated but still the potential risk here is with mountainous regions and remote villages that could see landslides not to mention a severe damage to infrastructure including a potential power outages. Now a lot of this of course is going to impact other parts of the island as our colleagues in Taipei have been reporting very strong winds as well as heavy rainfalls even though that capital city is in the northern part of the island. Now, Kong-Rey is forecast to move towards the East China Sea and impacting mainland China and potentially Japan as well in the coming days.

      "sentences": "One of the big questions we've had about North Korean troops going to train in Russia and then perhaps to fight on behalf of Russia in Ukraine is, what does North Korea get in return? And this is an area where the U.S. has simply said they're very much watching this space, but they have nothing to say yet. They won't speculate here, but they have made clear that they're looking to see if there is some sort of quid pro quo between Russia and North Korea in terms of what does North Korea get in return. Now, the U.S. hasn't gone that far yet, but South Korea did. The SouthKorean defense minister speaking alongside Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin on Wednesday at the Pentagon said it is quote, \"very likely that North Korea will receive help in critical technology areas including perhaps nuclear weapons, specifically tactical nuclear weapons, intercontinental ballistic missiles, satellite technology, all of the areas we have seen North Korea trying to push forward with some successes and some failures.\" Of course, that is technology that Russia already has at its disposal here and a space that the U.S. was watching in South Korea to see if that's what they would give in return. Now South Korea didn't say it definitively, but they said that's effectively what their indications are showing and what's very likely to happen. Well that would effectively mirror a sort of arrangement that Iran has with Russia, where Iran provides drones and ballistic missiles, and in exchange Russia provides technology in the nuclear realm on ballistic missiles, on drones, as that relationship grows. Now this is an area where South Korea and the U.S. will expand their intelligence sharing to see how this relationship grows and in what direction it goes. What sort of steps and advancements is North Korea able to make in these critical technology and crucially weapons areas so you're likely to see an expansion of that cooperation and intelligence sharing. This, of course, all happens as Western intelligence officials tell CNN that a small number of those North Korean troops in Russia are already on the battlefield in Ukraine, a situation US President Joe Biden called, quote, \"dangerous.\" Oren Liebermann, CNN in the Pentagon.

The company has faced criticism this year for serving wildly inconsistent portions from store to store.In June, a Wells Fargo analyst ordered and weighed 75 burrito bowls across eight different locations and found the weight varied as much as 33 percent. On Wednesday, the company's interim CEO said the solution is, quote, \"consistent and generous portions.\" He said customers are already posting proof they're getting bigger burritos. Starbucks customers will no longer have to pay extra to customize their beverage with non-dairy milk. Starting next week, the company is eliminating the upcharge for ordering a drink with soy, oat, almond, or coconut milk. Customers who request those will pay around 10 percent less than they previously did. This is one of several changes Starbucks is making as the company looks to rebound from a third straight quarter of slumping sales and fewer customer visits. The Berlin Zoo is inviting the world to witness something spectacular. This little pygmy hippopotamus taking her very first dip in the pool. Despite it being her first time, Tony knows exactly what to do, according to the zoo's director. Hippos don't actually swim, he says, they run underwater. Tony is just five months old and her life is full of adventures. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ANDREAS KNIERIEM, HEAD OF ZOO BERLIN (through translator): What do you do every day as a little hippopotamus? You drink an incredible amount of milk, high in fat, high in protein. Then you eat a little bit, too. And then it's off into the water. You splash around and do things. Probably after an hour, you're a bit tired. Then you sleep a bit at the water line here, and that's the daily routine. (END VIDEO CLIP)",
