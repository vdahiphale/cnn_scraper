(voice-over):  Former President Donald Trump indicted and arraigned on 34 counts related to business fraud. Tuesday`s legal proceedings relatively short, but its impact on American history seismic, unprecedented. Trump is now the first ever former or sitting president to be criminally charged. TODD BLANCHE, FORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP`S ATTORNEY:  He`s frustrated. He`s upset. But I tell you what? He`s motivated and it`s not going to stop him and it`s not going to slow him down, and it`s -- it`s exactly what he expected.",

The security around the New York City courthouse was ramped up ahead of Tuesday`s arraignment, with overall peaceful crowds gathering before and against Trump. The next step for Trump, back at home at Mar-a-Lago Tuesday night, where his lawyers have said they`ll dissect every charge in the now unsealed indictment and plan their defense. And the judge in this case did not issue a gag order, meaning that the former president can talk about this matter, but the judge here in Lower Manhattan urged both sides -- the former president and the prosecution -- to refrain from inflammatory rhetoric.

The USS Nevada was the only battleship to start moving though it was hit by a torpedo and multiple bombs. We`ll head to Pearl Harbor now for our next story. Last year, the U.S. announced a landmark submarine deal with Australia and the U.K. where nuclear-powered submarines will be sent to Western Australia. These underwater warships will be strategically located there in case China, which has the world`s largest navy, looks to possibly grow its presence in the Pacific region. So how massive are these U.S. submarines? Our Will Ripley gives us an exclusive look inside the USS Mississippi. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) WILL RIPLEY, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  Our journey begins in Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, the bustling hub of the U.S. Pacific fleet, covering almost half the world, 100 million square miles, 1,500 aircraft, and around 200 ships, including more than half of the navy`s nuclear-powered submarines. Today, we`re getting an exclusive look inside the USS Mississippi, one of the most powerful warships on the planet -- with a crew of around 140 people. Rear Admiral Jeff Jablon is commander of the Pacific fleet submarine force, facing new powerful threats in the hotly contested Indo-Pacific. The Mississippi is one of 49 fast attack submarines in the U.S. Naval fleet. The fleet also has 14 larger submarines carrying nuclear-armed ballistic missiles. The U.S., U.K. and Australia`s newly announced AUKUS partnership will send nuclear-powered submarines to Perth, potentially challenging China`s ambitions for the region. Beijing now has the world`s largest navy, but U.S. submarines have the world`s most advanced technology, a key advantage in underwater warfare.",

In the dark depths of the ocean, there`s no light to navigate. The team relies on highly sensitive sonar. The USS Mississippi, like all of America`s nuclear submarines, can`t essentially sustain itself under the water for weeks or even months at a time because of the nuclear reactor that powers them. They breathe recirculated air and purified water. The only thing that they need to actually get resupplied with is food for the crew members and that means that they get used to spending a very long time not only without sunshine and blue skies but also without regular communication or conversations with their families. The food on submarines is surprisingly good, but spending months under water can be tough. No mobile phones allowed. Outside communication only possible on emails. At the back of the sub, Jack O`Brien works with a team of technical engineers. Do you ever get bored on a sub? JACK O`BRIEN, CREW MEMBER, USS MISSISSIPPI:  No, no, that`s absolutely not. Every day I come in, thinking I know what I`m -- thinking I know exactly what`s going to happen, what I got to do.",
