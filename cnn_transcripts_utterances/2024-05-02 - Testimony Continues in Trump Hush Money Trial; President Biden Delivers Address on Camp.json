      "sentences": "And welcome back to CNN special live coverage.We are waiting for President Biden at the White House. We are told he plans to make remarks about the chaos we're seeing on college campuses with these anti-war, anti-Israel protests across the country. Biden has really said very little to this point about the protests and the arrests and all the rest we have seen on college campuses night after night. We're also getting some updates from inside the courtroom in New York, where our reporters are following every detail of Donald Trump's hush money cover-up trial, the prosecution dispensing with some potentially bad facts for their case. Keith Davidson, the attorney for Stormy Daniels, is now detailing for the jury how Trump's former lawyer and fixer Michael Cohen was furious over Donald Trump refusing to pay him back in a timely fashion. Also, we had learned that he was furious that Donald Trump had not tapped him to come with him to Washington, D.C. We're joined here in Washington by former Trump attorney Tim Parlatore. And, Tim, as you watch this play out, the jury being shown the January 18, 2018, statement from Stormy Daniels, Davidson, Keith Davidson, her attorney, being asked whether he prepared the statement in which she denies the affair. He said: \"I believe so.\" Steinglass asks: \"How would you categorize the truthfulness of the statement?\" This is -- do you agree with the assessment this is the prosecution trying to get some bad facts out of the way, so that, when the defense introduces them, as they no doubt will, because they undermine the case, the jury won't: \"Oh, I didn't -- I didn't know that.\" (LAUGHTER)",

Davidson says, well, it wasn't a payout and it wasn't hush money. It was consideration in a civil settlement agreement. So this is how the parsing is done.

And it's hard to imagine that anybody heard that and didn't hear a very, very clear argument that, as you said, Jake, you can be somebody who opposes any policy, and you should have the right. That is a fundamental right in the United States of America. But you can't intimidate. You can't do anything to stop people from going to classes or from feeling unsafe. And it is complicated.

We talked to some of the officers inside who said that they had things that were thrown at them. I saw one officer who was covered in the powder from a fire extinguisher, but no injuries being reported at this point. We are learning -- and I will tell you as we kind of zoom in about what's left here you can see behind me, there were 250 protesters approximately in this camp. That's what the CHP tells us. They brought in 250 officers of their own, so essentially one officer for one protester, bringing all of those individuals out. We are told that 132 of those protesters were taken into -- placed under arrest. We're waiting to see what those charges actually are. Now, overnight, we started to get a sense that this was about to go down because, late yesterday -- this gets to what -- the president's point about lawful versus unlawful -- the university itself, up to the point of last night, didn't ask the police to come in and actually clear this camp. But that all changed. We started seeing resources come in. We saw the FBI field office, which is about a mile from here, essentially turn into a staging point for dozens and dozens of law enforcement officers. Multiple prisoner buses were brought in. And, as you mentioned, Jake, just around 1:00 a.m. time, we -- or a little earlier than that, but that was the time when they actually made entry into the actual camp itself, going in, conducting those arrests. Right now, it is really quiet. What you're seeing -- I don't know if you can see it in the background there, but a line of LAPD officers just showed up, along with private security for the university here, and essentially did a complete sweep. There were a few protesters that were still milling about. There was a standoff of sorts early this morning between the CHP and protesters on that perimeter. Then the CHP just left.

In this case, it has to be clear enough, specific enough that you can look at it and go, that's likely to cause someone to break the law, to assault somebody, to destroy property. The other thing is, when we're looking at these encampments, people do, of course, have very broad First Amendment rights to protest, to assemble. It's right in the First Amendment.

And there's been a really interesting line of questioning happening right now inside the courtroom, where the prosecutors are asking Keith Davidson simple things, like, do you consider this to be hush money? This was -- do believe this was a relationship and affair between Donald Trump and Stormy Daniels? Because the statements they were putting out at the time from Stormy Daniels and from Keith Davidson, Karen, were basically saying that there was no relationship, that she was not paid hush money. And Keith Davidson is pushing back and he's refusing to call it hush money. What do you make of that?",

This reminds me of the \"I did not have sexual relations with that woman\" comment. You know, it's -- it's clear that this is not true, that he was being too cute by half, as they say. And what's happening right now is, Joshua Steinglass has to just say, look, this is what it is. This is the seedy world that Donald Trump lived in. These are the people he dealt with. He dealt with -- with the underbelly of media, of lawyers of -- I mean, you have Michael Cohen. You have Rudy Giuliani. You have this guy, Keith Davidson. I mean, the prosecutor is going to say, look, I didn't pick these people. Donald Trump picked all these people. And this is what you're seeing. But there's no way they're going to embrace this kind of language and this parsing of words. But it is what it is.",

      "sentences": "Yes, I mean, he's calling it a consideration, instead of calling it hush money, even though we just saw the contract, Paula, that says Stormy Daniels couldn't speak publicly about it. They were writing her denials when people were reaching out about it. I mean, what else would you call it? PAULA REID, CNN CHIEF LEGAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENTgetting $130,000, and they're getting her silence. They're getting her to hush. So the idea that that was consideration for something else, it just doesn't hold water. I think even calling it slippery is being generous. And then the idea that he's constantly saying, well, we were denying it was a romantic relationship. No. Read that statement. It specifically says that she is denying any sexual and/or romantic relationship. So, him trying to sort of weasel out of that, it's just not going to play well with the jury.",

This is January 2018, just to take us all back. This is when all this reporting was coming out in \"The Wall Street Journal\" and other publications. I remember because that was the State of the Union where Melania Trump, the first lady at the time, refused to ride in the motorcade with her husband to Capitol Hill for that. She instead went separately. I believe she was wearing a white suit that night, a lot of subliminal messages there. And, right now, we're saying -- we're seeing that some of the jurors are smiling as Keith Davidson is explaining a text message and what he meant by \"WTF\" as they were talking about her appearance on Jimmy Kimmel, where -- where she's denying, you know, the allegations of the affair and of hush money, which we now can see her signature on these agreements.",
