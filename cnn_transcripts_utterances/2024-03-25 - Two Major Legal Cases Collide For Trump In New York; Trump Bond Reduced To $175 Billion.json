One, two -- we cast that as a whimsy gavel. The markets are down and these are the main events of the day. The date is set, Donald Trump's first criminal trial is the New York hush money case. It begins on April 15th. And over all at the top Boeing chief exec, the chairman, and head of commercial airplanes all departing from the plane maker. And the EU launches new investigations into Apple Google, and Meta. We have Scott Galloway to try to understand it all. Coming to you live from London tonight, it is Monday. It is March the 25th. I'm Richard Quest and I mean business. Good evening from London. Rulings in not one, but two major cases involving of course, Donald Trump. First, the criminal hush money case. A Manhattan judge has fixed the trial date, April 15th. It is likely the first and only criminal trial that Donald Trump will face before the presidential election in November; the second is civil fraud case. Here, a New York Appeals Court has lowered Trump's bond, saying, he only has come up with $175 million, extra 10 days much lower than the $464 million due today. It is a lifeline for Donald Trump who says he will pay. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

What that does is it doesn't satisfy the full loss that he has felt, the full fine that he will ultimately have to pay if the rulings in the court are upheld on appeal, but it allows him to continue appealing while holding off New York State from claiming his assets, seizing his businesses, locking down his bank accounts, and putting properties he has into the foreclosure process. So right now, he has 10 days to post that but $175 million bond to the court assuring them that he has money that the New York AG can start to collect once the lawsuit, the judgment finally can be collected upon, but that is going to take several months to work out because it is in the appeals process now.",

Russ Buettner is an investigative reporter for \"The New York Times\" and did such magnificent work earlier on, in which he got to grips with Donald Trump's finances. So, Katelyn was just suggesting that he has got -- he will be able to raise at least enough for the bond for the lower amount. But how precarious are his finances now? RUSS BUETTNER, INVESTIGATIVE REPORTER, \"THE NEW YORK TIMES\": Well, it is as recent as a couple of years ago, Richard, he was quite low on cash. He had enough to sort of operate, but he has had always had several businesses that require constant infusions of cash including his golf courses in Scotland and Ireland, so he tends to run lower every year than he was the prior year. Last year, he had some influxes. He sold a money-losing hotel in Washington, DC. He gave up his rights to a golf course in New York City and he had a refinancing of a passive investment that he had. Those combined brought him about $350 million, give or take, but he has had some hard hits since then. He had to pay some taxes on that money. And then recently, he had to pay another bond of $92 million in a defamation case here in New York. So that brings its him down, if those calculations are correct, roughly to around $250 million, and this bond will cost him $200 million. So he is getting down to the range where he is very close to what he needs just to keep operating his businesses.",

The chief executive is Dave Calhoun, and he intends to depart by the end of the year, but he is not the only one going. Youve got Larry Kellner who will not stand for re-election as a board member. And the interesting one, I think, head of its commercial plane unit, Stan Deal. He has gone immediately, not even end of the year. His replacement is the COO, Stephanie Pope. Calhoun became CEO after the deadly Max crashes in 2018 and 2019. They have their work cut out for them, whoever becomes CEO. Boeing is under investigation by US regulators, the FAA, the NTSB, and the Justice Department, it has been ordered to come up with a plan to address its quality control issues. Several airlines have also said, Boeing needs to do better, and that includes Ryanair, which said it welcomes today's changes. Last week you'll remember, he told me about the telltale signs of what Boeing's work was getting sloppy. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MICHAEL O'LEARY, CEO, RYANAIR: In 2022 and 2023, we were finding little things like spanners under floorboards, in some cases seat handles, missing things like that.

How many Palestinian prisoners exactly would be released in exchange for some 40 Israeli hostages in an initial phase of this agreement? And from what we understand, the Israeli side has now agreed to release some 700 Palestinian prisoners, dozens of whom are currently serving life sentences, which is a significant increase from the previous Israeli position, but it is also nuclear that significant gaps still do indeed remain, and Hamas is making very clear on that point, pointing to the fact that there are other issues beyond that ratio that still remain, including the withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza and the return of displaced Palestinians to the northern part of the Strip.",

And the Israeli prime minister certainly choosing to make this a public issue by rapidly threatening and then subsequently canceling this visit by two of his top advisers to Washington. Now, it is also important to note what this visit was going to be about. It was going to be about what has become the chief disagreement between the United States and Israel and that is a pending Israeli ground offensive into Gaza's southernmost city of Rafah. And on that point, the Israeli Prime Minister, even as he had initially agreed to send these advisers to Washington to hear out US alternatives to Rafah, he had also made clear that he was not going to change his mind, that he viewed a military offensive in Rafah as imperative and in canceling this visit, certainly he bolsters that position.

Whenever you try a case, Richard, you have to have information relevant to the case, as we look at the timelines there and the potential legal calendar, you have to have information if you're the prosecutor that's passed on to the defense. In this particular case, that information was of Trump's former fixer, Michael Cohen, who we know himself pled guilty in 2018 to federal crimes, the prosecution just gave the Trump team a number of documents related to that plea of guilty. Why is it relevant goes to the credibility. Michael Cohen, certainly will be a critical witness in this case. And so, the attorneys for Trump wants to question him based on a number of things. Now, they have all the documents to do so, the judge said not so fast.

So, Katelyn was just suggesting that he has got -- he will be able to raise at least enough for the bond for the lower amount. But how precarious are his finances now? RUSS BUETTNER, INVESTIGATIVE REPORTER, \"THE NEW YORK TIMES\": Well, it is as recent as a couple of years ago, Richard, he was quite low on cash. He had enough to sort of operate, but he has had always had several businesses that require constant infusions of cash including his golf courses in Scotland and Ireland, so he tends to run lower every year than he was the prior year. Last year, he had some influxes. He sold a money-losing hotel in Washington, DC. He gave up his rights to a golf course in New York City and he had a refinancing of a passive investment that he had. Those combined brought him about $350 million, give or take, but he has had some hard hits since then. He had to pay some taxes on that money. And then recently, he had to pay another bond of $92 million in a defamation case here in New York. So that brings its him down, if those calculations are correct, roughly to around $250 million, and this bond will cost him $200 million.

And on that point, the Israeli Prime Minister, even as he had initially agreed to send these advisers to Washington to hear out US alternatives to Rafah, he had also made clear that he was not going to change his mind, that he viewed a military offensive in Rafah as imperative and in canceling this visit, certainly he bolsters that position. Now, it is just a question of when and if a ceasefire deal might materialize before that offensive is actually carried out -- Richard.",

It lowered his bond payment. It should have been four engines 60-odd million. It's now $175 million. And it gave him 10 more days to find the money, which most people suggest is now entirely possible. Also, a Manhattan judge rejected appeals from Trump to delay or dismiss the criminal hush money trial even further. Our date has been set, April the 15th. Joey Jackson is our legal analyst. He's with me now. Let's do the criminal bit first. So, April 15th, jury selection several days, trial of three to four weeks, five weeks, may be this case, assuming there is no further delays will be over by summer.",

So, for purposes of today, the attorneys that is for Trump were in court, and they were suggesting two things. Number one, that the case should be dismissed based on prosecutorial misconduct. What does that mean? It means prosecutors said Trump attorneys engaged in misconduct because they waited forever, according to Trump's attorneys to deliver information called discovery. Whenever you try a case, Richard, you have to have information relevant to the case, as we look at the timelines there and the potential legal calendar, you have to have information if you're the prosecutor that's passed on to the defense. In this particular case, that information was of Trump's former fixer, Michael Cohen, who we know himself pled guilty in 2018 to federal crimes, the prosecution just gave the Trump team a number of documents related to that plea of guilty. Why is it relevant goes to the credibility. Michael Cohen, certainly will be a critical witness in this case. And so, the attorneys for Trump wants to question him based on a number of things. Now, they have all the documents to do so, the judge said not so fast. It's not prosecutorial misconduct, but I will give you additional time to assess and evaluate these documents to prepare your case. I think that's the right call.

And a lot of it just comes down to incentives. In the United States, we get a lot. We're net gainers from big tech, despite all the problems. In E.U., it's harder to make the case that they're net gainers, they get all the weaponization of their elections, the misinformation, the teen depression, but at the same time, there very few hospital wings or university buildings named after Google or Facebook billionaires.
