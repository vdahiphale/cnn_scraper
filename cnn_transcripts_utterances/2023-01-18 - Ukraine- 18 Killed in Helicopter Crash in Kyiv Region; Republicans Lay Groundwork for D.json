However, not all Republicans are on board. CNN's Priscilla Alvarez has the details. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) PRISCILLA ALVAREZ, CNN WHITE HOUSE REPORTER (voice-over): Migrants lining up along the U.S./Mexico border, cities overwhelmed. It's a crisis Republicans say of the administration's own making. And they argue Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas is to blame even teasing potential impeachment. REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY (R-CA) U.S. HOUSE SPEAKER: Should that person stay in their job? Well, I raise the issue they shouldn't. So, the thing we can do is we can investigate and in that investigation could lead to an impeachment inquiry. ALVAREZ (voice-over): Republicans allege that Mayorkas failed to enforce the nation's immigration laws and they argue he lied to Congress when he said this to a House committee. REP.

TONY GONZALES (R-TX): Impeachment is in case of emergency break glass. It seems as if we have taken that to a common thing. It shouldn't be a common thing.

All the other dead and injured were locals, parents and their children arriving for the day at the nearby kindergarten.Ukraine's interior minister, his first deputy, under Secretary of State were amongst the dead. A ministry adviser says investigators are working to determine the cause of the tragedy. New study finds when kids under 5-years-old test positive for COVID-19 and other respiratory viruses, they tend to be become sicker and develop more severe disease. The data shows children with another virus are more likely to be younger than five, received increase oxygen support and be admitted to the intensive care unit. A study in the journal \"Pediatrics\" comes amid a harsh season of respiratory viruses, of course, including RSV, flu and COVID that have overwhelmed pediatric hospitals.
