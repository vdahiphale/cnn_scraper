There was an organization called Light the Night Asheville, and they did a lantern walk through the district for solstice. And, just for me, I was like, I would like to light up our smokestack. And so Mesred Aiken (ph) and the Frisson audiovisual team at Radical Hotel took that, took my challenge and did an absolutely lovely job of sort of creating a beacon of hope for our future and for our recovery. So we -- again, as creatives, we continue to do what we do best in terms of trying to visualize and coming together to create the unified recovery of the RAD organization to try and vision from the ground up, from -- as a community effort, what do we want the River Arts District to look like going forward if we are successful in getting enough funding to make it happen? And we challenge our legislators to be able to make some of those -- that money available to the building owners, to our nonprofits, to the arts organizations in order for them to be able to have some control of their own future.",

So if you are thinking of returning what is maybe an ugly holiday sweater or using the gift card you received, we have some tips for you. And joining us is the CEO of AsktheMoneyCoach.com, Lynnette Khalfani- Cox. Thank you so much for being here. Listen, 'tis the season for returns. What should people know if they're planning on returning a gift either in person or online? LYNNETTE KHALFANI-COX, FOUNDER, WWW.ASKTHEMONEYCOACH.COM: 'Tis the season indeed.

You absolutely want to try to take a screenshot of your return receipt and then get an e-mail confirmation also, if possible. Now, some people -- you don't want to make -- you don't want to make sure that the things that you return, if you do something in the mail, maybe get lost or don't return in time, because a lot of retailers are giving pretty strict deadlines this year, some as little as seven or maybe 14 days. So if you do have to, say, go to the post office to return something, maybe one of those big-ticket items or something grandma or a rich uncle sent you, get the tracking from the insurance, the tracking from the Postal Service and maybe add the insurance as well if it's, say, a high-ticket or a high-value item.

Obviously, each store or organization is going to be a little bit different, but do you need to be mindful of that? Do people -- do you find that stores really hold you to that 30 days or whatever the case may be? KHALFANI-COX:  Stores are absolutely strict about the return policy. So, you do want to be mindful and to know in advance when you're buying something that perhaps you have gotten -- or if someone gave you a gift and they gave you a receipt on there, it might indicate specifically the number of days that you have to return it. Try to stick to that if at all possible. Don't give the retailer a reason to turn you down and say, no, you can't return this.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK) [11:46:12] DEAN:  Well, here's a concerning thought that I'm sorry to tell you. We are now just a single mutation away from the bird flu potentially being able to spread from human to human. There have been dozens of human cases confirmed in the U.S. this year, but those were all contracted from animals. Right now, the CDC estimates the current risk to the public is low, but there has been a spike in cases among animals recently. The virus killed more than half of the big cats at a Washington sanctuary in a matter of weeks, and a house cat in Oregon died from eating pet food that tested positive for bird flu. CNN medical correspondent Meg Tirrell is joining us now. And, Meg, I think everyone would like to know just, like, how worried should we be about this?",

      "sentences": "Yes, Jessica, I mean, when you hear about a cat dying after eating infected pet food, I mean, that makes you think, uh-oh, how widespread could this potentially be?It's really important to give the details about this pet food. It was raw frozen turkey pet food sold by a company called Northwest Naturals that this cat consumed and was infected by H5N1. They found that the virus had contaminated the pet food and that cat died. We also have heard about House cats who have died after drinking raw milk. They died from H5N1. And so we know that cats are very susceptible to this virus and that raw milk and raw food are concerning, because the virus can be found in really high levels in those items. And so it's not recommended that cats or humans consume those things. We do know that pasteurization, though, inactivates the virus. So regular milk is all right. But if we look at the source of exposure for the 65 cases in humans that the CDC has confirmed of bird flu, most of these have come from dairy cattle. So we know that this is a really big outbreak, particularly in California among cows. We also know that there have been some cases, about 23, that have been confirmed among workers on poultry farms. And then there are a few cases where we don't know the source of exposure. And there is one where -- we just heard about this. Somebody was infected from a backyard flock. And so right now the U.S. is starting to step up its response to this. The most recent thing is that the USDA has started requiring testing of unpasteurized milk before it goes to the pasteurization process to try to get a better handle on where we're seeing bird flu in dairy cattle. So, as of now, they have brought on 13 states onto that program. The goal is to make that a nationwide program, so we can a better handle on this -- Jessica.",

That's what Murthy said. It's no secret that diet plays a major role in our health. And while we know the benefits of healthy food, the harms of ultra-processed food are now coming into clearer focus. Ultra-processed foods make up nearly 70 percent of our country's food supply. Numerous studies have found that consuming higher amounts of these foods raises the risk of obesity, but also the development of chronic conditions like cancer, cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, depression, and it probably even shortens lifespan. Researchers are now trying to figure out if ultra-processed ingredients are all created equal. An alarming spread of bird flu throughout dairy herds across the United States has scientists on edge.",
