Welcome to the program, everyone. I'm Christiane Amanpour in New York. And we begin with the devastating natural disasters and human tragedy bedeviling North Africa. In Libya, harrowing stories of bodies piling and filling up streets after massive floods when a torrential downpour smashed through two dams, washing away home and everything in water's way. As that country starts to count the cost, more than 6,000 were presumed dead. And at last report, some 10,000 missing. Another 30,000 have been displaced. These are huge numbers in a failing state which urgently needs help, as Correspondent Ben Wedeman now reports. And a warning, of course, some scenes are difficult to watch. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BEN WEDEMAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voiceover):  The bodies are everywhere. Dozens, dozens of the dead covered in blankets, awaiting identification and burial. The dead number in the thousands. But so far, no one really knows how many were taken by Storm Daniel. Survivors are finding more and more bodies. Rescue workers and volunteers have retrieved the body of a boy wrapped in a blanket and prepared to put him in a body bag. When his father arrives, overcome with emotion. Doctors fear so many dead left in the open could lead to an outbreak of disease. We aren't able to identify all the bodies and bury them, says this woman identified as Dr. Ais (ph). We want to provide a humane place, freezers where loved ones can then identify them. Access to Derna remains difficult. The flood destroyed many roads and bridges leading to the city. This port of Eastern Libya has been transformed into a waste land of mud, rubble and ruin. The raging waters that tore the city spared no one and nothing. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

JESSICA RAMOS (D-NY):  Yes, thank you. I was tremendously disappointed to hear the mayor who is supposed to be our greatest cheerleader here in New York City sound so defeatist. We know one of the values that truly characterizes New Yorkers is that we ban together when there's a challenge at hand. And this should be no different.

So, we're definitely not here to destroy things but actually to make New York better.

And what we want is to see the city and, of course, the state and the federal government, every level, really band together to make investments where they matter most. There is no reason why, if from Albany we're sending every single nickel and dime that our public schools need in order to fully function that we should be making cuts when we're actually welcoming 19,000 migrant children who will -- which means we will need more bilingual teachers, we will need more mental health supports. This again is a moment where we invest in our people and build our infrastructure, not do the opposite.

And, you know, they get off that bus in port authority or wherever, they have the t-shirts on their back, the sneakers on their feet. They're not prepared for northeast winter.

And here in the United States, the CDC isrecommending that if you are older than six months, get an updated COVID vaccine. The U.K. is bringing its vaccine drive forward as health agencies around the world monitor a new variant. My next guest is looking at lessons learned from past pandemics and the science that saves us. Historian Simon Schama's latest book is \"Foreign Bodies: Pandemics, Vaccines and the Health of Nations.\" So, we welcome you, Simon Schama, back to the program. First glance, pandemics is not necessarily what I would associate with you and your grand explorations of history. But maybe, absolutely, we need to learn these lessons from history. What's the most important one you would say to start off? SIMON SCHAMA, AUTHOR \"FOREIGN BODIES\":  Trust science. Don't trust it absolutely uncritically. But it was very shocking to me, actually, I think last week or maybe it was this week, to hear the surgeon general of Florida, appointed by the governor of Florida, Ron DeSantis, who's making skepticism about containing the possibility of rising COVID at the heart of his campaign and criticizing what was done during the first stages of COVID 19. The surgeon general of Florida said, do not take this new vaccine, especially if you're a young man. This is on the basis of extremely dubious data associating the possibility of myocarditis, a kind of inflation of heart muscles among young males. And, Christiane, this is, to me -- since you asked the most important thing, this is sort of part of a general attack on the authority of knowledge. A lot of the people I talk about in the book, it goes way back to the 1700s when we had no understanding -- we didn't really know about what an immune system was. And it was, of course, counterintuitive to actually take a bit of toxic material, in this case, small pox pus, and stick in it your body because you thought that would actually bring on a mild case of small pox and protect you from actually dying or being horribly disfigured about it. But people in the 1700s, a little on, including the philosopher, Voltaire, who was the first person to write about inoculation as an effective mitigation of the severity of disease, they all felt the following, that once the empire of knowledge spread its benevolent -- you know, its benevolent web of understanding, then, really, once people actually read a little of the science they could understand, they would accept that there just was a benevolent, not a dangerous thing. And we get rid of conspiracy theories. But what in so many parts of contemporary life of experiences, on the one hand, humans are capable of the utmost ingenuity, producing vaccines at a record rate, including the monovalent new vaccine for the variants of XPB, the decedents of Omicron. At the same time, rebundle (ph) of crazy paranoias. You know, our antenna are out there thinking, OK, it's a sort of conspiracy to rob of us of our liberty. God and God only should be the arbiter of who shall live and who shall die.

And the extraordinary thing is he runs into fierce opposition from the powers that be, and also, from the medical profession in India, the imperial British medical profession, who did not want to know about new microbiology at all. Haffkine did not have a medical degree. Had a scientific degree. But the astounding thing is that very much on his own (INAUDIBLE), with a little help and the little money, and the extraordinary allies in Mumbai, what was then Bombay, and the Jewish community and the Ismaili, he undertakes these odysseys (ph) of vaccination throughout the country. And traveling hundreds and thousands of miles among very, very poor people. So, he's an astonishing kind of evangelist for the proven efficacy of vaccine. And he cultivates religious leaders in order that they may persuade those who are understandably fearful or suspicious. It's when there's a kind of contamination scandal and 19 people die of a contaminated package, a contaminated batch in the Punjab in 1902, he instantly gets the blame for it. Although, it had happened in the village, not at his -- the first mass production facility for vaccines in the world. But that's the point. When the Jew, the Ukrainian Jew, the vaccination becomes an embarrassment to the British empire. And the viceroy says, well, Haffkine has brought discredit on the whole empire, he ought to be tried and hanged for this abomination. It's sort of a medical Dreyfus (ph), Christiane.",

LAMAS:  Well, as a critical care doctor, I mean, I work in the intensive care unit, I see patients often or not infrequently at the ends of their lives or facing the ends of their lives and in the intensive care unit for whatever reason. And often, that's entirely an appropriate choice. But at the same time, the questions of hospice often come up. And there is a real hesitation, fear, to discuss this. Particularly for people who are not, you know, in the final days of life. And so, the fact that Jimmy Carter was very public with his decision to enter hospice when there were months of his life to go, whether or not he knew it at that time, he wasn't in the final days of life, I felt like that was a very kind of important and powerful model to give to an American public.",

It's an insurance benefit that people get, which means that if a doctor determined that they're within, the best that we can tell, last six months of life, they can receive care that is targeted to their comfort rather than life prolonging measures. Meaning, often, that people don't return to the hospital or to the emergency department in those last months of life. They are cared for either at their home or at a hospice facility. So, it's really care that is targeted toward comfort rather than life extension for people who are in the last six months of their life.",

LAMAS:  Yes. I think probably the latter. I'm sure that there are some people who don't know about it. But I think in the past decade or so, the sort of prominence of hospice and palliative care as a discipline has become more prevalent in terms of discussion. But I think at the same time, there's a real fear and challenge with acknowledging that somebody is there. That your loved one is there. And as a result, hesitation to acknowledge it until it is impossible to ignore until somebody is really in the last couple days, couple of weeks of life. And I think that -- you know, I'm saying that in a way that suggests that that comes just from the patient or family member, but that's not fair or true, that's also coming from us, from doctors, from their caregivers who have very similar human reactions to say, no, no, no, there's something more I can do.

He didn't have to tell people, you know, what he was doing and where he was, but he chose to. Why do you think it's so important that he did? DR. LAMAS:  Yes. I mean, exactly to your point, he didn't have to and yet, he did. And I think he offered a model of a way to face the end of one's life that doesn't feel like defeat, that doesn't feel like giving up. There was the announcement that he was announcing hospice care and then, there are articles about how he was spending time with his family, you know, details like eating ice cream, these sorts of things, that, you know, suggested that it's not that hospice correlates directly with death, it's that this is a way to meet the final months of one of life. We don't even know how long it will be, really, on one's own terms.

So, can you just talk a little bit more about, like, what are some of the kinds of things that take place when one is in hospice care? DR. LAMAS:  Yes. So, just to kind of make a differentiation, some people can be in hospice at home and others, because of their own personal preferences, because of their needs, because there isn't a setup at home to make this possible, which we can talk about, choose to be in hospice, in a hospice home or a facility. And both of those are the right choice for people based on their circumstances. At home, one is at home. There are hospice providers who come a certain amount of times a week, sort of shifts based on your need. And you exist. You live your life. You can still be treated for an infection with antibiotics, it doesn't mean that all care that is intended to avoid infections or sickness, that all care stops. But if you're in pain, ideally, you don't go to an emergency room. Ideally, there actually are medicines at home that you can receive or medicines at hospice facility that you can receive. There are -- you know, there are issues surrounding, you know, what counts as life prolonging that's not allowed in hospice and what might actually be tailored to people's comfort. There's, you know, debates about whether or not people on hospice should be able to continue to undergo dialysis, for instance. So, there's some complexities there. But the sort of big picture is that people can continue to do the things that are important to them and live their life while being aware that what they're trying to do is maximize the quality of their time that is remaining rather than maximizing quantity.",

People are less anxious, less depressed sometimes. You know, being able to really -- I think for a lot of people, uncertainty is the worst thing. And so, being able to say, OK, I'm looking ahead. This is a decision I have made. This is where we're at, is kind of -- even if that decision is terrifying, that allows people to take back power and to determine, you know, what this period of time looks like.

And clearly, this was a painful experience for the person who wrote this. What's your response to that? DR. LAMAS:  My response is that we need to do better. You know, I think and I say this in the intensive care unit where we see families whose loved one was on hospice, pain became excruciating. The family became scared because they're not trained physicians or nurses. And they call 911. And then, end up back in an intensive care unit. And that happens. That happens too commonly. And that's a failure not of the family, to be sure, not of the patient, but of the hospice system where -- and of this -- exactly as that letter said, this is sort of gauzy (ph) fantasy that we give people where we say, people want to die at home, if that's -- you know, if you love -- your loved one, that's what's going to happen. But then, we don't have a healthcare system that is set up to offer that in a way that doesn't rely on family caregivers. It works when it works. When there are enough people there who feel comfortable enough with things like giving morphine. You know, in certain families and circumstances, it does work. But it doesn't work for everyone. And we -- if we pretend that it does, we definitely do people a disservice in the hospital.

You know, there are things that are important to people more than living as long as possible. And sort of understanding those and understanding the way those change overtime and really targeting our care to get to what's important to the individual is essential. And we can do better at that. I also think on a broader level, if we're looking at, you know, Jimmy Carter's, what we assume his death will be at home, and that's something that should be achievable to others, I do think that Medicare reimbursements for in-home care giving at the end-of-life have to be better.
