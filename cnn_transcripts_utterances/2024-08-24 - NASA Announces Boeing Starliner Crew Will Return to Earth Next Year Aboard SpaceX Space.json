I'm Fredricka Whitfield.And we begin with breaking news this hour as NASA says the Starliner crew will return to earth next year, and on the SpaceX crewed Dragon spacecraft. The Boeing test flight is now on its 11th week after issues with the Starliner spacecraft kept them aboard the International Space Station longer than expected. And it comes after NASA met earlier today to review who would bring the astronauts back safely. Let's listen to administrator Bill Nelson with the announcement. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "I think this was probably the most consequential decision that NASA has had to make about crew safety in quite some time. And you hear NASA Administrator Bill Nelson saying that NASA was really learning from past mistakes. And so now what's going to happen is these two veteran astronauts, Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams, they're going to have to wait about the International Space Station until February of next year, at which point in time they're going to return to earth on a different spacecraft that's built and operated by different company. They're going to be coming back on SpaceX's crewed Dragon spacecraft.As for the vehicle that got them into space, Starliner, remember this was the first crewed test flight of Boeing's Starliner spacecraft. That vehicle is going to undock from the International Space Station in early September with no crew on board and return to earth. In the end, NASA says it really came down to those thrusters. There was concern, and it turned out to be a unanimous decision by the decision-makers within NASA, there was concern that these thrusters could somehow not work at one of the most critical times. And that would be re-entering the earth's atmosphere. If Starliner's heat shield was not positioned in the exact right spot it would not be able to protect the crew from the incredibly high temperatures that the spacecraft has to endure when it re-enters the earth's atmosphere. Something very similar is what happened to the Columbia accident back in 2003. And so, Fred, during this briefing, I asked the NASA administrator, Bill Nelson, I said, you were an astronaut yourself. You flew in space on the space shuttle. You were also a member of Congress and on the committee that investigated the Challenger accident. You were a senator when the Columbia accident happened. How much did that experience influence your decision today? Here's what he said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BILL NELSON, NASA ADMINISTRATOR:  It has affected the decision today by this collective group and all of those that participated in the flight tests readiness review this morning. It is a trying to turn around the culture that first led to the loss of Challenger, and then lead to the loss of Columbia, where obvious mistakes were not being brought forth. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

However, the Dragon only requires really one, and there will be two others who have, or two in total that have been trained on it who can fly though the craft back manually in some kind of manual mode if necessary.

But yes, they've learned these lessons, and we're not going to get complacent. We're not going to get carefree about this, if you will, and go ahead and bring them down on the Starliner just because.

After Challenger, after all those years, we got complacent again, even before Challenger and the Apollo One fire, it took almost the same number of years for complacency to creep back in.

So in other words, there would be -- no one is proposing there would be no security along that border. The question is, who does it and for how long.

So that that war, that front is very much present. The question is whether it goes even further and turns into all-out war between Hezbollah and Israel, which would be tremendously devastating to both sides.Hezbollah, of course, has threatened to respond to the killing of its senior official in Beirut several weeks ago, but it has held off as negotiations are ongoing so as not to be viewed as having thwarted them.

We've never seen a nominee, presidential nominee switch the last moment before in U.S. history.And so one of the challenges for the Harris campaign was to show, first of all, that she had the support of the Democratic rank and file, and also that the party is unified around this switcheroo. And I think it's fair to say they achieved that. The unity, the emotion, the energy is all there and all positive. Her speech was quite surprising in one sense. Her full-throated embrace of a foreign policy approach that is actually quite similar to that of Joe Biden's indicated very little change in foreign policy. For those who believe in the United States as an indispensable nation for world security, that was great. That was an important thing to hear. And she did it with such emotion that it was clear that it was from her heart. She believed in that. The other themes, of course, were extremely important because she presented herself and her story. What we see right now is a vibe campaign, more than anything else. And we've seen it before. A vibe campaign is a campaign about change, about new, about the future. And some of the most successful American presidential campaigns have been vibe campaigns. John F. Kennedy, Barack Obama, the first Clinton, I'm talking about Bill Clinton's first campaign.

But those seven.The second thing we're going to see is a very important decision by the Harris campaign by her in particular, what policy issues to focus on for the debate, because she knows that Donald Trump doesn't debate specifics. He's going to go personal. But she may want to send it a series of messages to some of the battleground states through the debate. So I think that's one of the things she's going to be focusing on.

At this press conference where they laid out all of this, they said that this was the cause of -- the sinking that led to the deaths was human behavior. And now there are a couple of things we took away from this. One of the things that I think is most important is they didn't detain. All of the crew members who survived -- only one crew member died. That was the chef who was discovered early on Monday after the ship went down. They're all foreign passport holders, which means if they were to leave the country, if they were to leave Italy, they'd have to be extradited back.When pressed, prosecutors said that they had asked the captain to remain available for further questioning. I think that's a hugely important aspect of this case. We were expecting maybe someone in custody today because it is manslaughter. The other thing that prosecutors said, they didn't drug or alcohol test any of the crew members. They said they were in a state of shock and that was the reason that they didn't do it. So you've got a component there in terms of evidence that is going to be missing when it comes to what happens next. The third thing is that both the prosecutor and the fire brigade officers said that five of the bodies were found in the same area and it could have been because there was an air pocket, and that they had gathered to try to get that last bit of air before the ship sank. The prosecutor, that's a horrific detail if, in fact, that's true. Fire brigade officers said it could just be that the water push them together, but the idea that they could have been alive for some time before the ship finally became inundated with water is just a horrifying detail. The next thing that happens, of course, is that they're going to have to raise this vessel. And that cost well go to the owner of the ship, which is, of course, Mike Lynch's wife, whose company owned the ship. She is a survivor. Three other people survived. The rest of the survivors were the crew members. So it's still very much an open question, really, Fredricka, what happens next.",
