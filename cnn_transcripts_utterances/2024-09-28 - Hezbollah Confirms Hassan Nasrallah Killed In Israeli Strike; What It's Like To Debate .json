I'm Michael Smerconish in Philadelphia. The conflict escalating even more this morning, Israeli airstrikes have targeted 140 Hezbollah sites in Beirut, including weapons storage and missile facilities embedded beneath civilian buildings. That's according to the IDF.The strikes are part of an ongoing campaign by Israel to degrade Hezbollah military capability. The Lebanese government responding to the widespread destruction, calling for intervention on an international basis. The country has recorded more than 100,000 people have been displaced by the conflict. Authorities claim that number is actually much higher. Our Chief National Security Analyst Jim Sciutto in Tel Aviv with the very latest. Jim, tell us first, who was Hassan Nasrallah.",

      "sentences": "Hassan Nasrallah was a defining figure in Hezbollah and the region for more than three decades, leading the terrorist organization going back to 1992 and remaking it over the course of that time into a formidable force, certainly with Iran's help with many 10s of 1000s of rockets and missiles aimed here at Israel. He is central, was central to this group, and like the bombs that we saw strike yesterday, this attack is earth shaking for Hezbollah, and I think one can say as well for Iran, given how central Hezbollah is to Iran's exercise of power against Israel, but also in this region. Of course, the questions now, Michael, are, how does Hezbollah respond? Can it retaliate credibly, given the devastating attack, not just killing their leader, but you remember those pager attacks on many 1000s of Hezbollah operatives, as well as attacks on their weapons storage facilities. Can it retaliate credibly?Will Iran feel that it must attack to show its strength and to respond for this? And then, of course, Israel making preparations, it seems, at least, for the possibility of a ground operation inside southern Lebanon. It hasn't given that order, but it is at least building the forces on the northern border to do so.",

In both cases, the impression from the White House is that Benjamin Netanyahu, at least, was not sufficiently interested in or supportive of those efforts, at worst, was standing in the way of getting those agreements across the finish line. And I think that informs what I was hearing last night, as were several of my colleagues from the White House, a deliberate and quite public effort to put distance between the U.S. and this Israeli strike, making quite clear, one, the U.S. was not involved. And two, it didn't know about it. In fact, only got notice of the coming attack once the jets were in the air. I think it's a very difficult point in the relationship, certainly between Biden and Netanyahu, and arguably in the relationship between the U.S. and Israel.",

There has been some frustration among Hamas leaders and Hezbollah as well that Iran has not sufficiently backed them or used its own military might to strike back against Israel as Israel has struck Hamas and Hezbollah, even its own proxies question Iran's commitment to them. So, is Iran making its own decisions for its own interests and leaving its proxies to hang out to dry?To some degree, there's some suspicion that's possible, but you and I and everyone else in this region can be surprised at any moment, as we were in April, by a significant Iranian response, but also a Hezbollah one as well.",

      "sentences": "No, whether it's a new story an old story you are witnessing, Michael, three wars of attrition, one between Israel and Hamas, which is probably the least contentious or strategically important. A second between Israel and Hezbollah, which is going to go on in some form. And a third between two states, between Israel and Iran. None of these wars of attrition are going to end anytime soon, there are no transformative diplomatic Hollywood endings to these stories. At best it's a question of deterrence management, and maybe, maybe if Hezbollah, the Israelis and the Iranians are open to it, what I would call smart transactional diplomacy, agreements that will contain conflict, but not repeat, not bring about what you and I would consider, normal humans would consider peace in any way shape.So the question about whether we're safe or not, I think that Hezbollah -- well, we do not know how Hezbollah is going to respond. Will they use their precision guided missiles? They roughly have 400 of the scores of 1000s of cruise missiles. One way attract -- attack drones and ballistic missiles. They afford precision guided missiles that could strike easily Israeli population centers and infrastructure. Head of the Israeli electricity grid months ago warned that a Hezbollah strike on the grid could throw Israel into the dark for days, something that is almost impossible, not for the Lebanese for sure, but for the Israelis to imagine. Or will they stand down and understand that those sorts of actions would result in a massive retaliation. They need to figure also the Lebanese public into this, which is going to be already taking a beating as a consequence of Israeli strikes. So that's question number one. I would think they would resort, over time, to soft targets, strikes against Israeli diplomats, Jewish institutions and organizations abroad. Second question is Iran, and I think Jim Sciutto, terrific analyst, laid it out pretty clearly, the Iranians are in a bind. They don't want to see their primary proxy, their window on the Arab Israeli conflict demolished, but they don't want to be dragged in for Iranian national interest to a sustained confrontation with Israel that would almost certainly involve the United States --",

And I think what Tim Walz is trying to do now is he's trying to be supportive of Harris so that he can be a good cheerleader, and he knows how to do that. He's a former football coach on an assistant level, and I think that he's going to do for Harris whatever she needs. He's not going to upstage her, but you're going to see that his values are not driven from that fabric of deeply held convictions, as much as it's going to be a Zeitgeist moment.

And, of course, gave his speech at the United Nations, a pretty fiery speech each about Iran, about Hezbollah just hours before the strike. So, as far as we can tell, from the public White House announcements, there have been no conversations between the president and Prime Minister Netanyahu since all this began 10 days ago with the Israeli announcement that they were moving toward the north, with attacks using the pagers and the walkie-talkies, with the raid that they did, very skillful raid on a missile factory in Syria, and then these attacks.

And the question is, why has it declined to use its leverage in an effort to rein the Israelis in toward this ceasefire or toward the ceasefire and hostage deal that they we're negotiating in Gaza. And as you were saying earlier with Jim Sciutto, you know, what's remarkable about this is that Prime Minister Netanyahu has calculated that he's at a unique moment in American politics, where he can defy the United States and pursue his own agenda, driven much by the local politics that he's facing as he tries to keep his coalition together.
