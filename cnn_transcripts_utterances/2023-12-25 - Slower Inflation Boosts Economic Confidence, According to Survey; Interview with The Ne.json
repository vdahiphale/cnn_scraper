      "sentences": "Yes. So, I mean, we are seeing some pretty good news on the price front. So, what we saw this last month was the first decline in the month over month price level that we've had since early 2020. So, really the first experience of this we've had since before the pandemic. And what we're seeing in a, sort of, broader sense is that inflation has been slowing down for months. We're still seeing prices increase on a year over year basis, but they're doing so a lot more slowly than they previously were.And so, that should be bringing some relief, especially in a world where people are earning decent wage increases at the moment. You know, we're seeing wages climb faster than prices are climbing and that should leave households sort of playing a game of catch up with the price increases we saw earlier, but finally making some headway in that game of catch up. And so, I think it's a pretty optimistic moment.",

Do we think that the interest rates are going to stay the way they are? Will they drop some or will they go back to a, sort of, more aggressive lifting of the of the interest rates, you think? SMIALEKAnd so, in the pretty near future, we could be looking at a less intensive interest rate environment. And I think that that's good news for households and that markets tend to adjust ahead of those things. And so, we're probably past the worst when it comes to mortgage rates, unless some surprise happens. And we may in fact be headed for a substantially lower mortgage rates within the next couple of months.",
