And I counted parts of at least 21 states that are dealing with the excessively cold temperatures. Whereas cold as 18 degrees here into the overnight hours and early morning hours in the Central portion of the U.S. and we're talking upwards of 70 million Americans dealing with this.And yes, in the northern reaches of the U.S., the UP of Michigan there where up to a foot of snow possible with the cold air that's in place. So, winter weather alerts have been prompted across that region. You can kind of see the radar here highlighting some of the snow showers that are already coming down across this landscape. But the big story's not the amount of snow that's going to accumulate. That's going to be limited generally speaking. But the amount of people that are going to be dealing with the cold temps. In fact, upwards of 95 record temps possible in the cold end of things here from Tuesday going into Thursday. But you'll notice the trend here over the next several days. Going to begin to gradually warm up again. The average this time of year for example in Atlanta, 74. It'll be about 20 degrees cooler on Tuesday afternoon, but every single day check on about say 3 to 6 degrees and by this weekend back up into the middle and upper 70s. But in fact, looking ahead into next week, we do have the Eastern U.S. expected to remain well above average. So, this false fall that we're feeling is going to be short lived. But across the Western U.S., Max, noted that it's been excessively warm. Of course, you see the wildfire conditions on the border of Washington and Oregon. In fact, the vast majority of the 97 large active fires across parts of nine states are across parts of the Northwest. Where air quality alerts have been prompted in this region as a result of the very dry conditions and also the very warm weather that's been in place. But forecast guidance here from Friday into Saturday and even into Sunday brings with it some wet weather and even some high elevation snow showers there as well. So, improving fire conditions there we expect by this weekend, Max. And high temperatures ranging from the middle 80s there around the Western U.S. where the 40s are back in the forecast across parts of Chicago and Atlanta. Low to middle 50s for the afternoon highs.

Amongst them, as you mentioned, Iran's minister for information and communication technology. Because of course we have seen an internet blackout in pockets of the country as well, in an attempt to stop the spread of information and video coming out of Iran. These are sanctions put in place by the European Union in addition to sanctions already present in place by, of course, the European officials as well as U.S. officials. And we heard a response from Iran's foreign minister just yesterday tweeting, down a well-worn path of ineffective sanctions. It is an unconstructive act out of miscalculation, based on widespread disinformation. Riots and vandalism are not tolerated anywhere. Iran is no exception. Now course, the Iranian regime has been effectively paint these protests and these demonstrations as riots. They blame the unrest on foreign actors, including the U.S. and Israel in the past -- according to Iran supreme leader. But what we have seen is that these demonstrations are gaining momentum. They were sparked, of course, in the actions and death of Mahsa Amini, driven by women and young girls protesting against the regime's severe restrictions on women's rights. But these have really gained momentum and morphed into a much wider call for reform in Iran. And some now even calling for regime change. And human rights groups condemning the crackdown. Just yesterday we saw a letter signed by 40 human rights organizations, sent by Human Rights Watch, calling for the U.N.
