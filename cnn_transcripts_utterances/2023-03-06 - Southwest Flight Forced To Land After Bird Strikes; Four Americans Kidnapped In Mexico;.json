Now, according to the airline, right after that 737 took off from the airport, it hit a number of birds. One of those birds hit the plane's engine, which then laid it -- which then led to a fire. And it also hit the nose of that aircraft. Now, by the time the aircraft made it back onto the ground in Havana, we're told that firefighters were there. They were able to put out that fire. And that all of the passengers that were on board that plane were able to safely get out using those emergency chutes. One of those passengers talked to the \"Today\" show. Here's what he said.

And shortly after they crossed into Matamoros, Mexico, that's when they were fired upon by an unidentified individual. And shortly thereafter, the four U.S. citizens were taken from the scene by armed individuals. Now, the FBI says that it is asks for the public's help in identifying these suspects and that there is a $50,000 reward for information that leads to an arrest. The American citizens have not been identified and the FBI does say that they're working with their federal and local law enforcement partners in Mexico. Now, about Matamoros and about this area. Matamoros is in the state -- Mexican state of Tamaulipas. The U.S. Department of State has Tamaulipas on its do not travel list for U.S. citizens because U.S. citizens have been victims of crime and kidnapping. And so, Erica and Jim, this area is known for this. Cartels operate there.

Larry Hogan said, elected office isn't the only way to make a difference. There's a frustration about the divisive politics in this country at this point, and yet the loudest most extreme voices do continue to dominate. Do you see a scenario where that changes at all? DAVID GERGEN, CNN SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST: We'll have to wait and see, Erica. But it's good to be here this morning. And I must tell you that I think increasingly the -- this has become a two-person race. There's Trump and there's DeSantis and then there's everybody else on the Republican side. And no one in that everybody else column, I think, has a chance to really advance until DeSantis has been - has been checked out. You know, the press is -- we know all about Donald Trump. More than we want to know in some cases. But DeSantis has not gone through that kind of screening. And the press -- the press will be doing that in the next few weeks because it's so obviously a Trump versus DeSantis race right now. And from that we'll know, does anybody else have a chance? And right now I would say that nobody else is in the running. As I say, there's DeSantis, there's Trump and then there's a whole stream of other people coming on. But look at -- Jim Sciutto would respond to this, look at Mike Pompeo.

The problem that the Russians ran into, though, was Ukrainian morale and Ukrainian willingness to fight for their homeland. So, there are these intangible situations where Ukrainians are far better at this than the Russians are. Their command structure is far better, their leadership is far better and they're proving that every day. The fact that the Russians have not been able to take Bakhmut after seven months of fighting right there in that city and around that city really shows how critically important morale is for any type of military fight. And the Ukrainians have definitely won in that regard.",
