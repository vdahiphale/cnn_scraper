I'm Anderson Cooper alongside my colleague Wolf Blitzer.We've witnessed missiles intercepted across Israel a short time ago as air raid sirens went off on the ground below. The Israeli military now confirms some of those missiles made a direct impact in central and southern Israel. It's estimated Iran launched nearly 200 projectiles. Iran says, this attack was in response for the killing of Hezbollah's leader Hassan Nasrallah, and other assassinations.",

They're meeting the Israeli Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, his defense minister and other security officials are meeting right now to discuss.You did hear those public, that public pronouncement from Daniel Hagari saying that this was a serious attack, his words on Tel Aviv, and there will be serious consequences. And then I found it notable that Michael Oren, when he was speaking with Wolf just a short time ago, Michael Oren, of course, former Israeli ambassador to the U.S., that he said that Iran's nuclear facilities are not immune to such a response. He's not in those meetings right now. He's not making those decisions. But that question is an open one. And it's not a new one because there is a cohort in this country that has, for some time, wanted to strike Iranian nuclear facilities. Not clear that they've made the decision to do that, but that is at least a possibility. And that, it's hard to see how that would not lead to a broader, more open war between Israel and Iran. And the carry on effect of that is that the U.S. might find itself involved as well, whether it wants to be or not, because there are capabilities that the U.S. has, that are greater than Israel's in terms of defending Israeli territory, in terms of shooting down incoming missiles. I was told just prior to this attack that the U.S. would participate in Israel's defense and would shoot down missiles. If it had those targets, I'd be surprised that they did not participate, did not shoot down some of these. But if there was an open war between Israel and Iran on that scale, the risks of the U.S. being involved are quite high.",

And as I mentioned, the President and the Vice President, they've been meeting with top national security officials in the White House Situation Room, gearing up for a U.S. response. We don't know what that response will be, but we'll monitor what's going on. A very dangerous moment.Anderson, right now, you and I have covered this region for a long time.

Because as you know, and as I know and as Anderson knows, the Israelis have always suggested that the greatest potential threat to Israel from all over the area would be an Iranian nuclear strike against Israel. Iran has been working on a nuclear bomb, as we all know, and they're getting closer and closer. How worried should the world be right now about that type of Iranian attack against Israel?",

Well, the Israeli Security Cabinet is sitting right now in underground bunker in the mountains near Jerusalem to discuss exactly that, whether there could be another attack from Iran and what's going to be the Israeli response to the attack we just saw.The Iranians obviously still do not have a nuclear weapon. Israeli intelligence services think that it will take them at least another -- between one to two years to build a nuclear device that you can put on a missile and launch. So in that sense, there's no such threat at the moment. But I think what we're going to see in the next few hours is a very, very severe response from Israel to this Iranian attack that will not look in any way like the Israeli response to the Iranian attack in April that was just launching one missile at one anti-aircraft battery in an air base near Isfahan. I think we're going to see a very, very serious response. BLITZER: I think you're absolutely right. And I asked the question about the nuclear potential there, Barak, because as you well know, and as I know, over the years, the Israelis have always said that they would love an opportunity to preempt and destroy Iran's potential nuclear capability. There have been many top Israeli military officials and others who have said, you know, that the Israelis should do so before Iran actually has a nuclear bomb. What are the prospects do you think that even though Iran is not yet capable of launching a nuclear strike at Israel, Israel would use this moment to try to undermine Iran's nuclear capability? We know over the past few years, Israel has attacked various Iranian nuclear scientists among others.",

And the conditions right now, I think, are maybe more mature than any time before for an Israeli attack against the Iranian nuclear program, especially that one of the problems Netanyahu had over the years was that the IDF was very hesitant from taking such a step. The current IDF leadership is in a different place right now. And it is, I think, very much willing to consider such a move and to even recommend such a move to the Israeli cabinet.",

And we've learned, Anderson, that the vice president and the president together were in the situation monitoring these attacks as they were carried out by Iran and plotting how the U.S. would continue coming to Israel's defense. A National Security Spokesperson saying that President Biden directed the U.S. to continue assisting Israel in shooting down the missiles that Iran was firing and to continue to provide those defenses to Israel.But what's interesting, Anderson and Wolf, is that this comes after nearly a year of ambivalence and hand-wringing by the administration fears that there would be escalation that would lead to a wider war. And their diplomatic efforts have really had the primary goal of trying to thwart that from happening. And in recent weeks, they've been bracing for that potential, starting with the targeted strike that killed the political leader of Hamas, Ismail Haniyeh, in late July, then followed by several other attacks that were carried out, the pager and walkie-talkie attack against several Hezbollah leaders in Lebanon, and then some of these raids in Lebanon, and then the killing of the leader of Hezbollah. Obviously, this has all reached a fever pitch at a time when the Biden administration has been working feverishly behind the scenes to advance these fire proposals, both for war in Gaza, as well as the escalating situation in Lebanon. And those efforts have continued to remain elusive. So now as we await concurrent briefings from the Pentagon, the State Department, and the White House, there is still a very large question of how the administration can move forward with its diplomatic efforts at a time when it appears that its potency with the Israeli government and the advice that it's been trying to give behind the scenes has fallen on deaf ears.

We'll see how that unfolds. It didn't deter the Iranians from launching all those ballistic missiles towards Israel over the past few hours.Kayla Tausche, thank you very, very much.
