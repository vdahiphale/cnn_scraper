In just the last few minutes, you see some of the video there. Another airstrike in Beirut. You can obviously also hear it as the sun is setting. These are the latest images of this newest strike, as you can see, sunset in Beirut. Now, we can see the plumes of smoke. And also, you can look at what happened earlier today. And those were strikes in southern Beirut in the middle of the day. You know, extraordinary here. We just see an airplane from the Beirut airport going through that area. And so many have remarked how extraordinary it is that the airport remains open as these strikes are ongoing. Now, Israel's military says its airstrikes a few hours ago targeted Hezbollah's intelligence headquarters. Israel struck the heart of Beirut for the first time in nearly two decades. At least nine people were killed, that's according to the Lebanese Health Ministry. Lebanon's caretaker prime minister made an urgent plea for a ceasefire. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) NAJIB MIKATI, LEBANESE CARETAKER PRIME MINISTER (through translator): We have to look for a ceasefire. That's my message. Stop fighting. We don't need more blood. We don't need more destruction. Why is Israel is not accepting a ceasefire today? (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Now CNN reporters are covering the story from all angles. Jim Sciutto is standing by for us in Tel Aviv, Israel. But we do, of course, want to begin in Beirut where we find our Jomana Karadsheh. I mean, fair to say, look, these recent strikes as you've learned in the last few hours have really been unsettling people.

I mean, what more is the IDF saying about what this targeting is all about, especially given what we just heard from Jomana? The fact that these strikes are in Central Beirut. Some of them just a couple miles, Jim, from the seat of government in Lebanon. JIM SCIUTTO, CNN U.S. CHIEF ANALYST: Yes. Well, listen, as Jomana said, the IDF has identified the target of one of the strikes today in Southern Beirut. They say that it was a Hezbollah intelligence headquarters. They have not yet identified the intended targets of the other strikes. But listen, this is not -- this is not an unfamiliar pattern. Israel picks targets, as they are doing now in Lebanon, in Beirut. We've seen it in Gaza. They describe them as military targets, often, perhaps all the time they are. But they can often be in heavily populated areas where at least the danger to civilians is clear. And oftentimes, you have a large number of civilian casualties. We saw that with the Nasrallah strike that leveled a number of buildings. And that was one, of course, where there was no warning in advance. Listen, what's playing out before us is that Israel is now waging war against Hezbollah really across much of Lebanon now from Beirut to Southern Lebanon from the air and now on the ground in recent days in Southern Lebanon where there have already been firefights and losses for Israeli forces. So this is a multi-front war. It's a dangerous one. And it's one that is expanding, at least on a couple of those fronts, right, certainly in Lebanon, and now concern about an expansion in the direct conflict between Iran and Israel.",

You know that if we speak to so many people, civilians on the ground there, they feel they have no voice, that they are helpless, that the government there in Lebanon is impotent for a variety of very complicated reasons. So what next? They seem to have no voice in this conflict. I know that you have, for years, called out to kind of shake the bonds of whether it was Hamas or Hezbollah. How to do it? EL-MACHNOUK: So one silver lining to what's happening today is that Lebanese, across the political divide, across the sectarian divide, seem to be coming together on three main key points. The first is that they do not want an Israeli territorial invasion of their country. Second is they do not want any Lebanese armed group to fight on behalf of Iran. And they've seen that Iranian expansionism in the region has only led to failed states and death and destruction. And they also want a change in the political governance structure of a government which tries to talk to the international community in one language, saying that they want 1701, but also domestically prevent the Lebanese army from doing its job. And therefore, the main thing that needs to happen today is for the international community to meet the Lebanese people in those three key demands, not through platitudes, not through half-baked diplomacy, but by recognizing that it needs to pay, and put maximum pressure on both Iran and Israel, not to use Lebanese territory in their proxy wars, support the Lebanese army in a way that is unprecedented. I am talking about a full-fledged diplomatic, military and financial support for the Lebanese army.",

EL-MACHNOUK: I have to -- I have to unfortunate -- I do not do this happily, but I have to clarify something for international viewers. There is not one Lebanese citizen that actually takes the foreign minister of Lebanon seriously. The entire political class in Lebanon has been co-opted by Hezbollah in what became known as the Mafia Militia Alliance, a Faustian pact where the political sectarian political class has taken over the state and ravaged it with corruption in return for covering for Hezbollah's military action and its armed wing. Whether it's the foreign minister, whether it's the prime minister, these people are not in power as a result of elections. They are people that are imposed by Hezbollah on the Lebanese people. They have zero credibility as partners of the international community, unlike in 2006, where there was a government that could negotiate with the international community. And that brought about U.N. Security Resolution 1701. That remains to this day, the only way and the only path forward in ensuring that this is the last -- the last of Lebanese-Israeli wars, because we're faced with a choice today. This is either the last of Israeli-Lebanese conflicts, or this is the end and the death of Lebanon as we know it.

Now we reported yesterday that the U.S. intelligence community does believe that around 50 percent of Hezbollah's projectiles have been taken out in these Israeli airstrikes, leaving them of the supply that they once had of things like rockets and missiles and drones. And so that has severely weakened their capabilities here. But as we can see, you know, they have continued striking back. And we saw that, you know, eight IDF soldiers were killed just yesterday in the fighting in Lebanon. And so what the U.S. military is preparing for here is really a conflict that escalates even further than just Israel and Lebanon and actually expands into that war with Iran. And that is what everyone is waiting to see at this point if the escalating tit-for-tat between Israel and Iran actually continues and draws everyone into this large regional war. The U.S. has warships pretty much all over at this point in the Eastern Mediterranean, in the Red Sea, in the Arabian Sea, near Iran to prepare for the possibility that they have to again be intercepting these missiles. And, of course, one of the biggest jobs of the U.S. military, if it comes to it, is to help evacuate U.S. citizens. And that is why there are thousands of U.S. Marines currently in the Eastern Mediterranean preparing for that exact contingency if it becomes necessary for the U.S. to conduct this kind of mass evacuation operation. But for now, there are simply thousands of U.S. troops that are currently in the region, essentially on a heightened standby alert, to come to the aid of Israel if need be by helping them with additional air defenses and, of course, to help defend the many other U.S. troops who are in other parts of the region, including Jordan, Iraq, Syria, who could be vulnerable to attack by Iran's additional proxy groups.",

Israel said it was targeting Hezbollah's intelligence headquarters. At least nine people were killed, that's according to the Lebanese Health Ministry. Now, as the conflict in the Middle East continues to expand to Lebanon and Iran enters the arena, Israel continues its attacks in Gaza. Nearly 100 people have been killed in Israeli airstrikes in Gaza in the past 24 hours alone. Eight people have been killed in an Israeli strike on a school building in Gaza on Wednesday. The IDF alleged the school was being used as a command and control center by Hamas. Earlier in the week, 90 people were killed in multiple Israeli airstrikes. A member of Gaza's civil defense said the strikes began on Tuesday in an area where hundreds of displaced people were taking shelter. Now, clearly, the war in Gaza, as you can see right there on your screens, shows no signs of letting up, even as Israel expands its operation to Lebanon and signals, in fact, retaliation against Iran.

You highlighted all the deaths I heard in your intro over the past week. And what we've really seen the last few weeks is an increase in activity here in Gaza, not a decrease. We continue to face constraints and getting aid in. In August, a million people did not receive food. In September, that number climbed to 1.4 million. At a time when children should be in school, they're not. This would be the second school year in a row that they have missed the opportunity to learn. And the health situation continues to worsen, despite the fact we were able to implement a successful first round of the polio campaign. So the biggest concern amongst all that is we are headed to winter. It will be the second winter now of this conflict.

And in Rafah, in particular, what we're seeing is basically organized crime that's preventing aid from getting to people that are very much in need. So all the constraints that we faced have led us to the situation where we're in now where people aren't getting enough to eat. And there's not enough clean water. There's not enough medicine.
