Republicans see it as an opening salvo in talks with Democrats, but the president says he will not negotiate overpaying the nation's bills. Here with me now is Senator Bernie Sanders, chairman of the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee. Good morning, Senator. Thank you so much for joining me. Let's start on that sweeping GOP bill to raise the debt ceiling. People might not realize it, but you have successfully cut several bipartisan deals during your time in Congress. So what do you think needs to happen to get there now on this debt limit fight? SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (I-VT):  Well, needs -- Dana, what needs to happen are two things. First of all, everybody in Congress has got to understand the United States of America cannot default on its debt. And, by the way, a lot of that debt was accumulated under the Trump administration. You pay your bills, or else there will be cataclysmic economic problems in the United States and around the world, massive unemployment and a major recession. Number two, the president is right. What we need is a clean debt ceiling bill. You pay your bills, and then you can sit down and negotiate what a sensible budget is. What the Republicans are saying in their budget proposal is that, at a time of massive income and wealth inequality, when the richest people are becoming much richer, while working-class people are struggling, what they want to do is to cut programs for nutrition, for education, for health care, throw hundreds and hundreds of thousands of people off the health care they need. Our health care system today is dysfunctional enough. It is expensive enough. You don't throw people off of health care.",

So I would say to my Republican colleagues and some Democrats, do you have the guts to finally stand up to the pharmaceutical industry and make sure that all of our people can get the medicine that they need, and not have a situation where one out of four Americans, Dana, one out of four can't afford the medicine their doctors prescribe? Now, by the way, this bill, to my mind, is only a start. The following week, we're going to bring the major -- three of the major CEOs of the pharmaceutical industry into the committee, and we are going to ask them, among other things, why is the price of insulin for diabetics so high? They have lowered it. I want to make sure -- as a result of public pressure, they lowered insulin costs. I want to make sure that, in fact, translates into lower prices for ordinary people who need it. And I want to see substantially lower prescription drug prices across the board.

We have got a debt ceiling, a debt issue that's going to arise, I guess, now in July, is what the Treasury is saying.

Again, you pass that solution, that solves the problem. But, by the way, where the president's going to get into it with the House is going to be over the appropriations process, because this is not the end of the job. We're moving into appropriations seasons. We have got some major bills to pass, and we have got to be looking at all the spending across this entire government. This is just one piece. And I might remind everybody, Dana, that, in the last 30 years,the only real significant spending reforms that have been negotiated by Democrats and Republicans came out of debt ceiling negotiations. President Biden himself said that this was what you have to do back in 2011. Nancy Pelosi said in 2019 you can't do a no-strings-attached deal. Again, Kevin McCarthy and House Republicans have given you the solution. The Schumer Senate should take it up and pass it.
