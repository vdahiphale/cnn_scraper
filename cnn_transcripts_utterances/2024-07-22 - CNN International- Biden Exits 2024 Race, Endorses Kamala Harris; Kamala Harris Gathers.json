I'm Amara Walker. This is CNN Newsroom. Just ahead, the race for the White House turns on its head. Vice President Kamala Harris works to rally support behind her campaign after President Joe Biden drops out of the race. We will have full coverage this hour. Plus, the Secret Service in the spotlight. The agency's director is set to face tough questions on Capitol Hill over the assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump. And feeling the heat, the Paris Olympics are just days away, as the city faces climbing temperatures. We will show you how organizers are aiming to keep the games cool. An event that both seemed inevitable and also impossible to imagine has happened. Joe Biden pulled out of the race for reelection on Sunday, finally acknowledging, what so many in his own party have been saying ever since his disastrous debate performance, that it was in the best interest of his party and country for him to drop out of the race. President Biden swiftly endorsed his Vice President Kamala Harris to take his place on the ticket. Harris raised almost $50 million in a matter of hours Sunday, and Democratic donors are set to be celebrating the passing of the torch to a new generation of leaders. Now, it's unclear if any other Democrats will challenge her, but many Democrats are already saying Harris should be the nominee. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

He said that he planned to speak when he posted that letter on social media yesterday, saying that he was bowing out of the race. We still have not heard from the White House when exactly he will return back to Washington, D.C. But, it is his intention to speak very soon about his decision to drop out.But, what you've also seen the President and his allies and campaign do is really mobilize around Vice President Kamala Harris. The campaign apparatus itself has started shifting towards Harris. They've changed accounts on social media to be from Biden HQ to Kamala HQ. They've shifted their fundraising towards the Vice President, with one source saying that since yesterday alone, they raised $49.6 million for her campaign. The President is also later in the week was scheduled to attend some fundraisers out on the West Coast. It's unclear how exactly those will proceed. But still, many questions going forward about whether Vice President Kamala Harris can actually secure this Democratic nomination. She has earned support from many prominent Democrats, but some in the party have still said that they want to see an open process play out before that Democratic Convention in August. But, for President Biden's part, he, within 30 minutes of bowing out of the race, endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris, making his belief clear that he does think that she should be the next Democratic nominee.

They were happy to bash Biden and continue to argue that he was unfit for office, that he was too old, that he was, as the former President likes to say, too sleepy, and now the situation is different.

Of course, there is no rule that says if you choose to forego an election bid that you cannot keep your term going in office. But, today, we expect that Representative Nancy Mace, a Republican from South Carolina, is going to introduce a resolution to force this question. She said in a tweet last night quote, \"If Joe Biden does not have the cognitive ability to seek reelection, he does not have the cognitive ability to serve the remainder of his term. Tomorrow, I will introduce a resolution calling for Kamala Harris to invoke the 25th Amendment and assume the duties of the acting President.\"Meanwhile, Democrats are coalescing around Harris, arguing that it is time for Democrats to put differences aside to work hard to try to get her elected to be the 47th President of the United States. Just a few minutes ago, we saw Peter Aguilar, a member of Democratic leadership in the House, releasing a statement, saying he was going to do everything he could to ensure that she wins this November. We still have not seen statements from Hakeem Jeffries or Chuck Schumer, the leading Democrats in the House and Senate respectively. But, our colleague, Dana Bash reporting last night that they don't want to get ahead of their members. They want to give voters and Democratic lawmakers an opportunity to really coalesce on their own around Harris. They don't want to be perceived as forcing her as the heir apparent. But, obviously, we're going to be watching over the course of the next 48 hours if that starts to shift, as lawmakers return to Washington. It was really remarkable, because in the days leading up to this announcement, I had been talking to Democrats around the clock, and even some of the frontline members in difficult swing districts had been arguing that what they wanted to see was Harris quickly become the heir apparent, because they argued uncertainty was just not something that was going to help them in their reelection.
