Michael Cohen was in the hot seat and under pressure. Donald Trump's former fixer facing hours of grilling on cross-examination from defense lawyers yesterday. Their goal, it seemed, was to paint Cohen as a liar bent on revenge. Attorney Todd Blanche at one point confronting Cohen with how his tone regarding Trump has evolved, shall we say, over the years. He asked Cohen about comments that were made back in 2015. Quote, you said he's a man who cares about his country, right, Blanche asked. I said that, Cohen responded. And later, Blanche continued: And at the time, you weren't lying, right? Cohen responding: At the time, I was knee-deep in the cult of Donald Trump. Trump's lawyers then trying to contrast that by asking Cohen about recent insults and taunts he's leveled at Trump, including Cohen saying, quote, people will not be satisfied until the man is sitting -- this man is sitting inside the cell. Outside the courtroom, Trump appeared with a group of Republican allies standing behind him, tried to project confidence during the cross-examination, while again criticizing the gag order. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT &amp; 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Today, we had a very -- I think a very good day in court. You see what's happening. You have to report it, but this I can't talk about it too much. But I think was a very, very good day. Can you believe I've been in for five weeks instead of campaigning it's a shame.

All the events that led up to him deciding he was going to take a plea deal and start talking to prosecutors. But, of course, the defense getting a chance to try to undermine his credibility at -- what was your sense of how today played potentially for the jury, but also in the court of public opinion?",

He had potential VP picks outside the courtroom and he had the speaker of the house which was very stark, not only because of the stature of his position, but also because Johnson is someone who's really painted himself as this person with traditional values, and yet he's outside this courtroom for allegations of someone who is delivered hush money payments to an adult film star.

But you're absolutely right in saying that loyalty is a biggest test of Donald Trump looks for when he's looking for anyone on to work with, but particularly for his VP candidates. And I think he's known to be someone who takes track of people who stand up for him, people who fight for him.I think that's exactly what he's doing with some of these potentials VP candidates that we saw yesterday -- Doug Burgum, Vivek Ramaswamy, Byron Donalds. These are certainly things that he's going to be testing, especially because we saw Mike Pence, obviously, broke hugely with Donald Trump in the final days of his presidency.",

MAX FOSTER, CNN INTERNATIONAL ANCHOR &amp; CORRESPONDENT:  Well, a little pro-Israel supporters weren't happy about the fact that that weapon was withheld obviously, the main concern is how be used in or Rafah what we've got here is, you know, a president who's saying, we are showing his long-term commitment, if you like, to supporting Israel.

We will now go to court on June 20th. CNN projecting West Virginia Governor Jim Justice as the state's Republican primary winner. This sets Justice up as the favorite to succeed retiring Democratic Senator Joe Manchin. That is, of course, a seat that Republicans hoped plan to flip from red to blue in November. CNN also projecting that Angela Alsobrooks will win Maryland's Democratic Senate primary. She defeated three Representative David Trone, and will face off against former Republican Governor Larry Hogan in what is likely to be a pretty competitive general election in that blue state in November.

So it's going to be quite a busy day today you can see from the map again, we've got several different regions. We're keeping an eye on. In addition to that, it's also just the pesky brain showers that were dealing with across portions of the Northeast and the Ohio Valley. But the real active weather right now is the area down in Florida. We've got that line of strong to severe thunderstorms already making its way sliding into Daytona Beach, eventually into Tampa and Orlando. This tornado watch where you see in red is valid until 11:00 a.m. Eastern Time today. But it's one of three total areas that we were looking at the potential for some severe storms that does include Florida, also this area around the Carolinas, and then the target point really is going to be the central portion of the U.S. Damaging winds, large hail and tornadoes possible for the this particular regions as we go through the rest of the day and another concern is going to be flooding. That's going to be focused mainly along the Gulf Coast here because this is what were anticipating a lot of rain over the next several days. In fact, through Saturday, take a look at this. You've got that wide swath of about three to five inches of rain. The key here though is that grounded has already saturated for a lot of these areas. So adding even more is just going to exacerbate the flooding potential. So that's why on Thursday, you can see a lot of these target areas, but yes, even a moderate risk that's a level -- at a level three out of four. Same thing for Friday, a very similar area where were going to see the bulk of that rain, and we talked about the ground is saturated. Look at how much train has already fallen in just the last 72 hours. So, Kasie, you've got some of these areas that have already had four to six inches, now you're adding another three to five on top of it. So flooding is going to be concerned going into the weekend.",
