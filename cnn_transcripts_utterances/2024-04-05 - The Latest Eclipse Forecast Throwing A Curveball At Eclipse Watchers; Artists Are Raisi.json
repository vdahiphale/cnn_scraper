      "sentences": "A total solar eclipse like this one will not be visible from the United States again until 2044,so 20 years from now. That`s why we`re seeing so many people scrambling to try to find the best weather and get in position to see this on Monday. There are a few other things that make this eclipse really unique and the first is the length of time for totality. That`s the moment when the moon completely blocks out the sun and that`s when day will literally turn to night, so dark that the stars come out, nocturnal animals come out. That is how dark it gets and so that moment of totality for this eclipse is much longer than it was in previous eclipses. At the longest point it`ll be about four minutes and 30 seconds, so that`s a good amount of time to really get to soak in the power of nature in our solar system. Another really unique thing about this eclipse is the fact that it just happens to coincide with a period of peak activity on the surface of the sun, so during that moment of totality things like solar flares or coronal mass ejections are much more likely than in previous eclipses and could just make for some really cool viewing. But of course with any eclipse, but this one in particular, the weather is always a factor and unfortunately it`s not looking like it`s going to cooperate in large parts of the United States along this path of totality. Texas and Arkansas, really the weather not looking great there, but places like southern Missouri and Indianapolis and upstate New York and New England, the weather`s looking pretty good there. So as always before an eclipse, the eclipse chasers, the diehards are trying to find that best weather viewing condition so that they can see this eclipse because again, if you don`t see this one it`s going to be 20 years before you get to see something like this if you live in the United States.

      "sentences": "Pop quiz, hot shot.Which one of these artists has won the most Grammys? Taylor Swift, Shakira, Beyonce or Stevie Wonder? Queen B, Beyonce is the correct answer here. She`s the most awarded artist in Grammy history with a record 32 wins. Music is an art and it`s so important to so many of us, right? But what happens when artificial intelligence replicates or replaces our beloved artists` voices? It might be a good topic of discussion for you and your friends. Does AI change the way you perceive the songs and voices you love? How does it change the music industry? Who all does it impact? Is AI a threat to the music industry or what good might it bring? More than 200 artists including Billie Eilish, Stevie Wonder, Jon Bon Jovi, Katy Perry and more say yes, artificial intelligence is a threat to the music industry. In an open letter organized by the nonprofit Artist Rights Alliance, these artists are asking AI developers, tech companies, music platforms and digital music services to stop the use of artificial intelligence, saying that it devalues the rights of human artists. CNN`s Entertainment Correspondent Elizabeth Wagmeister has more on the artists` growing concerns. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

      "sentences": "This is the biggest show of support that we have seen from A-listers against AI, which ofcourse is a growing concern in Hollywood and beyond. Stars like Katy Perry, Stevie Wonder, Jon Bon Jovi, also the estates of Frank Sinatra and Bob Marley are calling to stop AI from replacing human artists. They say that voice cloning will essentially take away work and take away compensation from singers, songwriters, rights holders. Now, this is not an issue that is going away anytime soon, right? The technology is here to stay. And now what`s going to happen in Hollywood is what do we do with it? How do you protect these artists? We do see some legislation happening. This is an issue that is going to Congress. We just saw Tennessee was the first state to pass an act to bring some rights and protections to the artists. But we also have artists who appreciate AI. Paul McCartney recently said that he actually loves the technology because last year the Beatles were able to release what he says is their last song by taking a track that was recorded by John Lennon decades ago and using it for a new song. So again, very innovative technology, but can`t take away from the work and the bottom line for all of these artists. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
