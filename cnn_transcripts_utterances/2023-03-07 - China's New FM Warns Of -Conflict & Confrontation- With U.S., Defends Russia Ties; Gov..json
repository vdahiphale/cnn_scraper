      "sentences": "Well, certainly there's a possibility of direct military confrontation. The United States and China are facing each other down in the South China Sea over Taiwan, in the East China Sea.There are such military confrontations. They would come from an accident. They would come from escalation that went wrong and was meant to deter or bluster. The United States is vastly more powerful than China is militarily. But I think the real point here is, can we see any areas of cooperation? Which are very important between the two countries. Remember that the United States and China, right now, have record levels of mutual trade. There are a lot of American citizens that depend on Chinese goods. There are a lot of American companies that depend on access to the Chinese market. And the Chinese, and the Chinese economy and their growth depends on that interaction as well. The Chinese government is increasingly saying that we're not going to be able to maintain that level of engagement with this kind of mistrust and confrontation with the Americans in areas that are important to China trying to contain the Chinese. PHILLIP: Well, what can be done then to cool things off? I mean, it seems like things are heading in the exact opposite direction. The United States is warning China, don't get involved with Ukraine, warning of really severe consequences. Those are their characterizations. What can we do at this point to bring the temperature down?",

      "sentences": "Well, first, the easiest thing is a lot more direct engagement between high-level official on both sides.Part of the reason that the relationship is where it is right now is because, for three years, with Covid and with China's Zero Covid Policies, they just weren't traveling. I had any first meeting with a high-level Chinese delegation that isn't the Chinese ambassador to Washington just a few weeks ago in Munich at the security conference. They - I wasn't going to China. They weren't coming to the U.S. And so that problem is endemic among senior Chinese officials. Because when you spend that little time talking to each other, you start to stereotype. You start to believe what your own colleagues are saying 100 percent of the time. You start believing your own media. So we need to get that engagement going again across all levels of the U.S. and the Chinese government because these are two of the most powerful countries in the world. There also has to be - and I think it's useful that, after the balloon was shot down - it was very unfortunate that when the secretary of defense tried to call China, they didn't pick up the phone, the minister of defense. But the conversation that happened between the secretary of state in the U.S. and his counterpart in China did have the Chinese admitting that the foreign ministry didn't know that the balloon was off course, should have called the Americans. The Americans were saying, yes, it was knocked off course by the wind. You didn't intend to do that. That was useful. McCarthy - Kevin McCarthy saying that he's not going to make a trip to Taiwan, which would be an unnecessary provocation of the Chinese, and the Taiwanese don't want him to go, they don't want that problem, that's useful. I think the most important point is that the provocations in this relationship should be necessary provocations, that they should be in places where the national security of both countries is actually at stake. They shouldn't be just to put points on the board politically.",

Bush, and Democratic strategist, Maria Cardona.Always good to see both of you. Scott, I'll start with you. This was very popular in Florida for DeSantis at least when he was running for re-election the last time around. But just to give the audience a taste of the culture war issues we're talking about, he was talking about a, quote, \"biomedical security state,\" banning drag shows, banning treatment for trans kids, even banning certain majors, like what you can study at public universities. I mean, my curiosity is, is this a platform that can win where Republicans need to win in the suburbs and in a general election population in this country?",

He took counties and areas that had never voted Republican and turned them red.Whatever he's doing down there and the way he's presenting it is popular with the voters of Florida. Whether they're rural, suburban, urban, Independent, Republican, he's got a wide-governing coalition. And that's not me talking. That's the voting results from the last election. The things he's talking about today, I think it's actually going to be pretty popular in a Republican primary. And I think the real dividing line between him and Trump or anyone else is anyone can complain about the stuff you're worried about, but I'm the one who finishes it. I think that's where you'll see his campaign messaging go.",

It's popular in a Republican primary, but I think it remains to be seen.And by the way, I think Florida is more - you would probably agree with me, a red state than a purple state at this moment. Maria, I mean that question to you. I mean, are Democrats concerned, just given how widespread these culture war platforms are? It's not just DeSantis, but it's a lot of the other candidates, too. Are Democrats concerned this could resonate with enough voters that it would give Republicans an edge in the next presidential?",

      "sentences": "Absolutely. Democrats have to be concerned because it's the only way that we're going to be fighting against what I believe is an incredibly destructive agenda that Ron DeSantis is putting out there.And look, you know, Scott's right. He won in Florida. But to your point, I don't believe Florida's representative of the mainstream America anymore. And frankly, Democrats did not really compete in the governor's race in Florida, you know, if we're going to be truthful about it. What I believe is going to be Ron DeSantis' big challenge is that, yes, this is working in the Republican primary. This is working with the MAGA extremist wing of the Republican Party. But he is so obsessed with fighting \"woke,\" that he's asleep at the switch about the other issues that mainstream, common-sense Americans, even other Republicans, know are going to be the issues that will decide a general election. That is not book-banning. That is not focusing on going against and attacking the LBGTQ community. That is not whitewashing American history so that white people can feel better about something that we absolutely need to learn about, and our kids absolutely need to learn about. And I think all of those issues are going to be front and center in a general election. And it still remains to be seen whether Ron DeSantis can even make it out of Florida in a Republican primary. And I know that's something that Scott and other Republicans who are scared about Donald Trump becoming their nominee, as they should be, think that he will. But he is still not a - not someone who has proven that he can be appealing outside of Florida.",

Ron DeSantis does very well with donors and college-educated voters perhaps. Do you see him making inroads with the kind of Trump wing of the party that might be necessary? Maybe it's not necessary even to get through the primary, but to win a general election?",
