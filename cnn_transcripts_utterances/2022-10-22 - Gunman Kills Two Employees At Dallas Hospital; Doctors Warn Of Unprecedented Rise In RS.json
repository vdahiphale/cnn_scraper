The top stories, surging cases of a respiratory illness are forcing some hospitals to create tent cities just to deal with all the patients as health officials say they have seen more cases now than in the past two years. Plus, an underground network sending abortion pills from Mexico to women in states where the procedure is now illegal. And China's former president seated right next to the current one is shockingly yanked from the room as the Communist Party Congress Party comes to an end. You're in the CNN NEWSROOM. And first tonight, breaking news, a deadly shooting in a hospital in Dallas, Texas. Details are still coming in to CNN, but so far police are confirming that at least two people are dead, both employees at the hospital. Now I want to get right now to CNN's Camila Bernal and CNN national security analyst Juliette Kayyem. All right, Camila, what are you hearing so far? CAMILA BERNAL, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Hey, Paula. So this shooting took place at Methodist Dallas Medical Center. And according to authorities, no one else is at risk at the moment because that shooter was taken into custody. Now it is interesting because this shooter was essentially shot by a health system police officer. So this is something that was handled within the hospital, but we know that this suspect shot and killed two of the hospital employees. He was confronted by the health system police officer, and that officer shot. And that's how they were able to arrest the suspect. He was taken into custody and taken to another hospital. The health system, of course, putting out a statement, I want to read part of it, where they say, \"The Methodist Health System Family is heartbroken at the loss of two of our beloved team members. Our entire organization is grieving this unimaginable tragedy. During this devastating time, we want to ensure that our patients and employees that Methodist Dallas Medical Center is safe and that there is no ongoing threat. Our prayers are with our lost coworkers and their families as well as the entire Methodist family.\" So of course this is going to be difficult for the hospital system as it is two employees that were killed today -- Paula.",

We don't know the specifics yet so I'm going to be very careful here but the questions you would want answered are who in fact were the victims, were they known to the suspect or were they random victims, where were they in the hospital.If they are on the seventh floor and not the first floor, someone was looking for either them or the place where they were working. And that's what our reporters are figuring out as well, as sort of, you know, what's the narrative here behind a very not unusual shooting, that happens a lot in the U.S., but at a hospital where someone is not -- did not just come in shooting.

So if I get RSV, I will get it again. But what we do know is that kids who get RSV, then when they get it again the next year or two years later tend to have milder cases. So there is some protection from getting multiple RSV infections back to back to back. And of course we're missing that.And the other thing is, adults are actually also very dependent on getting multiple exposures to RSV back to back to back, which they haven't been doing. And so we actually expect that what we think is going on as one of the drivers of these higher case numbers might be adults who haven't been getting exposed to RSV in the last couple of years are providing a larger reservoir of symptomatic patients than what we're normally is seeing and so that's driving more infection in kids.",

The nurses have to keep their noses and mouths suctioned to keep the mucus out of the way so they can breathe. These kids are often in the hospital two or three or four days. Some kids can be in the hospital for one to two weeks. So that takes up a hospital bed for pretty significantly period of time.We're not talking about in and out overnight with IV fluids. These kids are in the hospital for days, and so staffing really is key with RSV season. And as you mentioned, we just came out of enterovirus season and we saw more enterovirus activity than we were used to. And now with all these RSV and if you look in the southern United States, we're already starting to see flu cases take a really big high jump. And so we're really a little bit concerned about this overlapping of all these different viruses, because usually RSV comes a little bit later and then flu comes very nicely after. They take their turn. But it doesn't look like they're going to be doing that this year. And so I think we're really worried about pediatric hospital capacity over the next several months.",

We have a vaccine for it.And because flu season is starting early, we want people to get vaccinated as soon as possible. And really everyone over six months of age that is eligible should be vaccinated as soon as possible against flu. EDWARDS: And I want to make one last point. So I've been seeing a lot of misunderstanding. This is a respiratory virus. Why do I need to wash my hands? I don't understand. So not all respiratory viruses are spread the same. So influenza, SARS COV-2, these are spread by a droplet. SARS COV-2 can also be spread by aerosol. But some respiratory viruses like rhino virus and RSV really are spread by that close contact with the respiratory secretions. And the virus can live on your hands for 30 minutes, an hour. So it really is important to be washing your hands frequently during RSV season. And what might be a minor cold to me or maybe I think it's allergies could be a devastating illness in a young infant so we really do encourage people who aren't feeling to keep their hands to themselves and don't kiss those cute babies.",

Darrell Brooks, he is the man accused of killing six people in Wisconsin after driving through a Christmas Parade. He is representing himself despite having no discernible legal background, but that is his right. And so far, he has repeatedly disrupted the Court proceedings by arguing with the Judge, having outbursts and trying to intimidate witnesses. Look, is it possible for a defendant who is representing himself to create a mistrial due to this kind of conduct? And then what happens?

And ultimately, he was convicted and is serving time in a supermax prison. And I think that that's likely the result here. There is an old adage that a person who represents themselves has a fool for a client, and I think that that is likely going to be the result here, because he's not going to make objections at the right time. He's going to waive a lot of issues and really the sort of mistrial that he is going to create is a situation where, potentially if the judge shows that she believes he is a danger, she said outside the presence of the jury, she is scared of the defendant. You know, as long as she is careful about how she conducts herself in front of the jury, I don't think a Court of Appeals is going to want another Judge have to go through this again.",

He's all but assured on Sunday to be re anointed for an unprecedented third term as China's Supreme Leader, setting himself up to be ruler for life.Today marks the official close at the 20th Party Congress, China's most important political meeting in decades. This is a highly scripted and choreographed Communist Party event that happens once every five years. But there was a bizarre and astonishing moment that was caught on camera by journalists in that ceremony room. See in the video, the man seated next to Xi is China's former top leader, Hu Jintao, after several confusing moments, he is led out of the room escorted by two men, a staff member holding his arm. He appears reluctant to leave. On his way out, he is seen saying something to Xi and then patting, Premier Li Keqiang on the shoulder. Now Chinese politics is incredibly opaque. We'll never know the true circumstances around this incident and it has not been reported at all by Chinese media. But this dramatic moment has already set off a firestorm of speculation overseas. People are wondering, was this because of a health issue or was it a political statement? Some analysts are saying regardless of the reason, it is a symbolic moment. It shows the exit of a man who represented collective rule, while Xi Jinping, well he represents strongman rule. Since he took over in 2012, he has purged his rivals, he has crushed dissent, and he has reasserted Communist Party control over every aspect of Chinese society. Tomorrow, we will see who Xi's closest advisers will be, but we already got a lot of hints today. We learned that Premier Li Keqiang and another top leader who are not seen as having close ties to Xi, well, they are set to retire. What's clear is that Xi is going to stack the top leadership positions with his loyalists. So in the third term, expect to see Xi Jinping double down on his iron rule over China, that means a more authoritarian China at home and a more aggressive China abroad. Selina Wang, CNN, Hong Kong.
