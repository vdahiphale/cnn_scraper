      "sentences": "Yeah. We are getting some details. It's kind of complicated because it's deep in the weeds in international banking and finance. And frankly, it's never been done before. After Russia invaded Ukraine, Russian assets were seized, right, a lot of those assets seized in Europe, total value about $300 billion. So, the aim here is to take the profits from that, not the goods themselves, the profits from that, and use them to give a $50 billion loan to Ukraine. It's a loan, right? Ukraine has to pay it back.Here are some of the catches and the final details that the G7 leaders will be figuring out. Who is going to put up the other money over and above the predicted profits from this $300 billion that's just sitting there, and who is essentially going to catch the can if Ukraine defaults on payments? And it looks like it's going to be split between the United States and the European Union. How it's split, precisely the mechanics of how it's all underwritten, if you will. And that's what will be hammered out today. But, in principle, the deal is there and done for President Zelenskyy to know that by the end of the year he will be $50 billion better off in a loan that is being funded. This is something he has pushed for, for a long time, which is to use those seized Russian assets, while Russia is attacking Ukraine, to use them for a good use, rather than just letting them sit there.",

Frankly, I think it would be more helpful still if the U.S. and Europe were to agree to send Ukraine all of the $300 billion of frozen Russian assets. I don't see why Russia gets to keep its money when it so blatantly violates international law and invades its neighbors. But, this is better than nothing, and it's certainly better than just giving Ukraine the interest alone on a $300 billion because this is something that the U.S. Treasury conceived to use that interest to fund a larger loan and provide $50 billion.So, that's in the ballpark of this year's U.S. aid package. So, that's a significant amount of money that will help Ukraine to defend itself and help Ukraine to rebuild. But, it's not going to obviate the need for more aid from the U.S. and Europe in the future. And we're going to have these major political fights going forward.",

But, in terms of how do you actually get Hamas to agree to the Biden plan, I don't think anybody has a clue. I think the U.S. has tried its best by trying to apply pressure through Egypt and Qatar and other states that have relations with Hamas, and all that pressure hasn't worked, because we saw just a few days ago,The Wall Street Journal reported on the messages sent by Yahya Sinwar, who is the senior Hamas leader in Gaza, basically saying that he sees all of these Palestinian casualties, these -- this horrific loss of life among civilians as being to Hamas' advantage because it puts pressure on Israel, and he is not going to give up because he thinks that he can still wait out the Israeli offensive. So, he is not going to agree to the terms that Israel is offering, backed by much of the rest of the world. So, I just don't see much hope for a ceasefire. Sadly, that's terrible news because it means unfortunately that the suffering will continue in Gaza.",

U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken traveled to Italy from a tour of the Middle East, where his latest diplomatic push has so far failed to secure a ceasefire and hostage deal between Israel and Hamas. Hamas is demanding numerous changes to the proposal, currently on the table, which is backed by the UN Security Council. Blinken says work will continue and he'll try to bridge the gaps between the two sides. CNN's Oren Liebermann joining us now live from Tel Aviv, Israel. Good to see you, Oren.

      "sentences": "Well, Secretary of State Antony Blinken wasn't looking to seal a ceasefire and get it done, and voila, in his short trip in the region, where he met with Egyptians, Israelis, Jordanians, and Qataris, but he was trying to make progress for a brief period while here. It seemed like that might be the case.Hamas finally responded to a proposal that the U.S. publicly backed from President Joe Biden after 12 days. But, that response was, according to Qatari officials, neither an acceptance nor a rejection of the deal. Instead, it's a framing of the deal, according to Blinken. They have requested numerous changes. Some are workable. Some are not. And now, he says it's the job to see if there is a window here to move forward and to bridge the gaps between the two countries, between -- rather, between Israel and Hamas. Israel, however, framed it as a Hamas rejection of the proposal on the table. The question, where do you go from here? Hamas says they had responded positively to what's on the table and showed a willingness to negotiate. They insist their changes are insignificant, though a source familiar with the talks said one of the changes they had proposed was that the timeline for a permanent ceasefire, and that remains the key sticking point as it has been for so many months now and in so many different efforts to get a ceasefire in place. Israel insists and has insisted, according to Israeli officials, that the proposal on the table allows them to continue pursuing their war goals, whereas Hamas is looking for an end to the war, a permanent ceasefire as part of this proposal. With the proposal on the table, this three-phased approach, there is a permanent ceasefire but only in phase two, and there is no specific timeline to get there. So, it is stumbling upon the same sort of issue where it has been before. And the issue, Fredricka, is there is no clear path to get past that. The hope was that a UN Security Council resolution would put pressure on Hamas along with the Egyptians and the Qataris, and it's just not clear that that's the case. Meanwhile, Hamas insists it is Blinken who should put pressure on the Israelis. So, even as these ceasefire negotiations are ongoing, there is clearly an effort here trying to frame the narrative as blaming the other side for the failure in negotiations, if that is indeed what happens.",

He will be meeting with Republican lawmakers to discuss the upcoming election as well as their legislative priorities if he wins the White House again. He meets first with House Republicans, most of whom are already fierce allies. But, his meeting with senators could be more frosty. This will be Trump's first face-to-face meeting with Republican leader Mitch McConnell since Trump left the presidency, and several Republican senators have not yet committed to attending the meeting.Let's go now to CNN's Lauren Fox on Capitol Hill with a very latest. Good morning to you, Lauren. So, I know House Republicans are treating this like a party. Matt Gaetz says it would be like a pep rally, in fact, but Trump's relationship with the Senate GOP, a little bit more frosty. Explain.",

      "sentences": "Yeah, Fredricka. I mean, it really depends on each member. Some of these senators who are in the Republican conference, they have had an ongoing relationship with Donald Trump, traveling to Mar-a-Lago, trying to spend more time with the President, having an ongoing phone and texting conversation with the former President. That is all part of the dynamic when Donald Trump walks into the room today.Yes, his relationship with Mitch McConnell has been icy. The two of them have famously not spoken since the election was certified back in 2021, and that happened, of course, just hours after the January 6 insurrection on Capitol Hill that at the time Mitch McConnell said Donald Trump bore responsibility for. Now, Mitch McConnell has said in the past that he will support the Republican nominee. He has made it clear he plans to support Donald Trump because he has been selected by the voters to be the Republican nominee. And McConnell actually addressed this yesterday at a press conference, saying that this has been his stance all along, and he will look forward to hearing from former President Donald Trump in the meeting today at the National Republican Senatorial Committee headquarters. But, another dynamic when Trump walks into this room today is going to be the fact that there are a couple of people in the audience who could potentially be his Vice President, and that includes Senator J.D. Vance of Ohio, Senator Marco Rubio. It's going to be really interesting to see whether or not Donald Trump gives any sense of where he is leaning when it comes to that decision in the room today. That was something that Senator Tommy Tuberville, a close ally of Donald Trump's, told me. He was sort of looking for trying to read the tea leaves once they get in the room later today. Now, the first meeting, as you mentioned, will be with House Republicans. That's beginning in just a little over an hour at this point. That is expected to be more of an easy audience for Donald Trump. He has continued having close relationships with many House Republicans, including the House Speaker Mike Johnson. I think it'll be a really interesting dynamic to see whether or not he talks more about the campaign strategy, whether he talks about what he wants to see legislatively. As Thom Tillis put it to me yesterday, it's probably a little naive to assume that Donald Trump is going to spend much time talking about the substance of what he wants to do after he is President, given the fact that the focus should probably be on winning the election first.

That was Republican David Joyce of Ohio. But, what we saw in this fight was Republicans demanding that Garland comply with a subpoena, the subpoena demanding audio recordings of an interview that the Special Counsel Robert Hur did with President Biden over Biden's handling of classified documents. Of course, in that report that Hur released months ago, it details how Joe Biden responded some questions, question about whether Biden could have even been prosecuted over this because he believed the jury would view him as a sympathetic elderly man with a poor memory.Now, there was a transcript that was released that the Democrats and the Justice Department believe are sufficient to satisfy Republican demands. But, Republicans one of the audio tapes as well, something Democrats believe will be used for political purposes. The Justice Department contended that releasing that audio tape essentially would impair the ability to go ahead and interview witnesses in separate investigations in the future, perhaps witnesses would not want to come forward if they were concerned that audio would release publicly or released to Congress. But, even as this vote happened today, some Republicans called for prosecution of Merrick Garland, and even some said he should go to prison. REP. MARJORIE TAYLOR GREENE (R-GA): Is Merrick Garland above the law? I mean, I thought the whole argument is that no one is above the law, and now that we've held him in contempt of Congress, he should be prosecuted by the Department of Justice, and he deserves the exact same fate as Peter Navarro and Steve Bannon.

Now, on top of that, the White House has asserted executive privilege on those audio tapes, and the position with the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel is that the -- if the President asserts executive privilege and they affirm that it was correct in this regard, that -- essentially, that is the correct position of the executive branch.So, this is essentially a dispute between the executive branch and the legislative branch. And ultimately, if this gets resolved, it would have to be by the courts to determine whether Congress has the right to that audio. If this plays out in the courts, it's going to take months and months and months to resolve, certainly after the November election. So, ultimately, that's how it could play out.

I mean, it's just incredible the amount of rain that we've already gotten, and four to eight inches of rain is nothing to sneeze at. I mean, look at some of these totals over the last 48 hours, huge swaths of 10 inches or more of rain. We're talking about some places got up to 20 inches of rain. Fort Lauderdale officially a foot of rain, Miami, nine inches, Sarasota, more than seven. In Fort Lauderdale, just in one day, we got nine and a half inches of rain. Not only is that an entire month's worth of rain, but it makes it the eighth wettest day on record. Period. So, just incredible prolific amounts of rain.Still looking at flood risk as we go through the day today. It's a moderate level three of four where we can still get downpours because we have this stationary front chest part and all this tropical moisture that just keeps feeding in it. That's why we've had some of this flooding rain as we went through the last couple of days and it continues through the day today. As we go into the weekend, it starts to ease up a little bit and will start to dry out a little bit more. But, again, until then, through Friday, we're looking at another four to eight inches of rain in this area. Some totals up to 10 inches possible, again, from Fort Pierce down to Miami and then back to Fort Myers. Now, we do know that our rain is getting more intense. A warmer atmosphere holds more moisture. That means we can squeeze out heavier downpours. And we see a little bit of an uphill trend here with that for here your average hourly rainfall rates in Miami since 1970. And that's a trend really for a lot of the country. When you look at the southeast, on our heaviest one percent of days, those heavy rainfall days are 37 percent heavier, the rain again just squeezing out in larger deluges. If you look at the northeast, you're looking at a 60 percent change in heavier rain. And again, what we find especially is that we have more extreme hourly rainfall rates, right? So, if you look at all the rain that we get in a year, maybe the yearly rain isn't going up. But, what happens is, is we get a lot all at once. We're changing the extremes. Heavy rain is heavier and droughts can become more extreme. All because we're fueling that atmosphere even more, Fred.",

That includes, of course, training of the troops as well. This will also include, he says, a financial pledge. So, we may expect to hear more details on that at the end of this two-day meeting, and of course, that will all push ahead to Washington in July.This is about NATO institutionalizing, making more predictable aid to Ukraine. Of course, the backdrop to this, number one, is that European countries in particular are looking to what might happen in November in the U.S. election. Perhaps a return by former President Trump would aid to Ukraine more uncertain. So, they're trying to enshrine this ahead of time. And secondly, looking at what happened between October and April, the delay in U.S. aid to Ukraine because of the wrangling in Congress and the untold damage that that did to Ukraine's fortunes on the frontlines, Jens Stoltenberg saying that he wants to avoid those gaps and delays in future.
