They now appear set to take the biggest number of seats in France's parliament after today's first round of elections in a stinging defeat for Macron. It also has the potential to change the relationship between the U.S. and one of its closest allies. Macron shocked everyone and called a surprise election just weeks before Paris is set to host the world for the Olympic Games.

What he said is this. Our objective is clear, prevent the National Rally from having an absolute majority in the second round from dominating the national assembly.Now, according to projections we have the National Rally Party, the far-right party, would get somewhere between 230 to 280 seats in the new parliament. They will need 289 seats if they want to have a majority. So it looks like the other parties involved here are going to form a blockade, tell their voters not to vote for the right, the extreme right-wing, and hopefully get their candidates in. Now that doesn't mean that there's going to be a walk in the park for Mr. Macron because in fact he's going to have to rule -- he's the president for the next three years, he's going to have to stay in office and have a parliament that basically is of the opposite party. There won't be a majority of the opposite party but they'll have a parliament that will be working against him at every stage of the game. A hung parliament essentially, something I call the cohabitation here in France. That means that basically power sharing. But Macron has got powers. He has power over defense, he has powers over foreign policy, but the purse strings are controlled from here at the prime minister's office. And so it'll depend on who becomes the prime minister.

You can make promises. You can have also the extravagant pledges in your manifestos. But when you actually get into office, it's a whole lot more difficult. And that that could be a way of exposing, you know, some of the contradictions of their programs and what power and the exercise of power really means. But, you know, if that is the answer, then it's a big gamble because it's not at all sure that that is what would happen at the end of three years in office. And I think, you know, before we even get to that point, we're looking at really a lot of uncertainty. We don't even know if Le Pen's party can form a government. We don't know if she would even want to try and form a government unless she wins the minority -- majority, sorry. If she does win, she might not even want to go to power.

But I think for him, to be -- whether he really wants to go ahead and form a government which would be unbelievably unstable because if you had -- if you don't have a majority the opposition will bring you down. So you can imagine a period of time where you have one prime minister choice, form a government, then the president own choice to form a government, and these keep falling.

It's unclear if it's just several facilities such as Stuttgart, which you just showed, an army garrison barracks in Bavaria, or whether it's across the European theater.Here is how the army describes Force Protection Condition Charlie. It is -- rather it applies when an incident occurs or intelligence is received indicating some form of terrorist action or targeting against personnel or facilities is likely. So clearly the U.S. sees an elevated threat level and has responded to that. Accordingly to one of the officials that CNN has spoken with, they haven't seen a move like this in 10 years, if not more than that. So the U.S. military in Europe taking precautions here. Now, it is unclear whether this is a specific threat against one base or it is just a larger threat level across Europe. And we have seen that, for example, in France, which is hosting the Olympics in less than a month, as well as in Germany, which is currently hosting the European Football Championships. Officials in those countries have said they will deploy international police officers because of the concern over an elevated threat level and potential terror attack against gatherings like that. And to point out, Fredricka, I'll also say that the U.S. embassy in Paris warned American citizens that there is an elevated threat against large gatherings.",

GEN. MARK HERTLING, CNN MILITARY ANALYST: Well, Fredricka, it creates a whole lot of different risk aversions. Gate guards will be more precise in terms of cars that are entering. There will be more patrols around bases looking for any kind of attacks it would go up against the wire of a military base, which you have to consider the two areas that Oren just talked about. Stuttgart, which is the headquarters of not just European Command, a major headquarters overlooking all of Europe, but also U.S. Africa Command. It's headquartered there in Stuttgart. But it controls forces in Africa so you have 51 countries, foreign countries in Europe, you have 54 in Africa, there could be chatter on the net that gives indication of something like this happening. But the two bases named specifically the garrison in Stuttgart and the garrison in Grafenwoehr, Germany is not only -- which is not only a major training center, but it's a major area where forces are held. You know, this is not only looking at the protection of the soldiers and the service members that live there. But it's also telling their families, when you go out on the economy, when you go to the local cities, when you do your shopping on the weekend, be very careful, extremely careful. And it's not just the European soccer championship that's going on in Germany and the Olympics that are preparing in France. But you also have the Tour de France starting in just a few days as well. So major sports events, a lot of crowds, and anyone who's lived in Europe knows whenever you have those kind of crowds during the summertime it poses a threat for someone to come into. Now this couldn't just be a terrorist threat truthfully, Fredricka. I'm concerned more also about threats from Iran, threats from agencies out of that country, and even threats from Africa because of the support for Ukraine that's been happening in Europe.",

(COMMERCIAL BREAK) [16:26:52] WHITFIELD: All right. We're hours away from a U.S. Supreme Court decision on Donald Trump's claim of absolute immunity. The case stems from Special Counsel Jack Smith's election subversion charges and could come down to whether Trump's actions after the 2020 elections were considered official. Legal experts have said that it's likely that Trump's efforts to get blanket immunity from all prosecutions will be unsuccessful. CNN political reporter Jeremy Herb is now joining me with more.

The Supreme Court is set to decide tomorrow whether Donald Trump will face trial on these election subversion charges as well as the court could choose to decide more broadly whether presidents can be criminally prosecuted.Let's take a step back how we got here. Last August, Special Counsel Jack Smith, he indicted the president, the former president over his actions to try to overturn the 2020 election. Donald Trump, he claimed he was immune from this prosecution. That led to the trial judge Tanya Chutkan as well as the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals rejecting Trump's claims of immunity. But the Supreme Court, they took up this case and in April, they were skeptical, including several justices, including Chief Justice John Roberts. They were skeptical of this argument that there should be no immunity. At the same time, the justices did not appear ready to fully embrace Trump's claim of absolute immunity. Instead, what they focused on here was official actions, official duties of a president versus a private action that were taken outside of the realm of presidential duties. And so what to watch for tomorrow is really whether the Supreme Court does give Trump some degree of immunity for those official duties while at the same time leaving him open to prosecution for what he did privately as a private citizen. The key question is, does the Supreme Court address Trump's actions specifically or do they set a standard that then requires the lower courts to go back and relitigate this whole thing, Fred? If that happens, this could take a whole lot longer and potentially push back beyond the election.",

The justices declined and that's what led us now on this process where we had multiple rounds of appeals that now we're heading into July 1st tomorrow when we're going to get this decision.So even if the Supreme Court does clear the way for this prosecution, it's not clear whether it can happen before the election.

He has been charged with having a role in the creation of slates of fake electors who would have then been introduced into the ratification of the Electoral College vote. So while Trump may not necessarily be able to argue that these charges should be outright dismissed, the Supreme Court has granted him an opportunity to potentially challenge these arguments in court, further delay the case, which is really the ultimate goal here.
