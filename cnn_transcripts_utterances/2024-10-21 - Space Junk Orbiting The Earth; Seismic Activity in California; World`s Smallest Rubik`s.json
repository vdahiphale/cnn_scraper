But an Italian firm called D-Orbit hopes to decrease this risk in overcrowding with a vehicle specially made for relocations, cleanup and repairs. With a $130 million contract from the European Space Agency, the company plans to use their device on satellites in geostationary orbit. That`s when a satellite remains over one specific part of the planet`s surface and orbits at the same rate as the earth rotates, giving the illusion on the ground that it isn`t moving. Once one becomes unusable, that`s when the GEA comes in. LUCA ROSSETTINI, CEO OF D-ORBIT: The type of interface that we invented, it`s already suitable for any type of satellite engine. So we are going to approach the satellite target, the customer satellite, we dock with the satellite and then at that point we can extend the life of the satellite, move the satellite in other locations in order to serve other markets.",

This vehicle can alsoguide items toward earth so they can burn as they enter the atmosphere. If GEA works, there will be fewer dead satellites flying aimlessly around the earth and a more sustainable way to reduce and recycle them, making way for a safer, less crowded space and more room to explore the universe.

Answer is Alaska, where a magnitude 9.2 earthquake struck Prince William Sound on March 28, 1964. While Alaska has seen the biggest earthquake in U.S. history, the state of California is no stranger to major seismic activity. California is home to many faults that can produce powerful earthquakes and recent activity has left folks there literally and figuratively shook. Two quakes rocked cities in Southern California in August and September, thankfully not inflicting major damage but strong enough to rattle some nerves. It`s left folks there wondering if a big one is coming. CNN`s Stephanie Elam gives us an inside look at how scientists are keeping an eye on those faults and how we can be better prepared for earthquakes in the future. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) KATE SCHARER, RESEARCHER GEOLOGIST, U.S. GEOLOGICAL SURVEY: All of the greater Los Angeles region is just laced with active faults.",
