They cannot sustain the fight without it.What they have to -- what lawmakers have to think about is where they're getting the biggest bang for their buck. When you compare what's going on in Ukraine, the fact they have ATACMs, for example, and they've been effectively using them, they've been able to recapture some of the territory that the Russians occupied in the initial phases of the war. They have done a lot with the aid that they received. When you compare that to, for example, the sinkhole of Afghanistan when it came to aid, it's a very different thing. We put in well over a trillion dollars into Afghanistan the years that we were there. Ukraine promises to be cheaper if we do it right and if we do it in a sustained fashion.",

      "sentences": "Anderson, this just in to me and my colleague, Jim Sciutto. A U.S. Navy destroyer operating in the Middle East, in fact, just passed through the Suez Canal just yesterday, was off the coast of Yemen when it intercepted several missiles fired from Yemen.According to one of the two U.S. officials we spoke with, it looks to be approximately two or three missiles that were intercepted. Those officials say it's unclear what the missiles were targeting, whether it was aimed at the carrier itself or whether they were targeting something else. The key question is, who fired them? One of the officials says it's believed to be the Iranian-backed Houthis in Yemen who have this sort of capability. It's been something the U.S. has been looking very closely, whether other groups, who are interested in partaking in this or see some sort of weakness in Israel, might try to participate in the conflict and get involved. Perhaps it's an indication of that happening. But it also speaks to the broader tension throughout the region. In addition to this U.S. Navy destroyer intercepting these missiles off the coast of Yemen earlier today, we have seen drone attacks on U.S. and coalition forces in Iraq within the past 24 or 48 hours. We saw three drones targeting U.S. forces there. This is what the administration and other countries were worried about, whether a conflict in Gaza could spread beyond. It's the intense diplomatic effort by the U.S. to head that off. But this is an indication that, first, of the volatility of the region and, despite the administration's best efforts, it's heading in the direction or moving towards a regional conflict. Anderson, we expect more information, a better and clearer picture perhaps of what those missiles were targeting, an exact number. And then next steps at this point. Keep in mind, Anderson, the other assets the U.S. Navy has in the region, two aircraft carriers in eastern Med and the Marines of the 26th Marine Expeditionary Unit in the Red Sea.",

That type of effort, in terms of what the Iranians might be doing here, could very well be a dangerous escalation of things. That's on one hand. On the other hand, if this is a -- an accidental firing or if they were looking at another target, that becomes another matter.

Because of the beginning of the ouster of Kevin McCarthy led by Matt Gaetz, supported by eight Republicans, all Democrats voting to take out Kevin McCarthy. Nothing has been done because Republicans can't unite behind any speaker candidate. Jim Jordan is poised to lose potentially 22 votes. If they have another vote tonight, maybe up to 30 votes on the House floor. That was the expectation this morning. We'll see if anything changed behind closed doors. It's pretty clear Republicans may be setting aside -- passing a resolution to prop up the interim speaker, Patrick McHenry. That had been the idea. And there had been a lot of momentum behind that idea. But it got pummeled behind closed doors just moments ago. And there was so much tension in the room. A lot of back and forth about that idea. And also towards Congressman Matt Gaetz himself. And I just had a chance to catch up with Gaetz about everything that's transpired in the room, including a tense back and forth he had with Kevin McCarthy. I asked him whether he regrets leading the charge to push out Kevin McCarthy given his preferred candidate, Jim Jordan, doesn't have the votes to become speaker. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

But the only reason people think there's chaos in this town right now is because the special interests aren't in control anymore. I think we'll have an upgraded position of speaker of the House. For me, it was never about one person. It was about ensuring that we got an upgraded position. Kevin McCarthy failed us. He made multiple contradictory promises. We weren't really governing under McCarthy. Everyone is making this big deal out of the fact that we've burnt the equivalent of four legislative days on all of this. But we spent seven legislative days on Post Offices and procedural votes, for goodness sakes. This is what it's supposed to be. It's not clean and it's not orderly.

The only leading option at the moment is to figure out some way to give Patrick McHenry more power to legislate. McHenry's ideological position is more moderate than what Matt Gaetz and, certainly, more moderate than Jim Jordan was. So what then was accomplished by this chaotic episode?
