Ultimately, though, the Ukrainians are also saying and in the same interview said, we've got a shopping list of stuff we need. We need modern aircraft. We need more artillery.They need the equipment to give them the edge because the Russians still have dominance in the terms of numbers of people that can throw into this fight and this - the weaponry that they can use. It's unsophisticated weaponry and that's the key aspect for Ukraine.",

      "sentences": "Okay. Sam Kiley, thank you very much for being there for us.Let's bring in Brig. Gen. Patrick Ryder. He's the Press Secretary for the Defense Department. General, thanks so much for being here. So it was just a few days ago that we heard about how these M1 Abrams tanks were too labor intensive, too complex, too hard to refuel to be able to send to Ukraine, so what changed in the past couple of days? BRIG. GEN. PATRICK RYDER, PENTAGON PRESS SECRETARY:    Well, it's important to highlight too that what we've been focused on is the near term requirements for Ukraine on the battlefield. The capabilities that they need to be immediately effective to address the kinds of things that Sam highlighted. However, we do assess that Ukraine requires a combination of armored personnel carriers, infantry, fighting vehicles and tanks to be able to have the maneuver capability that they'll need to be successful, both in the near term and in the longer term in this fight. And so really, what you're seeing here is the United States making a commitment, demonstrating its commitment to Ukraine for the long term, combined with the near term capabilities that some of our allies and partners are providing like the Leopards, and the Challenger tanks, and the Strikers and Bradleys, by the way, that we recently announced. So all that comes together to create real combat capability for Ukraine. VICTOR BLACKWELL, CNN HOST: But General, wasn't all that true last week when the U.S. said that it would not be sending the M1s and only after Germany said, well, we're not going to send these Leopards or allow any of the countries to which we've sold these German-made tanks to release theirs unless the U.S. does it first. Is there a direct correlation between the Germans' requirement that the U.S. send these tanks and the announcement that it would?",

So I mean, we've said all along that we're going to continue to consult closely with Ukraine with our international allies and partners on what Ukraine's security assistance needs are and this is no different. The M1 is a complex tank, it is difficult to maintain and requires a very complex logistics and sustainment network to support it. And so that was true yesterday, it's true today.And so as we look to provide this capability, we'll use the time that it will take to procure the tank to help train the Ukrainians, to help build that logistics and sustainment network so that when they do get it, they'll be able to employ it. But we've never taken anything off the table when it comes to the medium to the long-term support for Ukraine. And so again, we're going to continue to evolve as the battlefield conditions evolve. And we're going to continue to adapt to ensure that Ukraine has the support they need to be successful, not only in defending their territory, but also taking back their sovereign territory.",

And the international community has the right to support Ukraine as they defend their people. And so again, that's what we're focused on is giving them the capabilities they need to be able to defend their territory and take back their sovereign territory.Because the consequences aren't just about Ukraine, it's about the message it sends that if a belligerent neighbor can invade your country and conquer it, what does that pretend for European security or international security, so really we are focused on supporting Ukraine and we're confident based on past precedent that they will ultimately be successful.",

If you look at the current situation on the battlefield and largely along the front lines, it's static right now, with the exception of operations in Bakhmut or near Kreminna.And so in the near-term, what I think you'll see is Ukraine attempting to change the equation, maneuver and be able to push back Russia. But in the medium to long-term, having this capability that these advanced tanks will give them the upper hand to be able to secure and defend the territory that is rightfully theirs.",

It's the first time that he will be in front of a judge since being accused of murdering seven people and critically injuring another person.But we are learning, Alisyn and Victor, that this is not the first time that he has been accused of workplace related violence. Back in 2013, according to court records obtained by CNN, he is accused of attempting to smother a former coworker and roommate with a pillow attempting to murder him. That resulted in a temporary restraining order, which meant that he could not obtain or own a gun, but that expired in July of 2013. And as you mentioned, in this particular instance, he owned that gun and had a license for it. Yesterday, Gov. Gavin Newsom toured Half Moon Bay and met with victims and victims' families and met with community members deeply impacted by this mass shooting. Of course, it's the second mass shooting tour that he's done in just days. And I mentioned to him, California has some of the strictest gun laws in the nation and so why is this happening in the state. Take a listen to his response. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MIRACLE (off camera): Are these strict laws working? GOV. GAVIN NEWSOM (D) CALIFORNIA: Well, there are mass shootings every few years. We're the size of 21 state populations combined, we also have one of the lowest gun death rates in America, but also lead the national conversation on common sense and gun safety reform. And the data proves, doesn't assert, it proves it saves lives. We need the federal government to do its job. This is on everybody. We've chosen this. This is our decision to live in these conditions.

They are, I think, in a state of shock right now. And they need to have that human touch from someone who is so high up, who is expressing concern for them and how they are feeling. But also, I think they want the reassurance that there will be the resources there available for them. I've heard that some of the victims that are still in hospital are worried about how they're going to pay their medical bills or will they still have a job. These are things that we have to help them with and I think that Vice President Harris can do an excellent job in reassuring them.",

It was a step forward and required such things as enhanced background checks for people under 21 who are trying to buy guns, amongst other things.

Remember, the debt ceiling only allocates monies to pay the bills that already outstanding. It doesn't create any new spending, so there shouldn't even be a discussion about this. And if we default, that would be devastating to the economy around the world. So if the discharge petition is the route, then I would certainly support it. I actually think that there are Republicans who are concerned about the economic safety of America and I - but I don't know if they would sign the discharge petition.

What if any of the other allegations relating to the financial crimes by Alex Murdaugh are going to come into the case? Now, prosecutors are looking to bring that in to establish motive and that's the avenue they're looking to actually bring those issues before the jurors, but the judge hasn't decided. So what I'm going to be looking for in these opening arguments today from the prosecutor, how much are they going to talk about motive if they're not sure what is actually going to come into the courtroom. Remember, from a prosecutor's perspective and opening statements, you do not want to over promise. If you say that the jurors are going to see something or hear from a witness, you better deliver because the jury really pays attention. This is the roadmap for the case, so that's certainly something we're going to be looking for as the prosecutors lay it all out on the table.",
