But we're not far away from the fentanyl that Mexican drug cartels bring into communities like, Eau Claire.That's why I talk about it. And every state is now a border state because every state is affected by the problems. But particularly on this question about hospitals, and how do we actually reinvigorate hospitals in some of our small towns and more rural areas in our country? I think there are two answers to this question. One goes directly to the immigration problem and one doesn't. Look, first of all, we need to actually invest in our hospital system. We've seen -- since Obamacare was passed, we've seen a lot of rural hospitals, hospitals in small towns close down. You cannot have a good health care system, you're never going to help people beat addiction if they've got to drive 90 minutes let's to the closest hospital, so we've got to preserve the rural health care infrastructure that exists in this country. And this is where the illegal immigration issue bears on it directly. Because we know that Kamala Harris wants to give health care benefits, sometimes Medicaid, sometimes Medicare, to illegal aliens. We also know that when illegal aliens come in, they have to be housed in the jail sometimes, or they have to be housed somewhere else if they're not committing crimes. That costs local taxpayer money. We know they have to be fed. That costs local taxpayer moneys. We know that they have to be -- they have to be provided shelter, right? That costs money. And you combine all those things, those are tax dollars that are not going to build out our rural hospital infrastructure and support our hospitals. They're going to people who shouldn't be here. Maybe they're good people, but they shouldn't be here. And we've got to put the interest of our citizens first, That starts with prioritizing things like hospitals, medical services, food and shelter, that stuff. I want -- I want us to be a generous country. And I know Donald Trump wants this to be a generous country. But that generosity starts with investing in American citizens and people who have the right to be. Sir?",

I've never met a guy who, when he's got a big decision to make, he will solicit feedback from every single person all over the country. It's funny, when he was actually thinking about who was going to be his vice-presidential running mate, I met with him actually the morning that -- of the attempted assassination, on Saturday morning. And he said, you know, J.D., everybody asking me what I am going to do for V.P. and I'm asking everybody. He said, in fact this morning, I talked to the gardener at Mar-a-Lago. And I said, well, sir, what did the Mar-a-Lago gardener say? I mean, this bears directly on my life. I'm very curious here. And look, I'm -- I'm very much the same way. I mean, I like the people of this country. I like people who work hard and play by the rules. I like people who just want to take their kids to a ballgame or invest in their community or spend a little time watching TV and making the things that actually make this country work. They do it. And they do it right here in this factory. And the people behind me do it every single day. And I just -- I think that to lead this country, you should feel some gratitude for it and you should feel some admiration for the people who actually make the country run. And I will say, sometimes, I hear Kamala Harris, and she talks about the history of this country and she likes to put it down a little bit. I don't know that she actually admires the people who work in this factory. I hope that she does. But I don't really see that gratitude. I don't really hear that gratitude when she speaks. I certainly do. And I think that that's one of the reasons why I'd make a good vice president, is because I actually care about the people standing behind me. And I think they feel like I care for them. And I think they care for me, too. (APPLAUSE)",

And it's one of the things that's really frustrating to me about Kamala's campaign is that she seems totally uninterested in actually talking to American voters and persuading them. If there's a single issue around which I think Governor Walz has to answer when it comes to his record, this is a guy who says he stands for public safety, but actively encouraged the rioters who burn down Minneapolis. And I think that if you want to say you've stand for public safety, you cannot look the American people in the eye and say, well, I welcomed the people who caused $13 billion of damage to Minneapolis because I encourage them to burn my city to the ground. Rather than exercise some basic self-control and rather encouraged law enforcement to do what they can do and keep us all save. I'm just -- I'm scandalized by this guy pretending that he stands for working people. Working people need to live in communities with public safety. Working people need to be able to build a business and know that some hoodlum isn't going to come along and burn it to the ground because of a political issue. Working people need the police to be supported in their communities. And Governor Walz has been a total failure on all those things.",

And kudos to Wisconsin for stopping that. Because that's -- that's ridiculous. You cannot have private billionaires, who own social media companies, buying up public boards of elections, influencing public boards of elections. And again, as I understand it, that stopped. So I see a lot of reason to be optimistic about the election in Wisconsin. Of course, President Trump and I want there to be a free and fair election because we want every legal vote to count. That's the hallmark of America's constitutional republic. Is that everybody's vote has to count. But for everybody votes to count, everything has to be safe and secure. I feel a lot of confidence about Wisconsin. But it certainly as a campaign. And we're going to continue to monitor things.

What has Kamala Harris delivered? A promise to defund the police, a promise to ban fracking and offshore drilling, a promise to destroy the American energy sector, a promise to increase the prices of the goods that the American people rely on. She has not been a good vice president for the American people. And I don't think she deserves a promotion. I think she deserves to be fired.

Is -- I think it's pretty weird to be the border czar and to open up the border and allow fentanyl coming into your community. I think it's pretty weird to try to take children away from their parents if the parents don't want to consent to sex changes. That's something that Tim Walz did. I think it's pretty weird to want to defund the police. I think it's pretty weird to pretend that you're a tough-on-crime prosecutor, even though you pursued the policies that made San Francisco such a disaster when it comes to crime and public safety. So if they want to call me weird -- look, I've got my wife here. I've got three beautiful kids at home. I'm a normal guy who wants to live the American dream and wants all of you and your kids to be able to live the American dream. That's I'm in it. If those people want to call me weird, I think it's a badge of honor. Yes? BRIANNA KEILAR, CNN HOST; You've been listening to J.D. Vance in Eau Claire, Wisconsin. Just to be clear, Tim Walz did not try to take children away from parents if they would not consent to sex changes. But just a few other things to fact check here. I think specifically on the border, which is an issue that really animates voters. And not just Republicans. A lot of voters. And that's why you hear J.D. Vance really hammering on it. But while there are many things that the Biden and Harris administration have to answer for on that, some of what J.D. Vance said just does not ring true. For instance, he said that, right now, there's a terrible crisis at the southern border. Just to be clear, border numbers are actually down right now. They're at a three-year low since January of 2021, since that executive order that President Biden signed. They have fallen for four months in a row. He blamed Biden and Harris for the fentanyl crisis in America. And it is a crisis to be clear. I think, look at any community, you see that. But he left out that it started during the Trump administration during Covid. It was really an issue of closures at the border and drugs coming over in a more concentrated way. Less could get through. It became more concentrated. That persisted into the Biden-Harris administration. But certainly, he also seemed to allude as well to it being a root -- the root cause of it being illegal immigration. He was kind of alluding to that. And that's just not the truth. It comes through legal ports of entry. And it is almost entirely being brought by American citizens. He also seemed to allude to, if Kamala Harris we're in charge, if she we're the borders, as he put it, which is not a correct characterization, when his mother was struggling with addiction, and that his mother would be dead. So he is certainly trying to play on the emotions of this crowd.",

But still at a level that is killing so many Americans at a rate that no one wants to see.I also want to pick up on one other aspect that he talked about, saying that Governor Tim Walz actively encouraged rioters to burn down the city of Minneapolis. That didn't happen. In fact, while there is some question about how quickly the National Guard was called in and whether they should have been called in a day earlier or not. This was the first instance in decades that the entire contingent of the National Guard was activated to try and deal with it. And there was a legislative report that concluded that -- that Governor Walz did not realize the severity of events as they unfolded, resulting in a delayed reaction and increased violence. But we didn't see an encouragement of the rioters to burn down the city of Minneapolis.",

And even if the policy that they're putting forward is not necessarily the truth, that is what they want to be in voter's minds. And part of this, and the reason you're hearing J.D. Vance himself talk about this, is because they've been trying to get Donald Trump to talk about immigration, crime and inflation for the entire election cycle. He's struggled to do that. We've seen his speeches. He riffs. He goes off script. He ends up going into more personal attacks. What they have told J.D. Vance to do specifically, and what his goal has been for this week and beyond in all of these battleground states, is to try to talk about these exact things. And of course, we are hearing some of the fear mongering that is very reminiscent of the 2016 campaign. It's exactly what the Harris campaign is trying to point out. We're trying to have an optimistic message, try to look toward the future. This is looking backward. But this is J.D. Vance's goal. And I also find -- something that I found interesting, just comparing the speech here in the same city, Eau Claire. That we're hearing from Harris and Walz, he also was in Michigan this morning. And in both of these speeches, he focused more so on Harris and going after Harris. And this comes, as we know, that the Trump campaign has been struggling ever since Joe Biden ended his campaign a couple of weeks ago on how to define him. And that's what you're trying to see him do. The problem is they still do not know which of these attacks work best and how they can best frame this message to a lot of voters. They're still trying to figure out what this playbook looks like for someone like Harris, and now Harris-Walz versus Joe Biden. And so that's a lot of what we we're hearing and in that speech.",
