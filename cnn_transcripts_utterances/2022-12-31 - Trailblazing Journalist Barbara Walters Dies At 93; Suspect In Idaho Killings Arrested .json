And today we are honoring the life and legacy of trailblazing journalist Barbara Walters. Walters passed away yesterday in her home at the age of 93. She is of course known for her decades-long broadcasting career and her iconic interviews with world leaders and celebrities. Walters interviewed every U.S. president and first lady since the Nixon administration. She also became the first female news anchor of an evening news program when she joined ABC in '70s. Here's a look back at some of her memorable interviews. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

From the Capitol to 'The Views,' Barbara Walters uplifted women making history and progress for other women and for the world.\"I'm joined now by another esteemed journalist, Joan Lunden. Joan, you knew Barbara for many years. You co-hosted with her. In your view, what is the legacy that she leaves behind? JOAN LUNDEN, FORMER BARBARA WALTERS CO-HOST: To go the extra mile, you know, I'm listening to all this. And she paved the way for women. But men could learn a lot. Male journalists could have also taken a lesson from her. I remember one time she came -- the very first time I interviewed her on \"Good Morning America\" about one of her primetime specials. And I don't remember anything from the special. But I remember that she took me aside and said, I'm going to give you some advice. If you fight for equality there, you're going to hear from women all over the country, you should be able to start the show. Also you should get bigger interviews, just keep your head down and take all the small things that they're willing to give you and make every one of those shine. [15:05:09] And that's how you'll make your way. If you try to fight for equality, you will be out the door just like your predecessor because not just the industry but the country is not ready to give that kind of equality yet. Then she said, and the other thing I'm going to tell you is that -- she said, write thank you notes. She said when I would get interviews and everyone would wonder like how did she get that interview? It was usually because when I read in \"Variety\" or somewhere that someone had gotten a part in a movie or a television show or a Broadway show, I would immediately drop them a note. And I would say this is fantastic. You're going to be perfect for that role. I hope the production goes well. I can't wait to see the end result. She said so then when the movie came out, who did they go to? They went to me because I had already invested the time and I kind of set the table for it. And you know, and I followed her much of her advice. And she was -- I mean, she was kind of motherly to be very honest. She used to invite me to parties at her apartment in New York, which is still this amazing memorabilia from all of the stories she did. But the minute I would come in the door, she would come over and take me by the arm and say, all right, first, I'm going to put you over here with these ladies by the piano, and she'd tell me who they are. And this is an idea of what you could talk to them about. And pretty soon I'd feel her hand on my arm and she'd take me somewhere else. She was producing. She was making connections for other people. And that -- I mean, she was always doing this for other people. She was very generous in her leadership and being a teacher and mentoring other people.",

And, you know, and she was just -- she wouldn't mind if I called her a workaholic because she certainly was a workaholic. She really dedicated her entire life to the industry, to the profession, to her career. And I have to tell you, I mean, we co-hosted \"Good Morning America\" together many, many times first when David Heartman was gone, later when Charlie Gibson was gone.But during the commercial breaks we didn't talk business. We usually talked as two women, two moms. And she often told me that her biggest regret was that while she adored her profession and got satisfaction out of it, that it came at a personal price to her. That she regretted not spending more time with daughter Jackie when Jackie was young. And that was at a time when I remember the \"Today\" show was traveling all around the country. Like for one year they came from a different city like every week. I know that because I was just starting out as a little NBC affiliate in Sacramento, California. And one of my jobs was to watch that show every morning and I could pull pieces from it because I produced and anchored the local news there in Sacramento. So I saw her every single morning before I ever came to ABC and New York City. And she -- and she also told me how she felt that it really also cost her some of her marriages. You know, that she wasn't, you know, where he would want to, you know, come with me and go on a vacation somewhere and she would have to say, but I have a story to do. But I have an interview to do.

Like whether you were at a business occasion with her or at a party, and I mean, I saw her all the time because we were at the same network. And she just made people feel at ease.And that's really -- you know, people have asked me, you know, what the hardest part of doing, you know, a show like \"Good Morning America,\" I said it's not -- we're briefed. We have questions that we're going to ask. We've seen the person's movie or we've read their books. But it really comes down to being able to make the person across from you feel comfortable and safe so that they can, you know, get their head clear and tell their story. And I think that her disarming way about making you feel like she was completely listening to you and cared about you, even the way you always see the way that she's leaned forward in her interviews.

Sources say an FBI surveillance team tracked him for several days before arresting him in his home state of Pennsylvania.CNN's Camila Bernal is following these developments for us. Camila, what more are you learning about the suspect and what led investigators to arrest him? CAMILA BERNAL, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Hey, Paula. So, two things. That while Hyundai Elantra that authorities have been looking for for weeks, we know they linked the car to Bryan Kohberger, and as you mentioned, at some point when he was driving from Idaho all the way to Pennsylvania, authorities began tracking him. The other thing that was really important in this case was the DNA. They found his DNA at the crime scene and they compared it to a database. So when they had the DNA and they had the car, that's when they began surveilling him, watching his every move. According to his public defender, it was about 3:00 in the morning on Friday when authorities went into his family home in Pennsylvania. My colleague Jean Casarez spoke to that attorney.

They try to keep as much as they can under wraps so that they can continue the investigation without interference from the public. On the other hand, they're always balancing the public's need to know and to feel safe. And I think that this is a perfect example of that.Seven weeks is not a long time to do the type of investigation that's needed here. There are weeks needed to do the DNA analysis. And then you have to go through and process all of the digital evidence. They looked at cell phone records. They looked at digital information that came in via ring doorbell cameras and other cameras. It takes weeks to go through effectively. So the bottom line was seven weeks is a really quick turnaround in a case like this, where you are running down DNA. Then you have to compare it to family DNA on the international data bases and then try to find the vehicle and run the vehicle down. And then you've got a vehicle that is registered in Pennsylvania. It's not even in the Idaho database. So that complicates the process. I think the police did an incredible job here. They did it timely. It can be frustrating for the public.

Many people spent a good part of the day in basements, bomb shelters, in the subways taking cover as these -- yet again the Russians are firing missiles into Ukrainian cities. Now, according to the Ukrainian military, around 20 missiles were fired from Russia proper and also from warships in the Black Sea not only toward Kyiv but several other Ukrainian cities. Here in the capital, as you mentioned, one person was killed, 16 people injured, including a Japanese journalist. The targets included hotels, residential blocks and shops. And what we heard from the prime minister today is that, unlike previous -- for instance, day before yesterday, there were massive strikes across Ukraine. Many of them targeting infrastructure. Today seems to be random residential civilian areas. Here in Kyiv, 30 percent of the city is without electricity. This is an emergency measure taken.

Specifically the Fulton County district attorney's investigation, the centerpiece is the phone call from Donald Trump to secretary of state, Brad Raffensperger, where Trump asked him to find exactly 11,780 votes.This case has been going on nearly two years, picking up steam the last six months. We've seen a flurry of subpoenas to powerful people. This case is going to a grand jury that would make a recommendation whether the case should be indicted or not. The D.A. needs to decide whether to take the case to a regular grand jury to seek an indictment. But if this case results in an indictment, and it may well, it's going to be a serious legal obstacle to turn this case from indictment into a conviction. We'll be watching that.",

But also the Mar-a-Lago documents case. He was made special counsel by Merrick Garland in November and now he is off and running with both of these cases, Paula. Important to keep in mind how this is going to work. The special counsel gets to make the first requirement, indictment or no indictment. But ultimately, it goes to the Attorney General Merrick Garland. He will have the final say. He has to give weight to whatever the special counsel wants to do. But the buck stops with the attorney general, Paula. We know that special counsel, Jack Smith, is still recuperating from this bike injury but he's expected back in the United States soon. And I'm sure we'll be covering every nuance of this case in 2023.",
