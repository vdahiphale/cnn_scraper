But that's why we've got CNN Senior Climate &amp; Justice ReporterKatelyn Polantz who's covering the latest for us from Washington Katelyn? KATELYN POLANTZ, CNN CRIME &amp; JUSTICE REPORTER: Omar, we are going to be hearing Donald Trump talk about this gag order, because that's what he seems to want to talk about every time he's on camera coming in and out in court. But what happens today is crucial for him as a criminal defendant, not about the gag order. We may get some sort of result there. But the crucial thing is what happens on the witness stand in that courtroom before the jury in New York with the hush money case. And what happens before the nine justices of the Supreme Court in Washington hearing arguments over presidential immunity related to his 2020 election federal case. Omar, this is a pivotal day for Trump in these cases. I say that a lot. But today is a day really to watch because we so rarely have the U.S. Supreme Court weighing in on a question of this magnitude about the American presidency. In this case, Donald Trump's lawyers in Washington are going to be arguing to the justices that Trump should be immune for everything he was doing while he was president. That's related to that January 6 case, the obstruction and conspiracy charges he's facing in Washington and whether he goes to trial at all, or this year, in that case, a separate trial than New York. But what happens there what the justices ultimately decide they'll hear arguments, then they'll go into a private conference room and amongst themselves secretly decide what they're doing with Donald Trump's fate and the fate of this case and the American presidency related to immunity? What they decide there will have ripple effects across the board, not just for the White House, and any sitting president but for Trump himself in every single criminal case. His team has been arguing repeatedly, in his case in D.C. in his case in New York, and his case in Georgia, in his case in Florida, that there should be protections from a jury ever hearing about what he had done while he was president. And that is a point of time there were tweets that he was sending related to his criminal case in New York. So it all is coming together before the Supreme Court today on presidential immunity. But of course in New York, we have David Pecker on the stand, the king of American tabloids, the man a top National Enquirer talking about catching kill schemes where he wanted to help the campaign in 2016.",

You just saw the footage of him speaking this morning in New York City. That's a state case brought by the DA who was elected in Manhattan, that's about the 2016 election. What's happening here today in Washington in front of the U.S. Supreme Court is about Trump's immunity claims regarding his federal indictment from the 2020 election the Justice Department accusing him of breaking federal law while trying to overturn his defeat in 2020? He's arguing that that prosecution cannot go forward because the actions He's accused of taking all occurred while he was president. And they were all actions that were in furtherance of his official duties as president. According to their theory, if it was part of your official action, if it happened, while you were the sitting president, you could never be prosecuted for that. Perhaps they've got some arguments there that if you were impeached, and convicted, you could be but that hasn't carried into legal water. So that's what the justices will be weighing today. If they agree with Trump, then that would bode very well, for his federal case, stemming from January 6th. But it would not have any impact on the New York case, because all of that alleged criminal conduct occurred before he was ever president back in 2015 and 2016. So they're both about elections, Jim.

The president has to have immunity. This has nothing to do with me. This has to do with a president in the future for 100 years from now, if you don't have immunity, you're not going to do anything, and you're going to become a ceremonial president.

I mean you're going to make some great decisions and save the country, you're going to make some decisions, which are unfortunate, but that's the way it is. But you're not going to do anything if you don't have immunity, because otherwise you're going to be prosecuted after you leave office.

We had the best economy we've ever had, everything was good. We had no wars. We defeated ISIS. We had no wars. We had no nothing. But we respected all over the world. And now it's -- it's a disgrace.

This is the worst run country right now probably anywhere just about. You don't get much worse. We have a president who's a disaster.

And just to catch you up on what's happened so far Trump got to the court, courthouse just behind me within the last hour, within the last 30 minutes or so, he met with supporters and people on the street shaking their hands treating it more like a campaign stop rather than an entrance into court. He then before entering into court stop and spoke at cameras, again, a large portion of what he was saying felt more like a campaign rally in a campaign speech than it did as someone who might be just giving comments about how he feels being a defendant in this particular case. As of right now prosecutors are in the room, Trump has taken his seat at the defendants table. Court is likely about to officially resume shortly here. Not only are we waiting on potential testimony from David Pecker about the Stormy Daniels catch and kill deal, also waiting on a decision on the gag order because the judge in this case has not ruled on the DA's motion to sanction Trump for allegedly violating the gag order here, which essentially just says he cannot speak or direct others to speak about jurors, about witnesses, about the prosecution.

And, you know, again, from a common sense standpoint, that the civil immunity makes sense, you don't want the president to be bogged down with civil suits for the second guessing what he's done. On the criminal side, it does not make any sense because a person charged with something can always defend themselves saying I did nothing wrong. For example, saying for Trump, these were proper official acts, I was trying to safeguard the election he's free to raise that. That's different than trying to say that he's completely immune. The completely immune argument means you can't even look at what I've done. It's just a completely insulated from scrutiny. So it's very, very different.",

And Trump's lawyer said, well, yeah, unless he had been convicted in an impeachment process. It was remarkable to hear that argument. Of course, that court dismissed it very quickly by unanimous order. We'll see where this court goes. One question is how this relates to official versus private acts? And how will the court adjudicate that and where were Trump's lawyers alleging or arguing there's a dividing line?",

And they're not going to want to get into the distinction between -- official versus private acts. But you raise a really good point because the Supreme Court may be very interested in getting into that. And that's another way actually, from a practical standpoint, that Trump's team can win here. Because if the court wants further fact finding on that they could remand back to the trial court to say, hey, we need some more decisions by you on some of these issues. Are we talking private acts? Are we talking official acts, that will take time the court would rule on that maybe had more hearings, and then those particular findings could again be appealed. So that's actually a second kind of route for the team to take.",

Now Pecker has addressed two of the three so called catch and kill deals but not adult film star Stormy Daniels that though is likely coming today. Now Trump also spoke moments before entering the courtroom, though the comments felt largely like what you hear on the campaign trail for the former president rather than comments tied directly to this case, regardless, telling reporters his constitutional rights were being taken away and calling the case as he has every day, a which on. CNN's Senior Crime and Justice Reporter, Katelyn Polantz is covering the case for us from Washington. So Katelyn, just break it down for our viewers. What are we expecting today?

And we're already getting more of that story of how the NationalEnquirer paid off Karen McDougal to buy the rights to what she had to say about an alleged affair with Donald Trump, which he's denied and how that played out. What David Pecker has testified to already. This is one of a series of catch and kills schemes that the prosecutors are using to highlight how Donald Trump was motivated to use Michael Cohen to keep women silent during the 2016 campaign for his presidential runs benefit. What we're hearing is that Karen McDougal approached the National Enquirer started talking to them about a year's long or a year-long affair she says she had with Donald Trump. And that, at the time, David Pecker and his top editor at the Enquirer believed her even though she had no corroborating evidence, they thought she sounded legitimate. And so they got on the phone with Michael Cohen. Before this had happened, David Pecker has already testified to having meetings with Michael Cohen or having communications with him where he made clear. He would be helpful to the campaign would get stories like this under control and bury them. And so this is an example of how that was playing out, blow by blow by blow. Michael Cohen at the time denying Donald Trump had that affair.",
