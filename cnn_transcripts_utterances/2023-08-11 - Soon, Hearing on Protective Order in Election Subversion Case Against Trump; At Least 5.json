It's a big day for them and for the special counsel as this is the first hearing in the 2020 election subversion case against Trump. And the first time that we will hear from the U.S. district judge, Tanya Chutkan, she is the judge presiding over the whole thing.Overnight, prosecutors filed a motion asking for the trial here to begin January 2nd. They argue a speedy trial is in the public's best interest. Donald Trump, not surprisingly, lashing out about that on social media with his attorneys also pushing for any trial to be held after the 2024 election. CNN's Katelyn Polantz is outside the court for us in Washington. She joins us now. So, this is all getting underway as we speak, Katelyn. What could happen today?",

      "sentences": "Well, Kate, there has been the latest discussion about trial dates, but that is not exactly what the judge is going to be determining today. It's going to be something looming over this case throughout, though, because what is on the table today is how fast and how the Justice Department can hand over records to Donald Trump and his team, evidence in this case that they'll need to look at that they've never seen before and review as they head toward trial and prepare for that trial date that will be set at a later time.So, that evidence discussion, how much Donald Trump can share of it publicly, that is really going to be the legal issue that the judge is going to be looking at today. And we're going to be watching for a lot of things. Does she put a lockdown on Donald Trump so that he can't discuss publicly or discuss with anyone else at all, not even just on social media or in his campaign speeches, the information he's learning about where this investigation has gone so far. The Justice Department wants that full non-disclosure to be put over all of the evidence that he would be seeing for the first time and learning about in the course of this case. He wants a much smaller segment to be locked down, something that would be called sensitive materials. And so we're watching for how the judge responds to that. And so we're also watching for her tone. Judge Tanya Chutkan, she is a tough judge. She is also very metered judge in that she holds hearings that really do dig into the legal issues. She seems to move quite quickly. She seems to also be very prepared whenever she gets on the bench. And so we're watching to see how much she's taking into consideration some other things that Trump and his lawyers and the Justice Department have said so far to her, specifically about social media posts that the former president has made talking about the special counsel's investigation, wanting to come after people. Generally, if she responds to that today, that is something really to watch here. And then, of course, all of this will matter in the course of a trial date because the sooner that the Justice Department gets an order that they're asking for today and that they're fighting with Trump's team over, the sooner that order gets in place, the quicker Trump's team can start reviewing evidence, meaning the quicker that path begins for the real preparations to get to a trial.

But officials fear the current death toll of 55 that it will almost definitely rise. Let's get right to CNN Meteorologist Derek Van Dam to get a sense of what the situation will be like over the next 24 hours, Derek, as they try to recover. Are they going to face more fires? [10:15:00] DEREK VAN DAM, CNN METEOROLOGIST:  Yes, the search and recovery efforts there are going to be impacted by the weather going forward, but not like what they were when they were at the peak of this fire event. So, the winds have certainly relaxed. There's no question about that. But there are still embers and there are still flare-ups and there are still hot spots, at least according to the official statement from the Maui County earlier -- roughly about 12 hours ago. Now, you can see the wind forecast that we have here picking up through the course of the weekend. It was at a northeasterly direction, and then it changes to more of an easterly wind. This is a typical trade wind setup that the Hawaiian Islands receive. But, remember, it was Hurricane Dora in combination with this high-pressure system that put the strong winds funneling across the islands. One thing interesting to note, we have the ability to detect the hot spots. And during the height of the wildfire event, here's the up country, here's Lahaina. Look at as we fast forward to present moment in time. Those hot spots have basically diminished across the entire island. And the latest numbers we have is an 80 percent containment on the Lahaina fire, again, with the exception of those hot spots and flare-ups that are still ongoing for that area. In terms of rainfall, we could use it, but it's unlikely that we'll get it because of the leeward side where Lahaina is located. The majority of the rainfall over the coming days will be across the higher elevations and on the east-facing slopes. John?",

Just into CNN, the first hearing before the federal judge who will hear the January 6th case against Donald Trump, Judge Tanya Chutkan, that hearing began really just a few minutes ago about 10, 15 minutes ago. Already, we are getting very interesting tidbits from inside the courtroom about how Judge Chutkan will handle this case going forward, some real signs of where things are headed.So, let's get right to Katelyn Polantz here for these tidbits, the judge wasting no time here, Katelyn. POLANTZ:  No time at all. 20 minutes into this hearing and it already is about Donald Trump's speech outside of the courtroom. And I want to read a quote that the judge just spoke from the bench in considering whether she can put some sort of overlay, an order that essentially tells him he can't disclose evidence he's learning in the course of this pre-trial preparation as his team is preparing. She says, Mr. Trump, like every American, has a first Amendment Right to free speech, but that right is not absolute. In a criminal defendant's case such as this one, the defendant's free speech is subject to the rules. And Judge Chutkan is already indicating that she is ready to make rulings, making decisions today in court about how this case is going to go forward. And at one point, too, a Justice Department attorney said to her that they believe that Trump wants to try this case in the media before trial, and she did indicate that she does want to address that today during this hearing. Some of the other things she's saying is that she does want to make sure her rulings are taken into consideration the safety of witnesses. So, perhaps, some limitations on what Trump can say about the evidence he is learning from what witnesses may have said against him or about him in grand jury proceedings, other evidence he would learn about what witness testimony has been to this point. She also has indicated that she does believe there needs to be an order like this because this is a judicial context, this is not a political context, and that you have to protect the jury pool. That jury pool should not be tainted because Donald Trump, as a criminal defendant here, deserves a fair trial. John?",

He did speak very generally about, if you go after me, I'm coming after you, in all caps, social media post just the other day, where his team said that was general, it wasn't about this particular case.
