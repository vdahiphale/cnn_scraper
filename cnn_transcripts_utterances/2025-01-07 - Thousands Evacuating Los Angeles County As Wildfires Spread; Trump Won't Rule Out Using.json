Since then, 1,200 acres have gone up. And we don't know how many homes have been lost. I mean, this just one of them. Cars in that garage, a beautiful house on a beautiful little suburban street, gone. We have seen so many of these houses. The heat coming off this thing is intense right now. And look, if you can see these embers in the air? Chris (ph), can you show? So, that's the problem. Look at those embers on the wind. That shows you how fast the wind is gusting. But every one of those embers could be another fire. I saw something just clear -- I don't if you can see, just popped up behind that hedge, just about five minutes ago. That's an ember, a spot fire. More up here, it is just never-ending. And Chris (ph), down here, you see all this water on the street, Kaitlan. That's from the firefighters trying desperately to contain whatever they can. I mean, it is, right now, I would say, something, I don't want to say it's a losing battle. But boy, is it a battle. And they're going to be out here, all night. Because, as you said, these winds are only going to get worse. They're going to pick up. They might peak sometime just before dawn. So these firefighters are going to be out here, trying to contain this all night. And Kaitlan, I cannot imagine a worse environment to try to fight a fire. Tightly-packed homes, small, narrow roadways, steep inclines, wind. So, it's hard to get to it from the air. There are just men and women on the ground, trying to fight this fire. And it is a tough job. Listen, they knew this was coming, as I said, because of the winds. So they pre-positioned firefighters. But still. And can you imagine 30,000 people under evacuation orders, trying to get out on these little roads that are little more than a lane wide? So what we saw this morning was we saw many people in their cars, just stationary. We saw people abandoning their cars, walking with the luggage that they could drag behind them. And those cars. Well, the fire department needed to get in. So the fire department had to bulldoze dozens of cars out of the way, to get in, to try and save some of these homes. First priority is saving life. Second priority is trying to save property. And it is a tough, tough fight. And Kaitlan, it's only going to get worse.",

Former National Security Adviser, John Bolton, is joining me now.Ambassador, I'll ask you about the Gulf of America, in a moment. But you were there in 2019 when Trump -- this is not a new idea for him. He had talked about this, his first term in office. You had actually argued, in subsequent interviews, that it would be good for U.S. national security, you thought. That's the same argument Trump is making. Where do you stand on this after hearing from him today? JOHN BOLTON, FORMER TRUMP NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER, FORMER U.S. AMBASSADOR TO THE U.N.: Look, the Greenland issue is very serious. The question is, what kind of answer is there to make sure that we don't lose our strong NATO position in the Arctic Circle that endangers -- puts us in danger from Russia, and that we don't allow China to take advantage of its desire to be, hard for some people to hear this, but to be an Arctic power. The problem with what Trump is doing today is not the end result of what might be a quiet negotiation. The problem is, by doing it all in public, because he likes to hear himself talk, he is making it harder to achieve his own objectives, certainly with respect to Greenland, but also with respect to Panama. The Canada stuff is just trolling Justin Trudeau. But on Greenland, this is very, very serious. Suppose Greenland became independent of Denmark, and agreed to hold Russian or Chinese air and naval stations there? That would be, to say the least, troubling for the United States. So this question of the Greenland U.S. security relationship goes back a long, long way. Donald Trump didn't discover Greenland today, or back in 2019. It goes back a long way. And the way to resolve it, with the Government of Denmark and the local government of Greenland, is quiet conversations. When Trump says all this stuff publicly, particularly about not ruling out the use of force, he is pushing the democratically-elected Government of Greenland, and the democratically-elected Government of Denmark, into a corner, makes them harder -- harder for them to consider--",

And she said then, the idea of buying Greenland, which Trump blew up publicly, and which compromised any effort we had in 2019, to have a quiet conversation with Denmark, she called the idea, absurd. To which Trump responded, calling her nasty. Now, this is one NATO ally talking to another NATO ally. It's not the way to proceed. It does have a further ramification, based on what Trump said today about declining to rule out the use of force. That's exactly the same position Xi Jinping has on Taiwan. So, I could easily imagine Xi Jinping, saying, Look, I perfectly well- understand Greenland's close to the United States. Taiwan is close to us. Trump won't rule out the use of force on Greenland. Exactly our position. We won't rule it out on Taiwan. Or Vladimir Putin could say, Look, I certainly understand that. Ukraine is critical to our national security. We are using force. And frankly, if the United States invaded Greenland -- which, by the way, has U.S. troops stationed there today -- I, Vladimir Putin wouldn't oppose that.

So, I don't think that that's.But it's a trap for Democrats, OK? This is the same series that aired a few years ago. And that's just a reboot, OK? But the question is, will the Democrats play the same character? By which I mean, we're supposed to be the donkey. We're not. Democrats are a largemouth bass. We hit any shiny object, and always surprised there's a hook in it. In other words, don't chase Trump around Panama, Greenland, Canada. The most important thing Trump said at the press conference today -- President-elect Trump, I'm being respectful. The most important thing our President-elect said at the press conference was an hour into it, and he said, quote, You're going to see pretty drastic price reductions for groceries. Now, that's a piece of tape that Democrats need to save and run. He has laid down a marker. He has promised us, pretty drastic price reductions at the grocery store. I think the Democrats should answer all this, Greenland, whatever, saying, What's it going to do to the cost of groceries, gas and rent? That's why you're there, buddy. Groceries, gas and rent. Not Greenland, Canada and Panama.",
