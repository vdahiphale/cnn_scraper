He approached one of the security checkpoints, and he approached a police officer and tried to attack him with a machete. He then tried to strike another officer, and that's when a third officer that was also on the scene fired a shot from his service weapon and injured the suspect, Trevor Bickford, in his shoulder. Now, we are also learning, according to law enforcement sources, that Trevor Bickford was carrying a diary that -- where he had handwritten notes about wanting to join the Taliban in Afghanistan, and he expressed a desire to die as a martyr.

Last night, like you said, he made a clear concession to conservatives on a private conference call, telling them that he would be willing to include in the rules package a lower threshold of what it would take to call for a vote to oust the speaker, from half the conference to just five single members. That is something that moderates are really opposed to, but it's something that they could potentially rally around if it delivered McCarthy the votes he needed. But on that same call, Matt Gaetz, a key detractor, one of the five members who said he is opposed to McCarthy, said he's still a no. That surprised a lot of moderates and really led to a lot of frustration on this call, as lawmakers are hoping, at least his allies, that McCarthy can be the next speaker.

His attorney tells me that they arrived about December 17th. Now, we do know, and a source is telling CNN, that the FBI was surveilling him right here in Northeastern Pennsylvania for four days before the arrest. At the very same time, law enforcement prosecutors were getting their evidence together to present to a judge for that arrest warrant affidavit.

It's quite a remarkable scene here at -- at St. Peter's Square where you do already have thousands of people who are pouring in here to pay their final respects to Pope Benedict XVI. I'll get out of your way a little bit. It's a bit crowded here. There's a lot of people who are coming here from the immediate area, from Rome. There's a lot of people who are affiliated from the church. We have also seen people coming in from Germany. Pope Benedict XVI was, of course, German but also very much attached to his homeland in Germany, Bavaria. You know, the area around Munich and really someone who celebrated that area. It was interesting. It was a final letter from Pope Benedict came out where he praised the area from Germany that he was from. But as you can see, this is a big event here in -- for the Catholic Church, for Rome, for the entire Catholic community in the world, really. And pretty much that hasn't happened in hundreds of years, that when the funeral for Pope Benedict is going to happen, the acting pope is going to preside over the funeral of his predecessor. Certainly, a remarkable event. But also of course, right now, this area just celebrating the life and legacy of Pope Benedict, who you know, he was pope for about a little over seven years. But he was very influential here in the Catholic Church for decades, really, since the early '80s, Poppy.",

He didn't want a large funeral. I was here when the funeral for John Paul II happened, and also when Pope Benedict became pope in 2005, and that was a gigantic event. There were millions of people who came here to Rome and, of course, lots of heads of state and heads of government. Pope Benedict himself wanted a smaller, more humble ceremony.
