      "sentences": "Thanks so much for joining us this afternoon on CNN News Central. I'm Boris Sanchez, coming to you live from Treasure Island, Florida, a state that's been badly battered by Hurricane Milton.I'm joined live by my colleague, Brianna Keilar, who is in the nation's capital for us. And in just moments, we are expecting to hear from President Joe Biden, who will give us an update not only on the devastation from Hurricane Milton, but also on the recovery and what could be a long recovery ahead for residents here. I actually want to show you some of the first images that we're getting from the barrier islands along the Gulf coast, including Anna Maria Island. These were the areas where there was the most concern about storm surge and flooding. Hurricane Milton was prognosticated to have up to 15 foot storm surge in some areas. Here where we are in Treasure Island, fortunately, I can report that that came in significantly lower than expected. Much of the damage that you see behind me is actually from Hurricane Helene from about two weeks ago, and yet there is still significant damage in the area. We are watching law enforcement help coordinate as residents get back to their homes and back to their businesses. Just across the street from us, we were watching business owners clearing out some shutters and trying to get back in as the process of rebuilding begins. The expanse of the damage from Hurricane Milton is notable given that even before the storm made landfall on the western coast of Florida, we were seeing deadly tornadoes on the southeast coast, specifically in Port St. Lucie. In St. Lucie County, there are at least five people confirmed dead there. We have a reporter who is on the way, Brian Todd, who reported in the last hour that this was a devastating situation. We'll, of course, bring you details on that as we get it. Meantime, as the recovery from Hurricane Milton begins, we are continuing to watch rescue operations that, as we've heard from officials, are still ongoing in some areas. This hurricane brought with it an enormous amount of rainfall. We're talking about upwards of a foot of rainfall in the span of a day. I actually want to take you straight to President Biden now, who is making remarks on Milton. Let's listen. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

      "sentences": "We have been listening to President Joe Biden live at the White House. It's hard to make out what he just said. We've been listening to President Joe Biden live at the White House, answering questions from reporters and giving an update on the federal response to Hurricane Milton.A number of specific lines stood out. First, President Biden saying, quote, \"we will do everything we can to help you pick up the pieces in reference to folks who have lost everything here in the Sunshine State.\" The President talked about everything the federal government is doing to facilitate the work of helping residents get back on their feet and coordinating with local officials and state officials as well. He talked about speaking with Governor Ron DeSantis of the state, the FEMA administrator as well, Dan Criswell. Also, President Biden called for Congress to come back as soon as possible, he said, to help allocate funds not only to FEMA but also to the small business administration. Though the president said he had not spoken to House Speaker Mike Johnson. He was asked if he spoke to former President Donald Trump. The President there talking extensively about what he sees as disinformation and false claims that have been made by the former President about the federal response specifically to Hurricane Helene in North Carolina and Georgia and other southeastern states. The President there in response to Trump saying, quote, \"get a life, man. Help these people.: I want to get reaction now from Florida's Lieutenant Governor Jeanette Nunez, who we spoke to yesterday, who's obviously been tracking the storm closely. First, Lieutenant Governor, I just want to ask for your response to what you heard there from President Biden, both about his coordination with local officials and some of the political stuff between him and the former President over disinformation. JEANETTE NUNEZ, FLORIDA'S LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR: Well, certainly, as I said yesterday, the governor has been very focused on making sure we have all the things we need from the federal government, Helene, and then now, of course, Milton. So we've been working very closely with our FEMA director. And the Governor has not been able -- he has not lacked for anything from the federal government. And so as it relates to some of those comments, again, I think we need to focus on recovery, leave our personal feelings about individual candidates, the former President as well. I don't think there needs to be a time to have that sort of rancor. What we need to focus on is getting Floridians the relief that they deserve and that they need right now.",

Lieutenant Governor, I just got an update moments ago that you now have eight confirmed dead as a result of the hurricane. We know at least five of those were in St. Lucie County as a result of tornadoes there.Do you have any other information you can offer on the three others that were killed?",

      "speaker": "NUNEZ",
      "sentences": "No, I don't have additional information on that. What I will say is that those five that you referenced due to the tornadoes, those have been confirmed. We expect, as the day wanes on, as we continue to get into that rebuilding and recovery process, we may see additional fatalities above and beyond that because as we know, a lot of the fatalities occur post-storm, people driving through flooded streets, people using generators inside their home. And so that's sort of been our focus now on messaging, making sure people understand the hazards that exist when they begin that process of recovery, rebuilding. So we want to make sure people are mindful of that.",

      "sentences": "That's exactly right, Boris. So we are now on Fort Myers beach at the town here just reopened to residents a few hours ago. And there is a long line of cars of residents trying to get back onto the barrier island.We sat in traffic for about an hour at the foot of the bridge that connects the barrier island and the mainland because that's where law enforcement is checking for identification so that only residents are the ones that are able to get onto Fort Myers beach. We'll walk a little bit here so you can see some of the damage that we have encountered in our time here. I'll point out that a lot of this was destroyed by Hurricane Ian two years ago. And so some of this really has not been touched since. But as you can imagine, yesterday's five and a half, almost six foot storm surge only added to some of the damages and the destruction, the misery out here. What's happening right now is a lot of these construction crews are trying to remove some of this debris. There is a line of dump trucks that line -- Estero Boulevard, which is kind of the main boulevard that connects Fort Myers beach that heads north and south. And what they're doing is they're placing all of this sand, all of this debris onto these dump trucks in an effort just to clear some of the roads out here. This here was redone after Hurricane Ian. And now look -- what it looks like now. Again, yesterday, we were talking about a storm surge of about five and a half to about six feet. Now, the forecast originally was calling for about 8 feet to 12 feet of a storm surge. So that number was well under what the forecast was. And that is to the relief of a lot of folks that we talked to who said, look, we thought this was going to be a whole lot worse during Hurricane Ian, Boris. The storm surge out here was 15 feet, so you can imagine the concern that folks had with that being the case this time around. Luckily, we're talking about five and a half, maybe six feet. Boris?",

He's also a presidential distinguished professor of earth and environmental science. Michael, thanks for being with us.

I was down in Australia doing a sabbatical when they experienced what they -- they now call the black summer, this summer of unprecedented heat and drought and wildfires unlike anything they had seen before. And one of the things that happened, there are large areas now in Australia that aren't insurable anymore because they're just too fire prone. Insurers don't want to insure them. It's not a good bet for them. And I said at the time, and it applied to Australia, that the first stage to uninhabitability is uninsurability. If you can't insure a home in a region, you're not going to want to live there.And we're seeing the same thing now on our coasts here with these battering storms, one after the next. Insurers are going to pull out because it simply isn't, you know, it's too much of a risk for them. You know, it's not a good bet for them to insure these homes.
