I spoke with one of those leaders who attended the meeting was yesterday on \"FIRST OF ALL\".

That's more than half of Gaza's population living in a city typically where 300,000 actually reside.The Israeli prime minister saying that Hamas is ensconced in that city, that it is Hamas's last bastion effectively and that the only way to achieve what he has described as total victory over Hamas would be to carry out a military offensive there.

And yet does not seem to have a clear plan for what it will do with the civilians is raising enormous concerns. The United States saying that they had as of late last week, had not yet seen evidence of serious planning for the civilian population in Rafah saying it would be a disaster if a military operation were to be carried out there without that kind of serious planning multiple Arab countries, including Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, and Saudi Arabia warning of an imminent humanitarian disaster should that offensive be carried out with Saudi Arabia warning a very serious repercussions should Israel move forward with this operation. A Hamas spokesman also today telling Al-Aqsa TV that in a military offensive in Rafah would amount to the, quote, destruction of negotiations that have been ongoing for weeks for a potential cease- fire and the release of Israeli hostages from Gaza. Those negotiations are very much still ongoing with a major summit expected in Cairo on Tuesday. Of course, the question is whether or not such a deal could forestall, could prevent such a military offensive, at least for the 1.4 million people in Russia. That's certainly the hope.",

So there was a lot of emphasis on Hur being a very good lawyer who also happened to be a Republican and also happened to be a diehard Trumper or part of the MAGA world.And this is something that Democrats tend to do over and over again, particularly in cases like this. They really emphasize the bipartisan nature of say in this case investigations as a way of saying, look, we're impartial. We're above it all. When they go low, we go high, that kind of thing. So now the chickens are coming home to roost. The same person that you praised because you're trying to praise this kind of bipartisan framework has come out and said, you know, all of these things that you're now trying to recategorize and reclassify as partisan.
