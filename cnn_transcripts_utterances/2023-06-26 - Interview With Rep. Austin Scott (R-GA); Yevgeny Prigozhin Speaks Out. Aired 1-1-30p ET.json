Second is, we marched in demonstration of a protest, not to overturn the power in the country.

It has been made very clear that he was believed to be on his way to Moscow. He had sent his troops there, in essence, a coup attempt. Traitor is what Putin called him. He seems to be trying to, in a way, get back into Putin's good books. That seems like an impossible task, given that Putin only favors loyalty and hates people being disloyal, and he appears to have been the ultimately disloyal person. But what is he saying here that we can -- that we can learn from? And it is instructive. That clip we played before, he said:  I took the deal with Lukashenko in Belarus because it gave me an opportunity to keep the Wagner private military contracting company mercenary group on a legal footing. It is clear that his big gripe with Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu, that Shoigu is trying to take control of the Wagner group, is still ongoing. He said that is the reason why he was going to Belarus. And he also said that the reason to have that march was to, again, keep the Wagner group whole and stable. He lays out in the speech -- and we're going to play the clip in a second -- that the government, that Sergei Shoigu, the defense minister, wanted to shut down Wagner on the 1st of July. (BEGIN AUDIO CLIP) PRIGOZHIN (through translator):  As a result of intrigue's ill- conceived decisions, it was planned that this unit would cease to exist on July 1, 2023. The counsel of the commander gathered, which brought all the information to the fighters. No one agreed to sign a contract with the Defense Ministry, since everyone knows very well from the current situation and their experience during special military operation that this will lead to a complete loss of combat capability.

U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said it shows cracks in Putin's power. So are there any immediate weaknesses that Ukraine can exploit on the battlefield against Russian forces there? CNN's Nick Paton Walsh is in Kyiv. Nick, we know the Ukrainian military is claiming some small gains on the Eastern And southern front in the last 24, 48 hours. Is it possible those advances are connected to a perception among Ukrainian commanders that now is the time to strike, that there's weakness in Russia leadership?",

A little early.But you can be of no doubt that you will be in Ukraine here in the senior leadership observing what's happened in Moscow and not necessarily popping champagne corks, but thinking this is a moment where the disarray at the top should be seized upon. But that could take time. And there may also be a reluctance in Kyiv to get in the way of Russia making this level of mistakes. They don't want to create an existential crisis that might suddenly get people to rally around Putin. But we are seeing in the far east of the front lines near the city of Kherson, the Antonivskyi Bridge, suggestions that Ukrainian forces are on the move there. They have publicly stated they're on the move and progressing one or two kilometers forwards over the weekend around the city of Bakhmut, where Wagner fought pretty substantially over the winter, gained control of that city center, because the Russian military, it seems, according to certainly Wagner, were not stepping up to that task themselves. We also know that some of the fighters brought to Moscow, according to Russian state media to defend the capital, they were Chechen fighters loyal to Putin. Well, they were taken away, we understand, from Marinka, a pretty vital and heavily contested town on the Donetsk front line. That may have an impact there too. And on top of that, Ukrainian officials are saying they have taken another village in the southern area that's a key part of this ongoing counteroffensive, incremental, certainly. No signs of a massive breakthrough yet, but it will take time. It will certainly take Ukrainian officials wanting to be sure that they're not somehow providing an advantage to the Russians politically by throwing it all in, that they get those decisions right. And they will be getting intelligence too from their NATO allies, you can imagine, as well. But in the longer run, Yevgeny Prigozhin decamping, it seems, possibly to Belarus, maybe taking his fighters there as well, doesn't end the problem of this rebellious warlord, to some degree, for Putin. It again emphasizes for the Russian public how badly this war has been prosecuted, and may potentially cause greater problems down the line still -- Jim.",

We don't know what level of Wagner fighters are still with him, what kind of equipment they might take with them. We do know certainly that Ukraine's northern front with Belarus has long been something they'd be concerned about. And there are defenses in there as well.

I'm not optimistic that Russia can do anything more than what it's been doing in its recent past, which is lob artillery, use of drones. When they engage in a tactical fight against the Ukrainians, they historically have lost. Now, over the interregnum of about five months, the Russians have put in this great defense in depth. And the Ukrainians right now are being very aggressive, but cautious, to determine where those vulnerabilities and weak points are for the Russians, so they can exploit them. What I'm interested in seeing is, can the Wagner Group and the conventional Russian military integrate? I'm not optimistic that that can happen, based on its most recent past, and this incredible, critical voice, this assault, this critical assault, verbal assault on the Russian military and its leadership by Prigozhin.",

But there were a number of things that they were surprised by, including, as you mentioned, the fact that they faced such little resistance when they actually went into Rostov and proceeded with their march up to Moscow. It was very surprising to U.S. officials that Russian troops didn't do more to try to fight back. And they expected a lot more bloodshed and a lot more violence over the course of those kind of 36 hours or so. Another thing that surprised them was this deal that Belarus apparently managed to strike with Prigozhin. U.S. officials were taken off guard by the fact that Prigozhin -- or that Lukashenko, the president of Belarus, managed to play such a significant role in getting Prigozhin to turn around. And so these are the things that U.S. officials are now going back and analyzing, seeing why the Russian troops -- trying to figure out why the Russian troops did not fight back harder, whether there was any kind of dissent or any kind of movement to try to stop them amongst any of the troops, and also, of course, where this all goes from here, Jim.",

Yevgeny Prigozhin now says that this was not an attempted coup. But, as we know, often with Russia, all is not as it seems. I'm wondering if you buy his explanation? REP. AUSTIN SCOTT (R-GA):  No, I don't buy it. And I will tell you, as time goes on, we will know more. The magnitude of what has happened in Russia over the last 36 hours I don't think can be understated. It's going to have global implications. When we talk about something being a protest, Navalny was a protester in Russia. He's only alive now because, after he was poisoned by Vladimir Putin, people were able to get him to a hospital soon enough. Now he's in prison in Russia. I'm a little taken aback at the freedom of movement that Prigozhin and Wagner had through Russia. At the same time, I will tell you, Putin built Wagner into what it is, so that he could he could carry out paramilitary operations without his hands being on it. Now, I imagine some of the Russian soldiers were probably not sure what was happening, whether they were operating under the -- under the authority of Vladimir Putin or Prigozhin, so, obviously, a lot of confusion inside Russia right now. We will know more about what actually happened, I think, as time pushes on. But there's a lot of confusion right now inside Russia.

So, certainly, while we don't like Vladimir Putin, replacing him with Prigozhin and somebody with the mind-set of the mercenary that he is, is not in the best interest of anybody in the world. The way we benefit from this, as the Western part of the world, obviously, it shows that there's more than just a conflict or inability to coordinate between Wagner and Russian regulars in Ukraine. And so I think that creates some opportunity for -- opportunities for us that, hopefully, we will take advantage of. And, again, these assessments are going to be going on, Boris. And we're going to know a lot more, I think, over the next several -- several days and weeks about what actually happened.
