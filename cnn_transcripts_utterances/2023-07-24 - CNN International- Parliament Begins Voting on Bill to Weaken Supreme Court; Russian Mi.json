Head of a major vote happening today on parts of Benjamin Netanyahu's controversial judicial reform plans.We live in Jerusalem with the latest, thousands of fleeing raging wildfires in Greece right now creating chaos in airports amid peak tourist season. What you need to know? And drones hit Moscow overnight, as Ukraine claims the attack, live report from the ground. Voting is now underway in the Israeli parliament on the first part of a sweeping judicial overhaul bill, which would severely weaken the power of the country's Supreme Court. Thousands of protesters are gathered outside the Knesset right now, as you can see were earlier police dragged one group of demonstrators away. At least 12 people were arrested. Critics say the overhaul will put Israel on the path to dictatorship. The Prime Minister, who's out of hospital after being fitted with a pacemaker yesterday, says it's needed to prevent judicial overreach. Hadas Gold joins us live in Jerusalem. Just explain what's happening today, because isn't the overall plan going through Parliament today?",

      "sentences": "Yes, I mean, in the next few minutes, actually, Max, we may be seeing those second and then the third final vote for this bill, this legislation that's being debated right now. It's just part of the judicial overhaul.But if it passes, it will be the first part of the digital overhaul that will pass the parliamentary process what this bill specifically says it's trying to strip away the Supreme Court's ability to cancel government actions to prevent them from taking action that the Supreme Court says is unreasonable. Now, the protesters here we're just outside the Supreme Court, this road leads down to the Israeli parliament. And that's why you're seeing these thousands of protesters walking by because they want to be as close as possible to the Israeli parliament. They want those lawmakers inside to hear their shouts to hear their chants. They are fearful that if this legislation passes, that is the beginning of the end of Israeli democracy. They feared that it would get unfettered access to do what it pleases. So their Supreme Court here is essentially the only check on the Israeli government because of the parliamentary process. Now that they are seeing lots of reports of some last minute deal making that people are trying to, Ministers are trying to make to potentially delay this vote. But all indications are pointing to the government and Benjamin Netanyahu who arrived to the Parliament assembly straight from hospital after getting that pacemaker that they are going to be pushing ahead. This despite the concerns of thousands of military reservists who said they will not heed the call to serve as the circulation passes a lot of concerns about what that means for Israeli military preparedness. And we just heard from President Joe Biden once again, in an overnight statement, calling on Israeli leaders. He said not to rush into this to come to a consensus on this. This is the second statement we're hearing from President Biden on this judicial overhaul in the span of just about a week. And yet Benjamin Netanyahu, you know, he's facing a lot of pressure from his own governing coalition. And listen, they have the votes they have the majority in parliament. They say that they were voted in November and this is their right to do so and this is what the voters want, Max.",

Well, we're told that the backroom dealing has already begun even hours after the results are in but one result and the results of how this coalition might play out are not quite clear. But one result it does seem clear is that Spaniards who voted not to allow the far right Vox party into Spanish government, which would have been the first time in about 50 years not since the end of the Franco dictatorship with his death.Those far right units were far right elements for in the Spanish government. The voters for the main Conservative Party, they were 40 seats short on their own from the parliamentary majority and even added with Vox, they still came up about seven seats short. So that has breathed a sigh of relief into many, especially on the left who warned of this. The far right has been coming up across Europe, its governing in Italy, it's gotten into the government in Finland, Spaniards decided not here, not now, as far as the coalition there already is one with socialist Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez has had a coalition for the last four years. An aide to him a senior leader at the party, tell CNN earlier this day that trying to do this again, will be even tougher because nationalist parties in Catalonia that's the area around Barcelona and in the Northern Basque region, because of the vote results and their increased value for a potential left coalition. They're going to extract, try to extract a higher price. So the backroom dealing has clearly already begun.
