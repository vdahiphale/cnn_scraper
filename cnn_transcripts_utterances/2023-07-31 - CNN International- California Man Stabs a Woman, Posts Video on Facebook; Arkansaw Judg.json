If you're just joining us, let me bring you up to date with the top stories this hour.Donald Trump employee Carlos de Olvera is due to appear in federal court in just a few hours from now. He's charged with making false statements to the FBI in the criminal investigation into Trump's alleged mishandling of classified documents. A brutal heat wave continues to sweep across the United States. Over the next week, nearly 60 million people could see temperatures soar above over 100 degrees Fahrenheit. That is more than 70 -- 37 degrees Celsius. A Bay Area man is facing a murder charge after he allegedly stabbing a woman to death and then posted the video of the killing on social media. CNN's Camila Bernal has more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

Police saying he filmed her last moments.Now this all started on Wednesday when the Nye County Sheriff's Department in Nevada actually called the San Mateo Police Department saying that they received a call from a woman saying she watched the stabbing on Facebook. That woman was able to provide a name and a phone number and that information led authorities to an apartment complex. They say it was actually a large building, so it took them about three hours as they went door to door trying to find the suspect or the victim in this case. Unfortunately, they found that woman that had been killed. And authorities say that the two did have a connection, but so far, they do not know what the exact motive was in this case. Now he was arraigned on Friday and assigned a public defender. We have not been able to locate that public defender. And it is also important to point out that we reached out to Meta to ask exactly why that video was on there, how long it took or how long it was posted on the website before they took it down. We have not received a response from the company. But of course, it is a horrific crime where we're still asking those questions and still trying to figure out why he did this. Authorities asking for surveillance video from the area if anyone saw anything because they are trying to piece together exactly what happened in this case. Camila Bernal, CNN, Los Angeles.

That move came just days before the law was to take the fact and weeks after a group of libraries, librarians, bookstores and publishing groups filed a lawsuit arguing that the section of the law violated the first amendment. They also argued the law could lead to the removal of young adults and general collections with sexual content.Republican Governor Sarah Sanders signed the law in March. Her communications director says she continues to support the law despite the ruling which is subject to appeal.

It's not just the U.K. It's happening on the U.S./Mexico border. U.S. government is investing in it. It's happening in the European Union as well. They're investing in things like automated lie detectors.But the fundamental question is, how is this information that this A.I. technology is providing going to be used by authorities? Because the A.I. companies are telling us in their advertising that this tech has life-saving capabilities. It can be incredibly positive. It can save people and rescue them when they're in distress in these journeys. But what we found in this investigation, we looked at the deadliest incident in the English Channel last year, four people died. And we found none of this tech appeared to have been used and instead, it's been part of a campaign of hostility and deterrence. Have a listen to what we found. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) POLGLASE (voice-over): It's three in the morning on the 14th of December 2022 in the middle of the English Channel.

The French Coast Guards say the boat is undetectable on shipping radar but estimate it will shortly cross into British waters. Now CNN has found that, at the time of the incident, the U.K. government had expensive A.I. technology designed to spot these boats and knowing that the vessel was soon entering their territory, and that there were people freezing in the water, including children, they could have sent this. A Tekever AR5 drone designed to detect small boats and capable of deploying a life raft. It's licensed by the U.K. government. Even the British prime minister proud to show it off. CNN has established it flew over the same area where the distress call was made on multiple previous journeys. It even flew the day before and after the incident, but not in the hours the vessel was sinking. Instead, it took more than an hour for the first U.K. lifeboat to arrive.

And while the companies tout their life-saving capabilities, footage from these drones is also being used to identify those driving the boats and prosecute them for human trafficking.

In response to a Freedom of Information request submitted by CNN, U.K. Border Force said revealing the tech's capability might aid the criminals facilitating the crossings and increase risk to life at sea. The Coast Guard declined to comment, citing an ongoing investigation into the incident and a court case underway to prosecute the alleged driver of the boat. A new record was set for June with nearly 4,000 people detected arriving to the U.K. But for those that do make it, they face an increasingly hostile welcome. (END VIDEOTAPE) POLGLASE (on camera): And so, this illegal migration bill has become law -- the one we reference in that piece. It now means everyone arriving in the U.K. that way, in a small boat, to seek asylum here will be criminalized. They will be detained and then deported back to their home country or another country that is deemed safe. Now this law has had a lot of controversy here in the U.K. The U.K. Parliament had a lot of debating. The upper House of Lords here said that there were a lot of amendments they wanted to include to protect victims of human trafficking, victims of modern slavery and unaccompanied children that are arriving here on these journeys. These amendments were not included and the bill still went through. And now it has become law. The United Nations put out a statement basically saying that there were some quite serious consequences to this bill. Some of the statement said that the U.K. is now at variance with the country's obligations under the international human rights and refugee law. And it says it will have profound consequences for people in need of international protection.",

We've already had here at this fan zone where I'm in Sydney, fans hanging on the action, particularly this Spain versus Japan game. 4-nil to Japan. The team scored 11 goals so far at this World Cup, really throwing down the gauntlet to its competitors here at the 2011 champions Japan.But all eyes will soon be on the Australia versus Canada match. Both of those teams with a chance to go into the next round, course, host Australia under just that bit much more pressure there, you've to say, playing against Canada, the Tokyo 2020 gold medal medalists. So it was always going to be the match of the group stages. That gold medalists, as I said, versus the highly fancied Matildas. Now just means so much more in the eyes of Australia on the Matilda's team. Coach Tony Gustavsson said it would be a failure if Australia too didn't make out of the group stages as New Zealand unfortunately haven't made it out of theirs either. So much of the game tonight will focus on Sam Kerr. How much will Australia's Tallysman, the straightest captain, be able to play. She went out with a calf injury just before the match against the Republic of Ireland in the first game. She couldn't play when Australia lost to Nigeria in the second. How much will she be able to play in Melbourne today? That's what Australia has been talking about for days now. Waiting to see whether their Matildas could move through to the next round -- Max.",
