In fact, the Israeli government have said that they're prepared to move almost immediately to resume that military action if there is no extension of this hostage exchange deal. Yesterday, it ran up to the wire as well. And the Israeli military put a deadline of 07So there's still some time, there's still a few hours left for a last minute deal to be hammered out. And I expect that behind the scenes diplomatic efforts are in overdrive to try and make sure that this hostage deal that has gone on for seven consecutive days will go on for an eighth because it's, you know, it's in the interests of all parties, Israel is getting significant numbers of its hostages out. And on the Palestinian side in Gaza, they're getting prisoners released and of course, they're getting an important influx of humanitarian aid. Every day, this pause in the violence, this pause in the Israeli military operation continues. And so, look, the hope is that this can go on for longer, but at the moment, there's no deal. And, you know, there's just a few hours to go seven hours at most, we think, before time literally runs out on bringing the parties together for an extension of this deal, Jake.",

Remember, Israel set the number of 10 hostages that it wanted every day in order for this to be a 24 hour pause in the military operation. There were two Israeli hostages released in addition to the 10 yesterday, so they brought that number forward, it seems, and made 10. But I mean, the point is, it's getting increasingly difficult for Hamas, it seems, under the terms of the current deal, which basically focuses on women and children to gather enough hostages in a single day to make this swap.There are still about 140 hostages inside Gaza. And so, there is still Israeli hostages there, as well as other nationalities as well we understand who can be swapped, and Hamas is, you know, sort of in charge in vast swathes of Gaza. But when it comes to the adult males and it comes to the hostages who are members of the Israeli Defense Forces, the Israeli military, then you -- look, what Israeli legislators are saying to me is that Hamas is going to want a different equation, it's going to want a different deal. At the moment, it's getting three prisoners released, for instance, for every one Israeli that set free. If we're talking about much more higher value from their point of view individuals like Israeli soldiers, they're going to want more than that. And so, that is a process of negotiation that the Israeli say they're willing to enter into if there are more hostages being released. But you know, it still has to be agreed and it hasn't been yet.",

Bibas is of course the father of the very youngest hostage, 10 month old Kfir as well as his brother four year old Ariel. Hamas has claimed without producing any evidence as of yet that those two boys as well as their mother, who were all taken hostage back in October 7, said they were all killed by an Israeli airstrike on Gaza. We do not know that to be true. We do not know that they're dead even.Here is an image with a hostage video released today. We're not going to show the video. Of course it's pure Hamas propaganda. It does show the father, Bibas, pleading with Israeli officials to bring him and his family home as soon as possible. He was kidnapped on October 7. He has been held separate from his family since then. The last time I spoke with Yael Engel Lichi, her nephew Ofir Engel was being held hostage by Hamas after he was kidnapped while visiting his girlfriend at kibbutz Be'eri. He since marked his 18th birthday in captivity. After more than 50 days being held by Hamas, you're now seeing some of the very first photos taken of Ofir being reunited with his parents. He was one of the 12 hostages released yesterday. And his aunt, Yael Engel Lichi, joins me now. Thank you for being here. I don't get a lot of opportunities to do good news in -- since October 7. So, this is a nice respite. I'm grateful to be able to show these pictures of your family back together. Now, understanding that after more than 50 days of being captivity, you know, expectations have to be tempered. How's he doing?",

They kept telling him that everyone there, all his girlfriend's family was dead, that his government doesn't seems to take care of.And he was hold in a, I think, so in an apartment. So he was not underground. And he was not alone. So I think he had a lot of luck. You know, it's funny to say, but he had luck being with some other hostages. But if it were 45 days, and I asked him, how did you count the days? How did you know what day it is because he didn't have the chance to see television or radio or nothing? And he told me every day he baited another finger. So as the days went through he knows that -- his nails, not his fingers, so he knows how many days went over. And they were all kept in small room. They had a lot -- very little food. But it's not with the physical terms, it was the psychologic terms. He looked so afraid. And I went there in the hospital and I saw some other children that just went out today and yesterday.

Even if you just account for younger voters who might have a more pro-Palestinian SKU or be less enthusiastic about supporting Israel, people under the age of 30. It doesn't align with what we know about basic polling data.So there is that, there's also a difference if you try to do that apples to apples comparison between Instagram and TikTok in this case, it's about a five to one post difference for Instagram and TikTok, whereas the average is usually two to one or in a band between one to one and 3.2 to one. So again, you have these anomalies that don't seem to make sense, unless there's some other variable that TikTok can come up with. And again, I just want to stress, all that is, is using the metrics, the goalposts that TikTok themselves put out in November when they started to get asked questions about anti-Semitism, which is rampant on their platform. And of course, there were particularly acute cases, like people sharing Osama bin Laden's -- Osama bin Laden's letters to America and praising the content they're in.",

And we don't really have any regulatory process. To me, that's eminently possible. We're working on such legislation right now on the Hill. But, you know, and while I grant that social media in general, is assessable, and it has adverse impacts on kids, under the age of 30, in particular.The problem with TikTok really the unique problem with TikTok is its basic ownership structure, right? It is owned by ByteDance, which is beholden to the Chinese Communist Party. And even if you hate Facebook, or you hate Instagram, or you hate whatever social media company in America, the same thing is not true of those companies. So that is the core of the issue, as well as all the reports we've had about how data might be being used. And then again, just the basic point, that TikTok is increasingly a news platform for young Americans. It's not just about the data. It's not just about the spying or the espionage. It's whether we want to allow it to become the dominant news platform in America. And I think that's a risk we can't take.",
