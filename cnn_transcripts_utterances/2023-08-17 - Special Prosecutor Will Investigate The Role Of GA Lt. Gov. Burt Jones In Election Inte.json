He's now proposing his own date that just happens to be three years away.Plus, the FBI, involved in a new investigation. The grand jurors, who indicted the former President, in Georgia, are now being threatened, and also having their personal information exposed. And new warnings, tonight, in Hawaii, for victims of the wildfires. Beware of scams? As if they, weren't already dealing with enough, this new warning, after so many have lost everything already. I'm Kaitlan Collins. And this is THE SOURCE. Tonight, Donald Trump's delay tactics seem to have gone into overdrive. His new ask, for an extraordinary delay. They now want the judge, to set a trial date, for the Special Counsel's election interference case, nearly three years, from when he was indicted, just a few weeks ago. They are looking for April 2026. That is nearly a year and a half, after the 2024 election. It is obviously long past January 2024, which is when Jack Smith's team wants that trial to start. In papers, that were filed just a few moments ago, Trump's legal team is arguing that the government wants to, in their view, deny, the former President, and his counsel, a fair ability, to prepare for that trial. Trump's team is saying that Smith's proposed timeline would conflict with the other civil and criminal cases that he is also fighting. And while they do know that his obligation, to prepare for this case, is not nullified, because of the other legal issues that he is facing, they say that the court, they believe, should consider the effects that those other prosecutions is inevitably going to have, on this one. They're also noting that there is a mountain of evidence, for them to sort through, totaling 11.5 million pages. Trump, of course, does have a mountain of indictments, piling up. That is something that is apparently bewildering, even to him. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, 45TH U.S. PRESIDENT: Look, I think this is not even possible. Four, over the next, last couple of months. If you talk about an election, they want to put you in jail. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "Also tonight, Donald Trump has just officially called off that news conference, where he was going to really, finally provide the proof, he says, that the 2020 election was stolen.I've been hearing from sources all day that that news conference he had announced, after he was indicted, in Georgia, earlier this week, was really in serious doubt. Because Trump's attorneys had warned him that talking about baseless claims of election fraud, could hurt his case, in upcoming trials, where he's being accused of trying to overturn the election. Trump just confirmed, in a post, on his social media site. But he is saying that his attorneys would prefer to put it in formal legal filings, to fight that latest indictment, in Georgia. So therefore, that news conference won't be necessary. I'm joined, tonight, by former federal prosecutor, Elie Honig. Elie, obviously, April 2026 is a date that kind of surprised everyone, I think. They knew that they were going to push for a delay. How do you think the judge is going to respond to that? ELIE HONIG, FORMER ASSISTANT U.S. ATTORNEY, CNN SENIOR LEGAL ANALYST: Well, Kaitlan, when I first saw this date, 2026, honestly, I thought it was a typo. I said, they can't really mean 2026. I don't think the judge is going to take this seriously at all. I think the judge is going to see it as a wild overreach. That said Donald Trump does in his brief make a compelling argument that DOJ's request that we start four months from now, in January, is also wildly unrealistic. As you said, Trump points out there's 11 million documents here. He almost physically can't go through that in enough time. He also makes an interesting point that the average federal conspiracy case, run-of-the-mill, takes about two years to get to trial. And in fact, some of the people, who stormed the Capitol, fairly straightforward cases, were given two or so years, up until trial. So, he argues that \"I'm being rushed.\" And I think the judge is going to have to find some workable middle ground here.",

And one of the arguments is about all of the discovery evidence.

Also tonight, one of the biggest mysteries that was embedded in that Georgia indictment, we saw, earlier this week, against not just Donald Trump, but also 18 others, was who were the other unnamed members of what prosecutors are calling, quote, the \"Enterprise.\"In the words of the indictment, we are talking about unindicted co- conspirators one through individual 30. We can now say, for sure, who many of those people are, and how they connect to the former President. This comes as the time though -- at the same time that we are learning a special prosecutor, is going to be named, to investigate one of those unindicted co-conspirators, because a judge initially said they were off-limits, to the District Attorney. The list of co-conspirators reaches to the inner depths of Donald Trump's team. Boris Epshteyn is a key Trump adviser to this day. He is also, based on our reporting, co-conspirator number two. He was so close to Trump that you'll recall he was sitting just a few seats away, from the former President, when he was arraigned, here in Manhattan. If you dig through this list, it really runs the gamut, from Bernie Kerik, who was the former New York Police Department Commissioner, Rudy Giuliani's lead investigator; a former surfer from Hawaii; even to the CEO of Cyber Ninjas, that group behind a sham audit of ballots, in the State of Arizona. There are a number of Republican officials on this list as well. The highest ranking one that you can see here is current Lieutenant Governor of Georgia, Burt Jones. That is who a judge ruled that Fani Willis couldn't indict, because she had held a fundraiser for his political opponent. I'm joined now by two people, who know the situation, in Georgia well. U.S. Attorney, Michael Moore. And Geoff Duncan, the former Lieutenant Governor before Burt Jones. And also, we should note, a key witness, in this case. I mean, what do you make when you look at that board? I mean, this is your home state. You know a lot of those faces. MICHAEL MOORE, FORMER U.S. ATTORNEY, MIDDLE DISTRICT OF GEORGIA, PARTNER, MOORE HALL IN ATLANTA: It's not surprising, really at all. And I think they're using this idea of unindicted co-conspirators, to tell a story, and put some context on it. But it also lets a prosecutor reach a little deeper, into the whole of the enterprise, and pull the noose, a little bit tighter, around the group. And it's a valuable tool. It also helps keep cooperators and witnesses in line, because they can recognize that if they do try to do something, against the story, against what they've told might be under oath, at some point, that they could end up on the opposite side of the words more (ph) with Trump. So that's -- it's a good tool. But I'm not surprised to see these folks in it.",

I mean, what do you make of the fact that he is unindicted co- conspirator number eight? GEOFF DUNCAN, (R) FORMER LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR OF GEORGIA, TESTIFIED BEFORE FULTON COUNTY GRAND JURY: So, not really shocking, you know? It was a kind of a technicality. And his team filed the grievance, to get him off the initial list. But he had a front-row seat for this, right? He was a State Senator, at the time, and I was the Lieutenant Governor. And it really was kind of an odd motion for him. He kind of built this little coalition, of a handful of senators. And sure enough, they were the mouthpiece for Donald Trump, inside the Senate, and they were really the ringleaders, of trying to set up the meetings, at the Capitol and whatnot. And it certainly ended up being a fake elector. It was just interesting. I mean, these guys just got infatuated, in my opinion, to be in the cool kids club, right? It just was this draw of attention.

They do have their work cut out for them, though. The President's average approval rating, right now, is hovering somewhere around 40 percent. He has been struggling to sell his Bidenomics message to voters, who say that they are still dissatisfied, with the current state of the economy. So, joining me now, on this, is Biden's 2024 Campaign Co-Chair, former White House Senior Adviser, Cedric Richmond. Cedric, thank you for being here. I mean, the President has been out, on the road, trying to sell what the White House is calling Bidenomics, and this idea of a strong economy. But why do you think that that hasn't impressed voters yet? CEDRIC RICHMOND, SENIOR ADVISOR TO DEMOCRATIC NATIONAL COMMITTEE, BIDEN CAMPAIGN 2024 CO-CHAIR: Well, I think it's how you ask the question. If you look at the latest Pew Research, you see that 79 percent of the people in this country are either satisfied, or very satisfied, with the job that they have. And then, you put that on top of the fact that the President's created 13 million jobs, since coming in to office, and you look at GDP, and all of those things? It's a very good positive. So, to me, it's how you ask the question. The other thing that I would point you to is the fact that Bidenomics is really a value proposition, is the fact that this President believes that we're going to make this country, and continue to grow this country, by building from the bottom-up and the middle-out.",

He's always made it about the people. And I think that that's what separates him, from President Trump. President Trump is all about himself. President Biden is about delivering for people, and trying to improve their lives, which is why you don't see him, focusing on taking away freedoms, like Republicans, and what you're going to hear in Milwaukee.

One, attack Joe Biden and the media three to five times. Two, state positive vision two to three times. Three, hammer Vivek Ramaswamy in a response. Four, defend Donald Trump in absentia in response to a Chris Christie attack. Joining me now, to discuss, is Paul Begala, and Jason Osborne. Jason, I mean, you're familiar with debate prep. Is he going to be able to still use these very specific attacks? And you're including, the one on Chris Christie saying, \"Trump isn't here, just leave him alone. He's too weak to defend himself.\" But \"I don't think we want to join forces with someone on this stage who's auditioning for a show on MSNBC.\" That's what they are telling him to say to Chris Christie. I mean, can he still use that next week? JASON OSBORNE, FORMER TRUMP CAMPAIGN ADVISER, REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST, HELPED PREP DR. BEN CARSON FOR 2016 DEBATES: Well, I mean, the sad -- no, on that point. But I mean, the sad thing is, at least from what I've read is, virtually everything in the memo is stuff that everybody in the country that's a political person would suggest DeSantis do, right? I mean, highlighting your policies, two to three policies. That's basic debate prep, 101. I think DeSantis now is, having to configure the fact that his Super PAC is amateurish, and they're making rookie mistakes, in a time, where you can't make these kind of mistakes. I mean hide this stuff on someplace that nobody else can find. But certainly don't put together 700 pages of a memo, and expect five days before a debate that the candidate is going to have a chance to digest it.
