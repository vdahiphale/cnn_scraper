And here's part of what he had to say. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) VIVEK RAMASWAMY (R), 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: This myth of white supremacy, the closest you could find is Jussie Smollett, while you were actually speaking of trusting the media, jumping up and down over some false narrative. The best way you're able to find your best instance of white supremacy was a guy who was actually paying his other fellow people to be actually staging something that didn't happen. And so stop picking on this farce of some figment that exists at some infinitesimally small fringe of the American public today to open our eyes to the actual real threats that we face.

Harvard is still very much on the hook to turn over this mountain of documents.And we also know that there's an anti-Semitism investigation from that same House committee. There's also a federal probe from the Education Department looking into allegations of anti-Semitism and islamophobia. And, at the same time, they've also got to find a new president of this school. One who's going to repair the reputation that has clearly taken a big hit. Now, I also think how all of this has gone down the last few weeks has raised some questions about the Harvard corporation, right, that's the powerful and secretive top board at Harvard. It's chaired by Penny Pritker, the billionaire former Obama official. And there's a lot of questions about what happened here, right? I mean how do they go from saying they're unanimously behind Claudine Gay, to three weeks later accepting her resignation. How is the independent review into her academic writings done so quickly? And in hindsight, how is it so incomplete? So, that is all going to have to be answered. I talked to former Facebook executive Sam Lessin, he's a venture capitalist and he's a Harvard grad. And he told me he would give the Harvard corporation a D over how they handled this situation. He said that Gay's resignation is just the beginning. He said it's a first step that demonstrates that Harvard is not lost and can change, but Harvard still needs to address the deeper leadership and governance failures that came to ahead this fall.

How about that?There is definitely a tangible reason to get excited. And I'll explain why. This is the storm that's going to bring the energy to the East Coast. In fact, you can follow it as it traverses the deep south, pulls in some moisture from the Gulf of Mexico, brings rain to Atlanta. And then, yes, has its eyes centered on the East Coast. Exactly where, that is still to be determined. We know these are a game of miles when it terms -- in terms of the path of these snowstorms that potentially bring snow to the populated areas along the I-95 corridor, but certainly a chance. Will it bring snow to the coastline, New York City, Philadelphia, well, yes. I'm excited about that. But will it happen? We need to iron out those details in the days to come. But it is not lost on us that New York City has not received over 1 inch of snowfall in nearly 700 days. And Philadelphia, you had your least amount of snow in 2023 ever. Only 0.3 inches of snowfall. So, we talk about that exact path that is so important. A few different scenarios here. Focus your attention on this black dot. We call that the 40 west 70 north benchmark. And where the low pressure system ultimately ends up traversing depends on who will get the snowfall and who will get the rain. You can see the European and the American model showing some differences there. And that is the difference between rain and snow for our kids.",
