Key players in the region are stepping up efforts to prevent terrorist organizations from making gains after the fall of the Assad regime.Reuters is now reporting that rebel leader Mohammed al-Jolani said in a written statement that he would dissolve the Syrian security forces and shut down all notorious prisons. Meantime, there's fighting underway between pro-Turkish and Kurdish factions in northern Syria. The Syrian Democratic Forces, a coalition of militant groups dominated by Kurdish organizations, says Turkey and its militia allies are bombarding areas near the Turkey-Syria border. A resident told CNN a U.S. military convoy was seen at the northern entrance of Raqqa on Wednesday. The U.S. has worked with the SDF since 2017 to eliminate the remnants of ISIS and has some 900 troops still stationed in northern Syria. The Israeli military claims to have confiscated several Syrian tanks along the buffer zone that separates the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights from the rest of Syria. The Israeli Prime Minister had ordered the military to seize the buffer zone, as Israel insists it's working to eliminate threats to its security. Video has surfaced on social media, which allegedly shows a warehouse in Syria packed with the illicit drug Captagon. It's reportedly located at the headquarters of a military division near Damascus. If confirmed, the discovery would support claims that the Assad regime was involved in actively exporting the drug. The dawn of a new era in Syria is prompting refugees in Turkey to head back home.

At daybreak, this is all that remains of the Syrian fleet at Latakia after Israel launched a wave of strikes intended to destroy the strategic arsenal of the newly-deposed regime of Bashar al-Assad.

And one of the aspects of it is exactly that Israeli incursion that the Arab League is complaining about.One of the things that the Israelis have done is, as you mentioned, move beyond the ceasefire line that has existed since 1974 between Israel and Syria. And it's actually the first time since the 1973 war that Israel has gone on to a position that is closing in on Damascus. Now, Israel is denying that they are moving toward Damascus and would be, from a military standpoint, in my view, very foolish for the Israelis to do that. But they have captured Syrian equipment. They have gone into areas that the Syrian army occupied before several Syrian army posts have been abandoned. And so the Israelis have taken those areas over, they say, in order to prevent terrorist groups from occupying them and threatening the northern part of Israel, and obviously their positions and settlements in the Golan Heights region. So that's that part of the equation in Syria. The other parts, of course, include fighting in the northern areas. Kurdistan, the SDF forces that are supported by the United States, the Kurdish-backed forces there, are fighting with the SNA, which is the Syrian National Army, which is supported by Turkey. So this is where the Turkish and U.S. interests actually diverge. And in essence, those are several of the things that are going on. Plus, of course, there is movement in places like Deir ez-Zor, where the Kurdish forces that had previously occupied the town have basically moved out of that because of local populations' resistance to their occupation there.

Patel has been on Capitol Hill this week looking to drum up support for his nomination and says he will be ready on day one to fill the post. CNN's Kristen Holmes has more now on Donald Trump's reaction to the news. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) KRISTEN HOLMES, CNN U.S. NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Donald Trump and his allies have been celebrating the resignation of Christopher Wray. In fact, Donald Trump posted on True Social saying this, the resignation of Christopher Wray is a great day for America as it will end the weaponization of what has become known as the United States Department of Injustice. I just don't know what happened to him. We will now restore the rule of law for all Americans. Under the leadership of Christopher Wray, the FBI illegally raided my home without cause, worked diligently on illegally impeaching and indicting me, and has done everything else to interfere with the success and future of America. Now, he goes on and on, he talks about Kash Patel, but the reason why this is so significant is because he is talking about one specific instance in this post, which we are told by sources around him, was kind of a turning point in his relationship with Christopher Wray. One, Donald Trump was not happy with the end of his time in office, particularly January 6th, the fact that he believed that his law enforcement should have stood up and rallied around him, which the FBI, he believes, did not after that election. But the other part of this was when his house was searched in 2022. This was a search that was conducted by the FBI looking for classified documents, which ultimately led to his own indictment, Trump's indictment in 2023. Donald Trump viewed this as a breach. It is something he has mentioned. He even brought it up over the weekend when he was asked about Christopher Wray. Now, in that same interview, when he was talking about Christopher Wray, he was asked if he was going to fire him. He alluded to the fact that yes, he would, saying that if I've already put forward Kash Patel, there's reason to believe he would have to fill somebody's job, and that job would have been Christopher Wray's. Now, it seems clear that Wray had understood that there was two pathways here. One was resignation. Two was being fired by President- elect Donald Trump when he came to office. But when I'm talking to Trump's team, they feel very pleased that this is the path that Wray chose because they believe it paved the way for Kash Patel, who they say is doing very well on Capitol Hill in these various meetings with senators.
