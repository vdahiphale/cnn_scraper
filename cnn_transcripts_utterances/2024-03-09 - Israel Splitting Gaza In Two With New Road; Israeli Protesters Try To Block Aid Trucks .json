And Gaza has stayed on that trajectory. So far, President Biden, while he has complained privately and increasingly now publicly about prime minister Netanyahu, he's being more open about Israel's obstruction of the aid effort, as have other senior officials like Secretary Blinken and Administrator Power. But fundamentally, that hasn't changed. And until that changes, we are not going to be able to -- we're not going to see a counter famine effort succeed inside Gaza until there is an end to the fighting and until there is space for aid agencies to operate. Aid agencies are still being blocked by the IDF within Gaza and they are being obstructed in bringing things into Gaza by Israeli inspections. They are still occasionally being struck by bombardment by the Israeli military. Whether that's intentional or not, it's still happening. Those are not conditions in which it's possible to mount an effective counter famine operation. President Biden needs to decide, when is he going to draw a firm line with prime minister Netanyahu?

I mean, the first being, for example, that missile defense is probably quite a bit more effective and feasible than we had previously assumed. For example, the experience prior, we had before from the Middle East, really indicated that even intercepting subsonic cruise missiles, for example, should be rather difficult. But what we're seeing in Ukraine is that these missile systems get intercepted at a fairly large rate. And Western missile defense systems are fairly effective at doing so.

That's something they've been concerned about for quite a while, is that Western states may use their conventional missile technologies to potentially threaten the survivability of their nuclear arsenals. What we see right now in Ukraine war is that Western cruise missiles, like Storm Shadows, SCALP-EG; they're tremendously effective. They're very accurate. They are very potent weapon systems. And I do believe that this may reinforce some of the fears that Russia has experienced before when it comes to strategic stability. Doesn't necessarily mean, right, that the likelihood of a nuclear war is strongly increasing. But it definitely, I assume, will put some or will force the Russian leadership to reconsider and continue to think about their survivability of their nuclear arsenal.

It was an event that was going on.Now I do not have any details yet about what exactly happened, what exactly was talked about during this meeting. Was just described me as a quote-unquote, \"social media,\" essentially saying, the sources, that they were sitting down, two men without any agenda. But of course, it is hard to imagine Viktor Orban and Donald Trump sitting down without any agenda. Now the reason why this is so significant is twofold. One, the White House did not issue any sort of formal invitation. Two, Orban did not reach out to the White House. And I am told that he did reach out to Trump's team to set up this meeting. The other part of this is that Donald Trump is not only a former president but he is also the presumptive Republican nominee. And he could potentially be president again. And this gives you a look at the kind of leaders that he might align himself with on the world stage. Orban is an authoritarian. He has fought against the free press, calling it fake news. He has been rigid on immigration. He has been rigid on LGBTQ rights. He is, for all intents and purposes, he believes and steady believes that democracy doesn't work. Donald Trump has praised Orban. He has said that he believes his policies are good and at one point even said, some people don't like him because he is a strong man. But it's good to have a strong man controlling your country. Again, this could be an example or at least a reading of the tea leaves of the kind of leaders Donald Trump would align himself with if he is reelected to the White House in November. Now we're still talking to sources, trying to figure out what exactly was said if there was any business that was talked about as these two leaders met.

And this law could have deep ramifications for the city's status as a global business hub.Known as Article 23, the bill outlaws crimes, including treason, insurrection, theft of state secrets, sabotage and external interference. It includes sentences of up to life in prison for treason, 20 years for espionage and 10 years for state secrets. And Hong Kong officials say that it will fill loopholes in a sweeping national security law that was imposed by Beijing in 2020 after mass anti-government protests. They also point out that many Western nations have similar legislation. Around two decades ago, Article 23 was shelved after an attempt to enact it drew 0.5 million residents onto the streets in protest. No such scenes of public opposition are expected this time around. Beijing's national security crackdown has fundamentally transformed Hong Kong. Dozens of political opponents have been arrested, civil society groups disbanded and outspoken media outlets shut down. On Thursday, Hong Kong's top leader, John Lee, said he urged the legislature to vet the bill at full speed. In a statement, he said this, quote, \"Completing the legislative work, even one day earlier, means we can more effectively safeguard national security one day earlier. The HKSAR can then focus its efforts on developing the economy, improving people's livelihood and maintaining the long-term prosperity and stability of Hong Kong.\" The draft comes a little over a week after a month-long public consultation period for it ended. The city's legislature started debate on the bill on Friday and there will be several rounds of debate and the convening of a special meeting. The process could take weeks -- Kristie Lu Stout, CNN, Hong Kong. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

And truth is there's little hard evidence to support it. Other nefarious theories say someone entered the cockpit and hijack the plane. Then, there are mechanical issues.
