Letitia James is one person they've criticized for this very point.But one of the impressions they've had for Alvin Bragg has been the decision to go from a misdemeanor to a felony. That's been the point at the most contention here. And in order to have it be - I mean you're talking about a regular misdemeanor case, which is less than six months prison time, et cetera.

But he's got to make this case by putting in a combination of McConney's notes on what Allen Weisselberg has said. Allen Weisselberg was not actually there to add this whole thing up.

But they were able to show that he's a pathological liar. That he's lied in just about every stage of his life, about just about anything. And they don't - they necessarily haven't shaken him emotionally, you know, where he's broken down and given that Perry Mason moment of, yes, I lied. But with the text passengers last week, it was a great way for them to kind of end the afternoon. I think they have a great rhythm going. And now - and it's much easier the third time - the third day you're questioning somebody. You really have much more control over what you're asking and a lot more controlled over the witness. But the point earlier is absolutely right, you never know what a jury is thinking about. You never know what facts they're actually focusing in on it.
