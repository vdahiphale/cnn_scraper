      "sentences": "All right, the breaking news, you can see, new explosions seen and heard by CNN crews in Beirut. Those are new pictures just coming in.Israel says its air force hit Hezbollah's intelligence headquarters in Beirut. The new blast follow an Israeli missile strike in the heart of the city overnight that killed at least nine people. Also this morning, Israel is signaling what it is calling a strong, painful response against Iran that they say is coming soon. Iran attacked Israel with missiles earlier this week. The leader of Hezbollah, of course, over the weekend was also assassinated. President Biden's message this morning is that Israel has a right to defend itself, but he has also cautioned restraint. OK, with us now is former Defense Secretary William Cohen. Mr. Secretary, thank you so much for being with us this morning. What do you think Iran's current capabilities even are? I'm asking you because people are warning Israel, you know, you don't want to respond too much. That could - that could, you know, ignite some kind of wider war. But what could Iran conceivably do now to Israel that it hasn't already?",

      "sentences": "Well, it could attack targets where we have our military personnel. It could attack targets in Iraq, in Syria, also in the gulf states where we have thousands of our military personnel. We have them on ships. We have them in Bahrain. So, there are a number of targets that Iran could respond to by attacking the United States. That would be a big mistake, in my judgment, because that would then require the United States to become very actively involved in attacking Iran, which President Biden is reluctant to do.So, what he is doing is urging caution on the part of the Israeli saying, strike back, we know you're going to strike back hard. But take care that you don't end up killing lots of innocent people during the process. We expect you to go after military targets, intelligence targets, but not innocent civilians.",

To the extent that they're developing chemical weapons, that would be an appropriate target.Obviously, the most threatening to Israel would be the potential development of nuclear weapons. It's the biggest fear on the part of the Israelis should Iran ever get to that point where they can just develop and produce multiple weapons that would be an existential threat to the Israelis. And - but the difficulty for them is that those facilities are spread out over a large part of Iran. No one site. It would not be a single day operation or even a week operation. So, it's going to take - it would take a real sustained air campaign and a missile attack campaign to take out those capabilities on Iran. And I don't know - I don't believe that the Israelis, at this point, have that capability. So, they would ask the United States to participate, and President Biden has said, no, thank you.",

To the extent that Hezbollah starts striking Israel directly in their urban areas, as they have been trying to do recently, then I think the Israelis are going to respond and attack those sites in Beirut where Hezbollah has either military operations or intelligence that they don't apparently this morning. And what they're saying is, we know you're burying (ph) your military intelligence capability in civilian areas. We don't care. We're going to take them out. No matter how many we kill, we're going to take out your military and intelligence operations.We might approach that somewhat differently, but we, the United States, have never been in an existential threat since World War II. And so oppose - imposing our standards on the Israelis at this point is not going to be accepted by them. And I don't think it should be.",

Israel's never going to be safe unless they provide autonomy and independence and certainly sovereignty to the Palestinian people. And Israel won't be safe until that happens. And the Palestinians will never be saved from Israeli attacks until they recognize that.So, it's pretty clear what needs to be done. I don't think the Israeli, under the current administration, are interested in having any kind of a two-state solution. I think, ultimately, that's where we have to get to. Getting there is going to be very bloody.",

I want my children to have autonomy over their body. I want them to have rights if they are - if they are gay or trans. I want them to live in a planet that's not suffocating them. And I would love for them to live in a democracy. And I now understand that that's a privilege, and it's a privilege that we need to fight for.

You know, in the time since then, we have had many conversations about what's happening in our country. And I do always share my opinion, and he shares his. And so we have open communication. But as time has gone on, and as, you know, things have gotten worse and worse, I - I do bring it up less and less because I see that it's not changing anything and I'm - when I spend time with my dad, I want to connect with him. And that makes it very hard. And I think that's something a lot of Americans can relate to. And I think that is why we need a president who allows us to disagree without all of this hatred and anger.

All he cares about, all Trump cares about is maintaining power. He's made that very, very clear, that he will do anything, say anything, stand on anyone's backs just to get power.
