Trump has to win Pennsylvania. He could win everything else and lose Pennsylvania and lose. Vice President Harris has to win Pennsylvania. She can win other states that Biden won in 2020 but lose PA and still lose.

About three months ago, I did a focus group on behalf of a major Republican donor with Republican voters in South Georgia, rural Georgia evangelicals, they fit that profile and the fundamental concern of the focus group of my qualitative analysis was to figure out whether or not they would provide enough room for the former president to moderate on this issue while still supporting him. If it meant winning the election in November, every last one of those participants in my focus groups said absolutely, yes.
