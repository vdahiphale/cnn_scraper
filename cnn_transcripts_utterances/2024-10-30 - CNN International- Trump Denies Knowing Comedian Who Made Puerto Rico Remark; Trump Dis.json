And ahead on CNN Newsroom, it is the final sprint with less than one week to go until Election Day in the U.S. The candidates are on a battleground blitz as the extremely close race heads towards the finish line.Plus, sports and politics collide ahead of the U.S. election, could endorsements from athletes and other sports personalities sway voters? We'll discuss. And international condemnation is growing after an Israeli air strike kills dozens of people in Northern Gaza, including children. We're live in Jerusalem with the very latest. Well, the finish line is well with insight just six days ago until Election Day in a race that still remains too close to call, even at this late stage and both campaigns not letting up. Kamala Harris will be hitting three battleground states today. She's going to start in Raleigh, North Carolina for a \"Get Out the Vote Rally\". Then she heads on to Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. On Tuesday, Harris made a final appeal to undecided voters at a symbolic venue. The vice president choosing the ellipse for this moment, the same place that Former President Donald Trump spoke nearly four years ago on January 6th, before his supporters attacked the U.S. Capitol. Harris says that the choice is clear for voters a nation divided or one that's united. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KAMALA HARRIS, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE U.S., (D) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: America for too long, we have been consumed with too much division, chaos and mutual distrust, and it can be easy then to forget a simple truth. It doesn't have to be this way. It doesn't have to be this way. It is time to stop pointing fingers. We have to stop pointing fingers and start locking arms. It is time to turn the page on the drama and the conflict, the fear and division. It is time for a new generation of leadership in America. (END VIDEO CLIP) SOLOMON: But rather than basking in the afterglow of Harris' speech, her campaign is instead dealing with a new headache following a remark by President Joe Biden. Speaking to a Latino organization on Tuesday, virtually Biden criticized a recent Trump campaign rally where a speaker comedian called Puerto Rico, an island of garbage. Biden appeared to say that it's Trump supporters who are garbage before clarifying his remarks. Here's what Harris had to say about the matter last hour. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

How concerned are you, Bryan?BRYAN LANZA, SENIOR ADVISER, TRUMP 2024 CAMPAIGN: First of all, thank you for having me. Listen, I don't think we're as concerned as people expect us to be. You have to remember; President Trump has delivered to the Puerto Rican community when he was president. I think the Puerto Ric community is fed up with the Biden Harris Administration. The Biden Harris Administration basically bankrupted that community in the last four years. And so, looking for change, and Donald Trump is that change agent, and we offer that change. We offer a better economic path. As for the insult you know that the comment made, I think the campaign was pretty clear, pretty clear where we stand. It doesn't share our values and it doesn't share the values of the president. But I will tell you this. We know what shares Kamala Harris's values. We know that her vice president nominee called people who were at the rally Nazis. You know, there was a Holocaust survivor at the rally. He had the temerity to say something is disgusting Tim Walz, that a Holocaust survivor is a Nazi, and then the next day, literally, 24 hours later. I mean, I'm sure he's trying to clarify it, but -- you know Joe Biden referred to -- you know to half the country as garbage. You know, those are Puerto Ricans that he referred to as garbage. There's Latinos myself that he's referring to as garbage. So, we know where the Democratic Party stands when they think of Republican voters. We heard it in Obama in 2008 when he said, we clenched to our guns and our Bible. We heard it from Hillary Clinton, which he referred to us as deplorables. You know, every couple of years we see a moment of how they really think of the American voters, and we saw that this past weekend and last night, they're disgusted by the American voters. They call them garbage, and they call them Nazis. And that's just the nature of the politics in the Democratic Party, because they have no message to close on the end, because they don't offer any change they offer the status quo.",

It was a comic, a third party. What you have with respect to the Harris campaign, it was her VP nominee who called a Holocaust survivor, a Nazi who attended the rally. It was her VP nominee who said that young kids under five who attended this rally were Nazis, and Kamala Harris is not condemned at.Let me tell you a little about the rally what I saw. I saw Jews praying at the rally. You know, you don't see a Democratic rallies Jews praying because they're harassed. They have to do it in hiding. You know, we saw Jews praying that the DNC Convention in secret rooms where they were away from the rest of the volunteer the Democratic Party volunteers. You didn't see that at this -- at this -- at this rally this last week. And you saw Jews praying in public -- you know, unafraid, unscared of the violence individual that comes from the Democratic Party towards their faith. So, I appreciate what Maria is trying to do. She's trying to sort of cover up where the Democratic Party really lies. But their hatred towards the Jewish community was relevant and was present at the -- at our -- at our rally, because Jews could openly pray, and it's never present at the Harris rally, because they have to hide when they pray. That's where the Democratic Party is today. And I understand Maria has a tough job, sort of pushing away from Joe Biden's comments and from Tim Walz's comments. But ultimately, the voters are going to make the decision that that hate is what separated America, but only thing that can restore us is going to be the economic future that President Trump and the border security he is bringing forward.",

And then he will be traveling to Wisconsin later today for a state that he narrowly lost four years ago. And so far, they feel very bullish about their chances to hold on to North Carolina, and they feel good about where they stand in those blue wall states. The Trump campaign believes that there are quite a few voters who arenot being captured by a lot of the polls that have come out recently, showing this race neck and neck that is not capturing the work that they have put in trying to get, not low propensity voters, that is people who don't normally engage in politics to show up this cycle. They are convinced that that is the path to victory is running up the score in parts of the state where they know conservatives live but don't necessarily tend to show up, and that is a big part of what they are trying to do in these battleground states. Now you see the message right behind me in North Carolina, we are in Rocky Mountains where the sign says, vote early. 3.2 million people had already voted and cast a ballot in this state, as of yesterday. There will be many more counted today, and so that is clearly the message. What is interesting, though, is even as he is telling his supporters, go out there and vote early, take advantage of vote by mail, get in line and cast that ballot already, he is also, at the same time, sewing doubt about the election process as it is. Yesterday, he attacked voting in Pennsylvania, claiming that there are already signs that there are attempts to steal the election there. Obviously, that is a gross lie about what is actually transpiring in that state, where the election officials have said they are working around the clock to make sure this election goes off without a hit.

This is normally a dry river bed with hardly any water. As of this morning, it was nearly at the top.A lot of people had to abandon their cars along the highway just to make sure they weren't caught up in the flood. Fortunately, a lot of that water has come down now, but what it has meant is that a lot of people are now still conducting search and rescue efforts, still trying to find people, trying to find a lot of their belongings. A lot of the cars actually were the most dangerous objects swept up into the floods in these narrow, rural streets and in small towns, and that's been some of the most difficult part. But you're absolutely right now, the enormous amount of water that was dropped here, basically a year's worth of water, fell in less than eight hours in Valencia, where I'm at now. And that was just really an unprecedented amount. What we've seen here hasn't happened for decades. So, it's really been a shock to the community, Rahel.",

That's according to economists encouraged by the latest GDP report from the Commerce Department, it found that America's GDP, or Gross Domestic Product, expanded by an annual rate of 2.8 percent in the third quarter. That is stronger than what some economists have projected. Let's bring in CNN's Matt Egan, who joins us now from New York. So, I think historically, this will be a pretty good number. Break it down for us, Matt, what do we learn?",

Nothing will slow it down, not high inflation or high interest rates or this crazy election cycle. It just keeps going. And so, today's report is GDP. It's the broadest measure of economic growth.It's kind of like a quarterly report card for the economy, and it showed that the economy grew at an annual rate of 2.8 percent during the third quarter. That is very solid growth. It is driven by more spending, more spending from governments, from business, and most importantly, more spending from consumers. Despite all of that talk that maybe American shoppers were kind of getting tapped out, consumer spending up by almost 4 percent in the last quarter alone. And look, this is all happening at a time when some people had been worried about a recession. I mean, Rahel, I remember you and I were covering some pretty weak GDP reports about 2.5 years ago. There all these worries about a recession, but the truth is that it's nowhere in sight. In fact, a growing number of economists are getting confident that maybe the Fed has actually pulled this off, right? Maybe they pulled off the soft landing, teaming inflation, without wrecking the jobs market of Former St. Louis Fed President James Bullard, he told CNN that we should just declare it a soft landing at this point. And none of this, of course, is to say that the economy is perfect. I mean, there are real challenges when it comes to affordability, groceries, rent, day care, car insurance. It is tough out there. But the good news is that, because the economy continues to grow, because hiring continues, paychecks are going up. They are increasingly going up at a faster pace every single month than prices are. And so hopefully that means that more and more people are able to catch up to these higher prices and start to feel better about things, Rahel.",

For example, to have an athlete step forward and say something about the candidate themselves makes a big difference, because it makes the candidate also look like they're a regular American, that they're into things that other Americans are into. And I would just point out that politicians have used athletes as somebody who can be a prop for them to present themselves to the American people.It goes back as long as there's been professional sports in this country. It goes back to the Johnson Administration. Not Lyndon Johnson, but Andrew Johnson. 1866 that was the first time a baseball team was greeted at the White House.

They want sports to be an escape from politics.They want sports to be an escape from the divisions and the anger that seem to plague our society, but at the same time, precisely because they see sports as an escape, politicians then can use athletes to say, let's escape from the current mess and mire that we are currently in and actually move forward to a time of greater unity and prosperity.

So, there are lines that a lot of the leagues like to set up where they say, this is something that could actually appeal to our fan base. The NBA tends to have a much more liberal, urban fan base, but this is something that will actually push people away.
