Now, we did get revisions for the prior two months that we can show you here. March was revised lower. February was revised lower, in terms of unemployment falling to 3.4 percent, tying a 50-year low. Now, we have been in this range with unemployment of about 3.4 to 3.7 percent since March of 2022. As the president just said, we saw more people come off the sidelines. That was good news, a lot of that being driven by women, a lot of that being driven by women of color. So that was good to see. In terms of where we saw in terms of sector, where we saw the largest job gains, professional and business services, really strong demand for accountants. We saw that. Health care adding 40,000 jobs, a strong demand for nursing care facilities, that sort of thing, also leisure and hospitality adding 31,000. Important to point out, however, with leisure and hospitality, Jessica, that this industry is still not where it was before the pandemic. They're still down about 400,000 jobs. So, in many ways, they are still catching up. And then here's the caveat. The jobs support is considered more of a lagging indicator. This is not necessarily where you would see the first signs of trouble. I spoke a short time ago to Julia Pollak. She's the chief economist of ZipRecruiter. And here's what she told me, Jessica. She said: \"The issue, of course, is that this,\" this being the jobs report, \"is not necessarily where the risks show up first. Things can turn on a dime in the financial sector very quickly. We have seen with SVB how quickly things can deteriorate when investors smell a rat.\" That said, still very strong demand for workers and, as I said, summer came a little early this year, as things heat back up.",

The head of the Wagner Group, the private military company leading the siege in Bakhmut, has been criticizing Kremlin leadership for failing to give his fighters enough supplies and ammunition. Now he is threatening to pull out of that battle entirely. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) YEVGENY PRIGOZHIN, WAGNER GROUP CHIEF (through translator):  I am officially informing the defense minister, chief of the general staff, and the supreme commander in chief that my guys will not be taking useless, unjustified losses in Bakhmut without ammunition. So, on May 10, 2023, we are pulling out of Bakhmut. We have only two or so kilometers left to capture out of 45. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

In December of last year, the National Security Council spokesperson, John Kirby, estimated they had close to 50,000 fighters deployed in Ukraine alone, a majority of them convicts freed from prison in order to fight. The figurehead of the Wagner Group, who we just heard from, Yevgeny Prigozhin, so close to the Kremlin, he's been known as Putin's chef. He says he founded Wagner in 2014. And CNN has tracked Wagner mercenaries' movements in the Central African Republic, Sudan, Libya, Mozambique, Ukraine, and Syria. They have been accused of some of the worst human rights abuses in several of these countries. And, for that reason, the U.S. Treasury Department designated the group as a transnational criminal organization in January this year. CNN's Nic Robertson, he's in Ukraine tracking this. And, Nick, it's not the first time we have seen Prigozhin complain about his supplies on the front line, but to threaten to pull out entirely, I wonder, do Ukrainian commanders take that threat seriously?",

      "sentences": "They provide their own interpretation on it, and they can see that this perhaps is becoming the only reality left open to Prigozhin, because if -- they say, if Russia doesn't fix its ammunition supply problem and Prigozhin continues to lose 100 troops a day, which is what's happening, they say that that's actually going to potentially destroy Wagner.So, therefore, Prigozhin has no other option, if he doesn't get the extra ammunition, to pull out, or face Wagner having catastrophic losses. And it's interesting. When you listen to what Wagner Prigozhin went on to say was, he said:  We will pull out, we will go away, we will lick our wounds, and we will be there when the Russian nation needs us. So I think part of this is bluff, but part of it is also perhaps political positioning. I think it's very significant as well that, just today, Prigozhin announced that he was hiring Russia's former deputy defense minister, who was only pushed out of his job last week, as one of his deputies at Wagner. So this is very significant, that it clearly seems to indicate that there are highly placed defense officials within the Kremlin who actually are in favor of Prigozhin. And Prigozhin is specifically calling out the defense chief, the army chief of staff. So there are clearly some fundamental fissures that he's trying to exploit for whatever reason, exploit because Putin wants him to, because Putin wants to have fall guys, like the defense minister, Sergei Shoigu, when he doesn't get the gains in Ukraine that he wants, or because Prigozhin thinks he can get some political capital of his own and perhaps run for high office. None of that's clear. But what is clear is, that gives somewhat of a boost to Ukrainian morale when they go into the fight in Bakhmut, because they know the Russians are hurting and they're fighting internally.",

Congressman, we're grateful to have you. Thanks for sharing part of your afternoon. I want to ask you about a number of things, but, first, let's take a step back. Of course, let's take a step back and talk about the drone strike over the Kremlin a few days ago, Russia claiming the United States is behind it, the United States denying that. Do you have any indication of what led to this explosion over the Kremlin? REP. JOSH GOTTHEIMER (D-NJ):  No. I'm actually getting an intelligence briefing before the committee on Monday. What we know often, though, is, in cases like this, Russia is not often a truth-teller about what happened. So I'm eager to get the facts. I mean, I think the bigger issue -- and you were just discussing this a minute ago -- is actually the volatility going on right now in Russia with Putin, with Wagner, and how much of a challenge that is for him, given how much he depends on them. This is a huge boost to Ukraine. It's obviously a very tough -- it continues to be a very tough conflict. But the -- but I think this would be a huge setback to Russia.",

But the bottom line is, the fight back from the Ukrainian people has just been heroic. And every time Putin thinks he's got something locked up, he gets a serious fight back from the Ukrainians, from the allies, and who are in lockstep behind Ukraine.
