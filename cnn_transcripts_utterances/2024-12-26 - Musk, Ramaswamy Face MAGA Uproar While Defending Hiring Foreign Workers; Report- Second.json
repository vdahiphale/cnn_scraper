      "sentences": "Straight from THE SOURCE tonight.Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy don't often find themselves facing backlash from the MAGA universe. But tonight, there's a major divide between Trump's advisers and his MAGA base. Also, a second black box was just recovered that could provide new clues about what caused that passenger jet to crash, killing dozens, overseas, along with terrifying new video from inside, as the plane was going down. And while LeBron James is telling the NFL to back off the NBA's night. Beyonce might like to have a word. Her Christmas halftime show not only broke the internet, but also streaming records. I'm Kaitlan Collins. And this is THE SOURCE. Tonight, as President-elect Donald Trump is preparing for a widespread immigration crackdown, when he takes office 25 days from now, we're seeing a crack between some of his top advisers and his MAGA base. Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy are both facing major blowback, from their own supporters, for not only backing but encouraging offering more visas to highly-skilled foreign workers. Over the Christmas holiday, Musk posted this, online, saying, Think of this like a pro sports team: if you want your TEAM to win the championship, you need to recruit top talent wherever they may be. He later added, I am referring to bringing in via legal immigration the top 0.1 percent of engineering talent as being essential for America to keep winning. He's talking about H-1B visas, which allow employers to hire highly- skilled foreign workers. Musk, who himself is from South Africa, said that he once had this kind of visa, and he's arguing that Silicon Valley is facing a shortage of excellent engineering talent, as he put it. But the annual cap on those kinds of visas, right now, is at 65,000, with another 20,000 for those who get a masters or a doctorate in the U.S. Musk is being backed up by his partner, in Trump's government efficiency initiative, Vivek Ramaswamy. He says it's a cultural issue that there aren't more competitive engineers in the U.S. Here's what he said online. A culture that celebrates the prom queen over the math olympiad champ, or the jock over the valedictorian, will not produce the best engineers. A culture that venerates Cory from \"Boy Meets World,\" or Zach &amp; Slater over Screech in \"Saved by the Bell,\" or 'Stefan' over Steve Urkel in \"Family Matters,\" will not produce the best engineers. But that argument is not going over well with Trump's MAGA base, certainly not online. Some of them, saying: We did not ask them to engineer an immigration policy. Tech wants indentured servants, not high-skilled workers. You don't even know what MAGA immigration policy is. Now, Trump himself, who I should note, restricted H-1B visas in his first term, has said on the campaign trail this time around that he did want to make it easier for educated foreigners to work in the U.S. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP (R), FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT AND CURRENT PRESIDENTIAL- ELECT: What I want to do, and what I will do, is -- you graduate from a college, I think you should get automatically, as part of your diploma, a green card to be able to stay in this country.

But I think the U.S. should focus more on domestic skill development. Studies also show that H-1B1 exacerbates employers hiring individuals from outside of the country, when they could potentially hire minorities, for an example, which we know there's a shortage in the STEM fields. There are significant number of Americans who I think would love opportunities, if they had the proper training and skills, to operate in those jobs fairly well. So, why not start and focus there. I'm not of the support or mindset, Kaitlan, that we should let in more than the 60,000-plus that we're already letting into the country. Do we have some deficits? I certainly understand that point, again, to what Catherine was sort of alluding to. But I think by focusing on increasing domestic skill development, you can decrease the furtherance of those deficits by virtue of saying, You know what? We're going to spend more of our time, more of our dollars, educating our own citizens, to compete for these jobs. Versus, saying, Let's increase to a 100,000 or maybe even more, for employers to bring in individuals from India. Which is a predominant country where many of them come from. I don't agree with that at all. And I think folks in the MAGA-world have every right to be angry with Vivek and Elon Musk. COLLINS: Yes. Well, that's an interesting point, because I saw that argument being made. But also, I saw Mark Cuban, Mr. Mayor, responding to that, saying, Well -- and I think we have what he had posted, quoting to Elon Musk and Vivek, saying, Well, everyone argue college is overrated. If you're arguing we need to have more homegrown engineers, don't we need more kids who are going to college? I mean, I think he's being a bit sarcastic there.

They voted for Donald Trump, in part, because of his tough stance on immigration illegally, but also because, I assume, they believed that the President-elect wouldn't increase the number of individuals coming into the country, even legally, that could potentially negatively impact or disproportionately affect Americans, as it pertains to certain types of jobs. And so again, I go back to my original premise. We need to focus on domestic skill development. I understand what former Mayor de Blasio was saying. We got to bring people in, with the goal of getting to that point maybe in the decade or so. I get that. But why not limit the cap where it's at, and focus over the next decade of increasing skills within our own people?

Yes, part of that picture are entrepreneurs, the top engineers. By the way, if we don't allow them to come here, the jobs will follow them overseas, and that's where the employment will grow.

And then, the Ukrainians wouldn't have to send any drones anywhere, and everybody would be safe and fine, and those people who tragically died would still be alive today. So, all of the responsibility comes back to the Russian government, one way or the other.But Ambassador Taylor is exactly right. If you're waging war, then you should tell the passenger planes, not to show up. It seems pretty obvious. But if you think about it, for the Russians' perspective, they don't want to admit that the Ukrainian attacks are effective, so they don't want to talk about them, because they live in a world of lies. Vladimir Putin created a world of lies for his people. And occasionally, that world of lies is punctured by real-world events like this one, and that's why we're in the situation we're in right now.",

The Russians controlled that part of Ukraine at the time, but the Ukrainians were in charge of the investigation. They delegated the authority to the Dutch, because the Dutch had the most civilians onboard. The Dutch spent years and prosecuted and convicted the Russians who hit those buttons. Because there are actual human beings who are responsible for this. And if this was even an accidental Russian missile launch, against a passenger flight, there are human beings who can be held criminally responsible. So, those prosecutions happened. It took years. The Russians didn't actually show up for the prosecutions. But the point is that justice will proceed and evidence will be presented. And in this case, we have a lot more evidence, because thank God, 29 people survived, and we have all the video, and we have all this information. So, we can't trust any one investigation.

You don't have to pick a favorite name. I can understand why you wouldn't. But, at this moment, for your party, what do you think Democrats need right now? JONES: Well, look, so here's the reality. We are at a moment in time, where we have to not only rebrand, but also rebuild. And we're facing a GOP that is literally being led by Tesla, and the Democrats are on horse and bunny. We're literally riding a horse and bunny. So for us, it cost us the White House this time. But if we don't modernize and get our act together, then it will cost us, democracy and everything. So, I believe that a Chair, of course, we need to focus on our core constituency. The working-class, rural folks, Black voters, youth. We need to have fresh ideas.
