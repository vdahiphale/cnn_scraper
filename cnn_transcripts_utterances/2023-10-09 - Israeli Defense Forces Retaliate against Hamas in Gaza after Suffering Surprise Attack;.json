      "sentences": "This is Israel's essentially worst nightmare in my conversation with Israeli security officials over my past three years here or so. The concern was always about the north and what would happen if the north got involved, if Hezbollah got involved. I don't think anyone ever imagined what is happening right now over the last two days or so.Earlier today, Jerusalem, Tel Aviv were once again targeted by a barrage of rockets. I was in my apartment when this happened, and as soon as it was over, I came out on my balcony, and I could see a plume of black smoke coming in the area of Jerusalem. Jerusalem in these conflicts in the past tends to be taken out of the equation. It might get one round of rockets and that's about it. It's different this time. And it feels different across this region. This feels completely different. That's what you're hearing from the Israeli military as well. They're saying, this isn't an operation, this isn't a tit for tat. This is a full-out war. Israel has not properly declared war, guys, since the 1973 Yom Kippur War 50 years ago. And that's what's so stunning about all of this. Here in Jerusalem, I've been hearing just fighter jets, like a constant roar of fighter jets going overhead, likely flying towards the Gaza Strip. We know that they have just been pummeling the Gaza Strip with air strikes. We've seen multiple building being downed. But also keep in mind that because of the blockade on Gaza, the electricity, the Internet is not really fully available there. So our full picture of what's actually happen in Gaza, it's hard for us to completely understand exactly the scale of what's happening there. Of course, we know that there are hundreds of casualties, thousands have been injured. In Israel, we know of at least 700 who have been killed. We know that there's at least 2,500 injuries. Guys, just what happened at that music festival by itself, this is the largest mass casualty event in Israeli history. And that's just one event of the many that we're seeing right now. And only in the last few hours did we get confirmation from the Israeli military that they have finally regained control of some of those communities in southern Israel where they were engaging with militants in firefights for 48 hours after this first happened. That's just incredible that there were still residents in southern Israel being told to barricade themselves in their homes, to not leave for fear of militants still being there. And there's a fear there could be other sleeper cells or other militants who might appear. We have heard from the minister of defense who has declared a complete blockade on the Gaza Strip. This means no electricity, no fuel, no food, nothing will be going in and out of Gaza for the foreseeable future. Eyes are still on the north. There were some reports that sirens, air raid sirens had gone off in the north. That is a very, very concerning development. We don't have that confirmed yet, whether that means that there were rockets fired or not, because, again, if Hezbollah decides to join this fight, we are on a whole different level of conflict here the likes of which this region has never seen before.",

You know, I don't think it's beyond the realms of possibility that if the Israeli Defense Force got active and timely precise intelligence about the location of some hostages, that they would try to take that opportunity to get them. But I think that's exceptionally unlikely.And the sort of ground incursion that we've seen in the past, and I've been here before when those have taken place, it takes some time to gather the troops and the equipment and the material. And I don't see that in place yet. I do see increasing security. What you can see behind me now is Gaza. I'm going to step out of the way. You're looking at apartment buildings in Gaza, the city itself, that gives you a sense of the dense structure of the population. I'm hearing a fighter yet. You can actually see the fighter jet overhead here, flying quite literally towards Gaza at the moment. I have visibility on this Israeli fighter jet flying in towards Gaza. We can't really see in the distance. I can see with my eyes, but it would be hard to show. It would be hard to show. We'll try and show you some smoke coming from the horizon in Gaza itself. That appears to be the aftermath of an earlier strike that has taken place in Gaza. But from our position now, we have views over Gaza, the Gaza Strip, and I can still hear that fighter jet that I saw flying through the sky on its way to Gaza. Often, when we hear or see those jets flying, and it's flying relatively low because I can see it relatively easy, when we hear that, we hear them coming over, normally you get an impact in Gaza. It's not clear if that's what we're going to see or witness from here right now, but it's typical of what has been happening over the past 24, 36 hours, with increasing frequency as Israel tries to stop those additional rocket strikes being launched, as we've witnessed earlier today.",

ROBERTSONsituation in Gaza. Gaza is incredibly poor. You can hear that fighter jet again. It's incredibly poor, has one of the densest populations in the world. They absolute -- their economy absolutely is on its knees and relies on the ability of Palestinians to come into Israel to work and get some money, which keeps the economy ticking over, that and humanitarian aid and financial -- financial stipends from states that are trying to feed the civilian population in Gaza. It is a population that will very, very, very quickly feel the effects of an electricity stoppage. It does have a border with Egypt, and it is possible to get food and electricity from Egypt. But it has come to rely on Israel for a large part of the population's needs. So it will be felt. And that will be a pressure point on the government, on the leadership of Hamas. But it will also be -- it will also be something that Hamas will use to further their position that, we will lead you in this tough situation. It's Israel that's the problem, not us that's the problem. That will be their message. But it is likely to be a scenario where we will hear from aid officials about the decline in the health situation, in the decline of safe drinking water, in the decline of enough food for populations there. So 2 million people is a lot of people in a tiny space not to have clean water that's getting filtered -- that won't be filtered without the electricity. So the pressures will grow, without a doubt.",

We were on the phone the entire day with our son -- our grandson, Rotem, as he lay first under her body and then found a place to escape under a blanket in a laundry.In other words, we live in an age of cell phones. We all knew, most of Israel knew what was going on. We had contact with -- and have contact with our loved ones, our husbands, our children, our family members, our friends, our neighbors. We were participants in what can only be called a pogrom. This is not a military event. It's not a military strike. The historic interpretation or explanation of a pogrom is when a military strikes at civilians. And this attack was rehearsed, well rehearsed, well planned, carried out. And then you look at what they're doing. They're taking hostages from infants to senior citizens, people older than I am, denying them their rights. I wonder if they're giving them their medications, if they're giving them visitation, they're allowing them to communicate.

We have allowed the money to move to a different account in the State of Qatar from an account where it was held in South Korea, where Iran will continue to have access to that money only for humanitarian purposes with strict oversight from the United States Treasury Department. So there is no ability for Iran to use this for anything other than humanitarian purposes. I will also say that Iran has funded terrorism for years and years and years, decades, in fact, and we expect that they will continue to do so, which is why even as we allow them to have access to this humanitarian funding, which was already their money, it was already in an account to where they could act with and they could spend it, but were just unable to do so for some kind of technical reasons, we have made clear that we will continue to hold them accountable.
