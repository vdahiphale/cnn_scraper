RAJA KRISHNAMOORTHI (D-IL), HOSE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE: Yes, I think that, look, there's one -- there's one possibility that she's expressing an opinion about various things, and they're kind of crazy opinions. It's another that somehow there is a reason why she's expressing those opinions, and we need to understand what's what. I personally don't think that that is a wise choice for DNI, but on the other hand, with regard to the allegation that she's compromised, we need to know more information underlying the concern about why she's making the statements she does. In the Gaetz context, that's a totally separate issue, which is that there, we know there's derogatory information about him, and my colleagues are widely talking about it at this point, and not a single person would ever put him on the shortlist to be Attorney General.",

That is the question, and some people, as you know, say that, you know, the reason why she's doing that is potentially because there was some financial arrangement.

However, in this case, what the prosecutor is saying is that they have specific evidence, which may be circumstantial. What does it mean? It means sometimes you see what happened. That's direct evidence.Sometimes it's circumstantial. You don't see it, but the circumstances suggest that it is. And here, the suggestions are compelling. Like what? Like the fact that you have DNA that happens to be underneath his fingernails, right? So her DNA being there, that is highly problematic. We look there, the thumbprint on the phone. How did it get there? Now, DNA has limitations with respect to when it got there or how, but how do you explain that? And then, of course, you have the victim as you're looking at it there, the blood on the defendant's hat, in addition to disposing of evidence suggesting the jacket was disposed, that has evidence in terms of her blood and his blood. And so it's a lot for the defense to overcome. It's the beginning, Omar, as you noted, but boy has it started out in a way that is highly compelling, including the smartwatch that Brianna alluded to at the outset, which would suggest that she struggled for her life by up to 18 minutes. And so we'll see. A judge is making a decision as it relates to this case. It's not a jury trial. That's called a bench trial. He'll have his fair trial. But after that, a judge will make a conclusion based on the law, the facts and the evidence.",

That subpoena and appearance before the state house committee was set for after the execution date.So that derailed the execution in a dramatic moments before he was scheduled to be executed. All of that was halted. And this has triggered a legal fight between the state legislature and members of this committee and the executive branch here in Texas. But the Supreme Court has essentially ruled that the scheduled execution can continue. So what does that mean now? The state house committee is still trying to get the testimony for Robert Robertson before their committee, which would be dramatic in and of itself, Omar. But the district attorney there in Palestine, Texas, where Robertson was convicted more than 20 years ago, can now set a new execution date. That can't happen for at least 90 days. We still don't have word if she's going to proceed. We have reached out to that district attorney and have not heard back. So we are waiting to see when the request for that new execution date would be set. But members of the state house committee do say that the Supreme Court's ruling today does not block them from continuing the efforts to get Robert Robertson's testimony before their committee, which would be dramatic in and of itself, as I mentioned -- Omar.",

I'm not sure we've ever seen that, Brianna.But that slap there at the weigh-in, I mean, that was probably as real as when Tyson punched Allen in the movie Hangover 1, you know? It was just a lot of drama to drum up interest for the fight. But hey, I, for one, want to watch just to see how Mike Tyson looks. But you have to remember, come into this with low expectations. 20 years ago, the last time Tyson fought in a real boxing match, he didn't look good back then. 20 years ago, and now he's fighting a guy 27 years old. And this is, like I mentioned, though, a full sanctioned fight, but there's some different rules. It's not going to be a normal heavyweight bout. It's not going to be 10 to 12 rounds. It's only eight rounds, and the rounds are only going to be two minutes instead of three. They're doing all that to try to, you know, give some grace to Mike Tyson, who's 58 years old. Hopefully, he can last through all of those rounds. They're also going to have 14-ounce boxing gloves, not 12, which cushion the blow a little bit. But like I said, Brianna, come into this with low expectations. Jake Paul is the favorite. He's 10-1 in his boxing career. He started as a boxer just in 2020 professionally. You know, hasn't really fought a lot of, you know, pro boxers, but he looks pretty good when he's in the ring. So we'll see. He's a 2-1 favorite for this. The event starts at 8 o'clock on Netflix, but don't expect this match between these two guys to start anywhere before 11.",
