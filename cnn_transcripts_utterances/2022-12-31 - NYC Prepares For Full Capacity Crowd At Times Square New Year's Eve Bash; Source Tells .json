Thanks so much. Have a great time.Well, we are learning more tonight about the suspect in the University of Idaho murder investigation and specifically his whereabouts after the killings, but before he was finally arrested by police this week. The source I spoke with who asked not to be identified said that they did not know the Kohberger's, but did have a friendly conversation with the suspect, 28-year-old Bryan and his father at an auto store on December 16th in Pennsylvania. The father told the source that he flew out to Washington State and made a cross country trip with his son and he added that Bryan will be traveling back to the West Coast alone after the Holidays. Now, police have not indicated the suspect's father is in any way connected to the November college student murders. CNN's Veronica Miracle joins us now. Veronica, a lot of people there where you are in Idaho, including families of the victims. They have voiced frustration with the Moscow Police in the weeks since these murders were committed. Has that changed now that a suspect has been identified and arrested?",

And so businesses were impacted, businesses were shutting down early. And then on top of that, you have the police department here who faced a lot of criticism, as you mentioned, not just from the community. There was an outspoken family. And I did ask the Police Chief has that changed? He said, in fact, he has gotten apologies from people. Here's what he had to say. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

So Casey, these murderers have consumed that town there of Moscow, Idaho and much of the country as well. Let's put your experience as a criminal profile to work here. I'm told from a source that Kohberger and his father went to an auto shop in that white Elantra weeks after the alleged murder. So, the suspect here was just out running errands. Again, there is no indication the father knew about this or had any ties to this, but this came after a cross country road trip where according to this source, the father flew out and drove cross country with his son. So we want to bear in mind of course, Kohberger is innocent until proven guilty, but what is it about the mind of the criminal that would allow someone to do this after allegedly killing four innocent people?",

If he had run out and gotten rid of that white Hyundai Elantra, that would have raised eyebrows, that would have seemed strange, given that we had a nationwide APB looking for a white Elantra. Keep in mind it that we've not found the murder weapon, and he is smart enough to know that if indeed this is Mr. Kohberger as the culprit, he can get rid of a knife very easily, but to get rid of a car is not so easy. To act normal, his father had probably already planned to fly out there and you know, share the driving all the way back. It's a very long drive. I've read accounts from his fellow students in the criminology program at Washington State that he did return to class after those killings happened, and that he would not talk about the murders, although of course, in a criminology program, they were all talking about it. He didn't talk about it, but he was far more animated than his usual very stoic self. They referred to him as detached. So when you kind of Monday quarterback on his behavior, signs were there, but only if he was on your radar. BROWN: It's so interesting too, the source I spoke with today who had this friendly conversation not knowing this was the suspect a couple of weeks ago said that he talked to him about the fact that he was studying for a PhD in criminology at Washington State University. He said he wanted to be a Professor and that he was specifically interested in the behavioral part of criminology, not procedural. We know he was working on a research project to understand how emotions and psychological traits influence decision making when committing a crime. What does all of that tell you?",

What were they thinking? What were they feeling? Did they plan it before they left the house? How did they feel after it was finished? He has been trying to get inside the mind of criminals, and the question remains, did he become so obsessed with understanding the criminal mind that he decided he wanted to experiment and find out thinking he would get away with it? Exactly what it would feel like to kill someone. Everyone is looking for a motive. I think it is simply the thrill and the experiment, what would he feel if he did it himself?

He had been quite overweight, but suddenly became fastidious,obsessive about working out, lost a lot of weight. His own family said he was obsessive and compulsive about his diet, would not eat any meat that had been cooked in a pan in which meat had been prepared. And so, we see this element of control that can take over. You know, he worked as a security guard. We see that a lot with serial killers, this cop wannabe persona. But we also see over the years, an increasing ability to control things. You know, he didn't get his associate's degree until he was 24 years old, and then he was on the fast track, finished his Bachelor's in two years, a Master's in another two years, got into a PhD program. It says if he found his calling, but those homicidal ideations were launched early. They talked about, he was a bully. He took up kickboxing. He was mean. He had a personality change, trying to pick up other guys' girlfriends. So you know, as we look backwards, I don't know when that transition happened, but I can guarantee you he's been thinking about it for a very long time and the fantasy very often turns into reality.",

Well, the public is getting its first look at six years of former President Donald Trump's tax returns. He fought for years to keep them secret. But a Democrat-led House Committee released them yesterday and they are raising a lot of questions about his finances such as: Why did he pay little or no federal income taxes in some years? Take a look. In 2016 and 2017, Trump paid only $750.00 and in 2020, the final year of his presidency, he didn't pay a dime in Federal income taxes, his income offset by claiming millions of dollars and losses.

I did expect to see lots of losses in his other businesses that he was able to bring on to his individual tax return. I was surprised that Melania signed a joint return with him, because what that means is, if he's found to owe money, she is on the hook. It's not just him, it's her as well. So there were some surprises, but the losses were expected, but in many instances, in my opinion, not really credible.
