Let's get right to what America is talking about, nothing good to say. Tonight, a tape the Kamala Harris campaign will want Americans to hear, Donald Trump's one time chief of staff, John Kelly, talking unvarnished about the former president. He runs through a litany of episodes, how Trump held disdain for service members, calling them losers and suckers on multiple occasions, he says, how Trump looked down on disabled veterans, how Trump required explanations for why Hitler was not good, how Trump prized personal loyalty above constitutional principle, and how Trump, in Kelly's view, met the dictionary definition of a fascist.

And now two weeks before the election, he's seeing the writing on the wall and he's afraid that we are heading toward reelecting Donald Trump and putting him back in power. So, I think him speaking out is really powerful. And to describe I think that you can't just take your own former boss as a fascist and say that he has no regard for the Constitution, to say that he would operate like a dictator if we let him, I think that the American people need to listen to this and take his words very seriously because this is someone who saw him in the Situation Room decision making and is saying that this guy is a danger.",
