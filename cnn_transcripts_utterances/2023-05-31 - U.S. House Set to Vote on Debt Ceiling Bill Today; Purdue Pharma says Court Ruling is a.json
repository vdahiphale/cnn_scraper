Meanwhile, Jamie Dimon sees no decoupling between Beijing and the West. And in AI and Nvidia rally shows investors remain utterly obsessed. But now we're talking AI Armageddon too, leaving tech leaders and more a little stressed. Later in the program, Brad Smith, Vice Chair and President of Microsoft will join us. Remember, Microsoft is a big investor in open AI. That's the firm that unleashed ChatGPT on the world. Brad also has strong views on how we should regulate this technology. And also does he think we're headed for some kind of human extinction without that regulation will be asking. Plus, volt typhoon, yes, that's the codename for a Chinese hacking group that Microsoft has said, is working to disrupt critical communications between the U.S. and its allies. We'll be discussing that with Brad too, now from hacking malevolence and artificial intelligence to debt ceiling relevance. U.S. futures in European shares are a touch softer, as you can see there ahead of yet another key vote to raise the debt ceiling, more on the details on that coming up. In the meantime, a weaker picture too in parts of East Asia Hong Kong, shares are now in bear market territory tied to weaker Chinese data, the index of factory activity, they're falling to a five month low. No surprise, perhaps that China, in the meantime is courting American executives this week and making soothing noises about the ease of doing business there. Jamie Dimon saying today that JP Morgan is in China for the long haul. Elon Musk's Tesla is a China long hauler too. Musk meeting with China's Foreign Minister and Commerce Minister during his Beijing visit, Musk reportedly saying the U.S. and Chinese economic interests resemble \"co joined twins\". More chatter later in the show. But first, in another day of nail biting action in Washington D.C. the U.S. House is set to vote on the bill to raise the U.S. debt ceiling and avoid a first ever debt default event. The bill picked up key momentum yesterday. But with dissenters on both sides, those we've long discussed no time for complacency, as Lauren Fox reports. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) REP. STEVE SCALISE (R-LA): I think you're going to continue to see that vote grow. That's what happens with any major bill. LAUREN FOX, CNN CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice over): Congressional leadership working to lock in enough votes to pass a bill to raise the debt ceiling negotiated by House Speaker Kevin McCarthy and President Joe Biden. REP. ELISE STEFANIK (R-NY): Members from all across the conference shared their support for this important bill, and they shared their support for Speaker McCarthy's strong and effective leadership. FOX (voice over): The bill narrowly made it out of the rules committee Tuesday night with seven to six votes with two Republicans from the far right Freedom Caucus voting against the advancement. REP. CHIP ROY (R-TX): You're out there watching this. Every one of my colleagues we very clear, not one Republican should vote for this deal. It is a bad deal. FOX (voice over): Republican Representative Dan Bishop says he's lost confidence in McCarthy over his handling of the bills negotiation and is threatening a vote of no confidence. REP. DAN BISHOP (R-NC): It seems inescapable to me, given what has occurred and the way he was the steward of Republican unity. And he blew it to smithereens. FOX (voice over): Many Congressional Democrats also remain undecided. REP. DEBBIE DINGELL (D-MI): I'm still undecided. I mean, I'm angry that we are being held hostage. REP. JAMAAL BOWMAN (D-NY): Very disappointed, you know, the mansion pipeline, work requirements undecided still considering. FOX (voice over): Another factor that could dissuade some members is the Congressional Budget Office's score for the bill. The CBO says the bill will reduce budget deficits by $1.5 trillion over the next 10 years. But new food stamps provisions would increase enrollment and increase spending for that program by more than $2 billion during that period.",

That is, I think, partly because of the delicate situation that creates with their allies who continue to donate weapons on the assurance that they won't be used to strike inside Russia. That's certainly a red line for the United States. But what we're seeing is an increase in shelling across the border, particularly in the Belgorod region, an increase in intensity, and in the area that it covers. There were four injuries, as you said, in the early hours of this morning and a massive strike in the words of the Governor of that region. We've just heard of another injury in a different part of the region, someone hit by shell fragments while they're in their car and this on top of a report from the Governor of that region on Tuesday saying that he'd seen more than 200 hits by Ukrainian mortar and artillery fire in the last 24 hours. So really over the last 24 to 48 hours, a significant uptick in that activity in that region. And we're seeing other elements across the border as well down south in the Krasnodar region two oil refineries were hit, supposedly by drones, one sort of fire break out. The Russians have accused Ukraine of shelling over the border in the Bryansk region, which is up in just north of Kyiv so really a wide area being covered.

This is a tactic that we've seen, certainly, rhetorically from Russia all along. They take the accusations that are leveled against them with good reason, as we've seen them attack civilian areas within Ukraine and level them back on Ukraine to sort of manufacture the sense certainly within Russia, that they are somehow the victim that they are under siege. And this is, you know, to play at home to a population that wasn't expecting this war, to go beyond a few weeks, let alone 15 months that we're now in. So it is part of that to try to keep the population on the side and to create the sense the argument that they've also been sort of reiterating that this is a war that they're fighting not only with Ukraine, but of course, with NATO and Ukraine's Western allies.",

And the justices even reflect that in the opinion that when you have a bankruptcyaction that is so huge, and with so many ramifications, that you cannot cover everything you do the best you can for the whole. And it's interesting, because if you look at the backstory of all of this, Purdue Pharma was the company Sacklers individuals filed bankruptcy in 2019. And according to this opinion, the Sacklers said, here's what we'll do, we will file bankruptcy of Purdue Pharma. But we want immunity from all of these actions that are out against us personally. And according to the opinion, there was $40 trillion worth of civil actions against Purdue Pharma, and the Sacklers. So that's how this case began, the bankruptcy action was filed, the bankruptcy judge agreed that any individual claims would be folded over into the bankruptcy proceeding. But all these years have really been negotiating how much the Sacklers would personally pay because they said we will personally pay and give you billions of dollars to go into the bankruptcy proceedings of our own personal funds, and that amount reached its height. And that's when the agreement was made of $6 million. And that's going to be for individual claims. It's going to be opioid abatement procedures, what can be done in communities, and then also medication for opioid emergencies. Now, here's the produce statement they issued at the conclusion of all of this because it was appealed. And they were actually victorious in this, they said, our creditors understand that the plan is the best option to help those who need it the most, the most fair and expeditious way to resolve the litigation and the only way to deliver billions of dollar in value specifically to fund opioid crisis abatement efforts. And so that is where we are at this point. Now, there, as you said, many are not happy the attorney general for California, for instance, California will be getting $500 million.

Is there enough representation of those people and communities at this toxic gain to ensure that we don't see a watering down? I know there has to be a meet in the middle point somehow.

Of course, you can never have enough voice. I was very happy to meet with the waste pickers union those 20 million waste pickers across the world and they are the global sanitation force. And it's critical that their voice is recognized. Yes, dumping does happen in some locations. It is illegal. And it is against convention that most countries have signed up to. But a lot of plastic production happens also in the Global South. And there are lots of jobs in that sector. So it is embracing a new economic opportunity with different jobs and cleaner opportunities. Now we need to find a just transition for the waste pickers so that when we roll out recycling, and when we roll out elimination, those folks who today sustain their families from being that global sanitation workforce working in very difficult dangerous circumstances are those that will land the new jobs. That's why I'm very happy to have had the way speakers present. I would have liked to have many more. The next round will be in Nairobi, Kenya. There the distances to travel would be fewer but will be shorter by for many in the African Continent, and we hope to have many more represented.",

Let's take it at that level, are looking at this with great interest and are lookingat this also to see OK, so how will it work for our economy, we have a plastics economy, you mentioned some nations there, that drives jobs and opportunities right now and growth, et cetera. But we also cannot drown in a plastic soup, in our environment, in our waterways, in our fish in our oceans. So how will we square that circle and how will we make that transition? I was very encouraged by a country's in the broader negotiations beyond the G7. Some 50 odd plus countries have signed up for what they call the high ambition coalition. I was also very encouraged that the U.S. and a number of Pacific countries have come together to showcase solutions. I think there's a lot of innovation out there. Yes, everyone will look at jobs because in any country, nearly any country you go there is a plastics industry, north and south, east and west. But there's the same opportunity for a circular industry and for eliminating and replacing by say recycled paper, cardboard and other ways of enveloping what we are trading in a safe material that has food hygiene, et cetera. So in its convenience, so I think that to all the engineers and all the designers and all the brand owners heads up time to get innovative time to look at what it is that your industry can contribute. Because we are going to have to deal with this, we're literally drowning in plastic, and no one on any political party wants to see that on their beaches, in their tourism, or in the food that we buy in the supermarket.

An elevator has a safety brake. Electricity has a circuit breaker, the school bus on which we put our children or a high speed train has an emergency brake, it enables humans to stay in control and slow something down or turn it off. And we should have that for artificial intelligence as well, especially when it's controlling critical infrastructure, like the electricity grid or the water supply. And we are to have it at multiple layers, both the application that is controlling something. And the data center where it's deployed. That is, frankly, what we've been doing as human beings for 150 years for other technologies. Let's take everything we've learned and apply it to this technology as well.",
