They include this man you're looking at, Russian assassin Vadim Krasikov who was convicted in Germany. Turkey, which played a mediator role says the swap involved seven countries. The exchange comes after months of very complicated and complex negotiations between Moscow, Washington, Berlin, as well as seven other countries. Our international diplomatic editor, Nic Robertson standing by, but first, let's bring in CNN's Priscilla Alvarez live from Washington D.C. And Priscilla, I mean, this really does end a nightmare scenario for all these families and hostages. And finally, we have some good news to bring to our viewers right around the world. Just talk us through what we've heard from the President in the past hour, and what we're likely to see here in the coming hours, because it was a very moving press conference that we saw there from President Biden.",

And in this case, as we saw, as both Nic and Priscilla were saying, it's not just a whole of government, but a whole of partners. I mean, these are, you know, partners or world around that we had to rely on, that we did successfully rely on because of the existing relationships. Not just treaty relationships, which are, you know, technical in nature, but actual personal relationships between world leaders, between our President, you know, and other world leaders. That's critically important. The CIA often times plays an important role in this particular situation because often, the Russians insist on using Intelligence channels, as they refer to them, special channels. Because they believe that there's an increased amount of secrecy, discretion and clandestine, which is critical when these -- when these discussions and negotiations are going on. So, it's not uncommon to have at least a primary vector be between Intelligence services. But of course, it's all a National Security issue.

I don't think that Vladimir Putin assessed, and I think this is a correct assessment that there would be the kind of personal trust and relationship and shared values that President Biden has with, for example, you know, the German Chancellor and other world leaders. And I think at this point, Putin said, look, I need to go with what I think is going to -- is going to work. I think he knows as much as he dislikes a lot of Biden's policies and a lot of U.S. policies at this particular point. He knows that the Biden administration can effectively and efficiently run an administration, and that's a really important part of these negotiations.

And as you noted, I've spoken to Paul a number of times from his detention in that remote penal colony, out about 8 hours from Moscow.

So, this led to this very complicated, dramatic scouring of the globe, looking for partners who did have Russian spies in custody, who might be able to have them traded to Russia. And we saw the result of that today, seven countries were involved in the swap. They were giving people back who had been detained in Slovenia, in Poland, in Norway, and of course the convicted Russian assassin, Vadim Krasikov, who was in Germany. This was kind of the linchpin for today's deal. So, a lot of negotiations behind the scenes here, Isa.",

And Putin has told many times in the past that any real Russian opposition is not an opposition. They are not politicians. They are foreign agents. They are agents of the West. So, in this logic, he's exchanging the western agents for Russian citizens, it happens for the first time since the Soviet period. He's changing them for Russian citizens who are like a combatant, like prisoners of war in this conflict between Russia and the West in Ukraine. This is the logic. It doesn't mean -- it does not -- in this logic, the exchange of prisoners of war is not necessarily a step towards a peace negotiations.",

A source tellsCNN, Haniyeh was killed by an explosive device that was covertly hidden in the guest house he used in Tehran. That source also says the bomb was there for about two months and was detonated remotely. This latest detail comes as thousands gathered in Tehran, as you can see, to mourn Haniyeh during a memorial service. Iran and its allies vow retaliation against Israel for the death of Haniyeh, for which Israel has neither confirmed nor denied responsibility. But Israel is claiming responsibility for the death of Hamas military chief, Mohammed Deif. The IDF released this video of a strike in Gaza that killed Deif in mid-July along with at least 90 Palestinians. And these just some really of the dizzying series of events in what's been a dramatic week in the Middle East starting last Saturday, let me remind you, when a deadly rocket attack in the Israeli occupied Golan Heights killed at least 12 children. It was blamed on Hezbollah. Hezbollah commander, Fuad Shukr, then was killed in Lebanon by Israel on Tuesday. On Wednesday, the explosion in Tehran, which I mentioned, which killed Haniyeh. And today, Israel announced the death of Deif during last month's airstrike. Those three leaders, all key members of groups opposed to Israel, as you can see there. Joining me now is the former director of the Mossad, Efraim Halevy. Sir, welcome to the show. Let me really just get your reaction to what I've just outlined there for our viewers. It's been a very fast paced week. The political leader of Hamas assassinated, the head of Hamas' military wing also killed last month, a senior Hezbollah commander.

And over the 12 children were killed there, and it was a very, very, very grim event. And this became the reason for which Israel responded and killed the man in Beirut. And he is a -- was a very senior figure in the Hezbollah movement of -- in Lebanon. What happened in Tehran, I have no information of myself as to exactly what happened there.
