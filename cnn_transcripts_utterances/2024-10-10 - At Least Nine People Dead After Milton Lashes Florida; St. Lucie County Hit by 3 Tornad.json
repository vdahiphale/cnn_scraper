      "sentences": "Right, Boris, as my team and I are kind of scoping around this area of St. Lucie County, I can show you another example of just the devastation that those tornadoes kind of wrought on this area. This is the Lakewood Methodist Church here just north of Fort Pierce. And take a look, you mentioned Tropicana Field in St. Petersburg, kind of a similar phenomenon here. Look at the roof being taken off, at least partially taken off of the Lakewood church here. And there's - if I go to the left here, our photojournalist, Manny Climaco, is going to kind of zoom into the damage in the back of the church there, just incredible.You know, again, illustrating the force of these tornadoes as they came through here. What I can tell you is as we kind of come over here and I'll show you some damage in the neighborhood here to my left, your right, there are some houses back here that again had portions of roofs torn off. From what we have seen, Boris, you know, some tornadoes go through a given area and they cut kind of a wide swath of destruction and you can see a clear path of where they came through. These appear to be different from what our teams have observed here on the ground. These appear to be tornadoes that kind of touched down in specific places, then kind of lifted up, touched down in other places, lifted up, so there was - the damage is a little bit more sporadic. You don't see, like, widespread whole neighborhoods kind of crushed. You see kind of just little pockets of places that were devastated. The sheriff here, Keith Pearson, says that the area where the fatalities occurred, it is - the name of it is Spanish Lakes Country Club Village. He says it is a modular home community for people who are 55 years and older. We can tell you that - we know that it's in this direction, but the media is not being allowed access into that community because they're still trying to assess some damage, still possibly looking for other victims and other sensitivities that are going on there. We're not allowed to get into that area, which is just beyond those trees right there. But again, officials here just kind of coming through and trying to come to grips with this. And again, I'll - we'll just take you right back into the - just to a, you know, quick zoom in shot of that church. Just imagine a tornado coming in and just taking that off within a span of a couple of seconds. And you get a sheer sense of that power, in addition to those two tractor trailer trucks that we showed you last hour that were just kind of tossed off the road as if they were little toy trucks by this tornado. Again, we can confirm five people dead in this county - at least five. That's according to Gov. Ron DeSantis. Damage still being assessed here, Boris?",

Brian Todd live from St. Lucie County, Florida.Thank you so much, Brian. We mentioned a few minutes ago that there were still water rescues ongoing. I spoke with the sheriff of Hillsborough County a short time ago and said that they were still finding folks, including a 14-year- old boy. They posted this on social media, a video of this 14-year-old boy floating in floodwaters on top of what appeared to be a fence. He's fortunate that he was rescued. I want to go live to Isabel Rosales, who's in Hillsborough County, and she's been watching these rescues since very early this morning. Isabel, we understand more than 130 people were rescued from a specific place that had been designated as a shelter, right?",

This was their first priority, the Hillsborough County Sheriff's Office, to come here to this one story building, Great American Assisted Living, where residents found themselves suddenly encountering water, water coming through their air vents and then piling up and coming up to their knees.And these are people on medication, on oxygen tanks, people who some use wheelchairs, walkers, some are bedridden. They couldn't manage to get out of here, so they waited overnight and hours in the cold floodwaters for the sheriff's office to come in these amphibious vehicles and to get them out. Now, to the point that you were making, Boris, this is actually not an evacuation zone. This is not an area of Hillsborough County, the university plaza area by the University of South Florida that has ever seen anything like this. So people actually came from Bradenton in Manatee County to here to take cover from the storm, anticipating that they would get harder hit in Bradenton. And then this thing unexpectedly happened, flash flooding. So over 135 of them rescued, one of them, her name is Teresa. This is what she told me. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

I saw a father with a bicycle trying to get through the floodwaters that way, the kid up on the handles. Some of them taking clothes, shoes, whatever they can carry to get out of here. And I'll also mention this. The sheriff, he - Chad Chronister, started his rookie years, his career here in this area. He was choked up talking to me, saying this is something he has never seen.

That death toll steadily climbing up as officials get access to places that were previously inaccessible and they get a clearer picture of the damage. One of the hardest hit areas from the perspective of the human cost of this storm is St. Lucie County and we want to discuss some of the lives lost there as a result of a tornado - because of that tornado with Cathy Townsend. She's one of the Board of County Commissioners for St. Lucie County. Commissioner, thank you so much for being with us. What can you tell us about the five people, at least five, that were killed in your community? CATHY TOWNSEND, COUNTY COMMISSIONER CHAIR ST. LUCIE COUNTY, FL: So it happened at North County in a park up there called Spanish Lakes, and they were making arrangements to evacuate, but this came quicker than we were thinking. We were prepared for about an eight o'clock landfall of the hurricane, and this came sooner when the hurricane or the tornado started coming through. So unfortunately, there were quite a few residents there that had not evacuated and gotten out yet. They were still in the process. When it did touchdown, there were multiple, probably 50 percent of that park that had been devastated. We immediately went in under search and rescue, and we were opening up shelters and getting people to where they had to be, and we have confirmed five deaths, and there are four still currently in the hospital that we are aware of, and there were three from the Holiday Pines subdivision across the street, the three of those homeowners over there were also taken to the hospital.",

We were bracing for landfall way later in the evening yesterday and it was approximately at late 8Because, obviously, if you're anticipating that the storm is going to make landfall out west, it's not totally clear that all the way across the state, some 200-ish miles away, you were going to see something like that.",
