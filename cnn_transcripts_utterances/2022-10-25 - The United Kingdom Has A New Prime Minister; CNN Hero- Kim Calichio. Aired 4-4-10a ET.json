While the Nile crocodile is considered the most aggressive, mosquitoes with over 100 trillion on the planet can carry lethal diseases, affecting up to a million people a year. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

They suck your blood like a vampire, not cool.But have you ever noticed that some people aren`t bothered by mosquitoes at all? Well, scientists are discovering why some people are indeed mosquito magnets while others aren`t. Over the course of three years, researchers asked a group of 64 volunteers to wear nylon stockings on their arms for six hours a day. The research team then placed two people stockings inside a chamber filled with mosquitoes giving them their choice of human scented stockings and that helped determine which people were mosquito magnets and which were, quote, low attractors. Now the study found that molecular compounds were higher in mosquito magnets especially carboxylic acid on the skin. That`s found in the oily substance that helps to keep our skin moisturized. The study found that certain odors play a role too. And research had already previously found that body heat and the carbon dioxide we release when we breathe attract mosquitoes as well. Scientists say that with better understanding, new and approved repellents could be developed in the future. Question, lovely people, how would you like to be hired by NASA to hunt aliens? If so, maybe someday you will. The space agency just announced that a team of researchers has been formed to study UFOs. These professors, scientists and others are on a mission to explain the unexplainable. For more, let`s meet up with CNN space and defense correspondent Kristin Fisher. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

      "sentences": "NASA has announced the team of people that will participate in its study of unidentifiedaerial phenomena or UAPs or more commonly referred to as UFOs. And these people consist of astronomers, astrophysicists, biologists, former Pentagon, NASA, former Federal Aviation Administration officials, and one very famous former NASA astronaut, Scott Kelly, who, of course, spent a year in space. And these people are going to spend the next nine months or so really studying all of the unclassified data on UAPs and they`re also going to be analyzing how the agency can better analyze and handle and catalog all of the data that`s coming in on this from civilian and commercial entities as well. And you know, there are quite a few government entities looking into the issue of UAPs. Congress has been looking into it, the Pentagon as well. So why not NASA? Well, NASA says it`s job since its creation really has been to you know try to explain the unexplainable and look at these very complicated things up in our skies in space and try to figure out exactly what they are and how they work. So, NASA`s leadership believes that this fits squarely in their wheelhouse. And so, this is something that they this study is something that they announced back in July. They have just now announced the team members which are getting ready to meet. And this study is set to begin officially on Monday. And then that team is expected to release its finding publicly sometime in mid-2023. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

They purchased fresh groceries wholesale and food from local farms to pack in grocery boxes for people in need. Let`s meet Kim and hear about how the COVID-19 pandemic inspired her organization.

      "sentences": "When you are a restaurant chef, everybody in your life also works in the restaurant because it`s an industry where it becomesyour life. So, in the beginning of the pandemic, we thought what is happening to our people. As a restaurant worker, you were put out of work because your restaurant shut down. There was a community of individuals who did not qualify for unemployment benefits or stimulus funding. My business doing cooking and gardening classes completely halted and so I had no income at all myself. All right. We are ready. Do you guys want to set the table? My husband and I were like, at least I can get unemployment where there are five to 15 people that we know that aren`t going to have that. Is it good? Yeah? I had a choice to either sit here in my house and be overwhelmed because I was in the same situation, or I can do whatever it is that I could possibly do. There was nothing to lose almost. We`re going to do two apples, the bunch of bananas, two tomatoes, one pepper and then for the greens, we`re just going to do one of each. We started a GoFundMe to direct deliver groceries to families across Queens. And then these guys. And within a week, we raised ten thousand dollars. We thought the pandemic was going to be over in two weeks. So, we were like we`ll spend this grand and then we`ll go back to work and that never happened. We knew we were on to something. We were very efficient, and I think that`s our restaurant chef-ness. Everybody who started working with us, they were line cooks, so they knew how to do things quickly and efficiently. The first week, we delivered 25 grocery packages to 25 families and within a month`s time, we were delivering four to five hundred groceries to families every single week. All right. We source 80 percent of the produce from local farms in New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania. That`s super nice. Those are beautiful. They deliver food at our distribution center, and then we direct deliver those ingredients and packages out to families. For us, a measure of success is that a little over 126 households have come off of our free grocery program. Even if the pandemic completely goes away, these people are still left in a really hard place. They weren`t making enough money two years ago. So, until we`re able to create something that can be replicated in multiple communities, this work will continue. My hope is that we are working with our community they feel happy to be a part of something that is collective. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
