He has worked with Mitt Romney, Paul Ryan and Jeb Bush. And Phillippe Reines is with us. He helped prep Hillary Clinton for the 2016 debate. All right, Phillippe, let's start with you. Because a feature of this debate is that microphones are actually going to be automatically muted once it's the other candidates turn to speak. It's actually something that happened in the second debate in the last cycle between these two. Maybe helped Trump actually or seemed to be a better debate -- debate for him.

So this is just a safety mechanism to enforce some self- control. Donald Trump, in the other 45 minutes, will show what we all know him to be, which is erratic and loud. I think it redounds to the presidents favor because President Biden will be able to articulate what he is thinking, looking straight into the camera, telling the 75-plus million people who are watching what he has done for America, what he wants to do for America. It's hard to do that when someone is barking at you from, you know, 10 feet away. So this is only helpful to him. In terms of the president, I mean, the only thing that would help former President Trump is if you we're muted for the whole 90 minutes. We're still going to get a healthy dose of him and a reminder of him that I think people seem to be forgetting what the true Donald Trump is. And the more Trump tries to get under Biden's skin, the more he tries to focus to force a moment, the worst he might be doing for himself and the more he might be helping Joe Biden achieve Joe Biden's strategy, which is to remind everyone that he is a loudmouth, who really doesn't have anything to offer.",

We heard from a Trump ally in recent days that they believe that the moment that the 2020 election was lost was during the first debate when Joe Biden, in response to Donald Trump, said something to the effect of, oh, come on, cut it out, man. How does one practice for those moments in a debate? Is that something you can practice for?",

      "sentences": "Yes. I mean, it's easy to think that this is an \"SNL\" skit. It's not. There's no utility -- I think it was you have Alec Baldwin or any number of comedians who can do a better impersonation.There's no utility also in being the worst Donald Trump and yelling at the candidate all the time, because that's not accurate either. There will be windows where he has different -- he has different pitches that he'll show. So ideally, what you want is to help the candidate envision lots and lots of different scenarios. Not so they can memorize something, not so they can practice a moment. But that they, in their head, think about. It's not even necessary that the most important prep work is done in the room. It might be while they're running or while they're showering or dreaming or driving around. Because they start to think that way. The infamous Lloyd Bentsen-Dan Quayle moment was something that wasn't practiced per say. But Bentsen knew that he did it occasionally. And obviously, he thought about it. And when he had the moment, he took it. I think what's funny -- you know, listen to Peter, this has been obviously the Republican talking point that President Biden can't stand up straight. I don't know why they keep saying that because, obviously, it's a silly expectation to set. But as someone who played Trump and barked at Hillary Clinton, it would be remarkable to think that someone on stage with a human smelling salt is going to have some kind of moment, whether you want to call it spacey or senile, whatever it is like. That's the least likely time that Joe Biden is going to have some moment that supports this constant refrain of he doesn't know where he is, doesn't know what he's doing. And it's funny because it comes from Donald Trump. But I just don't think that that's -- I don't think it's going to happen. And I don't think it's smart. But I'm not in charge or what they do or don't say.",

He's been debating in the Senate candidates and Senate candidate forums. He's been debating as a vice-presidential candidate. He has beendebating as a presidential candidate. He's got over a half a century of debate experience under his belt. But what happened when Donald Trump went down the escalator in 2015 was he just -- he changed politics. Whether people like it or not, he changed politics forever. He also changed presidential debates forever. Presidential debates, as much as -- and this is the first time we will have a in-studio, with no live audience, televised debate since the very first televised debate in 1960 between Kennedy and Nixon. And no matter how hard Jake Tapper and Dana Bash try, they will not replicate the Nixon-Kennedy debate because this is a TV show and Donald Trump is a TV star. This is where he thrives. Donald Trump is the consummate entertainer, Donald -- Donald Trump is a combination of Caitlin Clark and the Savannah Bananas. And there is no way that the -- Joe Biden, who'd started debating in 1972, is going to be able to handle someone like Donald Trump. As Phillipe said, he played Donald Trump. I played Donald Trump in mock debates as well. I probably didn't do as good a job as Philippe did because we really had no idea what to expect to debate with Donald Trump. It's like asking a Scout team quarterback to play Tom Brady. Tom Brady can go in and read a defense. Donald Trump can go into a television show and read the room and know how -- to how to handle it.",

      "sentences": "Look, the arguments we're going to hear from the two candidates tonight.They boil down to two things. Former President Donald Trump saying that immigration and the border are out of control. And President Biden saying that Trump's policies, if he were to take a second term, they're too extreme. Now, this is important because of what you just mentioned, the polling shows that this is now a top the issue on the minds of American voters. And what is unique this time around is that President Biden has his own immigration record. Over the last three years, we have seen an administration that has grappled with record migration across the western hemisphere that has landed at the U.S. southern border. And that has led to images of border crisis after border crisis. And that is something that President Biden has been slammed by former President Donald Trump and Republicans time and again. And not only is it something that we have seen play out on the border, but also in cities across the country, which explains why so many voters are thinking about this in ways that maybe they weren't a few years ago. Now President Biden has released several executive actions over the last few weeks, no coincidence, that include -- included, for example, restricting asylum access at the border, and expediting the path to citizenship for some undocumented spouses of U.S. citizens. And former President Donald Trump has also said what he wants to do, mass deportation and supporting green cards for foreigners who graduate U.S. colleges. But ultimately, what we saw over the last few days is the Biden administration taking a victory lap and feeling as though -- President Biden can go on the offensive this time and say that he has an agenda that is working, given, for example, that 40 percent drop in border crossings. But the other thing that Biden campaign officials tell me is that the family separation policy under former President Donald Trump still resonates with voters. So this is an opportunity for President Biden not only to point to what he has done an office, but to remind voters of the stark contrast between the two. And remember that family separation policy really Biden people when it happened and that's something that we may hear from the president again tonight.",
