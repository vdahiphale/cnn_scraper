I'm Anna Coren from Hong Kong.Ahead on CNN Newsroom, no ceasefire deals so far, demonstrators are calling on Israel's government to do more to bring hostages home. Tornadoes wreak havoc over parts of the U.S. The danger isn't over as millions are still under tornado watches. And China's panda diplomacy, how the promise of pandas for San Diego could signal a warming of relations with the U.S. An Israeli official tells CNN that Israel has rejected Egypt's ceasefire and hostage release proposal and presented its own conditions for an agreement. There's no word what those conditions are. On the streets of Tel Aviv Saturday, thousands of Israeli protesters demanded the government do more to bring home the hostages Hamas is holding in Gaza. Well, some of those protesters clashed with police. At least seven people were arrested. Well, there are no signs that Israel and Hamas are closer to an agreement. Israel's foreign minister said a ceasefire and hostage deal could delay the planned ground assault on Rafah. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

That secures the release of hostages and how it is Hamas standing between the Palestinian people and a ceasefire.He's also due to discuss ways to try to prevent the conflict from escalating, an escalation we've already seen with the Iranian attack on Israel and, of course, the ongoing war that isn't a war rumbling between Israel and the Iranian proxy militia of Hezbollah in Southern Lebanon. So, they're going to be discussing ways to try to prevent the conflict from Gaza escalating for real, I suppose, into another all-out war elsewhere in the region, and also to discuss ways to try to achieve a lasting peace, not just between Israel and the Gaza Strip, but between Israel and the Palestinians. And I suppose the big prize there is the potential for normalization between Saudi Arabia and Israel as part of an agreement that would see concrete steps towards a two-state solution. But, again, two big stumbling blocks there. Number one, Hamas rejects a two-state solution and so does the current Israeli government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. So, unlikely that any real progress is going to be made on that front either, Anna.",

The two partially destroyed hospitals in the north, Lauda (ph) and Ali Hospital, can only do surgeries when they have enough fuel to switch on the generator and then they operate, they run out of fuel and they switch it off again. And the other issue is that these health staffs, these doctors and nurses and paramedics, have been worked once off for seven months and have not been paid for seven months. I mean, with all of the aid coming in, this aid, which is critical, is not going to those people who have been dedicating their lives to trying to treat the wounded.

In June 2023, the youth unemployment was over 20 percent, and towards the end of the year last year, it was around 14.9, 15 percent.So, it's obvious that the Chinese need investments and the investments have to come from the U.S., but unfortunately, because of souring ties between Beijing and Washington and many parts of the western hemisphere, it's definitely been a real challenge for China to actually rebuild its economy. So, the kind of diplomacy portion of the Chinese foreign policy is Beijing's attempt actually to rebuild some form of ties with the west once more.",

So, there were issues related to Sino-U.S. relationship because of that. And I'm sure the U.S. zoos were not mistreating the pandas at all.
