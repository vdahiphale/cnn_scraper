So right now, we're waiting for the Supreme Court to rule on what exactly is going to be happening here.Over the weekend, Ken Paxton filed another motion before the Supreme Court essentially arguing that the conditions that Kate Cox has described that she's under do not rise to the level of the medical exemption here in Texas. He writes that a fatal fetal condition or the threat of possibly not being able to have children in the future does not rise to that level. Even though the exemption here in Texas says that women who are in life-threatening conditions or also face a substantial impairment of a major bodily function could beat the standard of that medical exemption.
