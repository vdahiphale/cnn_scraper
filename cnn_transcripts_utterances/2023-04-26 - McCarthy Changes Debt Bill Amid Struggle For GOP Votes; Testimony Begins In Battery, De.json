It will be an enormous amount of work just to get Republicans on board. Again, Jim, the bigger issue of a bipartisan deal to avert what could be just an economic disaster of a debt default by as early as this June. There's still no clear way out of that mess as Congress and the White House are not talking about a way out.",

She told the court, quote, \"Donald Trump raped me.\"The former magazine columnist alleges that Trump assaulted her in a dressing room at a department store in the mid -990s. Before she testified, jurors heard from an employee who worked at that store. We should note, Donald Trump has denied these allegations.

And this morning, she described to the court and the jury what had happened to the heart of this allegation.She told them that Donald Trump had raped her. So she set the scene. She told them she was leaving the Bergdorf Department Store, she believed, on a Thursday night and sometime in the spring of 1996. She said she saw Donald Trump at the door, he put his hand up and said, hey, you are that advice columnist, and she replied, hey, you are that real estate tycoon. From there, she said they began kind of this flirtatious fun where they were -- he wanted her advice to buy a present for a woman. They looked at handbags. They looked at hats. He then suggested they go to the sixth floor, the lingerie department. And there, they were teasing each other over a body suit. He suggested that she put it on. She suggested that he put it on. She testified, though, after that is when things turned violent. She said Trump lured her into the dressing room, he then pushed her up against the wall. She banged her head, she said, twice from him pushing her against the wall. Then she said that he pulled down her tights and he raped her. She's testified that, after this, she fled the department store, she called one of her friends and she confided in her and her friend said, you have just been raped. She then testified she then had a subsequent conversation with a second friend, her friend, Carol Martin, and she said she described what happened to Carol Martin. And she, E. Jean Carroll, testified that Martin told her not to do anything about it because Trump would bury her. And this is what Carroll testified to on the stand. She said, \"I was frightened of Donald Trump, I thought he would retaliate and I was ashamed. I thought it was my fault.\" They just came back from an hour-plus long lunch break. Carroll is back on the stand. And her attorneys are asking her now about what kind of impact this had on her life. Carroll has testified she has not been able to have a romantic relationship since then. She said, flirting got me into trouble that day. And she said she can't engage in a romantic relationship if she can't look at a man in the eye and smile. As you said, Trump has denied this. His attorneys will get a chance to cross-examine Carroll and they said she's motivated by finance and by politics -- Boris?",
