Well, in the here and now, the Fed has been raising interest rates to try to slow this robust. To these numbers, another strong month of jobs, is it inevitable that the Fed not only raises interest rates when it meets next week, but goes back up to a half point as opposed to a quarter point?",

And I think that really, the Fed is going to come under a lot of this political pressure from progressives as we go through the year, because there is a good chance that they're going to slow the economy enough to throw people out of work. In fact, that's kind of the plan. They expect the unemployment to rise by design. And so, I think they're just going to have to kind of try to ignore that because at the end of the day, they very much see their job as getting inflation under control.

Carl, this was a big Republican promise. They said give us House majority and we will launch investigations into all of these things where we think there has been malfeasance by the government, malfeasance by the Biden administration. Just the House Oversight and Accountability committee this week. COVID-19 origins, pandemic spending, inflation, southern border crisis, artificial intelligence, Strategic Petroleum Reserve, Office of Personnel Management. Now the Republicans say these are all legitimate inquiries. So two questions for me, have they actually unearth any new facts?

China was quick to brandish its role in brokering this rapprochement and yes, it pointed out the United States played no role. Joining our conversation, the former Middle East Negotiator Aaron David Miller. Aaron, number one, Iran and Saudi Arabia making dice. And number two, China's saying it is the middleman, that tells you what? AARON DAVID MILLER, FORMER STATE DEPT. MIDDLE EAST NEGOTIATOR: Number one, it tells me that there's a realignment underway. And the United States at least on this one is sitting on the outside looking in. I mean, it's a trifecta of coincidence of interest, John. Chinese have a great stake in breaking out of their isolation and demonstrating their Middle East player. Iranians very isolated, I think have the same objective in the region. And the Saudis, I think are sending, whether it's a middle finger to the Biden administration is probably overstated. But I do believe it's MBS, Mohammed bin Salman is very much his show, demonstrating that he doesn't live in a unipolar world anymore, with the U.S. as the center of gravity. He's much interested in branching out, not just to the Russians, as we saw during October, two weeks before the midterms, when the Saudis cut oil prices, and the administration, quote, unquote, threatened consequences.

Is this is a -- is that one possibility of this, is with China's helping Iran sell that Saudi Arabia now gets access to nuclear technology?And what does that mean?

Iran, China, one, an established nuclear power, the other one, perhaps putatively seeking at some point to weaponize and actually produce nuclear weapons, very much so.And I think it should send an unmistakable signal, I think, to the administration, not that their options are all that great, that there are some new realities. The other issue is if the Chinese can broker, an Iranian Saudi deal, maybe and there's reporting the Wall Street Journal and other places that perhaps there's a way new regional alignment, to get the Americans somehow involved in brokering the relationship between the Israelis and the Saudis. So a lot is happening. And frankly, if you can reduce Saudi-Iranian tensions, bitter rivalries, and we're not on the edge of a cusp of a golden age, in relationship between Saudi Arabia and Iran, but if you can reduce friction, seems to me that that's all to the good. One final point. It's so ironic that the U.S. Navy is in the Gulf, essentially protecting what amounts to sea lanes for China, who has now become Saudi Arabia's largest purchaser of oil.
