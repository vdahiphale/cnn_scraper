What we are learning about Kyiv's alleged involvement and Moscow's response. Then, bidding farewell to a legend. Brazilians say their final goodbyes to the football icon Pele. And welcoming a new era again in Brazil, as President Lula da Silva returns for another term in office. And thousands arrive in Rome to pay their respects to Pope Benedict XVI. We alive in St. Peter's Square view. But first, this evening, Russia's Defense Ministry says dozens of Russian troops were killed by a Ukrainian rocket strike on Russian occupied Donetsk. Now it happened just after midnight on New Year's Day. Russia puts the number of dead at 63. But Ukraine's military says it's still clarifying how many Russian soldiers died. It acknowledges the attack happened, but it's not claiming responsibility. For the third straight day, Ukraine's capital is weathering airstrikes from Russia. Ukraine's military says it's intercepted dozens of shells and Iranian-made drones fired at Kyiv overnight. Our Ben Wedeman joins me now from Kyiv for the latest. So, Ben, let's see, what more information do we have from the Ukrainians about this missile strike in Russian occupied Donetsk. What are they telling you?",

We don't know specifically how many Russian soldiers. Now, there's a great deal of difference between the number given by the Russian, 63 dead and the Ukrainians initially came out and said 400 Russian soldiers were killed in this strike. But they now say they are trying to clarify those numbers. Now, interestingly, military bloggers in Russia who are an important, interesting source of information are blaming the high death toll on what they say was the fact that either in the vocational school itself or very nearby there was a large cachet of ammunition that exploded when it's believed Ukrainian HIMARS. This high -- this rocket system that's extremely deadly supplied by the United States were fired at this vocational school. And so, yes, the Russians are coming out and admitting this surprisingly high death toll. We shall see how it goes down politically there. Now, overnight, Kyiv once more, basically the fourth out of the last five days, the capital has been struck by what's believed mostly these Shahed-136 Iranian-made drones that explode upon hitting their target. Now, the Ukrainians say most of them have been shot down, but what we've seen is the authorities here are telling people to conserve electricity because of damage to the power infrastructure that continues to be, it seems, the target of these Russian strikes.

I think the last time was back in the spring. So to come out and actually give a specific number is unusual, but it seems that the information is out. And so, I think when we're trying to figure out how many people were actually killed, how many soldiers were killed in this strike, it's probably somewhere between perhaps a low Russian number and a very high Ukrainian number.

It's basically to throw a bunch of rockets in a fairly indiscriminate fashion. They will target in a broad sense but the Ukrainians have the ability to target in a very specific sense and they have the imperative of not wasting ammunition. So what they're doing is they're making sure that what they can hit is something that has military significance and that it is also something you said that is basically valuable from a tactical or a strategic perspective in the military sense. This was not a civilian target, this was a pure military target and the Ukrainians made it very clear that they are going to go after those kinds of targets as opposed to the civilian infrastructure that the Russians are targeting.",

And that, of course, could have a significant impact on the battlefield. So it's not -- you know, things aren't going to be over very quickly in spite of the Russian difficulties with their supply chain, in spite of their notorious corruption, and all the different disorganized aspects of the Russian military, those are significant factors.

And as the nation's government changes hands, Brazil's newly sworn in president is set to pay his respect sometime today or tomorrow. Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva took the oath of office on Sunday, as you can see there after defeating outgoing President Jair Bolsonaro. CNN Stefano Pozzebon and Julia Vargas Jones are at the stadium in Santos and they both join me now. And what scenes we have been seeing outside Santos there?

And it's about 2,000 per hours that we have been seen below us. It's really a poignant moment. It's striking to see these taking place in the middle of a stadium, which is normally a place we link with the images of cheerful fans, chants, screaming and of course, joyous moments. Pele scoring the vast majority of his 1,281 goals in the stadium. Well, now the stadium is silent to mourn the king of football. It's very respectful. There is a slow, low samba in the background. And apart from a few fans who clapped their hands and just cry his name out, it's been a very, very solemn procession of, I would say faithful. We're witnessing history in two locations today in Rome with the Pope Benedict -- the Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI. Well, here in Brazil, the atmosphere is rather similar because, you know, as you have covered Brazil before, this country takes its football very, very seriously and well, Pele was the greatest pontiff in the history of football.

We're seeing there a very famous indigenous leader here in Brazil, someone who was nominated to the Nobel Peace Prize in 2020. We got representatives from the worker class, from women, people with disabilities, children, communities of color, again showing what Lula will prioritize in his government. A whole 180 from President Jair Bolsonaro. In his first day, he's already reversed some of the policies from Bolsonaro making tougher to own and sell guns in this country, reversing a policy where you're giving back power to the environmental agencies, Isa, to make environmental crimes easier to fight. And also bringing in a very popular policy of the Lula government, which is a guaranteed income for poor families. That is really the core of Lula's policies. It's something that he's built his entire political career over, right, fighting poverty, fighting hunger. But in that image, notably absent is President Jair Bolsonaro. He fled, or I should say, he left the country on Friday, going to Florida without giving much of an explanation of why. Now, we do know that the country had been kind of holding its breath all the way until Sunday because we weren't sure if there would be a peaceful transition of power. Bolsonaro himself said he wasn't going to accept the result of elections that he didn't win. His supporters went to the streets, blocked highways, marched to military headquarters, demanding a military intervention. So in this climate, Bolsonaro leaving the country, in a way, opened the door for everybody to take a big sigh of relief. But, today, a group of parliamentarians on the left-wing Party of Hazel (ph), requested that he be arrested. It's a preventative arrest for the attacks on democracy, precisely these attacks that he had talked about for months, even before the election results had come in, Isa. And I want to say also that Bolsonaro and his family are being investigated on allegations of corruption, and he also is being investigated for his mishandling of the COVID-19 pandemic and spreading misinformation. So, very uncertain future for the former president going forward.",

He passed away on Saturday at the age of 95. His death marked the end of an unusual situation, really. A former pope and his successor lying living almost side by side. Benedict retired, if you remember, in 2013, becoming the first head of the Catholic Church to do so in 600 years. And that paved the way for Pope Francis, who paid his respects on Sunday. Well Italian leaders, including President Sergio Mattarella and Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni filed by a short time ago as you can see there. Police say about 65,000 people have turned out so far. Fred Pleitgen is standing by at the Vatican for us. And Fred, Benedict was one of the most important figures, I think it's fair to say, inside the Vatican. But he was also controversial too.

Though Ozzy Osbourne made it at 112. Celine's fans were outraged and wondered why the Canadian singer was snapped. But the magazine says it write the greatest singers, not necessarily the greatest voices with Beyonce ranked at number eight. What the criteria used by The Rolling Stones, if you're asking, was originality, influence, depth of their catalogue, and breadth of their musical legacy, with Prince and Elvis Presley in the top 20.
