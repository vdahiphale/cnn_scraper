And stand by for us because I want to talk about your new reporting tonight.And in case everyone missed it CNN is now reporting tonight that prosecutors investigating efforts to overturn the election are very interested in a chaotic White House meeting that took place in the final days of the Trump administration. Now, that meeting included Rudy Guiliani. So, Kaitlan, what do we know about why Special Counsel Jack Smith is pressing on some of these witnesses about this meeting?",

We don't know that it is actually days, but it does appear to be winding down as they had this flurry of activity recently. And one thing that I and our team have learned is as they were going through this, they have been asking questions for sometime but also recently about the chaotic oval office meeting that happened six weeks after Donald Trump lost the election.I think a lot of people will remember it from the January 6th hearings where attorneys in the White House were essentially pitted against these outside advisers to Trump, outside advisers who wanted him to do crazy things, like sign an executive order about getting the U.S. military to seize voting machines for those seven states that he lost. They were talking about martial law. They were talking about making Sidney Powell a special counsel to investigate voter fraud. That was at the center of the heated meeting where insults were hurled. A lot of shouting was happening in that meeting. But we are now told, recently, Jack Smith and his team have been asking witnesses about it, whether that is the investigators or before the grand jury. They were doing this several months ago with some witnesses. They've been doing it with more witnesses recently. One of those is Rudy Giuliani, who we know went before and sat down voluntarily with Jack Smith's team last month two days, back-to-back. He was asked about a range of topics, we are told. His attorney is not commenting on this tonight, but we are told by sources that that was something that he was asked about in that meeting, so just raising a lot of questions about what the end result of this investigation could look like.",

Is it going to focus on the fake electors and that scheme to have them, the seven states that he lost? Will it focus more exclusively on the figures at the center of this, John Eastman, Sidney Powell, Mike Flynn, Patrick Burn, who is the former CEO of Overstock? Those are the big questions and I don't think anyone has a sense.Of course, the other big question is whether Donald Trump himself is indicted in that investigation or if he is an unindicted co- conspirator or not he's mentioned at all. I mean, I think there are just so many questions. And it is such a bigger, broader investigation than the documents investigation.

And it all raises questions about what Moscow's plans are for Prigozhin. Joining me now on this plus many other issues is Republican Candidate Vivek Ramaswamy. Welcome, sir, to the program. I do want to start there on the war in Ukraine. It has obviously taken on renewed urgency after Prigozhin's uprising and Kyiv's offensive, and you proposed, as I think many people know, a 72-hour window as president if you were elected for Putin to agree to a deal that would pull him away from Beijing in exchange for the United States ending, effectively, its support for Ukraine.

But if you combine Russia's nuclear stockpile and its hypersonic missile capabilities combined with China's economy and its large land mass and the fact it is an adversary to the U.S., as well as its naval capacity, they outmatch us. So, I think our top objective should be to pull Putin out of that alliance. Putin does not enjoy being second fiddle to Xi Jinping. That is why I think he'll take that deal. But I think we have to end that Ukraine war by freezing current lines of control. PHILLIP:  Well, look. I think the other question here is, if you basically give Putin what they have seized by force, how would that stop China from seizing by force Taiwan, for example? I think the principle here, many people would argue, is that there is a world order in which you don't just get to seize territory by waging wars on your neighbors.",

But if Putin is no longer in Xi Jinping's camp, then Xi Jinping will absolutely has to think twice before going after Taiwan.I do think Taiwan is more important for the U.S. than is Ukraine because we depend on the semiconductors that come from that island nation that power our modern way of life, including our cell phones, our cameras, all modern technology, our cars, and so on. So, that is why I think that Taiwan and Ukraine are not really the same thing. We shouldn't treat them the same, either. But it is by ending the war in Ukraine and doing that deal that requires Putin to exit his alliance with China that we also deter China from going after Taiwan in a way that avoids war.

So, they'll separate the physical solid drugs and that'll go off for drug testing, which it sounds like this already happened and they determined it was cocaine. And then the packaging actually can go off and be processed in the latent print section for fingerprints or it can go off and be processed in the DNA section to generate DNA profiles or sometimes it can -- they can do both.[22:35:00] PHILLIP:  I want to show people what the size of a dime bag of cocaine would look like, basically.

And also, depending on how often it's been held, has it been crumbled up in someone's pocket for a week? Or if it's pristine, that could, you know, depend on how -- if you'll get fingerprints.And in terms of DNA, also, the size really makes a big difference. It's really small, and so they'll have to swab it and then do the DNA analysis. And really what we're talking about is touch DNA. So, you know, someone that held this Ziploc bag and they might leave traces of their DNA on there. So, there's really not a large amount of DNA. So, very often we don't get enough DNA to get a full profile. Additionally, we often get mixtures of more than one person's DNA. That's because the item could have been handled by multiple people. Or even if I were to touch something, I might leave my DNA on it, but if I touch something prior to that, I might also carry other DNA on it.
