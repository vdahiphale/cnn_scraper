Just on Monday, 13 service members died three years ago. Donald Trump appeared at the ceremony at Arlington National Cemetery. These service members died during that really chaotic and awful withdrawal from with -- from Afghanistan.Now what happened is that some of his campaign team showed up with cameras video equipment, and that is not allowed in Arlington National Cemetery. It is -- it is part of the rules of decorum in those cemeteries, there appeared to be some kind of altercation. Now we're still trying to find out the details of what exactly happened. But the Trump campaign is pushing back, saying that -- that it was -- it -- it was inappropriate, basically what the cemetery officials did, John, by preventing them from doing so. And Donald Trump's campaign has also put out a statement from some of the families saying that they had asked Donald Trump to appear at this -- at this really solemn moment here that we saw on Monday. So a -- a lot is still kind of in the gray area right now, and we're still waiting to hear more from Arlington National Cemetery. They said a report was filed. But still, it just goes to show you that we really can't escape this presidential campaign, John, no matter where we go.",

Not so fast, says the -- the Harris campaign because they want some of the rules to be altered a little bit, specifically the microphones back into -- in our CNN debate, the microphones, if you were not speaking, were muted, John, if you remember that, Donald Trump's campaign wants them to be muted for -- for this coming, upcoming debate. However, the Harris campaign wants the microphones to be open, and the reason why is they believe that they can get Donald Trump knocked off of his game. They believe that they can get him angry.

And I know Harris voters who believe that God spared Donald Trump's life because of what could have happened, should have something more serious have happened to him several weeks ago.But, you know, we also believe, especially as Latter Day Saints in moral agency that we make the decisions. We believe that the Constitution was divinely inspired. There was a great talk a few years ago by one of our leaders, President Dallin Oaks, about what that means. That doesn't mean that the Constitution is like letter perfect inerrant, but this idea of establishing a small Republican form of government, where we make the decisions, where we have a balance of powers, where we have checks on power. And in Donald Trump, we have someone with strong authoritarian tendencies, and that repels a lot of Latter Day Saints. You know, Harris-Walz, they're not going to get every Latter Day Saint to vote for them, but just as we saw in Arizona in 2020 we had 18,000 more Latter Day Saints vote for Joe Biden than voted for Hillary Clinton four years prior. And that was larger than the winning margin, and it'll make a difference in Arizona. It'll make a difference in Nevada, quite potentially. And so, yes, we're continuing to organize and just say, look, we have our agency. We have the ability to make decisions. God trusted us with that. And we, you know, from the New Testament, judge them by their fruits, right? And we look at Donald Trump's fruits and they are not good.",

But for this mission, it's even more tricky, because we're not just looking at the weather for launch. SpaceX is also looking at what the weather is going to be like, where the spacecraft is going to splash down five days from now.And so if the weather is not perfect at both locations from five days apart, then they're going to have to scrub. And so that's what they did last night. They looked at the weather again and said, we're not going to do it tonight either. So we're looking at Thursday into Friday at the absolute earliest, for when this mission could finally launch. And, you know, the reason that they're so concerned about splashdown, John, and it's not just the weather, it's the wave height, because this capsule splashes into the water somewhere. So the waves have to be the right height as well. It's because this mission isn't going to the space station where it can refuel on what's called the con -- consumables, right, like oxygen, food, water. These astronauts are going to be up there for five days, and whatever they have in that spacecraft when they launch is all they're going to get to have. And so they have to -- there's no -- there's no wiggle room at day five, if the weather is not good at the splashdown location, that's a problem.

Investigators say the suspect threw some kind of fireworks out of his car window last month, sparking the Thompson Fire in Northern California. He is now being held in jail without bail. A young girl in Florida is alive thanks to a camera her mother and a dog named Big Mama. \"NBC\" too reports the girl was inside her home when she suddenly smelled smoke, and her grandmother says one of their dogs started jumping on her as a ceiling started to fall in. Thankfully, the girl's mother was watching from miles away on the family's indoor cameras, and got on the speaker to guide her daughter and their pets out of their home to safety. Everyone is OK.

And it's all because the heat came back, and it came back in a big way. So here's the 50 million Americans impacted by heat alerts. That doesn't mean this is the only area confined to the heat, but this is where it will be felt the worst. Remember, we've got that urban heat island effect, thanks to the concentration, the dense concentration of the concrete, the asphalt of buildings along this I-95 stretch and corridor, so things heat up very, very quickly within this area. We've got a heat advisory for many locations. So yesterday, yes, this doesn't look like autumn to me. We're breaking temperatures or tying them. St. Louis is an example of that.
