And we begin this hour with new developments out of Gaza where the Israeli military says it has killed dozens of Hamas militants in ground operations overnight. The Israel Defense Forces says a staging post inside a building belonging to Hamas and an anti-tank missile launching posts were among the targets hit. Over the last few days, the IDF says it has struck more than 600 targets. According to CNN analysis of video published by Israeli media, IDF forces have advanced about 3 kilometers inside Gaza.But as the ground invasion expands, the United Nations is warning of growing hunger and desperation in Gaza, after people broke into warehouses to take survival essentials. Meantime, the Palestinian Red Crescent Society says Israel is continuing to launch air strikes next to the Al-Ahli hospital in Gaza where it reports extensive damage. CNN's Scott McLean is following developments and joins me now here in London. Scott let's begin with aid. There's increasing pressure from the international community on Israel now.",

      "sentences": "Scott, changing gears now to the fact that medics are defying orders to evacuate al-Quds hospital. So we're hearing. Probably because they feel the duty to their patients and also because there's no guarantee of safety if they did evacuate. This is despite the fact that there are air strikes hitting targets very nearby. Why is Israel doing this?MCLEAN (on camera): Yes, so the theory that we have from the Palestinian Red Crescent is that the Israelis are striking targets in the immediate vicinity of this hospital. They say three as of yesterday morning in order to essentially force their hand. To force people to evacuate because things will have gotten so miserable in that area. Video -- you know you're seeing it here -- shows, you know, some of the dust that's gotten into the building. They say that there was also extensive damage to the building as well. And look, the Red Crescent, the hospital director there, calling on the international community to try to protect this hospital and others that are like it. But look, the hospitals have maintained since the outset of this war and since Israel ordered the evacuation of these hospitals and medical facilities in northern Gaza, they have maintained that look, it is just not realistic. It is not safe to do that. A, there's no safe place for them to go in Gaza. Hospitals in the southern and central parts are already overwhelmed. And they say that look, you have patients who, you know, some of them babies in incubators. You have sick, you have injured people. And on top of that, you also have 12,000 people taking shelter inside this hospital. And they say that the vast majority of them are women and children. The hospital director also very firmly denied the accusation coming from Israel that this hospital is being used as a shelter or as a shield for Hamas fighters. He says that, look, the hospital doesn't let anyone in if they are armed.",

People are struggling to survive with the little water, with little food. They are in constant fear of violent death. There is nowhere safe in the Gaza Strip today. There is no electricity, no fuel. Hospitals are at the breaking point. In brief civilians, so they are running out of options. They are in a -- in a state of despair.We hear from our colleagues that now parents are writing the names of their children on their arms to make sure they don't end up in mass graves, as if death was inevitable. So the only thing to do now is to deescalate, to ensure long humanitarian poses, to ensure the safe provision of aid to ensure the safe treatment of severely in the -- severely wounded people, because humanity must prevail.",

And of course we stand still ready to facilitate the release of those hostages. So far, we've been successful in facilitating the release of four of them.

So a couple of dozens of trucks are nowhere near enough for people living in such -- in such a tragedy -- humanitarian tragedy unfolding. So for us, there should be no justification.

Thank you.Now to some disturbing images of how the conflict between Israel and Hamas is having a ripple effect in other regions. This was the chaotic scene at an airport in the Russian Republic of Dagestan. Videos show a large crowd storming the airport, making it onto the tarmac, some of them waving Palestinian flags after a plane arrived from Tel Aviv. Images verified by CNN show people within the crowd holding anti- Semitic signs. The Dagestan Health Ministry says at least 10 people were injured, two critically. Authorities have closed the airport until Tuesday and are investigating how to ensure that it's safe going forward and a local religious leader appealed for calm. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SHEIKH AKHMAD AFANDI, SUPREME MUFTI OF DAGESTAN (through translator): We will talk with the relevant people. And we will continue to try to resolve the issue differently, not with emotions, not with rallies, but in an appropriate way. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

The United Arab Emirates is expected to seek a binding resolution from other Security Council members for an immediate humanitarian pause in the fighting. The UAE is the only Arab country that's currently a member of the Security Council. To date, the U.S. has vetoed a resolution at the Security Council calling for a ceasefire and voted against a similar resolution introduced by Jordan at the General Assembly on Friday.U.S. President Joe Biden stressed the need for more humanitarian aid to get into Gaza in the calls with the leaders of Egypt and Israel.

Netanyahu vowed to exhaust all options to secure the release of their loved ones.Meantime, the U.S. government says it's also working to help American citizens in Gaza leave the Strip. White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan says the matter has to stay a top priority. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JAKE SULLIVAN, U.S. NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR: We are in almost hourly contact with regional partners and with Israel to try to get to a point where there is a deal to have the hostages released. It is difficult. It is challenging. The Hamas terrorists have not been forthcoming about allowing these hostages to go. But we believe that there can still be a pathway to get their release and we are going to work tirelessly to make that happen. And even though we have started to see Israel move in on the ground, that has not changed our basic view. That this has to remain a paramount priority, that we have to keep working at it and those negotiations are ongoing. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

I'm Bianca Nobilo in London with more on our top story -- the conflict between Israel and Hamas.The Israel Defense Forces released this video of their troops operating inside Gaza. They say they killed dozens of terrorists and that a fighter jet struck an anti-tank missile launching site in the area as of Al Azhar University. Israel's military also said it was increasing the urgency of their calls for people in northern Gaza to flee south. Humanitarian groups have criticized the demand, citing the difficulty of moving within Gaza while it's under attack. Iran's president says Israel has quote crossed the red lines in Gaza. President Ebrahim Raisi warns that Israel's response to Hamas in Gaza may force other nations to take action. Qatar's Prime Minister says he spoke with Iran's foreign minister by phone Sunday to discuss the Israel Hamas war and stressed the need for an immediate ceasefire in the conflict. In a statement on X, formerly known as Twitter, he said the risk of violence spilling over into other regions would have, quote, dire consequences. Sources tell CNN, a U.S. Marine rapid response force is moving toward the eastern Mediterranean Sea amid concerns over the war in Gaza broadening into a regional conflict.
