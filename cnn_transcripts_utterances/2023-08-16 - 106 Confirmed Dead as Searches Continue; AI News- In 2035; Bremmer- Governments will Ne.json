But in the meantime too lots of other stories for us to kick around including Trump's red card. The Former U.S. President has nine days to turn himself in after his fourth criminal indictment. This time in the U.S. State of Georgia, Trump and 18 other defendants charged with 41 counts of plotting to overturn the 2020 elections, the very latest on that ahead too. And leaving the pitch China stocks reporting worsening youth unemployment data, as its economic woes intensify. Beijing today calling the recovery \"Torturous\" also tortured China's embattled property developer Country Garden, warning a gain over its ability to make bond payments the country's central bank cutting interest rates unexpectedly this week also. And on Wall Street players begin to take the field, the bulls hoping to score some goals after across the board losses of over 1 percent in the previous session as you can see some red arrows there showing. European stocks also relatively mixed. Global investors suffering mid-August angst I think, amid concerns of further U.S. bank ratings downgrades interest rate uncertainty, and as mentioned, fears over China's economic weakness. And I think you can see that portrayed in the Asia session too. Japanese stocks falling below that 3200 mark for the first time in a month and a lot to get to as always this hour but first the latest on the wildfire emergency in Hawaii. At least 106 people are now known to have died in the devastating wildfires in Maui. Authorities say that number is expected to rise. Search crews continue to sift through debris even now only a third of the fire zone has even been searched. The Governor of Hawaii saying identifying those lost could take weeks. Families of the missing have been asked now to provide DNA samples. Mike Valerio is on Maui with the very latest for us once again. Mike a devastating wait now, for the friends and families of those potentially missing also questions being asked of how they perhaps could have been better protected?",

We're not hearing this directly from Travis King at this point, but Pyongyang is very clear about why the U.S. soldier fled across the border. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) HANCOCKS (voice over): North Korea claims racism in the U.S. military was the reason U.S. private Travis King crossed into its territory, adding he was seeking refuge in North Korea or a third country. One month ago King ran across the military demarcation line during the civilian tour of the demilitarized zone nothing had been heard from him since. Pyongyang finally breaking its silence on the incident claims King confessed that he \"Harbored ill feeling against inhuman maltreatment and racial discrimination within the U.S. Army\". A U.S. defense official said they could not verify Kings' alleged comments, and the focus remains on bringing him home safely. King ran across the border at the joint security area a heavily guarded area U.S. and South Korean soldiers were unable to stop him. Pyongyang claims King is \"Disillusion to the unequal American society\". There are no direct statements from King or details of his whereabouts or condition. King had faced assault charges in South Korea serving around 50 days in a detention facility. The army says he would have faced further charges if he had returned to the U.S. as planned. The day before he crossed into North Korea King was taken to Incheon Airport by a military escort, but did not build the plane claiming loss possible to airport officials who escorted him back to departures. King's mother through a family spokesperson is asking Pyongyang to treat her son \"Humanely\" asking for a phone call with him. Contact Pyongyang has not aligned with previous U.S. detainees. King's family has told CNN they feel helpless. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

So some say it is interesting that it is just the day before that North Korea is pointing out they have a U.S. soldier criticizing the U.S. Army of a valley of alleged racism.

And according to the Fulton County Sheriff who's in charge of that process, he's going to treat Donald Trump and the 18 co-defendants like he would anyone else who's been indicted here in Fulton County, which means that they're going to have to go through the infamous Fulton County Jail. It's the same jail were earlier this year a man being held on pretrial detention was allegedly eaten alive by bedbugs. Even the sheriff here in Fulton County Pat Labatt has spoken publicly about the deteriorating conditions there in the facility. And earlier today, I did reach out to the Fulton County Sheriff's Office who told me that none of the defendants so far have turned themselves in. Meanwhile, we are learning more about the potential defense strategies for Trump and his Former Chief of Staff, Mark Meadows. Meadows and his legal team filing a formal petition to try to get the venue change from state court to Federal Court arguing that anyone charged with crimes that they allegedly committed while working as a federal official should be able to have their criminal proceedings heard in a federal court. And here's what they're saying in part of that petition here saying \"Nothing Mr. Meadows is alleged in the indictment to have done is criminal per se, arranging Oval Office meetings contacting state officials on the President's behalf, visiting a state government building and setting up a phone call for the President. One would expect a Chief of Staff to the President United States to do these sorts of things\". Mark Meadows of course facing two counts in this indictment, one count for racketeering another violation of a public oath of office. He says he's going to find a file a longer formal complaint at a later date. But meanwhile, right now, his petition is in the hands of a U.S. district judge here in Georgia, Julia.",

And Mustafa, to Ian's point, you've been an integral part ofthe private sector development and the explosive acceleration that we've seen in AI's in recent years. I believe you've also seen President Biden a couple of times in the last three months. So there are two things there. Do you think the government, be it the U.S. government or more understand the tidal wave of innovation for good and bad that's coming? And do you think the private sector to Ian's point understand the responsibility that they have today and will hold in the future? MUSTAFA SULEYMAN, CEO AND CO-FOUNDER OF INFLECTION AI: You don't have somewhat surprisingly I think President Biden in the White House is actually moving very fast here. I mean, a bunch of people have said that, actually, they're moving in at an unprecedented rate. And I'd say they have a reasonably good understanding. I mean, now that everybody in the world has sort of seen the incredible potential upside and power of these models, these large language models over the last 6 to 12 months. I think everybody can imagine what that might look like if that trajectory of improvement continues for the next 10 or 15 years. And so I'm definitely seeing a really sharp focus on it. I do think that AI companies are also very much focused on it. And I think for the first time in the invention of a technology, taking the precautionary principle that is thinking ahead of time, what the potential downsides might be talking about them vocally and publicly and trying to actively mitigate them.",

And as much as look, there are no people out there, no leaders,global leaders that were talking about this issue in a serious way a year ago. And now they all are. So it's, true Mustafa is absolutely right. That the U.S. government, the EU government, the Chinese government, they're all suddenly focusing in unprecedented speed, but they are behind the curve. The companies have been moving at unprecedented speed for years now. They are better resourced. They have the expertise, and they have control. So the governments are playing catch up. And this matters immensely for national security for these countries. Not to mention the social fabric of democracies, not to mention the sustainability of economic development. So the fact that they're now focused does not mean that they're going to be successful. And it also doesn't mean they know what to do. Usually, when we have really difficult policy problems, like immigration, for example, or abortion issues, or you know, how to run up successful election. People know political leaders know what the right answer is. They just don't have the political courage and capital and will to do it. In this case, I actually do believe along with Mustafa, that the political will is there, it's just that they don't know what to do.

And understand the risks without having the United States and China that we know are already at loggerheads in terms of technology, and China certainly missed the Industrial Revolution.

And that means that suddenly, the United States and China aren't just dealing with an arms race between the two of them, but they're focused as the most powerful countries in the world that want to maintain the safety and the stability of the existing system. And in this regard, it's very important, the U.S. and China it's not North Korea, it's not a terrorist organization, it's not Russia. These are countries that ultimately even though they don't trust each other, do want to ensure that the system continues to work. And that's why Mustafa and I talk about techno credentialism. It's the AI equivalent of what we already do in the financial system, macro credentialism, that the American, the Chinese, the Europeans, they're all members of the IMF. They're all members of the Financial Stability Board of the Bank of International Settlements, and they all try to identify and mitigate risks to global stability, without choking off financial innovation and the functioning of our global marketplace. That's what needs to happen in artificial intelligence. And I was heartened, I wouldn't say I'm yet optimistic, but heartened Antony Blinken, just in the past hours, has said that, yes, that the Chinese do recognize that there needs to be a conversation on AI between the two countries that the Chinese at the Security Council just a month ago were productively participating in the first conversation in the Security Council at the AI. At a time when the Russians who aren't exactly a power here, were saying this should not be discussed at this body. I do believe that as the risks become more apparent, and they will in very short order that the pressure on the U.S. and China to work together on this front is going to grow very dramatic.",

And this would be a science led body that was focused on audits on red teaming that is pressure testing these models to identify their weaknesses. And when one company or academic lab identifies a weakness, they should then share that with the other significant players in the body. Because, you know, we've already seen some evidence of this. We already do that with the seven companies that have signed up to the voluntary commitment at the White House.

That a Women's World Cup booking their place in the in the final for the first time and deservedly so you know, they say third time lucky but that's really doing this England team a disservice after those two semi-final defeats. They absolutely deserved it. They were unified. They were hard working. They were skillful and they pulled those moments out of the bag when it mattered that goal from Ella Toone, another from Lauren Hemp and then Alessia Russo once again, making the difference that you really do have to feel for Australia's Matilda. So this is a group of women a team that have really galvanized the nation not only behind them, but behind women's football more than any previous generations and it will very much feel like a painful defeat.
