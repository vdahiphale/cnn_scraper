The incident was reported around 9:30 AM and police from different departments came in by the time they managed to get the situation under control. At least four people were killed, nine were taken to local hospitals and they are expected that there are other people that were also injured. We have been spending the day talking to the students as they were coming out. They have only been in school -- school started about a week-and-a- half ago, so they were just getting used to the routine again when they heard the shotguns first and then the alerts on the overhead announcements that they have inside the school. The school went on lockdown and they said that the panic, they went into lockdown and shortly after, once the situation was calm, police came and was able to rescue them and move them to safe locations within the high school. Many of them have told us that they saw injured people as they were exiting their classrooms. According to local authorities, earlier in the day, several schools in the area received a warning call, thread call, saying that several -- there would be shootings in several schools starting in Apalachee, which is where we are. All the schools in the area went into lock them, but once the situation was under control, they were allowed to go home. And one sight that unfortunately, we have become a little too familiar with when we come to cover the situation is the faces of desperation of the parents as they were walking up to the school trying to find out if their children were okay.",

Now, the vice president, you heard her comments talking about the shooting, but actually what she was speaking about in New Hampshire was her new plans to support small businesses. According to the plan, there are tax reliefs for starting a company that will increase from $5,000.00 to $50,000.00 and she is breaking with President Biden on capital gains taxes for higher earners. The president was intending to take it up to income tax rates whereas Vice President Harris is proposing much lower in the 30s. She said the goal is to increase investment in start-ups.

      "sentences": "It is a moderating of her position after she released her first set of economic proposals that werequite populist, but on capital gains, she he is separating herself or distinguishing herself from the president. And let me explain how: The current capital gains rate of 23.8 percent for higher earners, again, is paid when investment is sold or gains are realized, of course, but the Biden budget had proposed 39.6 percent. Now, what Harris is pushing for here is 39 -- her point here is that 39.6 is too high. Now, the reason that we are highlighting this is because again, in many things, the vice president and the president have been in lockstep. But as she starts to distinguish herself and introduce herself as the Democratic candidate, we are starting to see her break away from some of these policies and capital gains is a good example of that. Her belief according to sources, is what she said in those remarks that you just played, which is that if investors can provide more to small businesses, that is the route or the policies that they should put in place to allow for that, to encourage that. Because ultimately, Richard, the framing and the theme of today's event was about small businesses because she also made three other proposals and let me just break those down for you, expanding the tax deduction again for small businesses, removing regulatory hurdles and increasing community- based lending. So clearly, trying to appeal here to the middle-class, because the economy is a top issue for voters and we have seen that the vice president has been closing the margin with former President Donald Trump on this very issue, and these proposals, these breaks from President Joe Biden clearly aimed at trying to appeal to a broader swath of voters heading into November.",

If we are going to talk about a new trade paradigm, if we are really worried about China, we can't say to an ally like Japan well, no, you can't buy in either.

And frankly treating the US south of like its own personal China, you know, working with non-union shops in some cases, states that have lower almost no labor protections. So unions are very wary about how the Japanese operate in the US market. I am sure behind the scenes, there is also a lot of horse trading about, all right, Japan, if you're going to be able to come in and do this deal, to what extent are you going to train workers in new ways?

And one of them was this notion of holding on to the Philadelphi Corridor. And in fact, tonight, the prime minister was asked directly if the Philadelphi Corridor was so important, why was it not explicitly mentioned in that July 2nd document? And he really didn't have a good answer for that, Richard. And that's because listen, this isn't just coming from Hamas. It is not just coming from countries that don't like Israel. I've been speaking with Israeli sources close to these negotiations who made very clear to me that it was the Israeli prime minister who made additional demands and they believe that it is because of that demand, particularly on the Philadelphi Corridor, that we don't yet have a deal and some people also believe that its why those six hostages this weekend returned to Israel dead rather than alive.",

But we also learned that the 14-year-old presumably at that age and that school, perhaps a ninth grader, is a student at that school. What we did not learn today was whether this was a rifle or a pistol, how he arrived at school with it, whose gun that was, or what the disposition is with the parents of that individual, whether they are cooperating with the investigation or with it, or whether they are with him. We did learn that the 14-year-old was interviewed by both the Barrow County Sheriff's investigators and investigators from the Georgia Bureau of Investigation, and that he was talking. We don't know the substance of those conversations. And finally, we had reported that there was an investigation by authorities into purportedly a call of threats to the school that came in this morning, threatening a shooting, and the sheriff, when asked not specifically about that call but whether he knew of any advanced threat, said not to my knowledge. So that's something we'll also have to sort through as to whether that is some part of the investigation they haven't gotten to or whether that information which was provided to us by Georgia authorities is something that will turn out to be an early report that is unfounded.

It's a state that values its gun rights. On the other hand, Kamala Harris, as vice president, has been leading the Biden administration efforts on red flag laws to take guns out of the hands of people who may be in some kind of personal crisis or a mental crisis, announced the $760 million to enhance red flag laws across states, and to fund the Threat Assessment Center that would be able to do such emergency removals from people to get ahead of events just like this.
