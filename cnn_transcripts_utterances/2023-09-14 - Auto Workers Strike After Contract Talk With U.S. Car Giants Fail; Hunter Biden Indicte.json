I mean, you see the countdown clock right now on your screen.Don't turn away. That's going to be very important because it could mean that production could actually grind to a halt at General Motors, at Ford, at Stellantis, the company that builds Jeep, Ram, Dodge, and Chrysler brands. Now, the UAW president Shawn Fain saying just a little while ago, if there's no deal by midnight, that means that three plants are going to go on strike. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

But Hunter Biden is accused of lying when he bought a gun. Why? Well, they say he falsely swore that he was not addicted to illegal drugs even though he was struggling with a crack cocaine addiction at the time. Now, there's the threat of a trial, upending, of course, his father's reelection campaign. And we have news on another trial that could upend, well, another presidential campaign. A Fulton County, Georgia judge has rejected D.A. Fani Willis's plan to try Donald Trump and all of his co- defendants together on October 23rd. That's like a month away, everyone. Now, there's no trial date set as we're sitting here today for the former president, but it's likely that Trump won't actually face a trial until we're thinking maybe next year which, of course, brings us right into the heat of the race for the White House.

That cost has to be built into electric vehicles that are already expensive, that are sitting on lots longer than traditional internal combustion vehicles, and that just don't seem to be in particularly high demand right now. So, when you look at that kind of market incentive there with demand and supply, I think you're in a scenario where unless EVs become significantly more profitable for the big three, increased labor costs and diminished sales could very rapidly eat into their very existence.",

Then when he showed up in court in late July, the judge had a lot of questions about it. She had questions about how it was structured and whether it was constitutional. So, she told both sides, the government and Hunter Biden's team, to go back and try to work it out. And in that time, that is when then U.S. attorney, David Weiss, a Trump-appointee who held over, asked to be elevated to a special counsel, and that is when the prosecution team said that they could not reach a deal with Hunter Biden and that they were going to move full steam ahead. That brings us to today with this indictment of three felony charges. And one of the reasons why this was sped up a bit also is because the statute of limitations would run out next month because that's when Hunter Biden bought this gun in 2018 of October. And that is when he allegedly made these false statements on the ATF form, that he was used to purchase the gun by saying he wasn't using or addicted to drugs, and that same form was given to the firearms dealer. And then, of course, he was also charged with possessing the gun, all of them serious felony charges. Now, his lawyer, Abbe Lowell, has come out swinging tonight saying that essentially prosecutors are bending to the MAGA right side of the Republican Party.

But there's the question that Abbe Lowell is talking about, Ankush, and that is the idea of it being that this charge, these three, violate the plea agreement.

Georgia tonight, they already have a case there, 18 defendants strong. They're going to have only two trials, October 23rd, only two defendants in one trial.

What -- you know, what deference -- not deference but what space does he give to the prosecutors to argue their case and so on? Those rulings are going to potentially have an impact on what happens for the rest of the case.

The defense has really another benefit and that is that they were likely get all the transcripts from the special grand jury proceeding, something that we don't see in Georgia very often because we don't use a special purpose grand jury. So, they'll get reams of information if they get those transcripts and they'll have testimony and sworn testimony that they can then rely on.If I were going to talk to the grand jury, the body that actually indicted the case, I might be interested in what particular pieces of information they found the most compelling. Remember, they saw only a slice, only a very little bit of the case. And, you know, the presentation to this grand jury, the criminal grand jury, was small compared to the eight months of testimony that went on before the special purpose grand jury. But if you would still want to know what pieces did you find compelling, why did you find it compelling, were there questions that you had at the end of the day, the judge is not going to allow them to get into grand jury deliberations. But getting some feedback is almost like having a focus group or a mock jury. If you're prepared for trial, you'll get the benefit of their gut impression before they had their vote.",
