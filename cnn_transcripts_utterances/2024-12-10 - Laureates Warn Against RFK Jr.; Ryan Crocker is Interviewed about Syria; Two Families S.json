Republicans expect, for the most part, for senators to do their jobs, but to also support the nominees from the president-elect. And if they aren't willing to, for whatever personal reasons they may have, maybe they're interested in the job, I'm not saying that the senator is, but some have sort of thrown that out there, then those constituents in her state are going to call and say, we support Donald Trump. Now, we voted for you. You have an election coming up in about two years. If you want our support, then you need to ask your tough questions, get the answers that are necessary, but let's move this process along. The president-elect deserves that opportunity.

According to \"The New York Times\" they obtained a letter. It marks the first time in recent memory that Nobel laureates have banded together against a cabinet choice. And here's why. They put in the letter this, \"placing Mr. Kennedy in charge of HHS would put the public's health in jeopardy and undermine Americas global leadership in the health sciences.\" One of the - one of the doctors leading the charge here said this to \"The Times,\" \"these political attacks on science are very damaging.

And whether senators are willing to put the best interests, the health, the survival, the livelihood of the country before all of those things.And that's tough because, Shermichael is right, Donald Trump won the election. He is putting his people forward. I don't believe, and I think a lot of people don't believe, they are the best people. And these senators have a very difficult decision to make because while they absolutely are prone to capitulating to pressure from Donald Trump, so many of them have bent the knee, so many of them have kissed the ring, so many of them have, you know, genuflected at the altar of Donald Trump for their own political purposes, their constituency is the American voter, the Americans who depend on them to make the right decisions for their own lives and livelihoods.",
