I'm Alisyn Camerota.In the hour ahead, we're going to examine the media phenomenon that is the Netflix documentary called Harry and Meghan. Why is it the most watched documentary debut ever for Netflix? Why have people around the world watched more than 81 million hours' worth of this? Is it because of all of the blockbuster accusations in it or do we all just like to see good looking people struggling behind the scenes? Maybe we relish royal drama. Maybe everyone is hungry to hear what Harry actually says to his brother behind closed doors. How is it going over in Britain? We'll find out. What does Buckingham palace think about it? We'll find out. Maybe the phenomenon is that we're all suckers for a fairy tale or vipers for a fractured fairy tale. Really, I have so many questions. And whatever it is, something is going on with the popularity of this. Maybe it tells us more about ourselves than about Harry and Meghan. So, I'm joined by guests here and in London, all of whom have a lot of opinions about this. They'll also share new reporting on what we've seen so far and the final episodes that dropped at 3:00 A.M.

I'm sure he was shouting. I don't think we have any reason to doubt that. Charles was lying, according to Harry.

We've heard it from Oprah. We've now heard it from Netflix. We're going to have the book coming out in the new year. Is there a cell by date?",

And I think that, you know, if you've been paying a lot of attention to the times that Harry has been in public the last few years to some of the things that Meghan has done, they've been working with Jose Andres and World Central Kitchen. They've actually done some pretty interesting work where, you know, all that was needed was some funds to make things happen for people.

      "sentences": "Well, I just going to touch on what Richard said. You know, the reason why Meghan Markle, and I guess Prince Harry continued to tell their story is because there is clearly a gap between how Meghan Markle sees herself and how the world sees her. And there is a very, very wide gap. And obviously she's attempting to close that gap.I think what I really admire about the fact that she's speaking out is that, I mean, Harry touched on this in the first episode, or actually in the fourth episode where he said, look, racism, I'm paraphrasing, racism isn't just a white police officer kneeling on a black person's neck on a street in Minneapolis. It's not someone screaming, I can't breathe. Racism comes in so many different iterations. It comes in so many different shapes and sizes, and oftentimes it can be very subtle. It can be extremely covert, and actually the more subtle it is, the more courage it takes to speak out about it. And so, I just think that this is a process of education for a lot of people, especially for the British public. It's a teachable moment. Because a lot of people say to me, well, Zain, just because I don't like Meghan Markle, that doesn't mean that I'm a racist. Yes, of course. It doesn't mean that you are a racist, but you have to look at the nuances. It's what I call shadow racism behind some of the coverage, and I have to ask. What has this woman done. That headline, and you and I were just talking about this a second ago, that headline where, I can't remember which tabloid said it, but it was something like, you know, Meghan Markle's flowers at her wedding, you know, Charlotte, Princess Charlotte had an allergy to flowers, and Meghan Markle's flowers at her wedding, you know, could be responsible for -- could've killed Princess Charlotte.",
