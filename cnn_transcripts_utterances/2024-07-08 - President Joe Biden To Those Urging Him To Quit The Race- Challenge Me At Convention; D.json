Thanks so much.Let's turn now to CNN's Kristen Holmes, who's in Miami, Florida, she's following the Trump campaign. And Kristen, you're learning the saga over Biden's nomination is complicating Donald Trump's strategy. How so? KRISTEN HOLMES, CNN U.S. NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, that's right, Jess. I mean, keep in mind that these two weeks, this week and next week were supposed to be all about Donald Trump. We know that he is still yet to actually put forward a vice presidential pick and then the convention in Milwaukee next week. Now, you will not really seen or heard from Donald Trump at all. Yes, he has been on social media posting about Joe Biden, but he's really laying low for the most amount of time as they've watched this kind of spiral. They were not sure how Biden's performance would play out. But they certainly didn't see this coming. This potential that Biden wouldn't be at the top of the ticket. And Joe Biden and the Democrats have really taken the spotlight for the last several weeks since that debate. Now they are trying to figure out what exactly is next for Donald Trump. They have a self-imposed deadline of Monday. That's the start of the convention in Milwaukee for Donald Trump to actually name his vice presidential pick. When that's going to happen? We don't know. He has tomorrow a rally at his Doral Resort in Miami where we are and then later in the week, over the weekend, he has one in Pennsylvania, even the people closest to him say they are not entirely sure how this is going to roll out and he could come as late as Monday morning. Now, people close to him, they say that this is not going to impact him making an announcement. But as somebody who has covered Donald Trump for some time, he is somebody who likes to have complete control over the media narrative. Knowing that, for example, on Thursday of this week, Biden is expected to give a press conference at NATO, that all eyes are going to be on that could impact the way that Donald Trump decides to announce who his vice presidential pick is. But, right now, they are just sitting back trying to figure out what is next at the top of the ticket on the Democratic side, much like all of us are. They haven't changed any of their strategy yet. They're just sitting back and waiting to see how exactly this is going to play out.",

That is all happening, a big week for him, while Joe Biden is still in this battle, which is just remarkable to think that I'm saying that in July, right? He had the nomination wrapped up from the get go. And he is now in a battle to stay on top of the ticket. Now, it's a battle he's going on a lot more offense as of today than we have seen him over the last 11 days, whether on the donor call or in that MSNBC interview, that letter to members of Congress.

Pre-debate, Donald Trump had a two point edge in a poll of polls and average national polls, 49 percent to 47 percent, that's a pretty close race. You see post-debate, Donald Trump has stayed the same. He didn't grow his support with the debate. But Joe Biden took on some water, he is down to 44 percent. And that's a five point lead in the pll of polls for Donald Trump. So, to say that the debate had no impact, I don't think is reflected by the totality of the polls. Also, if you look at the electoral map, guys, and the road to 270, it's only going to get more complicated, look here. This is our latest assessment of the races, the yellow are the true battleground, you have some leaning red states that are clearly heavily contested states as well, like Georgia, North Carolina, Nevada, Michigan. But we are -- we are now talking about the light blue states, perhaps Minnesota, Virginia, New Mexico that are leaning democratic now, they may be coming online as more competitive in this moment, we need to see how true that is. If that happens, that means more resources that Biden has to spend in a greater number of states than he's currently spending. If the map expands against him, that's not a position of strength heading into this fall campaign.",

But after seeing the debate, and then after thinking about the fact that, you know, the president relies on things that every president relies on, including advanced staff, but he does so in a way that is distinct and seems to rely on them more. You know, one example is the teleprompter, right? Joe Biden uses a teleprompter, every president uses a teleprompter, but Joe Biden uses it more seems to rely on it more. He even uses it in small fundraising events. So, basically, what was happening is that even in small, usually casual events with just not that many people, the White House was very, very concerned about every single step the president was taking that even experienced staffers thought was a little bit unusual. And then after the debate, they basically feeling that maybe this was to make up for his limitations.

The fact is that if he has doubters, especially doubters that are powerful, whether or not they'd be a big donor, a big Democrat. And the fact of if they go public with their doubts, it honestly sort of makes him more motivated to go forward. And that's sort of the dilemma that you're seeing in this DemocraticParty. It's part of the reason why you notice when any Democrat suggests that maybe he should step aside. They always preceded with heaps of praise for the president, how historic he's been, how great of a job he's been. And then they say, I think you should go out there. The entire Democratic Party in essence is tiptoeing in some ways around Joe Biden's ego in order to try to coax him out of the race. But Joe Biden, very proud person has no intention. He's been saying he has no intention to get out of the race, and part of that is because it is a commandment in Joe Biden's orbit that he is the most electable candidate against Donald Trump.
