It's unclear if it detected any overheat, but in Salem, Ohio, just 13 miles further along, surveillance video clearly shows sparks and bright lights coming from under a rail car at about the halfway point of the train. There is another hot box detector just down the track from where the surveillance video was taken, but it's not clear if it detected an overheat either. If it did, both the conductor and dispatcher would have been alerted to a heating issue, the NTSB said. Shortly before the derailment, another detector alerted the crew of a mechanical issue.

That snow is so dry and it blows all around the roadways, so we wind up with drifting and whiteout conditions regardless of snow falling. So blizzard warnings still in effect across the Upper Midwest, back into the Northern Plains. They are now extending. Winter storm warnings into New England, where we are expecting snow this morning and throughout the upcoming days as the whole system tracks further eastward. Still holding on to snowfall this morning in Minneapolis Green Bay, back through the U.P. of Michigan, all across the Great Lakes for that matter. Not just snow, but ice. Even though they have allowed the ice storm warnings to expire, we are still dealing with accumulation. Battle Lake, Wyoming, 48 inches of snowfall. That's preliminary. More snow to come. Of course, we'll add on to that. Ann Arbor, Michigan, impressive and dangerous crippling accumulations for ice, 0.65 inches. And there's that forecast. Still holding on to snowfall through the rest of the morning, through the Upper Midwest and the Great Lakes. The whole system again tracking eastward Friday morning across New England, switching over to more of the ice threat. So again, travel becomes not advised in those locations. More snow expected across the Midwest, parts of Iowa, back into Illinois and Indiana as we come into the upcoming weekend. So another system trying to head our direction here. Nowhere near what we're dealing with now. 6 to 8 more inches expected across the Great Lakes and Upper Midwest on top of what we've already experienced through Friday, and then more so across New England here in the upcoming days. Ice accumulation a little less, but still holding on to that threat. Notice the light pink color. That's a quarter of an inch of ice expected.
