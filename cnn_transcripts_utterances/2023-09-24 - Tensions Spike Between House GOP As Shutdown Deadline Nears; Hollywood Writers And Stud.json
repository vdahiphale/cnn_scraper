I'm Fredricka Whitfield, and we begin this hour with growing pressure on Capitol Hill to avoid a crippling government shutdown this week.Time is running out. Lawmakers now have just six days to pass a spending bill to fund the government. Federal agencies have already started the formal process of preparing for a shutdown, and if that happens, millions of federal workers could have their paychecks withheld until a deal is reached. But with the clock ticking, it is clear how Speaker Kevin McCarthy doesn't have the votes to pass a stopgap funding bill and House Republicans are engaged in open warfare over who is to blame for the stalemate. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. MICHAEL TURNER (R-OH): The holdouts keep saying to Kevin McCarthy, don't bring bipartisan bills to the floor. We don't want you to use Democrat votes to try to avert a shutdown. But they're using Democrat votes to try to cause a shutdown, and these individuals, these Republican holdouts are voting with Nancy Pelosi. REP. MATT GAETZ (R-FL): We should have separate single subject spending bills. Kevin McCarthy promised that in January. He is in breach of that promise. So I'm not here to hold the government hostage, I'm here to hold Kevin McCarthy to his word. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

It happens very rarely. The right has gone out of their way to humiliate McCarthy. And look, I mean, McCarthy's strategy from the beginning, since he has been speaker has been in the end to give his critics on the right most, if not almost all of what they want, and to believe that in the end, the members from the more competitive districts, the 18 Republicans from districts that Biden carried, the additional dozen or so in districts that Trump narrowly carried, they will fall in line in the end.

You know, you could look at that first debate and say that Nikki Haley did the best at kind of elevating herself out of that pack. You know, there's some evidence of her moving and advancing in the polls in all three of the early states, particularly New Hampshire, and South Carolina. But like, you know, you're talking about a drawing at the margins of this race. The overriding fact is that Donald Trump is polling at 55 or 60 percent, and none of them really made a dent in that. So who is second, 45 points behind Trump is somewhat of, you know, a thin victory. If that's all you're going to achieve. Clearly, in the second debate, they have to be there to make more of a case against Trump and put more pressure on him to show up and defend himself.

CNN's Camila Bernal, joining me now from Los Angeles. Camila, hopeful are people?   CAMILA BERNAL, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Look, people are hopeful, but also a little bit skeptical because what they're doing now is waiting for the Writers' Guild, waiting to see if they're going to make any sort of announcement because sources close to the studios have said that the studios offered a best and final offer. So, they are still at the negotiating table today, but everyone really on pins and needles waiting for the WGA to decide what's going to happen here moving forward. There are people here who say look, we want to return to work, we're ready to go back, but they also say that they're willing to continue this strike for as long as it takes because they want to work through the demands. They say they specifically want higher wages when it comes to streaming and those residuals. They're also very focused on artificial intelligence. And so all of these writers that I've talked to have said, look, we want our demands to be met. We want the studios to listen to our demands, and one of them saying, we want to be able to put food on the table. We want to be able to save for our future. So these are the kinds of things that they're focused on. And there is a lot of skepticism in terms of what they're hearing from the studios. So again, they're just waiting to hear from the WGA.

They're going to -- they actually had continued to list medical debt that had been paid off, so they're not going to do that anymore. They are not going to put it on the credit report for a year as opposed to six months to give people more opportunity to work out any problems between the insurance companies and the providers, and they are also not going to include debt that's less than $500.00 on credit reports.

A phenomenal international career.You mentioned the two World Cups, the Olympics, more than 200 caps. So today will be 203, sixty-three international goals, 73 assists, just an absolutely phenomenal career. In 2019, which is pretty recent, only four years ago, that was the pinnacle for her not only winning a second World Cup title, but doing it where they were under so much pressure to do so because of the fight they were all involved in for equality within US soccer. So they really felt as though they had to go out and win. Rapinoe was the leader of that team. She incurred the wrath of President Donald Trump at the time. So I mean, you remember when all of that was going on, that was when we got that iconic photo where she kind of stood there with her arms kind of outstretched, you know, which broke the internet. So this is what she's achieved on the field, but when you look at what she's achieved off the field, this is why she has such a huge legacy.
