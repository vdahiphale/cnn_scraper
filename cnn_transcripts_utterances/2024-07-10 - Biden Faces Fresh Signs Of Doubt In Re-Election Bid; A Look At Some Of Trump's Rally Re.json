Leading this hour however, new cracks for President Biden, Hollywood actor Democratic fundraiser George Clooney leading today's charge calling on President Biden to drop out of the presidential race. DNC fundraisers separately canceled an upcoming fundraising event. A slew of Democrats on Capitol Hill are coming out voicing fresh concerns about what happens to them and the party if Biden stays in the race. CNN's Manu Raju on Capitol Hill chasing down Democrats left and right. Eight congressional Democrats, eight House Democrats, Manu, have already publicly called on Biden to step aside.

That's the Colorado Democratic senator who said on CNN that he believes that Joe Biden is on track to lose and there could be a landslide, that the House and Senate could go Republican and that there's probably -- he didn't go as far as calling for a change. But that is what a lot of people privately want to see happen. They want Joe Biden to make up the mind -- make up his mind and make, they say, the right decision. Now one comment that got a lot of tension today was Nancy Pelosi, the former House Speaker, she went on MSNBC earlier today and she suggested that Joe Biden would have to make a decision about whether to run or not.

BILL DE BLASIO, (D) FORMER NEW YORK CITY MAYOR: Well, Jake, I think it is predictable that when there's a challenge and when there's an open question about what to do, you try to project continuity. And that's 100 percent necessary for all the campaigning that's happening on the ground in the swing states. You got to keep that operation going. And so the President's message is pretty much the only one he could give at this point. But I'll tell you, as someone who -- I, myself on a much more humble level had to decide whether it was time to end my political career, and that's a very, very tough and emotional and kind of painful decision, I think the President's obviously, thinking about all the evidence in front of him.

And Donald Trump failed in debate, because he was just as radical, just as extremist. He literally said, oh, everyone wanted Roe v. Wade to be overturned.

It would be kind of ironic, if we said to our own party, people are not allowed to speak up and express their concerns. Yes, I think the President has been an extraordinary president far beyond I think what many people predicted. But at the same time, if there are valid concerns, and folks want to surface them, that's healthy, we got to have this discussion.Now, the President has an opportunity to answer those concerns by the way he campaigns and the way he governs in the coming days. Or he might make a decision to step aside and the obvious choice then would be Kamala Harris. And Kamala Harris would bring a lot to the equation, she could potentially help us reach some of the voters, we may be seeing some drift within the black community or some of those -- particularly those suburban women voters that we really need to be part of our coalition with swing states. So, you know, Joe Biden has live options here. But I would emphasize on the emotional level, I think this has sort of been undercounted. This guy has been a successful president. Imagine what it feels like if you've kind of done everything right and now all these people are saying it's time to go, well, that's painful. So I think in fact, if people push too hard, in some ways, there is the problem of a very, you know, honorable and proud man kind of bristling at that. So I think in a funny way, we're at the balance point. Some voices are saying what's on a lot of people's minds. Plenty of other people are being very careful and diplomatic.

And also you left out of that whole thing, Jake, is that he said he didn't know what NATO was when he ran for office, which is sort of true because he didn't know what the sights Pecos (ph) treaty was related to the Middle East. He didn't know the difference between a Shia and Sunni. And he's sort of bragging about that now. And so, there's an anti-elitism strategy there. There's an anti-anything but white strategy there.

Now, I will say this, because you and I are both students of history, Jake, the Democrats are at their best when they are bold and they go with younger candidates. So, Barack Obama at 47, young candidate going against a war veteran, beat the war veteran. Bill Clinton, generational -- Boomer generation going against the greatest generation, he beat the war veteran. And so the younger people in the Democratic Party do better. Seventy-five percent of the voters are saying that the President is too old to do this now. I think he's done a great job.

A cold gun means that the fact that it didn't have any ammunition in it, that there was nothing in it. And so in other words, he had no idea plus, it also wasn't his role as an actor to check the gun and make sure that it was safe.",

No, it didn't. Russia is still there. Russia is still -- the Russian army is moving forward. Ukraine could not gain success on the battlefield.And when we ask, so what is the final amount of weapons we should be delivered in order to check -- to turn the tide around and make Ukraine in a better shape from the perspective of the battlefield? No one can give an answer. So this shows to us that instead of the battlefield, we should look at the negotiating table, and we should encourage negotiations to be started, which brings the hope of an agreement of peace, which can ensure a durable and fair peace in the region.
