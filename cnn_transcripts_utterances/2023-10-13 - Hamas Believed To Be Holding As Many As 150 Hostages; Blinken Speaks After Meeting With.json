And upon getting here, I spoke with one of the family members of a hostage who has been gone since Saturday. They know she has a hostage because they have actually seen a video now of the people who took her -- the Hamas terrorists who took her. Very disturbing of course for the family to see.I talked to her brother-in-law, partly because her sister, the woman he's married to is, so distraught. She cannot get herself together. She cannot do anything but think of what is happening with her sister and whether or not she will be rescued from the hands of Hamas. I do want you to hear from Dan Mor. He is a person who normally says look, were you -- we live a good life. We love it here. We love our lives here. But this has completely and utterly devastated the family, that Moran who is his sister-in-law, was at that festival where everybody was dancing very near the Gaza border. And then she calls up her family and they can hear gunshots going off over and over and over and over again. There is screaming. There is rushing. There is yelling. And then they lose her. Then, they don't hear from her anymore and they have not heard from her since. What they have done though is see a video of her now that was put out on TikTok. And here's how he describes what he saw in that video. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

In this area -- in Israel, you hear rockets going off fairly regularly, depending on where you live, especially in those border towns in places like Ashdod and Ashkelon, anywhere sort of near the Gaza border.It is not all that unusual to hear rockets going up every now and then. And people go about their daily lives because usually the Iron Dome takes care of it and they're able to move on. Every now and then, there's damage. Sometimes someone is injured. More rarely someone is killed, but it is a part of the life living here in Israel. What is different this time is that almost every single person that you come in contact with, knows someone who has either been killed, injured, or kidnapped. Knows someone whose children have either been killed, injured, or kidnapped, or grandparents who have been killed, injured, or kidnapped. It is remarkably devastating that so many people in this country have ties -- close ties with someone who has been maimed or killed in this attack by Hamas. They also talk about what is happening in Gaza because they realize there are civilians, innocents there as well. And they are seeing that horror happen as well again. And so, there is this sense here. It's very different. It is far more quiet. Although we are on the Sabbath. This is Shabbat, the sun has gone down and people are observing. But it is different. The feeling is much more tense, it's much more filled with sorrow, and it's much more filled with fear, John,",

The UN has said for so many people to move, it is impossible. John Kirby has also said it would be a toll order to try to do that.Hamas controls the transportation, controls whether or not people can move around in big numbers like that, and Hamas has told those civilians to stay put. So, then the situation is set where Israel is asking the civilians to get out of the way. When they go in with the ground forces is expected, as the secretary of state was saying, if the civilians are used as human shields, which appears that they would be, there'll be civilian casualties. Who gets the blame? There will be countries that will absolutely blame Israel and tell it to stop its military operation. And Israel will say we gave the opportunity and asked for the civilians to move. And Hamas stopped them. Hamas is responsible. They'll say Hamas doesn't care about the population. This is a blame situation that we've seen play out before. It doesn't change what will happen on the ground. But it is -- it is something that absolutely will complicate you know the situation on the ground. And the same for the hostages. I think the expectation is that the hostages on the ground could be used as human shields as well. So, before -- we were speaking before about the timeliness of this, the short timeframe that Secretary Blinken has here to do this. And this is because the ground incursion could come very soon.

Murdering babies, burning families to death, and taking little children as hostages, these are unconscionable acts of brutality. Every country in our judgment needs to condemn these actions, needs to hold them accountable, and we will continue to make that clear. When it comes to providing for civilians in Gaza, both ensuring that they can be out of harm's way and that they can have access to the support that they need, the humanitarian assistance, the food, the medicine, the water, our focus now is on helping to create safe zones. And we're doing that with the leading international organizations, we're doing that engaged with Israel, and we're working with other countries to that -- to that end. So, that's where our focus is.

Iran and Hezbollah have already made threats of opening this new front if attacks on civilians, and the -- or an Israeli blockade of Gaza continues. What would the U.S. response be if Hezbollah ramps up its own attacks, for instance, in response to a ground invasion? And, Sheikh Mohammed, the U.S. and Israel are both struggling with this tragic and fluid hostage situation that the secretary was talking about. And I've looked for Qatar to help navigate it. Can you tell us about your engagements with Hamas? And are you optimistic about getting these people back alive, given the reports that some of them may have already died in Israeli strikes on Gaza? And secondly, there have been rising criticisms and protests across the Arab world as Israel -- as Israel's retaliation continues. What's your view of how Israel is conducting its military response?
