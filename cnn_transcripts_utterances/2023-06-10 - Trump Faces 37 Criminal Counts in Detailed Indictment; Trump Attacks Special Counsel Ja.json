Now 31 of those counts involve the retention of national defense information. That kind of information includes things like details about U.S. Nuclear programs, about defense and weapons capabilities, about potential vulnerabilities to attacks, and potential response options should that happen.Now, it really speaks to the level of sensitivity about these documents that were found. And U.S. Officials that I've talked to since this indictment was unsealed, really agree with prosecutors that these are exactly the kind of materials that could put human sources at risk. And also, the way that these documents were found at Trump's resort in Mar-a-Lago could erode trust from allies who really depend on the U.S. to keep these kinds of things secret. Now, you mentioned earlier these documents were found in a variety of different places, in some cases, a ballroom at Mar-a-Lago, a bathroom, a bedroom, even a shower. And there's one photo in the indictment itself that really puts a finer point on the sensitive documents and how -- I mean, if you look right there, that's a five-eyes intelligence document, something that's reserved only to be shared with the U.S.'s closest allies, spilled out on the floor in a storage room at Mar-a-Lago. So this indictment really does, more broadly speaking paint a narrative or really detail out what investigators have found as they've been probing Trump's handling of classified documents.

As human beings, we just want to know why other people do the things that they do.Now looking at the material that's referred to in the indictment, it's really not very easy to figure out why he took this stuff. Its -- and it covers a broad range of material, at least in the way that it's described across those 31 documents. The best hint that we have in the -- in the indictment as to why are the two episodes that it refers to, the one which we've reported heavily on here at CNN about the conversation that the former President had with Mark Meadows, co- authors of his memoir, where he allegedly referred to a classified document about Iran. There is a second episode referred to in the indictment in which he has a conversation with a member of one of his PACs in which he shows that person allegedly a classified map about U.S. Military presence in some part of the world in conflict zone. So, you know, I guess one of the answers to that question of why is to impress others, show people what he has access to, to maybe use that information in his interactions with other people in some -- in some way.

Some of them end up having to testify, and having, you know, their attorney-client privilege, his attorney-client privilege pierced.I think here, there could be some benefit for Trump because it's a tried and true tactic of delay for a defendant to get rid of their counsel. They don't like them, they can't get along with them, and you bring in new counsel and they need time to get up to speed. So this is an old trick that I've seen as a prosecutor. I wouldn't say I've played it as defense counsel. But if you're under a deadline, you're trying to slow things down, changing counsel can slow things down, so that might be of some benefit to him.",

However, my guess and this is purely speculation, is that they never felt they had probable cause to be able to convince a judge to give them a search warrant.The information that we know, particularly about the episode we were discussing earlier about the conversation at Bedminster in which he referred to and maybe had in his possession a document about Iran that occurred about a year before prosecutors discovered it. So when you're applying for a search warrant and one of the aspects of the information you use to base the request on is it has to be fresh, it has to be recent because ultimately you're trying to convince the judge that there is probable cause to believe that there is evidence of a crime in that location now. That's why you have to go get it.

I have to say, I was surprised that the case was brought in Florida versus Washington D.C. since the focus seemed to be in D.C. Not privy, obviously, to what went on there in terms of internal deliberations. The Justice Department might have been trying to head off arguments about whether venue was proper in D.C. or not. They perhaps wanted to show that they weren't venue shopping themselves, not looking for a more liberal type of jury pool, which would be found in D.C.If there was some element of discretion there, it was a calculated risk, and certainly drawing Cannon would be the worst outcome of that calculated risk.",

Having said that, you have to keep in mind there are fires burning right across this country, from the west to the east. It is on track already to be the second worst fire season ever in this country. And it will likely be surpassed given the fact that this is still early in that wildfire season. Now, having said all of this, what is going to help the most is some cooler, wetter weather moving through some critical regions like Quebec, hopefully in the next few days. This will continue to be a problem though, and I want you to see why. Have a look at this map. This is Canada. In fact, North America. That includes Alaska, the boreal zone. It includes millions of hectares of boreal forest. Those places have been susceptible to more wildfires given climate change. It's not a clear pattern, it is incredibly complex. But the fact remains that there have been more wildfires and they emit carbon of their own. That also adds to the climate crisis. Given what you see there, officials in the United States and Canada are trying to see if they come up with some kind of joint fire management system that includes better ways to try and manage wildfires in the future. And also obviously trying to pool resources, trying to really not just prevent the fires, but when they see hotspots, get on top of it right away. Having said that, officials say to prepare for what unfortunately will be a very severe wildfire season in the months to come. Paula Newton, CNN, Ottawa. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

But we're still seeing high levels of pollution. Some of it has moved towards the Midwest as opposed to the East Coast.
