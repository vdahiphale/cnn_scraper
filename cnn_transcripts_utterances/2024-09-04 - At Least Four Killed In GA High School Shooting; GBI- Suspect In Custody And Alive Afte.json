And the focus is on Georgia, where there's been a school shooting in Winder. At least four people are believed to have been killed, approximately 30 more injured. This is according to law enforcement sources outside of Georgia.Speaking to CNN's John Miller, we should point out of those approximately 30 that are injured, it's not clear how many of them were gunshot wound victims. Some of them may have been hurt while trying to flee the scene. Officials say that at least one person is in custody, a suspect, but that it could take multiple days to get clarity on exactly what transpired.",

You can't imagine what's going through the minds of those parents and those students about a month into the school year facing this tragedy. We want to bring in CNN Law Enforcement Expert John Miller.John, the Sheriff outlined this morning that calls first started coming in of an active shooter at 9:30 this morning. It wasn't that long after that we started getting word that that suspect was in custody. What do you make of that response time and what we know so far about what took place?",

He said. 04But, John, if you could stay with us, as we do have reaction as well from Governor Tim Walz who said that it is tragic and that this kind of thing is all too common. Can you talk to us, John, a little bit more as you've been speaking to sources about these casualty numbers. Four people believed to be dead, 30 more injured. Talk to us a little bit about what you know there. And also, since we're hearing from the Sheriff, he's just saying multiple injured that sort of reticence to get into the numbers.

      "sentences": "Well, a sheriff is unique in American law enforcement. You know, the police chief is someone that's hired by the town or the city who reports to the mayor. Sheriffs in this country are by and large elected, which means they're more than just the law in a county like Barrow County. They are a community leader who has been placed there with popular support of the community.So I think the Sheriff is being very cautious here because he's dealing with human beings, he's dealing with families and very raw emotions. If you give a number of casualties and then it goes up, people will say, you know, that we were robbed of hope. If you give specifics and the information changes, you know, you can be criticized. So I think what he is working towards is building with those law enforcement partners the support system to reach out to those families, to make sure that the information they're getting is certain. We have seen in past cases where someone was listed as deceased and then they were revived on the way to the hospital. We've seen cases where they came out with a very small number, and that number expanded. So I think what he's doing is out of not just an abundance of caution in terms of statements, but out of an abundance of compassion to make sure that whatever he reveals beyond that at 4 o'clock is information he's very certain of, at least at that moment.",

And we just got an update from the Georgia Bureau of Investigations. They posted this to social media writing, update, four dead, an additional nine taken to various hospitals with injuries. And this is important, suspect in custody and alive, reports that the suspect has been neutralized are inaccurate.We have CNN's Josh Campbell tracking all of this for us. And Josh, it's significant that officials are pointing out that this suspect is alive, not only because there had been apparently reports that he had been neutralized, but also because this is a significant factor in the investigation as they try to figure out a motive and exactly what happened at the school.",

And you're right, this is very rare that you find somebody being taken alive because that's not part of the psychological profile of people who kill at schools. They don't want anybody to have any kind of input into their disposition, the end of their life. They want to take control of that.But I think the problem here, or not the problem, the thing here that we need to just manage our expectations here is you're not going to find a reason. You're not going to hear a reason that justifies this. You're just going to hear a cycle, a reason that justifies some kind of homicidal or ideation that this person has. It will tell scientists. It will tell forensic scientists. It will tell profilers why they did it. And it will be a great science experiment -- not to -- I don't mean to make it sound petty, but I mean, this is where you find out why they're going to do it, what's going to happen in the future, how we defend against it.

      "sentences": "Yes, that's absolutely true, Boris. And, you know, my experience has been, if an attorney becomes involved in it at an early stage, the questioning stops. There's no benefit to defense counsel allowing police to question someone. But the good news is that sometimes, you get a person like this in your custody for a period of time. And you have the ability to connect with them. A lot of times, people who do things as tragic and just crazy as this want to talk. They want to tell you what led them to do what they did.And as was said, it's not logical. It's not anything that's going to be of assistance to the victims' families, but it does offer insight into the thought patterns of someone who is planning something like this. So in that way, it's beneficial. It's also helpful if this individual had assistance from anyone. Sometimes, someone will either wittingly or unwittingly assist in preparing for a terrible thing like this. And they should be held accountable, even if it was an unwitting assistance, providing an underage person with a firearm, for instance, or giving ammunition to someone who shouldn't have it legally. All of those things really important to understand and to hold people accountable for, whether it'd be a gun dealer or a person in the family or someone who is otherwise assisting. So there's a lot of important work going on right now. And hopefully, they'll get some idea as to what this individual was thinking before it happened.",

I've been in meetings where we've gamed out or played out what would happen if there was a shooting at a school. And, you know, there are some people that say, well, you know, put up a perimeter and tell parents they can't come in. They're coming, whether you like it or not.And you really have to keep in mind the mentality of someone who's got a child in that school and do whatever you can to provide outreach to the individuals involved and not to treat them badly or to try to eliminate them from the conversation. But it really is sort of an opening the doors up, having them come into a controlled area and then very quickly, getting them information and being compassionate, and getting the children as quickly as you can into the arms of their family. They're never going to be satisfied until they can physically touch the kids that are in that school. And, you know, it's heart wrenching to see a group of 40 or so students standing in a circle praying on a football field. The parents want to be part of that. And it's hard to keep them away from it.",
