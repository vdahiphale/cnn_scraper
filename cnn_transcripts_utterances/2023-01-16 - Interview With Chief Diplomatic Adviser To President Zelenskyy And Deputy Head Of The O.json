A Russian missile strike in an apartment building in Dnipro has left at least 40 people dead, making it one of the deadliest single attacks of the war. Ukraine's authorities report that it was cruised by a missile. The current wave of attacks on civilian targets comes at a make-or-break moment in this long vicious war. Despite earlier Russian claims a victory, Ukraine says there is continued fears and ongoing fighting for the Russian town of Soledar, near Bakhmut. And Kyiv fears that Putin will find some excuse to try to reinvade from the north. The military warns that combat air drills that began today between Russia and Belarus present a clear danger. Meanwhile, more western allies, including Britain, France and Poland promised to send Kyiv tanks and other advanced weapons. But, is it happening fast enough to help Ukraine defend itself against a feared Russian offense this spring? Igor Zhovkva is a top aide to President Zelenskyy and he's chief diplomatic adviser and he's joining me now from Kyiv. Welcome to the program. As we speak, Mr. Zhovkva, your rescue crews are still digging out that apartment building in Dnipro. Do you know the number of dead? Do you think it will go higher?",

So, President Zelenskyy who is striving for peace, was talking about this from the first days who doesn't want peace? Who suggested a very simple way out. 10 points peace formula. The president suggested it to many of the world leaders. And I haven't heard anything this peace formula from any single world leader -- oh, except probably one, you just mentioned now, President Putin himself. He doesn't even want to talk about this. Very simple formula with nine points being the points of depriving Russia of aggressive instruments, not only on the battlefield. Because depriving all of us from food supply from Ukraine is also aggression. Making environmental disaster is also aggression, et cetera. Even the statute of the U.N. is also an aggression. So, let's combine our efforts together, that's what my president tells to the world leaders.

They managed to escape Irpin just before the Russian troops entered. They, nonetheless, face bombing and saw missile strikes and the like. Many of their family members were either trapped behind Russian lines or in some cases, in prison or deported in the way, as were many people that they knew. And when the they initially fled, Ruswan (ph), the husband, he stayed in Western Ukraine, whereas Maya (ph), his wife, and their two-year-old daughter found temporary refuge in Spain because the European Union opened their borders. However, overtime, they recognize that even after the Ukrainian forces recaptured Irpin, which they did later in the fighting, that normal life there would be almost impossible and they also recognize, for various reasons, that it would not be possible for them to stay in Spain permanently, including the fact that Spain, because of its labor policies, has significant limits on child opportunities in that country and there are other issues as well. So, they heard about the Uniting for Ukraine Program from friends of theirs who were previous participants and were already in the U.S. And then, they got on to the same We-Connect website that I mentioned earlier and they found us.",

There are also geopolitical advantages to us taking in the Ukrainians in this situation because, for -- in pretty obvious ways, it strengthens our position in the international war of ideas against dictators like Putin. So, while one can imagine legal challenges, it's unlikely that they would succeed, at least not based on the wording of the statute in question. I do recognize concerns, and I've written about it myself, that, you know, this statute if interpreted broadly as, by the way it was, under the Trump administration, would give the president vast unilateral power over immigration, perhaps too much.

Though, I think we can perceive incrementally and I think we can learn lessons from the domestic civil rights struggle against racial and ethnic bias where, ultimately, progress was made because more and more people recognize that distinctions of race and ethnicity are ultimately arbitrary, where you are allowed to live, what sort of work you are allowed to do should not depend on whether you are white or black or Hispanic or Asian or whatnot.
