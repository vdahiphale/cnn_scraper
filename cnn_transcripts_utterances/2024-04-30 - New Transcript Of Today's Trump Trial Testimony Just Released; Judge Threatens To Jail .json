Trump now on noticed that he could be jailed, yes, jailed if he's found in contempt again. For the next hour, we'll take you inside the courtroom from gavel-to- gavel. Our reporters and experts are standing by to break down today's most important developments and look ahead to what's next. Welcome to our viewers here in the United States and around the world. I'm Wolf Blitzer with a special report in The Situation Room, the Trump Trial Today. Donald Trump's historic criminal trial is set to resume on Thursday with more compelling and potentially crucial testimony by the former lawyer for Stormy Daniels and Karen McDougal. His turn on the witness stand capping a jam packed day inside the courtroom that included the judge finding Trump in contempt for nine violations of his gag order. Let's get to all the breaking news right now. CNN's Kara Scannell is outside the courthouse for us. Kara, we just got a new partial transcript of today's testimony.

This is right after the Access Hollywood tape. Keith Davidson says, yes. Who sent the first text in this chain? Keith Davidson, it's from me. And what did you say? Trump is effed. You wrote the whole word out, effed, in the text? He says, I did. What prompted you to say that Trump was effed? The Access Hollywood tape. How did Dylan Howard respond, Dylan Howard over at AMI the National Enquirer, he responded with, wave the white flag, it's over people, exclamation point. And how did you interpret that?

Keith Davidson says, in any event, Gina, and that's a communications person, called me up to tell me that some jerk called me and was very, very aggressive and threatened to sue me. And I would like you, Keith, to call this jerk back. Prosecutor, I hate to ask it this way, but who was that jerk? Answer, it was Michael Cohen. So, what happened when you called? Did you call Michael Cohen? I did. Tell us about that. Gina provided me the number that he left either with her ex or on the voicemail. It was for the Trump organization. I called. I was transferred to Michael Cohen. I introduced myself. And before I could barely get my name out, I was just met with like a hustle barrage of insults and insinuations and allegations.

Michael Cohen already established by another witness was known to be working on behalf of Donald Trump, the candidate, not just as an attorney for him.The jury hasn't seen the Access Hollywood tape, and they're not going to see it in this trial. It's too prejudicial, but they're going to be seeing all of the blowback after it, including the urgency, the intensity, the things that Michael Cohen was saying and doing to really communicate that they believed there was a problem in the Trump campaign, that they needed Keith Davidson to take care of with Stormy Daniels.",

There were several points at which the witness testified that he had effectively been misled by Cohen. I think the quote that we saw up there earlier, I'll just do it myself. I would not be surprised if we see that in the defense closing as indicative of Cohen sort of freelancing in this area. So, it's good for the prosecutors to get it out in this way when they can control it, but these are not great facts for Michael Cohen.",

Okay. How did you respond to that? Davidson, good, throw in an ambassadorship for me. I'm thinking the Isle of Man question. What did you mean by that? Mr. Davidson? It was sort of in jest, but it was just a joke. So, the question, I'm trying to think about how to phrase this question. Why was that a joke? Why was that funny? What was going on in your mind when you made that joke? Answer from Davidson, well, I don't even think the Isle of Man is a country, Steinglass laughs, and I know they don't have an ambassador, but I think it was a reference to Mr. Trump's candidacy. Question, can you just explain that a little bit more? Answer from Davidson, that somehow if Karen did this deal with AMI, that it would help Donald Trump's candidacy. Question, and at the time that you sent that text in just, did you understand that AMI was working with then candidate Trump regarding your client? Answer, I don't know about that. I don't know that I had specific information that they were or not working with him. I knew they'd announced their support for Mr. Trump, but I don't know that they were working with him. Okay. Is it safe to assume from your joke that you had an understanding that if you were to close your deal, that would somehow benefit the candidate, Donald Trump? Answer from Keith Davidson, yes.",

Joining us now is someone who has worked with Judge Merchan and knows him well, retired New York State Supreme Court Justice Michael Obus. Justice Obus, thank you so much for joining us.

The jury doesn't even know about this, hopefully.And if the judge were to incarcerate the defendant, that runs the risk of spilling out into the jury and even risking a mistrial. I don't think he'll be pushed that far. And in the meantime, I think the potential penalty, which Judge Merchan has now specifically referred to, which I thought was interesting, has had some bearing on what Defendant Trump has had to say. I did catch his speech after the court proceedings today, where he carried on about. The gag order itself, and about all the judges, Judge Kaplan, Judge Engoron, Judge Merchan, about the district attorney. He did not say a word about the witnesses. He's removed the offending posts and reposts, and I expect he will pay the fines. So, it will be interesting to see what happens Thursday morning, but I don't think, um. Judge Merchan will be pushed to the wall on this. BLITZER: Interesting. On Trump's remarks after the trial today, I want to play a brief excerpt of what he said. Listen to this.

Of course, you have the assistance of your law clerk and the court staff and all of that, but basically are out there on your own. You have to make decisions in real-time, some of the time or reserve decision and spend your evenings getting ready to make a decision the next morning. He has done amazingly well with that. And I think what has shown is not only that it seems to me that defendant Trump is now lining himself with the with the gag order, and I'm sure his lawyers are advising him to do so, but also that the trial is actually proceeding, quite efficiently and fairly, and I think his lawyers know it.

You're all starting to see David Macintosh, who runs Club for Growth, somebody who had been feuding with for roughly over a year and now has come back into the fold. You saw Ken Paxton there. They are trying to show that he has the Republican Party behind them. Now, of course, he wants to have one of his kids in there as well. But the other part of this is just the fact that it is a logistical challenge. They cannot have just Trump's advisers in there every single day because they can't have access to their phones and they can't do any work when there in that courtroom.

And so to have a family member there today, definitely, I think was good for him, but then I think, too, that, you know, he is having a hard time with not being control and sitting there every day because he's used to being at Mar-a-Lago where when he enters the room, they stand up and clap for him. And in this courtroom, he's being treated like every other American is because as we know in this country, no one is above the law, but its definitely probably frustrating for him. And it's taking a physical toll on him as well I think, too. It is tiring having to sit there for hours on end just for any normal defendant, let alone an elderly defendant.

We know that he did try to have one event, but it was canceled because of weather. But other than that, he's been hosting dinners at his at Trump Tower. He played golf at Bedminster, not on the campaign trail despite saying that this trial was keeping him off the campaign trail. So, tomorrow is going to be in both Wisconsin and Michigan. These are obviously two states that they believe are absolutely really critical to his pathway back to the White House. They are states that he won in 2016, almost shockingly, but then lost in 2020.

And I think the thing that he's going to have to worry about him and his team is not his base in this trial, and the court of public opinion, it's going to be particularly independence and women, because I think when you look at this trial, the optics of it aren't great.I mean, this was an affair he had with a porn star shortly after his wife gave birth to their child. And so, for women who might be on the fence about Donald Trump because they're unsure about his character. This is just another reminder of the kind of man that he is. And so this is something that they might have to deal with, with this trial, but also who knows, its certainly could not have an impact at all when you look at 2016.

The mayor was talking about the several individuals who stormed the building here, the Hamilton building here at Columbia, that has changed everything. And it appears that the NYPD now has information which is concerning to them. And so look at what they have done here, Wolf. We have not seen anything like this. Broadway, you are familiar, Wolf, with here -- this area in Morningside Heights. There's no traffic here. They have shut down this entire area. They have moved in more police officers. They are using these metal barriers to sort of keep the street clothes. But certainly, Wolf, there was a lot of concern here.
