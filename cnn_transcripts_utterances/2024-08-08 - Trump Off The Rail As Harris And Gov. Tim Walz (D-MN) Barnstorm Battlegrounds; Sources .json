Donald Trump comes out swinging at Kamala Harris and Tim Walz during a Mar-a-Lago news conference as he tries to blunt the momentum of the new Democratic ticket. The former president leveling new attacks at his opponents and ranting about crowd sizes as he took questions from the news media.Plus, new details about the alleged terror plot against Taylor Swift, the concerts in Austria. Authorities now say all three suspects are teenagers and that the mastermind of the foiled scheme planned to kill himself and a large number of people during the attack. And here in the Middle East, anxiety is clearly building as Israel braces for potential attacks from Hezbollah. Sources tell me a strike could come within days, keyword days. This, as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu holds an urgent meeting with his security cabinet. Welcome to our viewers in the United States and around the world. I'm Wolf Blitzer in Tel Aviv, Israel, and you're in The Situation Room. We begin tonight with the latest in the race for the White House, Donald Trump scrambling to reclaim the spotlight as Kamala Harris and her new running mate, Tim Walz, take their battleground state tour through the Midwest and beyond. CNN's Kristen Holmes is joining us now live from just outside the former president's Mar-a-Lago estate down in Florida. Kristen, what is Trump saying?",

A lot of it was attacking Kamala Harris, trying out new lines on her, saying that she was barely competent, saying that she was not smart in any way, saying at some points that she was worse than President Joe Biden when it came to policy. There was a lot of ranting, a lot of doubling down on various things, talking about immigration, talking about the economy, talking about inflation.Now, the one big piece of news that we got out of all of this is the fact that he has agreed to three debates, including that September 10th ABC debate that he had agreed to with President Joe Biden, then reneged on, now he is back doing that. But the big focus for him, and this has been a real line coming out of the campaign now for the last several days, was that Kamala Harris has not taken a question from media, has not done a press conference. Listen to just some of what he had to say. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP (R), FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT, 2024 PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: She hasn't done an interview. She can't do an interview. She's barely competent. She's not doing any news conference. You know why she's not doing it? Because she can't do a news conference, she doesn't know how to do a news conference. She's not smart enough to do a news conference. I haven't recalibrated strategy at all. It's the same policies, open borders, weak on crime. I think she's worse than Biden. I'm very happy to run against her. I'm not complaining from that standpoint. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And my dad served in the United States Army. So, I take this very personally. The measure should not be about whether or not you fought and you were in combat. The point is, did you put on the uniform of the United States of America? Tim Walz did for 24 years, and it is a way -- we know this game from Chris LaCivitas. And let me just tell you, if this is the way they want to distract from the fact that Donald Trump used his wealth and his privilege to be able to actually skirt his responsibilities to our country and not wear the uniform of our country, fine, let's have that conversation.

I mean, it was just absurd.And, you know, I think it underscores a point that we haven't focused on as much on now that Joe Biden's out of the race, perhaps we will, and that is just the absurdity and the non-sequiturs and the misinformation and the disinformation that we're hearing from Trump. Sure, he stood there for an hour and took questions. But when you're not wedded to the truth, it's pretty easy to do so.

She's saying, hey, I did these four years as vice president, promote the president. But let's look at what she's done the last four years.You know, inflation has literally bankrupted the middle class. It's bankrupted the working class. You know, you have illegal immigration, 15 million people coming across the border. You know, there's a broken system on our border. And you have two wars and a third one about to start. That's what this election is going to be about. It's not going to be a crowd sized January 6th or Martin Luther King's. It's going to be about the issues that have impacted the middle class and the working class.

He's a key member of the House Armed Services Committee. Congressman, I know you're being briefed on all these very disturbing developments. What are your concerns around how an attack by Hezbollah, potentially an attack on Israel, would unfold? And if Israeli civilians are caught in the crossfire, do you fear these months of escalating tensions could cross the point of no return into some sort of full scale war? REP. SETH MOULTON (D-MA): Yes, that's exactly my fear, Wolf. And let's be clear, Hezbollah has no intention of thousands and thousands of rockets, so many that they could easily overwhelm Israel's defense systems and result in a lot more civilian casualties and ultimately a much wider war in the Middle East. While we're watching exactly what Hezbollah and Iran might do here and contemplating exactly how Israel might respond, I think we also have to be clear eyed about our own national security interests. One, we want to stand by our allies and stand by our troops in the region. Israel remains our staunchest democratic ally in the Middle East. But, two, we do not want to get bogged down in another Middle Eastern war. That would take our eye off the ball, take our eye off the most serious national security threat to the United States today, which is China on the other side of the globe, and also ultimately risk American lives.

But what is not debatable is that Trump would be far worse for our foreign policy all around the world, far worse for preventing a wider war in the Middle East. He would ultimately continue to politicize this war over Gaza and I think pushes further away from a political solution, from a political settlement that ultimately would end the fighting.That's one thing we learned in Iraq and Afghanistan is you can't kill your way out of an insurgency like this. That's something that the IDF is pressuring their prime minister, Prime Minister Netanyahu, to do is come up with a political solution here. But that's not what Trump is talking about. That's not what Trump wants. And so, if you are concerned about this war, you don't want Trump to be the next president. If you're a staunch ally of Israel and you want to see Israel win this war and defeat Hamas, then you need to have a political endgame. Trump's not about that either.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SALMA ABDELAZIZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice over): Chilling new details are emerging about the terror plot on a Taylor Swift concert in Vienna. Three Austrian teenagers, aged 19, 17 and 15, now detained and facing questions. The head of Austria's domestic intelligence service telling CNN, one of the radicalized teenagers had obtained a job working at the venue he planned to attack just days prior to his arrest.

Investigators considering the possibility that the suspects planned to run over fans gathered outside the stadium with a vehicle and had even obtained a blue light, similar to what police attach to their cars, to force their way through the crowd. Then they plan to attack innocents with knives and machetes, and in a final stage, detonate explosives at the site.The 19-year-old suspect, who lived in this home an hour outside of Vienna, is the alleged mastermind. Authorities say he has confessed to the terror plot. Items found inside his home included chemical explosives, detonators, ISIS propaganda, 21,000 euros in counterfeit cash, machetes and knives. All three suspects were radicalized online by ISIS recruiters. HAIJAWI-PIRCHNER: It's very worrying. We can see that in Austria we have very young guys that are radicalized due to the fact that they are using the online propaganda that is brought out from ISIS and also ISKB.",

DONELL HARVIN, FORMER D.C. CHIEF OF HOMELAND SECURITY AND INTELLIGENCE: Well, their age doesn't really stand out. We've seen this as a trend with ISIS and other Jihadi groups over the last decade. In fact, we've lost -- you know, over 250 U.S. citizens fled to the so-called caliphacy. Many of them were teenagers. What does stand out is how operational they were.

You can see the officer looking toward the roof. And then here's that moment where this officer gets a boost up to that AGR building roof.

Wolf, that moment where he hoist himself up on the roof that you just saw.
