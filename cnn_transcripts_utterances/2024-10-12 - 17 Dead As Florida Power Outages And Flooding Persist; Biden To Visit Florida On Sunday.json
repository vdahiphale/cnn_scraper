I think in having this discussion, we need to be mindful that there was an agreement back in 2021, three years ago, and in that agreement, they of course, Boeing, agreed to certain conduct and to avoid fraud.It was what we call a deferred prosecution agreement, in English, that means we're going to prosecute you, but I'll tell you what? If you engage in good behavior over a period of three years, there will be nothing to see here, we'll dismiss it. However, here we go again. And so, I think to the extent that there might be liability moving forward, it's going to depend upon whether Boeing and their executives are good actors, they comply with whatever the plea agreement ultimately is, right? To the extent that this has engaged in or it's modified in any way. And so, we'll see, that's a fact that that's not yet determined. We have to examine their conduct and see whether or not they're in full compliance with whatever order is ultimately decided upon.",

It has to do as Joey was saying with the conduct of the people involved.And I think that's where Boeing has to look forward, to make sure that they have the right people in the right places that are going to be honest, forthright and transparent about everything that they do. And I think they've made some great strides in moving in that direction, but it couldn't take a generation for that to occur to make that really sink into what kind of a company they're going to be moving forward. That's not an easy task, and I think maybe, they have the right person in charge now with their new CEO to do that.",

Now, when you walk into a brick and mortar pharmacy, you expect that the medication behind the counter is from a reputable pharmaceutical company.But what the DEA says is that they're concerned about this rise in fake online pharmacies that are selling illicit products that have killed multiple people. Now, let's look at some of the warning signs. They say that if you buy online and the store doesn't require a doctor's prescription, that is a red flag. Also be on the lookout for medication that is extremely cheap, cut rate prices that seem too good to be true. They say that if you receive a pill and the packaging is damaged or the pill itself is damaged, that is an issue that you should be concerned about. And finally, if you receive a bottle of prescription medication that has no expiration date, that is a big red flag. Now, here are some of the websites the DEA says that they have indicated are indeed fraudulent. You'll see these are generic names for example, pharmacy stores online, care online store. But when you go to these websites now, here's what you'll see, a notice from the Justice Department that these websites have been seized. But authorities say there are still so many more that are out there, they want the public to be on alert. Now, people are wondering, why would a drug dealer sell you something like a fentanyl-laced pill that could ultimately kill you, their customer? I recently spoke to an LAPD detective who said that at the end of the day, these drug dealers don't care about the customer, it's all about making money. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

So, the rivers will still continue to respond, even going into next week, some of them still rising, and they're slowly receding. And you can see what the rivers have done here.All of this flooding, not from storm surge, it is from the incredible heavy rain that we got, and again, the river is just responding to it. I mean, look at this swath of 10 to 20 inches of rain from Tampa, St. Pete, all the way up through Orlando and then over towards the east coast as well. All of this on the north side of Milton. It kind of got squeezed with a front, and that pushed even heavier rain. So, these again are the river levels. You could see a lot of them still at moderate and major flood stage, not just on the west coast where Milton made landfall, but also on the east coast because the watershed again needs to find somewhere to put 20 inches of rain. So, we still have rivers that are going to be slow to fall on the west coast. You can see not really fallen going into Monday, so, still a problem through the weekend. And then rivers again on the east coast continuing to rise. You can see the rivers here getting above   major flood stage and still rising even through Wednesday of next week. So, that will continue to be a problem. There's some light showers on radar for parts of south Florida. We'll have some spotty showers as we go through the day today. Again, a lot of it pretty light, and a lot of it focused on the Miami Fort Lauderdale area. We're looking at maybe an inch or 2 of accumulation and not for the bigger storm zone. So, that's at least, some good news for them there. Another thing that has been incredible to watch come through are these tornado surveys, we had three EF-3 tornadoes from Milton, one that was long track, 21 miles on the ground, that is rare, period, let alone rare in a hurricane.
