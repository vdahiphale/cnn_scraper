And she's been chastised by them for, in essence, making decisions which are completely against the law, completely against pending -- pending precedent.

This is one of the reasons why she will not rule on anything because she knows this could happen. That's the one intelligent thing that she's doing right now.

And it does seem like RFK Jr might be becoming a little less popular. So these are views of RFK. And take a look here. The favorite rating, in November of 2023, 31 percent. Look at the favorable rating now, 25 percent according to Quinnipiac University. How about the unfavorable rating? That has gone up 36 percent in November of 2023. And now what we're looking at is a 43 percent unfavorable rating. So this net favorability rating is now at -18 points. It was just at five points. That's an interesting looking five. It's now -18. So it does seem that RFK Jr is becoming less popular. But who is he becoming less popular among? And who does he seem like he's hurting most in the presidential race? Joe Biden and the Democrats, or Donald Trump and the Republicans? It's actually Republicans who seem to be more on the RFK Jr bandwagon. In fact, if you were to look at the last Quinnipiac University poll, what you saw was that RFK Jr was, if you were looking at that pool, you would see that by 14 points, they preferred Donald Trump to Joe Biden. And that's why this slide is so important. What you see here is a GOP views of RFK Jr back in November of 2023, 41 percent favorable rating. Now, just 31, the unfavorable rating goes from 22 to 30. It seems like Donald Trump's attacks on RFK Jr are working.",

Things like AI systems impersonating real people, creating misinformation.As well as more speculative concerns like artificial general intelligence. These systems that could one day become as smart as if not smarter than humans. These employees say they don't believe that major AI firms can be trusted to voluntarily share information about these -- these risks. And they want to ensure that, in the absence of regulation because there's still are so few guardrails for these companies, that employees are free to speak up when they have safety concerns and bring those not only to the companies, but also to regulators and to the public. I want to read to you, a line from this letter that I think really gets at the heart of the concerns here. These employees say, \"Ordinary whistleblower protections are insufficient because they focus on illegal activity. Whereas many of the risks we are concerned about are not yet regulated.\" So they're asking for a series of commitments from these companies. They're asking for things like the companies not to enforce non- disparagement agreements. They also want the ability to make anonymous complaints to board members and regulators. And look, we should say, too, that OpenAI has in some ways kind of agreed with the fact that there is a need for this public debate over safety. A spokesperson told us yesterday, in response to this letter, that, \"the company is proud of its track record providing the most capable and safest AI systems and believe in our scientific approach to addressing risk. \"We agree that rigorous debate is crucial given the significance of this technology and will continue to gage with governments, civil society, and other communities around the world.\" But look, I mean, we'll have to wait and see if the company does indeed agree to some of these demands in this letter. But I want to point out this is still a voluntary commitment. There's still a need for regulation in this AI space.",

No amount of spin or scare tactics will change that. Let's hope it doesn't come too late. WEIR (voice-over): While the head of the United Nations has been railing against polluters and petrol states for years, he is using this report to plead with world leaders to cut dirty fuels faster than ever.

If you do smoke, these are the consequences. We need to get, I think, more savvy to do that around greenhouse gas emissions, as well.
