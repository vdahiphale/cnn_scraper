Welcome to the program, everyone. I'm Christiane Amanpour in Paris where the Olympic Flame is making its way through this city of light before tomorrow's opening ceremony. A hundred years since they held their last summer games, that was 1924. Athletes from 206 Olympic national teams are descending on the French capital as the world tries to unite around the Olympic ideals of excellence, respect, and friendship. These games will see the return of superstar champions, like the British diving prodigy, Tom Daley, the Jamaican sprinter, Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce, and of course, the American gymnast, Simone Biles. It'll be an Olympiad like no other with new sports such as breaking, also known as break dancing. And for the first time ever, there will be gender parity. More than 10,000 male and female athletes competing side by side. My first guest tonight knows these games very well. The British tennis star Andy Murray is the only man to take gold twice in men's singles. We met here earlier this morning ahead of his training for this event. His final professional competition.

But, you know, the mid-1930s are also kind of the end of this era of really visible queerness in a lot of cities in Europe, in the U.S. especially, and, you know, you had in Germany, which was, you know, right next door to Czechoslovakia, you had Magnus Hirschfeld, who was this really prominent sexologist who offered medical care to trans and intersex people in the 1920s and 1930s. And, you know, he helped to bring forward these ideas that, you know, perhaps there is a lot more to understand about the body and about what we call gender today and about transition themselves.

And so, I think the public was quite primed to see -- like -- to like accept the idea that there was more than they generally understood about how, sort of, like, sex worked and how these categories of male and female worked. And what really struck me is that a lot of the coverage of Koubek and Weston, these two athletes who transition gender, is quite empathetic.

And she sort of -- because of a childhood accident had this, like, very deep voice. You also had just like big biceps, she was often sort of noticed for her perceived masculinity. And, she -- basically, in 1936, at the Berlin Olympics, she's one of the top U.S. athletes. She eventually wins the gold medal at the same day as Jesse Owens wins his gold. And there's all this scrutiny, you know, sort of in part because of these -- of Koubek and Weston, these two athletes who transition gender.

And Helen Stephens has always been -- has always sort of dealt with this, but it really comes to a head at the Berlin Olympics.

Again, it's not reallyclear like what were they looking for or which kinds of bodies would be allowed, which wouldn't? That was never outlined in these early years. You know, eventually that ran into a lot of problems. And so, as sex testing grew, sports officials began embracing a chromosome-based test, which essentially would try to sort of delineate athletes by, like, measuring their -- they're testing their chromosomes. The problem was, you know, there are a lot of like athletes who would probably identify as cis women today who have like a multiplicity of chromosomes. They were just sort of quietly expelled from the Olympics in the like '60s and '70s and into the '80s. There's a lot of backlash to this. So, the policy switched over to testing hormone levels. And today, what we have is kind of a grab bag of different policies. So, the IOC, the International Olympic Committee, which makes a lot of these overarching policies, they've actually said that they no longer want to set the terms of eligibility for women athletes, and they released a statement in 2021 that actually talked about wanting to have more inclusion of trans intersex women in sports, but they left it up to the individual federation. So, like, the Track and Field Federation, for example, to sort of govern their own group of sports separately. And what has happened is that, in a lot of cases, these policies have become quite restrictive and have banned, like, nearly -- in many cases, banned nearly all trans women from competing in the Olympics, also have set really hard limits on women who might fit on an intersex spectrum, and even cis women who have high testosterone levels limitations on whether they can play and how they can play, but it really depends now based on sports. So, the current policy is really different depending on what sport you look at, but that same concept of we're going to regulate, like, which kind of women can compete, I think you can sort of draw a direct line between 1936 and today, even as the policies themselves have gotten very different and the things that are being tested has gotten very different.",

Even when you think about these efforts to regulate testosterone levels in women, you know, we don't do the same thing in men's sports. And if the idea is that, you know, testosterone levels confer some kind of unfair athletic advantage, you know, men have the same diversity of testosterone levels as women, so why wouldn't we also limit like men's testosterone levels? It doesn't really make sense to go down that path. That's not even to mention, you know, someone like Michael Phelps, who's born with this really specific genetic condition that gives him like a long wingspan that also happens to be perfect for swimming. You know, or some of these more like invisible types of advantage like class, you know, early on in your sports career, you know, whether you can pay for trainers or to go to some kind of summer camp and work your way up in sports can really influence, you know, whether you can make it to this elite level. And all of this is just to say that, like, I think a great thing about the Olympics is it brings together a lot of different people from a lot of different backgrounds and experiences and people who sort of exist on the spectrum of bodies and experience that we all do and there's some things that we can't regulate and we accept that we can't regulate. And I think, to me, it is quite telling to see the fixation on trans women in sports and intersex women in sports specifically, and also, cis women with high testosterone levels in a way that we don't fixate on any of these other things throughout the history. It strikes me that we've been having the same conversation kind of over and over again, and often erased from all of this is the athletes themselves and just, you know, their humanity. And then, also, just like the immense skill it takes to get to the point where you could maybe go to the Olympics. You know, these are all athletes of, like, unbelievable skill who've put in years and years of their lives into this sport. And so, to me, it's just kind of unthinkable that we would then say, actually, you don't meet this sort of subjective, everchanging definition of woman, and so, therefore, you can't compete.
