A heartbreaking personal message from Catherine, Princess of Wales, announcing she's fighting cancer. It was discovered following her abdominal surgery back in January. The princess is now undergoing chemotherapy. And a mass shooting in Russia. Local media reporting gunmen opened fire at a popular concert venue in Moscow killing at least 40 people. ISIS has now claimed responsibility for the attack. The latest on that in just a moment. But first, to that news from Kensington Palace and from the Princess of Wales herself. Catherine letting the public know in a recorded video message that she's being treated for cancer. The 42-year-old mother of three described being in the early stages of preventative chemotherapy. She didn't say what type of cancer she has only that it was found after she'd had that major abdominal surgery about two months ago. And she also made very clear that the priority has been protecting her three young children as well as addressing her health. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

In January, the princess underwent an unspecified abdominal surgery and was in hospital for two weeks, a frenzy of conspiracy theories emerging on social media, but few guessed the princess could have been dealing with such a serious diagnosis at the age of 42.

And what was really clear from that video message we had from the Princess of Wales was that the timing of this announcement is nothing to do with that awful pressure. The timing of this is all to do with the royal family, and not the Royal Family, the institution, the family of five with three young children who today finished school, ready for their half-term Easter holidays, only to be told this by their parents that their mother has cancer and is undergoing chemotherapy. And of course, this comes just weeks after they found out that their grandfather was also being diagnosed with cancer. So, an incredibly difficult time, a very personal time for the family.

We didn't have that with King Charles. And frankly, what's really interesting is, already, we're getting a lot more information from this royal family than we have in the past.

We've been told, again, major abdominal surgery, but wedon't know what part of the abdomen, what was going on in terms of where the cancer is located to. Your observations about what she described as preventative chemotherapy post a period of healing after the surgery, what does that say to you? DR. DEVILLE:  Yes, it's a challenge. I mean, we could speculate a lot. I mean, if we think about the -- you know, fact that there was a major abdominal surgery that leads us often to think of, you know, what's in that area, gastrointestinal tumors such as the colon, you know, small bowel, large bowel, but also, you know, what's common in women of a younger age might be gynecologic type tumors, which are generally lower in the pelvis, but may, you know, require abdominal surgery or an abdominal approach and still be considered in sort of an abdominal surgery. So, we really don't know too much in terms of the tumor type or that not much is sort of revealed from that perspective. If we think about the need for chemotherapy afterwards as a preventative or what we would call adjuvant chemotherapy are sometimes, you know, in discussions with patients, we talk about it as sort of an insurance policy. It's this idea that, you know, all the cancer has been removed, the visible cancer has been removed, the imaging studies, the follow-up scans show that there is no visible signs of cancer. But for -- in the analysis of the tumor and in different tests that we can do, we may be concerned that there's still a high risk for having some residual cancer cells left in the body. And there have been, you know, again, across many different tumor types, there's lots of evidence that additional treatments like chemotherapy or radiation therapy, immunotherapies, hormonal therapies even, that those may help to eliminate any residual cancer cells and therefore, improve the survival and the longevity. And so, you know, there are some particular tumor types that may, you know, portend to that, such as colon cancer that I mentioned before, or some of the gynecologic tumors. But, you know, we didn't get more details around that to sort of know. The other thing I'll say is, you know, these chemotherapies, these sort of preventive -- in this preventative state, there may be a variety of types of chemotherapy that can be given as an IV, an intravenous infusion, or they may be just an oral, you know, a pill or an oral medication that the patient can take as sort of completely outpatient and not have to come into a center. They can also be for a very prolonged course. And so, they may be, you know, just three months, six months, or much longer, depending on the aggressiveness or the concern of the aggressiveness of the tumor.",

      "sentences": "Yes, and it's not just about the fear for your own health, which is perhaps bad enough, but again, as she illustrated, the fear ofwhat it means for her family and the people around her, too. I think one observation on this, Dr. Curtiland, is that she is so, sort of, powerful and has such a strong voice that if she did indeed decide, hopefully when she's through this, perhaps to come forward and say, look, these were my symptoms, perhaps I was caught off guard, whatever it is, it could be an incredible push for others out there to go and get symptoms that they may be ignoring or not even realize the symptoms checked. DR. DEVILLE:  Yes, it's very important. That's why, you know, certainly I do encourage patients, again, when they're comfortable, when they've reached those points that, you know, if they want to share their stories or their testimony, it can be so powerful, you know, talking about -- our outcomes are always best when we have early detection, you know, early screening diagnosis. And so, reporting those symptoms, doing screening tests, and as a young a young person at diagnosis, you know, may have not come up through an actual screening test, it may have been actual symptoms that the individual is experiencing and had, you know, a workup for, and, you know, hopefully what it seems was picked up in an early state, and therefore, they can have that best prognosis. But that's why it is ultimately important to be able to talk about it. I'll also say for the perspective of family history, which you were sort of mentioning before, we know in this sort of modern era of personalized medicine, as we're understanding the genes of the tumor, the genes of the individual, all of these things are important in understanding our risks and risk factors for certain cancers. And so, it is important for us to understand our family history and certainly amongst -- share it with our family members so that, you know, our siblings, our children, they can also be -- have an awareness and be tested and be followed for certain things that they may be at risk for as well.",

Firing automatic weapons, dressed in camouflage fatigues, several explosions can be heard as well.

But I mean, the truth is, is that Russia is looking more unstable now than it has for many years. You know, Putin is facing, you know, assaults on multiple fronts. He's got the war in Ukraine, of course, in which potentially hundreds of thousands of people, according to western estimates, are casualties in that confrontation.

And that's such an important message. And I just -- you know, it's just that it was a huge shock for her. Obviously, huge abdominal surgery. Then cancer found after that. I mean, and surgery followed by chemotherapy, it's just -- you know, it's so tough on the body. And I think really people are shocked now across the world that, you know, she is the picture of health. She's so young and it is really shocking news and reminds us that cancer can touch us at any stage of our life and it can touch anyone.",

But to your point as well, at the end, even making this about others that are suffering too and less about her, quite frankly. It was a -- well, it was a princess-like moment. For me, it was a sort of coming of age in the royal family and her status moment as much as anything else.",

It wasn't astatement put out by Kensington Palace saying, the princess has cancer and we will update you surely. This was Kate speaking to us by video call. And you know what it made me think of? It made me think of how the queen was such an effective user of TV throughout her reign, the eve of Diana's funeral, the COVID speech, when she said, we will meet again, reminding us in those dark days of COVID would be out of there sometime. And this, I think, is -- you know, unprecedented in terms of its openness as a royal family member saying, I have cancer. I'm having chemotherapy, very open. And also, in the way she addressed us directly by video call. And I think we are seeing -- you know this is uncharted waters. This is huge changes from the royal family in terms of the openness and the use of a direct video call in the way that normally we associate that only with the monarch in key constitutional moments.",

At least 40 people have been killed after gunmen opened fire on the crowds. State media says, children are among the victims. Oren Liebermann is standing by. Oren, this attack comes at a time where we had a warning from the U.S. embassy in Moscow on March the 7th, warning Americans to avoid large gatherings for a period of 48 hours. There's also, in light of the taking of responsibility by ISIS, of suggestion that the United States had also warned Russia about the potential of attacks by ISIS-K that had been a steady stream of information, I believe, since back in November. What more do you know? And are these two things tied from what you understand?",

He said this last weekto the FSB, in fact, or earlier this week, dismissing outright the U.S. warnings. Calling them provocative, essentially, saying the U.S. was trying to create instability. So, at least on the outside, from the public facing persona of Russian President Vladimir Putin, he dismissed the U.S. warnings here. Now, whether somebody below him or beneath him or whether he took it seriously behind closed doors here, that's a question that is much more difficult to answer.",

Oren Liebermann, thank you for that report.Joining us now is Brett Bruen, who was a National Security Council official in the Obama administration. Brett, good to have you with us. I think we should always be careful about jumping to conclusions in any event, but always where Russia is concerned. What is your early observations about what we've seen from Russia Friday evening and, of course, the claiming of responsibility by ISIS? BRETT BRUEN, FORMER U.S. NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL OFFICIAL:  Well, a couple fold, Julia. One I would say that this is obviously based on just what Oren was reporting. Very concerning situation from a security standpoint. It means that Putin is going to have to focus more resources domestically, even as he tries to gain ground in Ukraine. But it also doesn't mean, Julia, that he won't try to spin this to his favor to try to justify both what he's doing in Ukraine, but potentially with other crackdowns as well, domestically and in other places across what is known as Russia's near abroad, some of those countries bordering it in Central Asia and Europe. So, I think American officials, other Europeans will keep a close eye on Putin's next move.",

But also, more recently, March the 7th, a specific 48-hour warning about potential locations such as a concert. Interesting that President Putin himself was so skeptical in response to the warning from the United States.

And we didn't take action at the time, informing Americans, but we did with official Americans. So, this March 7th warning was because U.S. officials had information -- specific information that they were warning U.S. officials to avoid those kinds of venues in Moscow. They needed to tell Americans, and that's why they issued a warning, despite obviously the reception -- chilling reception it got from Putin.",

British opposition leader Keir Starmer is sending his best wishes to the Princess, commenting that public speculation in recent weeks must have added to the stress of her diagnosis.
