So it's going to be even more difficult for emergency crews to get to this province, Enga Province, which is in the north of the country. It's about 600 kilometers from the capital Port Moresby. And it's happened at this isolated and rather remote village, Kaokalam Village.And the reports that we are getting is that this landslide occurred at three o'clock this morning as people were fast asleep. And you can see from the video and the pictures that have been released, it's like a side of the hill has just come away. It's just slipped. And we are hearing that it has completely flattened a village. So they're saying more than 100 dead. It could be even more, you know, people obviously desperately trying to recover the bodies. There are reports that some people were found alive. But there is an enormous, enormous task ahead when you look at the amount of earth and rock and rubble that they will have to dig up to find the other people from this community. But as I said, we are hearing that the access road into this village has been cut off, that the main highway has been cut off, making it very difficult for emergency crews to reach this area. We heard from a Red Cross official in Port Moresby a short time ago who says that there were earthquakes in the area a couple of days ago, that this is the highlands. It is hilly, but it's not as mountainous as other areas that experience landslides all the time. Let's have a listen to what this Red Cross official had to say. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

So let's start there, Ben, with the U.S. efforts to revive the talks. What more can you tell us? BEN WEDEMAN, CNN SR. INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, as we know, David William Burns, the head of the CIA, is going to Europe, presumably Paris, where he will be meeting with Qatari, Egyptian, Israeli and French officials to try to get the hostage talks back on track. You'll recall that earlier this month, the beginning of the month, they basically collapsed when it appears that the Egyptians gave different versions of agreements to Hamas and Israel. There was confusion and suddenly they stopped. So here we are on day 231 of this war. These, basically, the last time any hostages were released was in late November last year, when for eight days the fighting ceased and hostages were released. And Palestinian detainees and prisoners were also freed. But since then, these talks have been going back and forth, and the death toll rises. It's almost 36,000 at this point, and it's worth mentioning yet again, after 231 days, the international media is not allowed into Gaza, either by Israel or by Egypt. Kim.",

It's important to keep in mind there are seven land crossings from Israel and Egypt into Gaza, and it is so much cheaper and easier to actually send aid through there. But the United States and others have decided to go for this peer option. There are also airdrops going on into Gaza, but they simply aren't enough. There are more than 2 million people in Gaza, the vast majority who have been displaced multiple times. And as the fighting in Rafah goes on, keep in mind, of course, Rafah was the main crossing for humanitarian goods into Gaza, but because of the fighting there, very little is getting into Gaza at all at the moment, and therefore the already dire situation is only getting worse.

So let's start there with what we just heard. One of the main criticisms, of course, is this idea of equivalence, that the leaders of Hamas are being treated the same as the Israeli leaders did. Is that accusation justified?DANIEL LEVY, PRESIDENT, U.S./MIDDLE EAST PROJECT: I do not think it is. I think this is painfully simple, which is that international law is applied without distinction. Everyone is bound by international law. So this isn't about equivalence. It is about saying that a Palestinian people under belligerent permanent occupation has the right to resist, but that resistance must be conducted within the framework of international law. And the Israeli state has the right and indeed the duty to defend its citizens, to provide them with security. But that has to be conducted within the framework of international law. What Hamas did on October 7th apparently violated international law. It is therefore culpable in its leadership, in those who conducted and ordered this, to prosecution. What Israel has done subsequently, using starvation as a weapon of war in how it has conducted itself in Gaza, is also culpable under international law. The ICC was also previously considering the crimes committed before October 6th under Israel's illegal occupation. So there's not an equivalence, not between a regional military nuclear armed power and an occupied people denied their rights and freedoms. This isn't about equivalence. It's about law. And I think the U.S. has a problem if its president does not understand that the law, whether internationally or nationally, has to be applied equally. Because one of the things also I understand he and his Democrat party are running on is that his opponent is a threat to the rule of law and democracy. But does the president himself understand what those things are, if he makes these accusations?",

Let's be frank about this. And that's the question you're saying they're going to they're issuing threats against the ICC. The idea that you can intimidate people into doing the wrong thing, into violating their own charters, is a terrible thing for the U.S. to be doing at a time where international law and international institutions are fragile, at a time when U.S. standing internationally needs that floating global south-global majority vote. You're undermining yourself at a time of the Ukraine-Russia crisis. You stand up for one thing in one instance, you undermine, cut it off at the knees in another. And you're encouraging Israel to do the very things that will not bring Israel security. Of course, these are devastating to the Palestinians, the images we see every day from Gaza.

The entirety of at least the Zionist political spectrum has jumped to the defense of the Prime Minister, as if the problem is the consequences, as if the problem is being caught, not the act you are committing and being caught for.That's unfortunately a deep moral failing that needs to be discussed. Part of it is what you pointed out, what the Prime Minister is saying, because I think the cognitive map in people's heads is, well, this is easy, we know, this is anti-Semitism, this is the world is against us, and it's a terrible direction to go in for many reasons. But one of them is, when you trivialize the accusation of anti-Semitism, when it becomes meaningless, if everything is anti-Semitic, then nothing is, then you actually undermine the struggle, the very real struggle, to secure Jewish communities, other minorities. It makes it harder to create a broad anti-racist coalition at a time when intolerance is on the rise. So this conflation, this misplaced accusation of anti-Semitism, I would argue is bad news for Jewish communities, in addition to all the bad things happening in the Middle East right now.",

Regional officials say seven people were killed and at least 23 others wounded in attacks on Kharkiv on Thursday. The targets included a major printing company that publishes newspapers and about a third of the books released in Ukraine.President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says his country still lacks enough air defenses to fight back, and he's urging some Western allies to allow Ukraine to use weapons provided by them to strike across the Russian border to defend itself. Kharkiv came under fire as Russia is trying to push ahead with its new cross-border offensive north of the city. So as his troops attack Ukraine, Russian President Vladimir Putin is propping up his relationship with the country that helped his invasion. He arrived in Belarus on Thursday for talks with his counterpart, Alexander Lukashenko. The Kremlin says the discussions will include their strategic partnership and alliance. Belarus allowed Moscow to use its territory as a launchpad to invade Ukraine in 2022. And last year, Russia transferred some of its non-strategic nuclear weapons to Belarus. Russian President Vladimir Putin is hell-bent on rooting out Western influences in Russia, but one well-known U.S. TV personality is getting a lot of airtime on Russia's state television. Conservative pundit Tucker Carlson has become a familiar face on political programs. As Matthew Chance reports, it may have something to do with his political views. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MATTHEW CHANCE, CNN CHIEF GLOBAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): On Russian state TV, Tucker Carlson's face is hard to escape. That loud American journalist, they call him, whose conservative Republican views clearly strike a chord with the Kremlin. For months now, Carlson's online show has been airing on local Russian media, which is a sure sign the Kremlin, which has silenced critical voices, sees propaganda value in what it has to say. Most recently, a segment on the dangers of U.S. biological weapons development with an American science and technology writer was aired in full. Carlson tells CNN he was unaware the clips were being shown. But for months now, the Kremlin has been casting Tucker Carlson, who lost his job on Fox News last year, as a truth-speaking American media star. Even granted him a rare, very long interview with Vladimir Putin, screened at cinemas across the country to dutiful Russians. I watched this movie out of big respect to our president, said this theater goer. I've seen it twice, says another. It's great to hear the opinion of our great leader, she adds. Tucker Carlson isn't the only outspoken American celebrated by Moscow. He's also praised on Kremlin TV. As is Republican Senator Mike Lee, both staunchly opposed to U.S. military aid to Ukraine, a position of course shared by the Kremlin. If the war in Ukraine drags on, there are concerns. Kremlin propaganda, anti-Ukraine, pro-Russia, is increasingly finding its way into the U.S. political debate. Even being uttered, one Republican congressman told CNN recently, on the House floor. And Moscow's interest lies in bolstering those who it feels share, at least in part, its skeptical, sometimes distorted worldview. Matthew Chance, CNN, London. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

The state governor says that the local authorities had checked on the stage and he assures everybody that the local protocols were followed so it had been safe to continue with this event that happens about 10 days before Mexico goes to elect the next president on the June 2nd elections. The other two candidates offer their sympathies to the victims. One of them, Claudia Sheinbaum, had an event in that same city, not far away from where the incident took place, and she canceled the event in solidarity. Gustavo Valdez, CNN, Atlanta.

The world number one shooting a two over par and finishing the day tied for 79th on the leaderboard.Earlier, police in Louisville, Kentucky released two videos showing some of the arrest of Scheffler last week. Scheffler was detained after trying to drive around police at the scene of a fatal accident outside of the PGA Championship. CNN's Gabe Cohen reports from Louisville. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) GABE COHEN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, Louisville police released new video of Scottie Scheffler's arrest on Thursday, including an angle from a nearby traffic pole camera. It does not show the initial incident in which Scottie Scheffler allegedly disobeyed that police officer's orders and then dragged him with his car. But it does show just seconds later as the officer is chasing down Scottie Scheffler's vehicle. He appears to strike the car with some sort of object, and then he converses with Scheffler through the driver's side window before other officers arrive at the car. They get Scheffler out and they take him into custody. The city has said they don't have any video of that initial incident, and that's because the officer's body camera was not turned on, something that the police chief has said is a violation of the department's policy. And as a result, that officer has received counseling from a supervisor. Now, on Thursday, Louisville's mayor and police chief held a press briefing. They did not take any questions from the media, and they didn't address the charges that Scottie Scheffler is still facing. He faces four charges, by far the most serious of which is that second degree assault on a police officer charge. It is a felony. And a source tells me that behind closed doors, at least some of the top brass within the police department have voiced some concerns that that felony charge may be excessive. So we thought that might be addressed at the press conference, but it was not. Scottie Scheffler's attorney, though, spoke to me just afterward, saying that the videos that were released lineup with their version of events, that this was all a big misunderstanding. STEVE ROMINES, SCOTTIE SCHEFFLER'S ATTORNEY: Our position is the same as it was last Friday. Scottie Scheffler didn't do anything wrong. We're prepared to litigate the case as long and as aggressively as necessary. And we're not interested in settling the case. It'll either be dismissed or we'll go to trial.",
