The Biden administration expected to unveil new evidence of a Russian state media network's key role in the Kremlin's global intelligence and influence operations. CNN national security correspondent Kylie Atwood is joining us from the state Department right now. What are you learning, Kylie?KYLIE ATWOOD, CNN U.S. SECURITY CORRESPONDENT: Well, listen, what we've learned, Wolf, is today the Biden administration, as you said, is going to reveal RT, that Russian state media network as playing a critical role, a key role in Russia's intelligence gathering and operations globally around the world. This is according to a senior administration official and multiple sources familiar with the matter. What the State Department is going to do is they are going to declassify U.S. intelligence based on RT activities globally that make this case that RT is fully integrated into Russia's intelligence operations around the world. They're also going to do something else. They're going to launch a global diplomatic campaign so that U.S. diplomats are informing their counterparts in other countries of the risks associated with RT. We're expected to learn some very new details about what exactly Russian intelligence has been doing with RT. For example, embedding a Russian cyber unit into RT at one time, that's according to multiple sources familiar with the matter. And we should note that this builds off of the Biden administration's focus on Russian intelligence gathering, Russian disinformation globally. Just last week, we saw the Biden administration, the Department of Justice, go after what RT is doing here in the United States to try and undermine, to try and influence the 2024 presidential elections. And what they're going to do today is make the case that this isn't just happening here in the United States, but this is a problem around the world. And I think it's important to note, that this also is just weeks before the U.N. General assembly. Later this month, we're going to see world leaders at the United Nations. And the senior administration official tells me that they're going to try and use that gathering of world leaders to actually create momentum for going after, for targeting RT and making sure that people who are seeing what they are putting out know that it is tied to Russian intelligence operations.

      "sentences": "Yes, I think if you could describe the next phase of the campaign for Kamala Harris, it would be the grinded out phase. They really want to get her in the battleground states, not only in front of voters at big rallies, but kind of among the voters at these retail stops. And you'll see her do that in Pennsylvania today. And it's interesting. She's traveling to two counties in Pennsylvania that Donald Trump actually won in 2020.And they do make the point that they want to get her among voters, and she's going to look for votes anywhere she possibly can in Pennsylvania. And I think if you're looking for any further sign that Pennsylvania is a linchpin of her strategy, just look at her calendar for the last eight days. She has spent seven of those days all are part of them in Pennsylvania. So this is a very critical state. We're going to see her first in Johnstown. She's going to be visiting a local business with John Fetterman, the Pennsylvania senator. That's kind of where they want her. They want her talking to people. They think that puts her in a good light, puts her sort of among the people she needs to be talking to. Then it's onward to a big rally in Wilkes- Barre, sort of the, kind of the traditional big rallies that we've been seeing her doing. So I think this is a very important moment for her. Last night, we did find out that the campaign raised $47 million in the -- in the 24 hours after that debate. That was from 600,000 individual donors. But with the big fundraising, with the momentum, obviously also comes the concerns among the campaign about overconfidence, and they are very much trying to guard against that. They say they're still the underdogs in this race.",

Certainly the polls in Pennsylvania show a very close race. But yesterday it was interesting. She was in North Carolina. That's a state that Democrats had more or less written off when Joe Biden was the nominee. Now they believe it is still very much competitive for them. And so in addition to the so called blue wall, you are going to start to see Kamala Harris really try and focus on these multiple pathways to get to 270.",

The almost comical focus on the debate and what the debate supposedly did or did not do is not really holding up in most of the polling that I'm seeing here in Wisconsin. Secondly, how ironic that -- that -- that Vice President Harris should be talking about Donald Trump answering questions when she's done virtually no interviews for weeks on end. Two months she's gone with almost no interviews whatsoever. And suddenly she's the authority on Donald Trump answering questions. It literally comical.",

But the truth of the matter is whether Donald Trump debates or not isn't really the question. The question at hand here, and you see it in the CNN polling as well, is the Democrats are upside down on inflation, on the economy, on the border, on violent crime. The problem for Kamala Harris is she can't afford to answer those questions because if the Harris campaign is tied to the last four years of Joe Biden, she will lose the election and the Democrats know it.",

But look, Donald Trump's out there. I mean, kind of one of the interesting things about this, Wolf, is here's Donald Trump, pretty well known commodity. Let's face it. I think that's something that Democrats and Republicans can agree on, that people know who Donald Trump are -- the -- pro -- pro -- Donald Trump is.The problem in this election is we don't, Kamala Harris doesn't want us to know who she is. If you take her by the record, not only her record as vice president, but in the United States Senate as the most liberal person to the left of Bernie Sanders in the U.S. Senate, she wants to run away from all that. So she has to concentrate all the fire on Donald Trump. So, you know, as I say, it's -- in -- in a sense, it's a race between two incumbencies, the four years of Donald Trump and the almost four years of Harris and -- and Joe Biden. When you stack it up that way, Kamala Harris loses.",

I think sometimes all the political folks who watch all this stuff are so close to it that they forget what the voters are really thinking about. They're thinking -- I think it was Ron Klain, knowledgeable guy, Joe Biden's first chief of staff said, look, the problem with gas prices like that, or it's the only thing you buy that you're reminded of several times a day. Well, that's the situation with grocery store prices as well. People are reminded once or twice a week how prices and inflation are out of control of the last four years, over 20 percent cumulative.

President Biden has been facing increasing bipartisan pressure to try to loosen the restrictions and is signaling a new openness. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, is delivering a rather chilling warning just ahead of today's meeting. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) VLADIMIR PUTIN, RUSSIAN PRESIDENT (through translator): This is their direct involvement.

He had it sort of tucked under his arm. We also know he missed several days of school, maybe nine days before the shooting happened. He excused himself, went to the bathroom, and when he went to the bathroom, he came back with that gun exposed. This matches up with all the people who've talked to us so far about him being at the door, trying to get back into that classroom with that gun exposed before he started shooting.We've also figured out from the GBI that he had a knife with him as well. And we don't believe that knife was used in the attack at all because he used that gun to start firing over and over. This has been devastating for this community.
