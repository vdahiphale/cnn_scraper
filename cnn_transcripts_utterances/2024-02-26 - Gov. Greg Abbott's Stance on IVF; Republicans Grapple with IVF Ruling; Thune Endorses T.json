And enforcement is where the people are really seeing what it means to live in a world in which these laws have changed women have seen it in this first year. Now, IVF clinics, et cetera, the doctors who administer that. And IVF isn't really covered by insurance the way many people would like. A lot of the people who get it do have the means to get it, which means you're antagonizing a world of voters who are many women, many wealthy, many vote.

The NRSC, the National Republican Senatorial Committee, is trying to advise Republicans on how to talk about this. And they've got a couple of bullet points that I think we can put up on the screen there. One, they say that candidates should express support for IVF. Two, they should oppose restrictions on IVF. And, three, they should campaign on increasing access to IVF. And, again, this all only exists because Roe versus Wade was overturned. What did you make - what was your assessment of how Abbott answered that question, and what do you think Republicans need to be doing? MATT GORMAN, FORMER COMMUNICATIONS ADVISOR TO SEN. TIM SCOTT'S PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN: A couple things on that. Number one, when I saw that memo sitting from -- at - at a party committee like that, I recognize how big of a deal issuing that memo is, and doing it openly. We would do those on occasion, not very often, and they would often be not released to the press. We wouldn't want that out there. But I think doing it publicly, quickly and very simply, there wasn't a lot of complexity, contrast with the Abbott answer, in exactly what was in that memo. I think that's talked about how much Republicans, as a party, are spooked when it comes to having to talk about kind of the complexities of this. And I think when you -- when you talk with the Abbott clip, the short answer is the right answer and it's the easiest stance. The more you try to get in ins and outs, you are just talking yourself into a wall here and you're not I helping yourself.

That's the personal component of just looking at it and being able to go into a voting booth and vote where your - where your heart is and how you feel like your community is being impacted. On a political side, you know, if you're running a campaign, it is really hard to get a voter to do one thing in February and then change their thinking in nine months to do something in November. And so it is a risk. I know they are saying this is a primary approach, but changing a voters' behavior from, I'm not with this guy at all, to, I'm going to vote with him, is really, really hard.

Donald Trump will be the nominee of the Republican Party by the middle of March, and you have to figure out what -- how you want to spend this last week. And a lot of it has to do with what your future objectives are. Do you want to be the candidate in 2028? If so, do you want to lean in or lean back a little here and try and mollify these Trump forces. Maybe the best strategy is just to continue with the Cassandra (ph) strategy and say, he's not going to win and we need a winning candidate, but do it in a more muted way. Or if that's not your objective, maybe you do want to lean in and instead of just telling Trump -- telling people why Trump can't win, you tell them why he shouldn't win, which is something that she has avoided thus far.",
