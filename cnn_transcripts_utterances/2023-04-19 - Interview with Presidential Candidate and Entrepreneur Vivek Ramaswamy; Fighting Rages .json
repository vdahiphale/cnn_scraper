I think Lyndon Johnson's so- called great society was one of the greatest misnomers in American political history where even back then, in the 1960s, 70 percent plus of black kids were born into the two-parent homes. Today, that number is less than 30 percent in the opposite direction. The very policies that we implemented in this country in the name of helping black Americans have actually been disastrous for black Americans and all Americans, and I think that that's something that we need to wake up to.",

The number of casualties is rising and half of the hospitals in the capital \"out of action.\" Then the U.S. issues a stark warning to Russia about American technology inside the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. Plus, Japan plans to release more than one million tons of treated wastewater from the Fukushima nuclear plant into the sea. But that's despite concerns from some. The government promises it is safe. The deadly power struggle between the rival military factions in Sudan is now in its fifth day, with both sides accusing each other of violating an internationally brokered ceasefire. The temporary truce was shattered just hours after its scheduled start, which was on Tuesday. Millions of civilians remain trapped in their homes, many of them running dangerously low on food and water. And one humanitarian group says half the hospitals in Khartoum are \"out of action.\" CNN's Larry Madowo joins me live in Nairobi. What's the solution here?

And now, both are either accusing the other of having violated it first, which has been the trend we've seen since Saturday when these clashes first broke out, both sides claimed the other attack them first.But this is leading to a humanitarian crisis that's just getting worse. One aid organization, CARE, says about 15 million Sudanese people are in need of humanitarian assistance, 11 million are not even meeting the basic nutrition requirements. And this other aid organization, Medecins Sans Frontieres, or Doctors Without Borders, says that, right now, about half of the hospitals in the Capital of Khartoum are out of action. Some of them have been bombed. Some of them are just out of resources. They don't have people or medicines or equipment to continue doing this work. And in some cases, staff just can't get there. Doctors and nurses and other medical professionals are afraid of getting there. So, that is the reality. The few that are operating are stretched to capacity. One of them received more, about 130, 140 wounded in just one day. At the same time, these two sides still no closer to a negotiation. And I want to show you one video we received from a Sudanese British author and activist who's trapped in Sudan. Listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

So, it is very difficult to even verify the facts on the ground around the Zaporizhzhia power plant.We have seen in the past, the power plant actually becoming disconnected on multiple occasions from the Ukrainian national grid as a result of Russian shelling, and that has really stoked concern and fear across Europe, and indeed, in the U.S., around the possibility of a nuclear accident. Now, of course, the U.S., in this letter, which has been reviewed by CNN, this is coming from the Department of Energy in the U.S. saying that the plant contains U.S. origin nuclear technical data that is export controlled by the U.S. government. So, that means it would be unlawful for any Russian citizens or Russian entities to handle this technology. And of course, this is a huge priority and huge concern for the U.S. government.",

FOSTERNow, Japan plans to begin dumping more than a million tons of treated radioactive wastewater into the Pacific Ocean, and that's in the coming weeks. It was contaminated at the Fukushima nuclear plant, that was the disaster more than 12 years ago. Officials insist the water is safe to release, though. But fishermen aren't so sure. CNN's Marc Stewart talked to them. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MARC STEWART, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voiceover):  It's just after nine in the morning. The crew of this ship is back import at the Onahama fishing village in Fukushima, Japan. Kenzaburo Shiga (ph) is a third- generation fisherman, starting in elementary school, going on trips with his father. He told me he's happy on the boat, but he faces challenges. His catch is tested for radiation. That's because the port is around 40 miles from the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant. In 201, there was a meltdown here after a catastrophic earthquake and tsunami. For six years he couldn't fish, told to stay off the water. When he heard he couldn't fish, he was sad, disappointed the ocean was off limits. STEWART (on camera):  12 years later, fishermen faced yet another challenge. Treated wastewater that accumulated inside the plant will soon be released into the ocean, a threat to their reputation and way of life. STEWART (voiceover):  He says the decision made his blood boil. He wonders why the government made the decision without the consent of the fishermen. At the time, the prime minister said it had to be done to decommission the plant. We wanted to see the plant for ourselves and we were allowed to after agreeing to a strict safety protocol. STEWART (on camera):  This is as close as we can get to reactors one through four. The cleanup work here will take at least 20 more years. STEWART (voiceover):  We also saw a lab where fish are tested. And lots of construction on the water treatment facility. STEWART (on camera):  Let me show you the tanks behind me row after row, enough to fill about 500 Olympic swimming pools. The treated water will be let go gradually through a tunnel that will take it off shore and then eventually into the ocean. STEWART (voiceover):  According to the plant operator, Tokyo Electric Power Company, the water has been treated by taking out most of the radioactive particles. It's then deluded with seawater, taking it to a level much lower than the World Health Organization's clean drinking water standard. An official from the utility told us he recognizes there's distrust because of the past, but they're listening to concerns. He knows not everyone will accept their plan, but points out support they're getting from third-parties such as the International Atomic Energy Agency. Still, neighboring countries have expressed concern. STEWART (on camera):  Is there a public health risk by releasing this water?",
