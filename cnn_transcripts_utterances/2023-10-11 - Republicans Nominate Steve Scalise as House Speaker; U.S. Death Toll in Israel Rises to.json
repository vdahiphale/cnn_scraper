The prime minister's office says that babies and toddlers were found decapitated in the small community of Kfar Aza. That's the kibbutz where Israeli Defense Forces say that Hamas butchered civilians, though Hamas denies that it attacked children. The unprecedented atrocities have put months of bitter division within the Israeli government on pause. They have now formed an emergency unity government and war cabinet. And, in just a few hours, the U.S. secretary of state will be there in Israel to meet with senior officials -- Anderson.",

The Pentagon has tasked special operators to assist the IDF, the Israeli Defense Forces, with planning for potential hostage rescues. Now, it is believed that Hamas has captured more than 100 hostages. Islamic Jihad had claimed that they had 30. Overall, there are an unknown number of Americans being held hostage. The White House says at least 20 U.S. citizens are right now unaccounted for, and the State Department now confirms at least 22 Americans have died in Israel. That is up from just 14. That was the number about 12 hours ago. So, those numbers are growing. Right now, I want to get you to CNN's Nic Robertson, who is in Sderot right by the Gaza border. Nic, what have you been seeing over the last several hours?",

They cover more ground. They're more likely to come into contact with these elements. And we have seen these armored fighting vehicles out today, and they come mounted with a heavy machine gun on the front of them. And that's the type of heavy machine gun that I think that we're hearing there. So it could be that a group of soldiers, they have established themselves in a field or wherever their location is. They have got guards on their perimeter. And they might have picked up some movement or they might have seen something through thermal imaging or night vision or whatever it is. And they have realized that that's a target and they're going after it. So I think more and more of this may come.",

But, you know what, when I reflect back on what the -- what the commander said to us, the major general in charge, again, I will repeat -- repeat this line, because it really sticks. He said: \"I was shocked what I found, massacre.\" He said that -- \"I was reminded,\" he said, \"of what General Eisenhower said when he found the atrocities, when he found the death camps after World War II. He said get the press in here. Show them.\" So I think that's what -- that's what was taking place yesterday. And I realize now that, when he said there was beheadings and that families were being killed, he was really understating the brutality of what he'd seen and what he was aware of, because we have now heard it now from the from the prime minister's spokesman confirming this. So it kind of just adds that other degree of incredulity, I think, that there could be that level of barbarity. And -- but the commander was telling us, people -- these families, some of them, their hands were bound when they were executed. So the shock level here is just horrific. And, for him, it was reminding him of what is -- what his parents had gone through. They left Europe, and they were survivors, the survivors of the Second World War.",

That is per multiple sources in the House of Representatives, a major win, but not a guaranteed path to the speakership. He still needs a majority of the entire chamber to replace Kevin McCarthy, the ousted speaker who was removed by the House last week. Let's get you to Capitol Hill right now.

That majority threshold was at 111 Republican votes.He got 113 votes. The vote was 113 to 99, defeating House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan, who had the support of former President Donald Trump, had the support of a lot of conservatives, including the ones who voted to oust Kevin McCarthy as speaker. But this vote to elevate Steve Scalise, who is currently the House major leader, the number two under the speaker, to the speakership essentially is a sign that he has some work to do, because of the fact that, in order to be elected as the House speaker, you need to have 217 votes on the House floor, and, at the moment, as you can see, a long ways from getting that. In fact, there was a debate inside the conference this morning about whether the person to be nominated as speaker should have to clear that 217-vote threshold behind closed doors in the conference meeting. Scalise's supporters defeated that motion. Jordan's team tried to push for that motion, believing that it could help him get elected to the speakership. Now the work is cut out for Scalise, who has to try to avoid the same fate as Kevin McCarthy, who in January went through 15 rounds on the House floor to get the requisite number of votes to be elected speaker. Can he do that? That is one of the big questions that he will have to deal with here. A number of members voted present because they didn't like their choices. They have concerns about some of the answers that these two men gave. Others were with Jim Jordan. And Jordan himself has not said that he would vote for Scalise. I asked him that question going in to this conference meeting. He said: \"I will get behind whoever can get 217 votes.\" Well, Scalise did not get 217 votes. If Jordan does not get behind Scalise, that could lead to a messy fight on the House floor. So, now where does this go from here? Now, they have to make a decision on when to bring this to the full House. It could happen as soon as this afternoon. It could go into next week. It could go into tomorrow. That will be a key decision here, because Scalise will have to ultimately decide if he wants to take a risk, go to the floor if he does not have the votes locked down here, but a significant moment, after this House has been paralyzed following that historic vote and unprecedented vote to oust Kevin McCarthy as speaker. Now the Republicans have voted on a nominee, but can he get the votes? Can he be elected speaker? And can they move on these key issues, whether it's aid to Israel, aid to Ukraine, avoiding a government shutdown by mid-November, all major questions after Republicans nominating here Steve Scalise, the House majority leader, to be the next speaker of the House -- Boris.",

You heard the congressman saying that Jim Jordan didn't explicitly say that he's endorsing Steve Scalise, that he would get behind whoever can get 217 votes on the House floor. Can Steve Scalise get there? He didn't get there in the conference meeting. And what will some of those members who may want some concessions, will they fall in line? So, there seems to be some confusion too about the timing of all this. Some of the members believe that there could be a vote this afternoon to elect the next speaker of the House. We will see if that's officially announced today. So perhaps the Scalise team wants to push ahead, wants to force this vote right now, and doesn't want to wait this -- force this to linger, because the longer that he lingers, then the more deals he may have to cut with some of those hard-liners who essentially ended Speaker McCarthy's, Kevin McCarthy's speakership. He doesn't -- he wants to avoid that. And Scalise so far has indicated he has not cut those side deals. He said that to his conference last night, but he might have to do that in order to get to 217 votes. Perhaps by going to the floor and daring some of the members to vote against him, he may not have to do -- cut some of those side deals. So we will see ultimately how this plays out. But it's also interesting here, guys, to note this was a secret ballot election. Some of these members simply just don't even want to talk about how they voted, Congressman Dan Bishop, for one, who was aligned with some of those hard-liners in his conference, not saying how he would vote, how he voted just now, some of them indicating that they will still vote for Scalise if he's on the floor. But a divided Republican Conference at this key moment here, deciding to move forward with Steve Scalise on the narrowest of margins internally, but can he get there? Can he get the votes to be elected speaker? A lot of Republicans hope that he can get there. But the question is, how will he be able to get that done, and whether some of those detractors ultimately will fall in line. I'm going to ask Mr. -- Mr. Fry, what -- who did you end up voting for?

This is the risk of the narrowly divided House that Kevin McCarthy -- that doomed his speakership; 221 members in the House, that means 217 votes.

      "sentences": "Thank you.So, there -- so, from one congressman right there, Mr. Thomas Massie, still deciding whether or not he will vote for Steve Scalise, wants some more time to discuss it with the members. And I can tell you he's not alone who probably feels that same way about whether or not he will actually be ready to vote for him. I'm going to try to ask the Congressman Scott -- Mr. Perry, are you voting -- are you going to vote for Steve Scalise on the floor? Mr. Perry? Mr. Perry? OK, he didn't answer my question there. But that's another question, is whether or not some of these members who may have voted for Jim Jordan, may have abstained, may have voted present will vote for Steve Scalise. Thomas Massie wants more time, and he may not get that more time, because the Scalise supporters are eager to take this to the floor and have a vote immediately this afternoon. We will see if that's the decision of Steve Scalise. But another important thing that Thomas Massie just pointed out, this is ultimately the decision of the speaker nominee, Steve Scalise. When does he want to have this vote? Is it time to just pull the bandage up, fight this out on the floor, see what happens? That is a huge risk. One of the fights that they had internally today is to avoid that. They wanted to just sort -- some of the members, including, namely, the Jordan supporters, wanted to just fight this out behind closed doors, take some time, figure out which candidate could get to 217 votes, which is going to be the magic number on the floor, and then not have that drawn-out, long floor fight. Scalise's team did not want that. They were concerned, if they went down that route, he would not win the nomination. But now they are left with the prospects of not getting the votes on the House floor after getting barely a majority of his conference to support him in the nomination. So what will those other 99 members do? Will they all fall in line? A lot of them will. A lot of them are willing to support this nominee on the floor of the House. A lot of them simply, like Thomas Massie, who backed Jim Jordan, not ready to back Scalise yet, wants to have some meetings, so perhaps they may have to wait a little bit of time. We will see, though, what the House majority leader, now speaker nominee Steve Scalise, decides to do about the timing of this critical, critical vote -- guys.",
