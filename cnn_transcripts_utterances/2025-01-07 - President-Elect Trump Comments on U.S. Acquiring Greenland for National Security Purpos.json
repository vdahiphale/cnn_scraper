CNN's David Chalian is joining us now. David, Don Junior's visit is not an official one. He's not an official with the Trump campaign in this capacity. But what's his -- what's his plan?

What they say is, is, as you know, you mentioned it was an item on the to do list that never got done in the first Trump administration. And Donald Trump shortly before Christmas talked about this again and started Truth Socialing. Denmark said that Greenland is not for sale. The prime minister of Greenland has said that they need to use this as a moment to fight for their independence, and that they are not for sale for anyone, but should think about how to govern themselves independently and who they trade with.But this is Donald Trump, real estate developer, on display. I don't think we should spend a whole ton of time on this until we know that there's an actual plan in place, an offer, that there's a system set up, rather than just it being sort of a Donald Trump wish list item and bluster. I will say the former president has called it a national security necessity for the United States to acquire Greenland. So it seems to me that would be a pretty big deal if he's unable to follow through with it, if indeed it is, in his mind, a national security necessity.",

And that's a substantive policy disagreement which can be fixed in a Trump administration by simply reversing what Biden is doing.The difficulties that I think are being experienced in the transition have a lot more to do with the Trump team's failure to sign up to the normal transition process, to get their transition people access in various departments, particularly, for example, the Defense Department, where my understanding is that things are way, way behind where they might -- where they should be with less than two weeks to go until the inauguration. And I think that's really worth investigating more, what is the state of play for people representing the Trump transition team and getting briefed on issues and substance in all the various different departments and agencies? My guess is they're pretty far behind everywhere, but as I say, particularly in the Defense Department. If that's not right, then let's hear about it.",

But for all those who chuckle and say, oh, Greenland, ha-ha-ha, let me just say, you're wrong, too. The security of Greenland is directly related to the security of the United States.Now, how we go about that is a subject for discussion. There is a long history here. I won't go through it here. I should have written about it in my book, but the book was already too long for the publisher. But it's just worth repeating that there are serious issues here that that need to be addressed. They don't necessarily need to be addressed by the United States acquiring sovereignty over Greenland. There are a lot of ways to go about this. We looked at some of them when I was at the White House. There are probably more that can be done. But I'll tell you this. The one way to screw this up is to keep talking about it publicly. Officials in Greenland are elected by the people. Officials in Denmark are elected by the people. You keep talking about buying them as if it's a real estate deal, you're hardening their positions. You're pushing them into a corner that will make it very difficult to achieve what is the real American national interest here, which is preserving the security of the North American landmass, and obviously, critically, the United States itself.",

It's -- the people who sign up to serve in senior positions in the administration have to swear an oath of loyalty to the Constitution. That's what they're really there to defend, not loyalty, blind loyalty to the to the person in the office of the president.But Trump, Trump doesn't have any basic philosophy he's looking for in his appointees. There's a real question whether he cares about competence. He just wants people who are going to salute and say, yes, sir, and go do what he wants without thinking of the consequences. And the irony here, not only is that bad for America, it's going to be bad for Trump. A president is not well served by people who are afraid to speak out, afraid to say, but, Mr. President, have you considered factors a, b and c, or Mr. President, have you looked at this option which may get you to the to the goal you're seeking in a better way than what you've just said? He Trump may get fealty, but ultimately it will work out badly for him and particularly badly for the for the country. So if the Senate cares about that, it ought to look at whether these nominees are fit for office in terms of their views. I think in terms of opinions and policies, presidents are owed great deference. But the but the advise and consent powers, they're really on the question of character and fitness.",

The special counsel regulations under which Jack Smith is operating say that at the end of his investigation and we are there for Jack Smith, he must, it's mandatory, create a written report that lays out his findings.Now, at that point, the report goes to the attorney general, who then may not must, but may release it to the public. Now, Merrick Garland, so far in his term, has immediately released special counsel reports to the public. He did that with the Robert Hur report about Joe Biden's classified documents. He did it with John Durham's report. So, Donald Trump is taking really an unprecedented step here of trying to block the release of that report. Every time thus far in our recent history, where one of these reports has been written, it has, in fact gone over to Congress and then come out to the American public.",

So, that argument is not going to apply.But I do think he's going to argue, Donald Trump's team will argue the entire institution of special counsel is unconstitutional as Judge Cannon found and therefore you cannot release this report. That will take us into unknown territory, because while there have been several challenges lodged against special counsel over the years in various cases, not just this one, they've all failed up until Judge Cannon.

They say they will be conducting an autopsy to determine the cause of death. But this flight had originated, according to JetBlue, had departed from New York around 7:00 PM last night, had landed in Fort Lauderdale shortly after 11:00 PM when this discovery was made in the early morning hours during a post flight maintenance inspection. Now, you mentioned, Kate, this happens just two weeks after a body of a stowaway was found in a flight from Chicago's O'Hare Airport, bound for Maui. That same day on Christmas Eve, another stowaway found while the plane was taxiing at Seattle's Sea-Tac Airport. And of course, many of us remember what happened Thanksgiving week, an un-ticketed passenger also at JFK's Airport, managing somehow to make it from JFK all the way to Paris before being discovered. Now, the FAA tells us that stowaways often use the landing gear to hide in, not realizing just how, you know, small of a space there is once that landing gear retracts.

Aviation is often the attack target of terrorist attacks. And yet, the airport on the tarmac is supposed to be covered by surveillance. We're supposed to have camera coverage, and everyone on that tarmac is supposed to have a background check and supposed to be an airline employee who's documented and known. So, the fact that this keeps happening and people who are not, stowaways, the FAA did a report on stowaways in the wheel wells are not usually airport or airline employees and yet this keeps happening. People are getting onto the airport property and getting into an aircraft, and it poses a huge security danger for the aircraft because these people were just apparently just trying to get some place, but it could have easily been someone attempting to attack aviation. SIDNER: How common is this, that someone is found in a wheel well? I'm asking because we've now seen two separate incidents within a couple of weeks of each other.",
