You know that I'm a mother of a nine-year-old girl, and this story felt very personal to so many mothers and fathers and people, human beings across this country, when this little girl went missing on a camping trip just two days ago, when she was just riding her bike, everyone.Well, she has been found safe tonight. We're going to unpack all of it. We're going to talk to our experts and give you everything we know now that this little girl is safe. That's all coming up. But, you know, I had been waiting also to talk to you all day long about day one of this trial against Donald Trump. He showed up. The cameras were let in for just long enough to catch the former president sitting at the defendant's table. A few feet away from him was the attorney general, Letitia James, who he has called racist and has condemned her for a very long time. A judge was also a few feet away from him, presiding over the entire trial. And Trump was actually late entering the courtroom because he was too busy insulting that judge in front of the cameras outside the courtroom. And mind you, Trump did not have to show up to this. It's surprising to know, in a state court case in New York, you might be shocked to know that it's actually not required for you to actually appear. Remember, he didn't show up at the trial where he was accused of sexual misconduct by E. Jean Carroll. Remember that? But this trial, one that could spell maybe the end of the Trump business in New York, the one about his wealth and mind you, a quarter of a billion, yes, with a \"B,\" a quarter of a billion bucks, well, you better believe he was in that courtroom, or was it the campaign trail that he was on? Maybe a little bit of both because, after all, this to me sounded a whole lot like what was going on, that the courthouse was another stop on the campaign trail, at least outside.

The court could ultimately rule on these other six counts as well as how much money they're going to give to the state of New York based on his finding of fraud. And so, attacking those two makes very little sense.

Now, it's not a requirement there to actually be a victim, but is that going to hold water? ROGER SEVERINO, VICE PRESIDENT, THE HERITAGE FOUNDATION: Well, there's a fundamental concept of law. No victim, no crime. So, where's the victim here? One of the banks made $40 million in interest. President Trump paid all his bills. He paid every single thing he owed. He never missed a payment. So, you're right, it is a political clown show. But the ringleader is Letitia James, the attorney general. She's the one who's bringing this politically-motivated campaign against President Trump.

It's very clear there's no victim. He said that you don't even need an intent to actually defraud. And we're talking about sophisticated banks, right? When he gave his numbers, as to what he valued Mar-a- Lago, the judge said it was only $18 million. One of the most famous properties in America, only $18 million.

I think one asset in particular to keep an eye on is 40 Wall Street. This is a building in downtown New York. It does have a pretty significant loan against it.And it also has a big problem, which is that it's technically what's called a leasehold. In other words, Donald Trump doesn't own the land there. He just gets to operate the building and collect the profits. The rent that he has to pay to the owners of the land, which is a German family, skyrockets 10 years from now. That basically makes that property sort of a ticking time bomb. So, if you were to try to sell that anyways, an investor might look at that as, oh, this might be sort of a fire sale. If he has to sell that with under duress from the New York attorney general or court, then all of a sudden, it's sort of an extreme fire sale and he could end up in trouble on that loan. But the important thing to remember about Donald Trump's finances is that he does have a significant amount of cash. His best defense in this case is about $425 million. That's roughly the amount of cash that he has. So, even if they force him to pay, say a quarter of a billion dollars, sure, it's going to be very, very painful and it's going to limit his ability to, for example, borrow against his buildings in the future and figure out what to do with expiring loans on office buildings, but he can handle that hit and he's not going to walk away from this a poor man.",

It runs it against every print from anybody who has been arrested on a felony or been in state prison. And they came up with a match.

But one of the reasons to think about this is that you don't want to sometimes spook the suspect into never knowing where the person they're holding might ultimately be, and then you're lost and at the mercy of the person who may choose to speak to you. But talk to me about the role of technology in a search like this. KAYYEMAnd part of this is modern technology. How are we able to do this now? So just think of the combination of things. First of all, you have the fingerprints that are then matched to an older database which you have the suspect in there for some randomness in a different jurisdiction, a random crime in a different jurisdiction, not related to this particular crime. You then have the pings from the cell phones. And that's relatively new technology in the sense of our ability to, in real time, assess where is the network connecting, and then we can target where the suspect is.",

Tonight, according to his office, they say he was not harmed in the incident. CNN's Manu Raju joins me now on the phone. Manu, this is unbelievable.RAJU (via telephone): Yeah, a terrifying incident that happened about 9:30 this evening. Congressman Cuellar was parking his car in the Navy Yard neighborhood not too far from the Capitol. Three armed men came up to his car. They approached, uh, his vehicle, and then he was carjacked at gunpoint. His phone was stolen. His iPad was stolen. Even his (INAUDIBLE) was stolen, according to his office. Of course, his car was stolen. Police say that the suspects are still at large. They're searching for the suspects along with the vehicle. The congressman, though, was not harmed, according to his office. Of course, (INAUDIBLE) shaken up by (INAUDIBLE), Laura, as we've seen some violent episodes (INAUDIBLE) members of Congress as well. Angie Craig of Minnesota last year was punched in the face at an elevator in her apartment. Staffer of Senator Rand Paul was stabbed last year as well. So, members of Congress are not immune to violent episodes and crime here. It is not uncommon to members of Congress to be out and about in a busy congressional week. They're out in the evening, they have fundraisers, they have dinners and the like. This incident is a scary one for long-time Texas Democrat Henry Cuellar. But, as the office says, he's not harmed despite this incident (INAUDIBLE), but something that a lot of members are talking about tonight, this busy time on Capitol Hill and this scary incident for the congressmen.",

Here's Congressman Gaetz earlier tonight. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. MATT GAETZ (R-FL): He doesn't have my support anymore, and he doesn't have the support of a requisite number of Republicans to continue as the Republican speaker. Now, he may continue as the House speaker and he may continue as a speaker of the Democrats in some sort of uniparty coalition, but he is not going to be a speaker in power as a consequence of Republican votes.

I don't know the resolution or whatever you might call it was introduced tonight. It will go through the regular order of things. Our caucus will be meeting on its regular schedule tomorrow morning. I suspect Leader Hakeem Jeffries will bring us up to date on exactly what may be going on between him and the speaker. So, nobody knows where this is going.
