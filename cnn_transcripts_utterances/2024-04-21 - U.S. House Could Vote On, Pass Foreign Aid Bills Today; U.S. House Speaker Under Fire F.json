Now on Friday, House Democrats helped House Speaker Mike Johnson get the measures passed a key procedural vote. The Ukraine aid bill contains around $61 billion in funding, including $23 billion to replenish U.S. weapons stockpiles, another $11 billion to fund operations in the region and nearly $14 billion to help Ukraine buy advanced weapons and other defense equipment. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy is making it clear the help can't come soon enough. Here's what he said in his address to NATO defense ministers in Brussels on Friday. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

A full jury panel is now in place after the last alternates were seated on Friday. An appeals court has denied the presidential candidate's latest attempt to delay his criminal trial.

Authorities say he was previously known to the police and while they are searching for any domestic terror connections, that is not believed to have been the motivation. In court, a handful of prospective jurors became emotional. One was excused after she told the judge she had anxiety and was worried as the trial goes on, more people could know she's part of the jury, saying, \"I might not be able to be completely fair and not emotional, so that concerns me.\" Another was dismissed after she began crying, saying, \"I'm sorry. I thought I could do this. I wouldn't want someone who feels this way to judge my case either. I don't want you to feel I've wasted anyone's time. This is so much more stressful than I thought.\" A third was sent home after noting she was feeling anxiety and self- doubt as she listen to a line of questioning about the credibility of witnesses. At the defense table, Trump sat flipping through papers with charts, photos and graphics. He whispered in past notes with his lawyers and at some points was hunched over with his elbows on the desk. Prosecutor Susan Hoffinger started off questioning potential jurors, telling them, \"This is not about Mr. Trump being a former president. It's not about his being a candidate for the presidency. It's only about whether the evidence proves he's guilty.\" During her presentation, Trump leaned back in his chair. At one point, his eyes closed. Trump's attorney, Susan Necheles, focused on bias against the former president. She told those in the jury box, \"You all bring biases and you particularly bring biases about someone who is as publicly and outspoken as President Trump. There's nobody that doesn't know him in this room.\" In the afternoon, the court moved to a routine hearing to determine how much of Trump's legal history the prosecution will be allowed to ask him about if he testifies, which he said he plans to. Prosecutors argued they should be allowed to question Trump about the findings in the E. Jean Carroll defamation case, among others, despite Trump's attorney's strong objections. The former president shook his head as the prosecution spoke about how he defamed Carroll -- Kara Scannell, CNN, New York. (END VIDEOTAPE) (MUSIC PLAYING)",

But when we look at how this is going to play out in the election, if he is convicted, this is not going to play well for him. I mean, at the very least he could actually even see prison time. But like you mentioned, the polls reveal that they would not want to vote for a president who is convicted of a crime. Of course, this is all uncharted territory for us. We've never really had this kind of situation in U.S. politics. And you would think that just the criminal counts in itself would be enough to deter people from voting for him. But I think that Trump, it seems to be, relying on this idea that his base is going to come out to vote for him no matter what. It doesn't matter what he does and he's above the law. But I think he's about to face a lot more friction as he may get a result. And particularly in this case that doesn't go well for him.

And there were three Republicans in total on, that is enough that, if they decide to put it to vote and all of the Democrats agreed to vote him out, Mike Johnson would be ousted from speakership. But that would create huge chaos and I actually don't think that would be good for the Republicans six months before a national election, to show how unable they are to just even manage this slim majority that they can't keep a speaker in the House.

And again, both sides domestically, at least, taking this as a window.On the Iranian side, what we have seen is an effort to downplay Israel's attack on Isfahan. What we have seen is a real disregarding of the attack actually by Iranian officials, who have described Israel as using tiny drones, the damage being limited. In fact, we heard from the Iranian president Ebrahim Raisi, speaking yesterday, there was no mention of Israel's attack on Iran, though the focus was very much still on Iran's retaliatory attack on Israel, following Israel's consular strikes. So clearly an effort on the, on the Iranian side to downplay the incident and they may well also, of course, be regional considerations at hand. There had been significant concern around the potential for this provocation to lead to a broader regional war, particularly with regards to Iran's regional proxies. And of course, important to remember that Iran has recently reestablished relations with Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, both of whom are key allies to the United States in the region. And we know that the Biden administration has been very clear in trying to avert a broader escalation of tensions in the region. Now on the Israeli side, again, this has been a limited response from the ground. Scheme of things but there is a clear message, a clear signal being sent here, of course, the province of Isfahan known to house a key nuclear base, a key airbase, as well. This is an industrial hub known to have produced drones and missiles. So this is a strategic location in Iran. Clearly the intelligence is on the side of the Israeli officials, who launched this attack on Iran. But again, the scope of the attack in itself was limited. Perhaps the importance of significance there was in the message being sent by Israel. But of course, there has been mounting pressure on both sides to avert a broader regional war. That was certainly the case for the European Union. We heard from the E.U.'s foreign policy chief Josep Borrell, saying that E.U. leaders need to stand together in trying to pressure both sides to avert a regional war. Of course, as we know, the U.S. it has been very vocal in dissuading any sort of border escalation or provocations.",

Rosemary Church has the story. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ROSEMARY CHURCH, CNN ANCHOR (voice-over): Deep under the ocean's surface, a little robot wanders through Australia's Great Barrier Reef. It's an AI powered drone called Hydrus. And it's doing important work for the environment, examining the coral reefs. The diverse ecosystems protect coastlines from erosion and storms as well as providing jobs and food for local communities. The effects of climate change are threatening the coral, causing it to expel algae and lose its color, sometimes permanently.",

CHURCH (voice-over): Cooler waters can return the coral to its natural color but some are not able to recover and they eventually die. That's where this new technology comes into play. According to its maker, Advanced Navigation, Hydrus is less expensive than most other underwater vessels.

Now the NBA playoffs tip off today, the field of 16 is officially set after a pair of impressive play wins by the Miami Heat and New Orleans Pelicans, each playing without their biggest stars. \"CNN SPORT's\" correspondent Carolyn Manno joins me now.So Carolyn, so much going on, this might be the most exciting weekend of the year for NBA fans. CAROLYN MANNO, CNN SPORTS CORRESPONDENT: They're spoiled this weekend. Kim, good morning. Both Miami and New Orleans though, are going to need herculean efforts if they want to make a run this postseason. But they have taken the first step, which is getting in and that's important. Zion Williamson out for the Pelicans, nursing a hamstring injury but the rest of the team rising to the occasion in this win or go home situation against the Kings. Six players scored in double figures. They were led by Brandon Ingram, the former all-star, who had a team high 24 points to go with six assists. And a big block as well in the third, swatting Harrison Barnes. He led the break past Herb Jones for three. So New Orleans running away with it. Jose Alvarado put them up by 20 halfway through the fourth as they end up winning by eight, clinching the eighth seed and setting up a series with the Oklahoma City Thunder. In the meantime, no Jimmy Butler, no problem for Miami, the Heat flat- out stomping the Bulls. And after starting the game down by five, the Heat got hot, they got blistering. Actually going on at 26-2 run and they never looked back. Tyler Hero, just one assist shy of his second career triple double 24 points, seven rebounds, nine assists, including an incredible behind the back pass to Caleb Martin for three as Miami cruises, 112-91 and will now turn their attention to the NBAs best team this season. The Boston Celtics head coach Erik Spoelstra from Miami, just happy to have a chance. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

He was forced to walk away from the game five years ago because of a slew of injuries that even included a broken back after a bicycle accident. So he had been working as a carpenter when he started giving lessons to Little Leaguers and then got the itch to play again.
