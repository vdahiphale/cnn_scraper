You know, given that things had basically went pretty well as far as the U.S. officials yesterday at the summit were concerned, I asked him after all of that, would he still consider him a dictator. And he said, yes. That that is basically what we are dealing with when we are dealing with this government in Beijing. I think it's just really interesting, because U.S. officials had noted heading into the summit that there was so much riding on Chinese counterparts that they were dealing with in terms of the optics, and how sensitive they were to how the summit would be perceived by the rest of the world.  We know for sure this is a label that Chinese officials are incredibly sensitive to. M.J. Lee, great work. Thank you.

So far in the initial hours that this operation has gone on, theIsraeli military has released video they say was from an area where MRIs are conducted in the hospital, where they found small amounts of firearms and military equipment and that sort of thing. But clearly, not the extensive kind of evidence that is so crucially needed at this moment that would back up the claims that the areas underneath this hospital is this crucial command-and-control center.

And it comes at a time, you know, when the families are just growing more and more desperate for news as they watch the military operations, the dangerous military operations ongoing inside of Gaza. The Israeli Defense Force has confirmed that one of the hostages, a woman by the name of Noa Marciano, was killed. Hamas has claimed that she was killed in an airstrike.

And he seemed most eager to make two key points. One concerning America's improving relationship with China and the other its unchanged and steadfast support of Israel.Joining us now, \"Semafor\" reporter Shelby Talcott; political video reporter at \"The Washington Post,\" Joyce Koh; and CNN senior political analyst and anchor, John Avlon. Guys, thanks for joining us this morning. Shelby, I want to -- I want to start with you and try and bring things back home, right? The geopolitical implications of that meeting were enormous. We continue to talk about that at length. China is also a huge political issue inside the country, so much so that Xi Jinping, according to a senior U.S. official, actually raised concerns about perceptions and media coverage related to it. How do you think people looking towards 2024 will view what happened last night? SHELBY TALCOTT, REPORTER, \"SEMAFOR\": I'm actually kind of surprised that there hasn't been more chatter from 2024 Republicans yet on the meeting. I do anticipate that that's going to change, probably this morning or this afternoon. Because particularly with Republicans, China has been a huge topic on the campaign trail. It's playing really well in early states like Iowa. People really care about it. Overall, though, I think the sense of optimism that Biden portrayed is not necessarily the -- the same that we're hearing here in the U.S. I think -- I think maybe he was a little bit over-optimistic. And just historically, you look at, you know, he called -- he called Xi a dictator again. That is -- that last time around really didn't bode well for the relationship. And so I would say it is -- remains extremely tense, and I would expect 2024, Republicans to continue to harp on Biden's relationship with China.",

But I mean, it's -- what, you know, Shelby's talking about is also just the way that China has been a constant source of sort of aijeda (ph) among Republicans since Donald Trump. I think the difference, you know, fast forward four or five years later, is that Donald Trump is on the stump praising Xi, praising dictators, and President Biden's calling him a dictator. That's a pretty substantive difference. The other thing is that, even if you're -- if you're saying that we are engaged in a very tough competition with China, as the Biden administration does. You know, in the 2020 election, there was all this sort of talk about Beijing and Biden, he was going to sell out. The Biden administration has been very tough on China. And this meeting was about issues that also the Republican base cares about. Fentanyl is where foreign policy comes home in America. They're working on kind of a deal. Saying we're going to -- we're going to call him a dictator, but we're also going to have talks with the military to avoid an escalation, who in the realm of responsible is going to oppose that? I don't want to set is the bar too high for our political discourse, but -- so I think this was substantive. You know, the substance of the policy.
