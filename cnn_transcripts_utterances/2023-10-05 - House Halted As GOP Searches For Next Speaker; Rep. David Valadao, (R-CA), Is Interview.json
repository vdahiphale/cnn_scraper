In New York City, around 600 migrants are showing up every single day. In Chicago, plans to bring in military grade tents as migrants crowd city sidewalks. Democratic leaders in both of these big cities are going to the border themselves, just as the Biden White House announces a plan to build more border barriers. And police say a man showed up at Wisconsin's State Capitol with a gun looking for the governor. What he did after his arrest is just as shocking. But first, Donald Trump is now weighing a trip to Capitol Hill, this time without the violent mob. Though he is injecting himself into what he maybe knows best, chaos. This one is stirred up by Republicans who have brought the House to a standstill as they mull over who should be their next speaker after they got rid of the last one. Let's get right to CNN's Manu Raju live on Capitol Hill. And Manu, longtime Republican lawmakers Steve Scalise and Jim Jordan seem to be the front runners right now, but they're taking quite different approaches to this race.",

Trying to go member by member to lock down their support, talking to various factions, various groups within the larger House Republican Conference and making the pitch about why they believe they can unite this badly divided conference. There are many questions that member have about their policies, the decisions they're going to make, how to avoid a government shutdown and how to avoid what happened on the House floor just two days ago when Kevin McCarthy became the first speaker ever ousted by his own colleagues on a floor vote.All these questions come as these two men are trying to essentially get a majority of the 221 House Republicans to vote for them in a secret ballot election next week. That will be the nominating contest after they are nominated by their conference, then they go to the House floor for a full vote. And that's when things will get tricky, Jake, because right now the House is 433 members with two vacancies. That means they could only afford to lose four Republican votes on the House floor. And if there are more than four, we can see what happened to Kevin McCarthy, happened to either of these candidates, which is why these discussions right now are so critical to lock down the support and make some promises to these members. Otherwise, if these members don't like what they're hearing, then they may undercut that bid for the speakership, Jake.",

They have not said whether or not they were threatening. They've said only that he wanted to speak with the governor. They took him back into custody, again without incident. He consented to a voluntary search of his backpack, which showed that he had a collapsible -- basically a collapsible police baton in his backpack. And Capitol police consider that a weapon and said that he does not have a concealed carry permit for that weapon. So again, they took him back into custody. He was at least charged with that. The latest information we have, Jake, is that he was at least -- they were going to try to get him to undergo a psychiatric evaluation. Many more questions here to learn, Jake, but certainly the diligent police at the Madison Capitol protecting the governor from what could have been a much scarier and much more dangerous incident. Tony Evers, the governor of Wisconsin, saying just that, saying this is not something you ever want to see. But he's very grateful for the diligent work of the Capitol police in Madison.

Sidney Powell's attorney, you know, sort of presented an early preview of what his defense is going to be as he was trying to get the charges against her dismissed.

So I think this is an ideal situation where you can take a lot of that H.R.-2 and what Henry Cuellar was talking about earlier today on the show saying there's a lot of H.R.-2, you know, that border bill that Republicans like. Let's take pieces of that because there's a lot of technology in there, a lot of things that Republicans like. And then let's get the Ukraine money that we know we need.There's a deal to be had there. And Joe Biden can, well, Republicans are trying to burn down the House, he can be working with Henry Cuellar and with Senate Republicans and with reasonable Republicans in the House and say, let's make a deal. And he can be the art of the deal here while Donald Trump is dealing with his legal problems.",

Around 2000, it starts going up and then we are that giant red line on the right side. And scientists are saying that is gobsmackingly bananas right now. It's a combination of fossil fuel pollution over 150 years and El Nino just beginning in the Pacific both the natural and the unnatural causes of this giant crisis.But there's amazing good news as well from the International Energy Agency. Their new report now takes stock of just how fast the world is adopting to clean energy. Solar, heat pumps, battery storage, these sorts of things have them predicting now that humanity will hold the warming at about 2.4 degrees warming by 2100. There's still a chance for 1.5. That is considerably good news considering just ten years ago we're talking about, you know, apocalyptic temperatures by 2100. But this shows that we can bend the curve if humanity cares.

His latest book is Our Fragile Moment: How Lessons from Earth's Past Can Help Us Survive the Climate Crisis. Congratulations on the book, Michael. Despite this year being on track to be the hottest ever recorded, you take, as Bill just did, a cautiously optimistic tone in your book. You write, quote, the greatest threat is no longer denialism, which is frankly, untenable, given the impacts that we can all see playing out in real time, but rather doomism the notion that it's too late to act, unquote. So what lessons from the past give you hope that we can actually meet this moment? MICHAEL MANN, DIRECTOR, UNIV. OF PA CENTER FOR SCIENCE, SUSTAINABILITY &amp; THE MEDIA: Yes, thanks. And it was a great sort of summary that Bill provided there. And he emphasized sort of this duality of urgency and agency. The urgency is obvious. It's clear we're all feeling increasingly dire consequences of fossil fuel burning and the warming planet that that's causing. But as Bill alluded to, we have agency as well. We can reduce our carbon emissions enough to avoid crossing into truly catastrophic territory. And when we look to the past, we can see that, you know, Earth does have a certain amount of resilience. The Earth system, earth's climate has a certain amount of resilience within it. And that's a helpful thing. And we see that in the past, the climate hasn't spun out of control. It's warmed up substantially when there's been a massive input of carbon dioxide, and that happened 55 million years ago, for example. That was a natural input of carbon dioxide. The planet warmed nearly nine degrees Fahrenheit, but it took tens of thousands of years. That's rapid on a geological time frame. We're warming the planet 100 times faster. And that's really the problem. It isn't how warm it is or how high CO2 levels are. They've been higher. The planet's been warmer. It's the rate at which we are warming the planet. But we can stop it, if we stop polluting the atmosphere with carbon pollution, the warming of the planet stops and the impacts that we're seeing stop getting worse. We'll still have to contend with those impacts that are baked in, but we can prevent it from getting worse.",

If they can convince us it's too late to do anything about the problem, it potentially leads us down that same path of disengagement. So it once again comes down to urgency. We see the urgency. We have a crisis on our hands and agency. We can do something about this. We need action.

He didn't have to physically be in the courtroom. There was no right at all for him to be heard in that courtroom. But then there was a can of worms opened up in that courtroom today because the attorney for Young Lee's family said, your honor, there was a hearing that was in the judge's chamber, very close in time to when this all happened. And the prosecution, the defense, the judge was there, no court reporter, nothing was written down. The prosecution, we understand, said, we have exculpatory evidence. We want to vacate the conviction. It was not disclosed at that time what it was and was all very quick. The justices took note of that because one even said, it appears as though there was a lot of stuff that had been discussed even before that that plain clothes would be -- civilian clothes would be ready for him. I want you to listen to the Maryland Supreme Court Justice Shirley Watts, take note of this revelation.
