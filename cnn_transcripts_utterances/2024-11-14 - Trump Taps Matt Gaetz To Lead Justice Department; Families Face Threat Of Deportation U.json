In other words, he wanted someone who would follow what he needed done, not what the law might suggest or practice might suggest is the appropriate approach. So, Matt Gaetz who's famous for being a shock jock on behalf of Trump in the House of Representatives. And also infamous for a number of as yet unproved allegations surrounding his personal life. He was the person who fits the Trump mold. Indeed, what's been so interesting in the last day and a half is that we see a different mood, a different approach to Trump 2.0 so far than the first Trump administration. The storm when drawn, the energy, the chaos was coming from him from his words in the very beginning of his previous administration. In this case, he's actually, first of all, less, available.

But diplomats say much of the focus will be on one person who's not even there, U.S. President-elect Donald Trump who pledged to slap tariffs on both friends and foes. The current U.S. president and his Chinese counterpart are said to arrive later on Thursday. Before holding their final meeting over the weekend, experts say Beijing smells opportunity in Trump's election victory, and it will try to divide the U.S. and its allies while presenting itself as a more stable alternative to Washington.Well, for more, Marc Stewart joins us now live from Beijing. Good to see you, Marc. So, what can we expect to come out of this APEC Summit, especially with Trump looming so large over it?",

      "sentences": "Rosemary, good morning. On paper, the APEC Summit is supposed to be this economic forum with 21 different world leaders. But obviously, the changing tone of Washington with the incoming Trump Administration and its America-first agenda is certainly going to dominate conversations with many of these diplomats, as they try to figure out a new world when it comes to both politics, economics.There are two conflicts going on, the Middle East and of course Ukraine, and how the Trump Administration is going to figure in on all of that. From where I am in Beijing, of course there is a lot of curiosity, a lot of interest in this meeting between Chinese Leader Xi Jinping and President Joe Biden. Really two things to look out for, number one, this meeting between the two leaders, China perhaps may be looking to symbolize to the world and to the incoming administration that it craves communication and stability because it wasn't that long ago that diplomats here in Beijing would spend many nights lying awake wondering what was next under the previous Trump Administration, during the first Trump Administration. There's no question there have been some tense times between the Biden Administration and China. We saw some very frosty moments when the balloon was shot down. But over time, things did cool down and we have seen regular diplomatic conversation and visits from the United States and China. In fact, just this year, we have seen U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen come to China, as well as National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan. These are the kind of discussions that Beijing would like to continue, but there's also a lot of concern that the tone and tenor may change if China critics such as Marco Rubio take office. So, the symbolism of this meeting will be significant. And then the other point to keep in consideration when it comes to China and the U.S., China will likely make a point, whether it be through speeches or through individual meetings, to let the world know that there is a heavy price to pay if you are heavily aligned with the United States and that it may be worth having a relationship with China, as China does try to establish itself as this alternative to the West. It certainly is making some very visible moves. In recent months, we have learned of Visa0free travel for some European nations coming to China. We also have learned that China is going to resume trilateral discussions between Japan and South Korea. These are very visible signs as China tries to let the rest of the world know that it too can be a player. Rosemary, of course, a lot of attention on the incoming Trump Administration, not just by China. We're also expecting to see world leaders from Japan, Australia, as well as the Prime Minister of India.",
