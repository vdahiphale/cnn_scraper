Let's bring in CNN's senior Vatican analyst John Allen, who is also in Rome.John, Pope Emeritus Benedict, I understand, left a letter. JOHN ALLEN, CNN SR. VATICAN ANALYST:  That's right. Happy new year to you. Pope Francis, like his predecessor, St. John Paul II, left behind what in the Vatican is called a spiritual testament, which basically it's his final message to the world. This is a very brief two-page missive from the pope emeritus. It was actually written in 2006, shortly after he was elected to the papacy in 2005. Basically he thanked a number of people, including his members of his family, his brother, Georg (ph), his sister, Maria (ph), who was his housekeeper for most of his life, his parents and so on. He apologized for any wrong he may have done to people over the course of his life. And then the last part of the letter was a sort of vintage Pope Benedict touch. The key theme of his thought and life in many ways was the relationship between faith and reason. That religious faith is not opposed to reason; it is instead kind of the peak of reason. It is compatible and it is the fulfillment of reason. And that was the message in the spiritual testament as well.",

More conservative or traditional Catholics, I think, will remember Benedict as a man who stood for the truth of Catholic teaching in a time of secularism and moral relativism. More liberal Catholics will see him as a tragic figure who tried to obstruct reforms in the church intended by the Second Vatican Council in the 1960s, that they would say are only coming to fruition now under Pope Francis. Some victims of clerical sexual abuse will see Benedict of the public face of the church's denial and coverup but others will remember him as the first pope to apologize, the first pope to meet with victims of sexual abuse, which he did in the United States in 2008. The first pope to begin expelling abusers from the priesthood and to write zero tolerance into the church's policy. Look, it is a complicated kaleidoscope of images. At the end of the day, I think Pope Francis has tried to put his figure -- put his finger not so much on the public figure but the private man of Pope Benedict, who, I think, anyone who knew him would agree with Francis, was a kind, gentle, humble, sweet figure.",

The new year and sushi. But first, Elizabeth Cohen looks at how close the world is to breakthroughs and treating serious illnesses, including Alzheimer's disease. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ELIZABETH COHEN, CNN SR. MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  A pipeline of new drugs might -- might -- provide some hope and relief to people suffering from certain medical conditions as early as 2023. One of the most anticipated new products is a drug which doesn't cure Alzheimer's but clinical trials show it appears to slow the progression of the disease by as much as 27 percent. Doctors say that could give patients a longer quality of life. But there are concerns over possible side effects, like brain swelling and bleeding. DR. RONALD PETERSON, MAYO CLINIC ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE RESEARCH CENTER: The people will remain stable at their current level of function for a longer period of time. Maybe six months, up to 12 months. And for people who are planning their life and dealing with day-to-day activities, this could be a very meaningful postponement of the deterioration of the disease. COHEN (voice-over):  Another possible breakthrough is in the works for a problem women have been enduring for generations. Clinical trials for a new drug shows it significantly reduces the severity and frequency of hot flashes. The oral nonhormonal treatment may be FDA approved early next year. Also by fall, researchers are hopeful an RSV vaccination will be available, especially given the wave of infections filling up hospitals this year. There are several candidates nearing review in the U.S. which could protect the very young and elderly, who are most susceptible to complications from this lung infection. On the COVID front, look out for a combination of a COVID and flu shot which could be available by next flu season. And the FDA is weighing an application to allow Narcan to be sold over the counter. That decision should come in late March. Industry experts say there's one thing that's almost certain for 2023: the cost of health care will go up one, with one survey predicting global health care costs increasing by 10 percent next year. Some costs impacting widely used products like COVID-19 vaccines. It's estimated the cost of vaccines could quadruple in the U.S. if the federal government stops providing them for free -- Elizabeth Cohen, CNN reporting. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
