That's tonight at 9:00 p.m. right here on CNN. Hello, again, everyone. Thank you so much for joining me. I'm Fredricka Whitfield. And we're following significant new developments in the arrest of golfer, Scottie Scheffler. CNN has learned that there is no police body cam footage of the incident that led to the stunning Friday arrest of the world's number one men's golfer. Scheffler says he was rattled by his arrest that he calls a real -- a big misunderstanding with police. It unfolded just before dawn yesterday outside the Valhalla Golf Club in Louisville, Kentucky. Scheffler is accused of injuring an officer who tried to stop him from driving through the scene of a fatal traffic accident outside the club. Scheffler was booked, put in jail temporarily, and is now facing four charges, including felony assault of a police officer. We've got team coverage from Louisville. Patrick Snell is covering the tournament for us and Gloria Pazmino is looking at the investigation. Let's begin with you, Gloria. You spoke with the mayor of Louisville about the incident and what are you learning?",

We know Scheffler and his attorney have said this was all a big misunderstanding. We know that Scheffler is, is cooperating with the investigation. He is been complimentary of police. But we also know that the police in their incident report said that Scheffler did not obey the orders of an officer that was at the site near the golf course, trying to direct traffic, following a car accident that had happened that morning. He did not listen to the officer, he proceeded towards the entrance of the golf course. And it was during that moment that the officer was dragged, he was injured, and he was taken to the hospital as a result. That's where Scheffler is getting the felony charge of assaulting a police officer. So, now, we're learning there is no footage of this interaction. There are other video angles from the area that the police are currently reviewing, but we do not have the beginning of the interaction. Take a listen to the mayor speaking to us just a little while ago. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And that really signaled the intent for his round, which was very impressive indeed, when you reflect on all he'd been through a fight under 66 on Friday for Scheffler to really power his way up the leaderboard. So, that was impressive in its own right. But, as I said, it's all about golfers in their routines, Fred. They like creatures of habit, they like to stay in the zone. And Scheffler was very quick to do that after his round on Friday. And we saw this very powerful imagery from videos. We saw him interacting with the fans, he's very comfortable with the fans. He's always very generous with his time, he was signing autographs. And also, the surprising imagery, surprising, yes, because he was actually talking with police officers as well. Maybe, we wouldn't have expected that given, as I say what had transpired earlier in the day. And then after his round, typical Scottie Scheffler, not just his trademark resolute play, but taking time out to speak with reporters afterwards. And then, reflecting on all he'd been through, a lot of players would have just completely backed away from that, not even come set foot in the media zone. Scheffler did that. He was very open. He was very honest at times. He was engaging, he was humorous, and he was especially thankful to be even playing on Friday. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

I just think they're not relevant anymore.\"Now, the question is, though, can this organization still help Donald Trump and the Trump campaign believes that it can. His organization has been meeting with political operatives for the NRA as part of this broader outreach to conservative groups, trying to get all their ducks in a row before the summer and fall. And -- but to the degree to which they can help is still in question. This organization gave Donald Trump or supported Donald Trump to the tune of $30 million in the 2016 election. It is not clear they have nearly that kind of money to spread around this cycle. But Donald Trump is coming here today to reaffirm that he is a strong Second Amendment supporter. He has previously told this organization that he would unravel all the policies that Joe Biden has done over his four years in office. And look, this is an area where there's a lot of contrast between the current administration and the -- and President Trump. He is someone who has said he wants to undo everything Biden has done, Biden has said. He will go even further and push for an assault weapons ban. So, this is something that's going to be a major talking point throughout the campaign and we're going to hear from Donald Trump later day for his pitch to voters in 2024.",

And I said, God, you know that I do not have a discipline for study. You know, so get (INAUDIBLE) out since 1959. So since you are sending me to learn more about you, then you're going to have to help me. And I was very specific what I wanted. I said, God, you're going to help -- you going to have to help me have the ability to steady, also open my mind so that I can receive and decipher information, and also be able to interpret what it is that the instructors and the Bible would be saying to me.
