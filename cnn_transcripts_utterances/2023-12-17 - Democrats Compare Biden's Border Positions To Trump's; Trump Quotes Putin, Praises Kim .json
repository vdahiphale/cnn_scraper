I'm Manu Raju.It's been a busy weekend on Capitol Hill where a handful of senators are pushing to reach a deal by tonight on immigration, a topic that's eluded Washington for decades. And hanging in the balance, aid to Ukraine and Israel. Since Republicans refuse to approve more aid without kinder immigration restrictions amid a surge of migrants at the southern border. Senate is due back tomorrow after Majority Leader Chuck Schumer delayed the start of senators' holiday recess and has pledged to put this all to a vote this week. But congressional sources tell me this morning, they are skeptical about being able to reach a deal given that sizable differences remain. Something that senators reiterated on the Sunday shows. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R-SC): The bottom line here is we feel like we're being jammed. We're not anywhere close to a deal. It'll go into next year.

And right now, they feel like the only way that they can get that additional aid to Ukraine is by giving to Republicans. Because Republicans -- the whole reason we're in this situation right now is because a growing faction of House Republicans. Some Senate Republicans have said that they're not going to support any additional funding to Ukraine unless they get these more severe restrictions on asylum seekers, on undocumented immigrants. And I know that everything's fluid and that's what I've heard from sources as well. But on what the Senate is potentially considering with the White House at the table saying they're open to it, the impact of those policies would impact the 11 million plus undocumented migrants that are currently living in the U.S., some who have lived here for years, married here, have children here. It would also impact asylum seekers. If those things were to become law, it would essentially eliminate asylum as we know it right now under the current U.S. law. So their dramatic immigration change is not just throwing more money at border security or border patrol, which is what the White House was initially OK with doing. And so because they want that Ukraine funding, we hear, you know, the administration feels as though they don't really have a choice but to be at this negotiating table.",

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. DICK DURBIN (D-IL): I am concerned about it. And I think it's an indication of the delicate position we're in on this compromise.

Pretty strong warning. Just look at the polls before you jump in, Laura. Look, the Hispanic -- among Hispanic adults, immigration and border security ranks second, 15 percent inflation ranking. The highest according to that recent CBS News poll. And also just the president's favorability among Latino voters. Right now, in a recent poll, 42 percent among voters. His -- the -- how the exit polls looked for him in 2020, 65 percent of Hispanic voters supported him. But will this make a difference? Do they want -- they're not -- it's not a homogenous community. Everyone's a much different view on this. But how does that impact that electorate? BARRON-LOPEZ: Right. Immigration typically is not the number one issue for Latino voters in the United States. It tends to rank second as that poll shows or third. And I was just talking to a pollster who focuses on Latino voters this morning who said that actually when you put the economy up against gun violence, gun violence takes number one among Latinos right now in a lot of battleground states. And so I think that, look, there's clearly an argument that President Biden can make when he starts contrasting himself with whoever the GOP nominee is. But, of course, he has to pay attention to those numbers because Trump is gaining marginally with Latinos.",
