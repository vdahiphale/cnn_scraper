      "sentences": "And breaking overnight, the New York Times is reporting Special Counsel Jack Smith is going to resign before Donald Trump takes office, planning to leave the job before he can be fired.And a massive explosion at a food coloring plant in Kentucky. 2 people are dead, 11 people are wounded, and now an investigation into what happened here. I'm Kate Bolduan with John Berman. Sara is out today. This is CNN News Central. Today, Donald Trump returns to Washington very soon this morning. He'll be meeting face-to-face with President Biden at the White House. This is tradition, the outgoing president inviting the incoming president for a private meeting. For both men, it's the first time that they're going to be in the same room since they faced off for the CNN debate that changed everything. It's not only tradition, it's a noteworthy one, as it's a tradition Donald Trump rejected after his loss in 2020. So, stand by for that. We're also standing by for Donald Trump's other big stops of the day, meeting with House Republicans and later Senate Republicans that are on the brink of picking a new leader. And if you blinked or decided to get any sleep, you likely missed a slew of Trump job announcements. Call it shock and awe. Call it fast and furious. Whatever you want, Trump is on a roll announcing administration picks. Among them, okay, let's start with maybe the least surprising, that Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy are joining the team. They will run a brand new government commission that they're trying to brand as a new department, a government-wide cost cutting project that could reshape the entire federal government and slash the workforce. Then there is the most surprising pick so far, what John Berman was getting at, Donald Trump announcing his choice for secretary of defense, Fox News Host Pete Hegseth, an army veteran, but his lack of experience running anything close to an organization of nearly 3 million people has even Republicans scratching their heads. Republicans like Senator Lisa Murkowski, saying simply, wow, in responding to it. Senator Thom Tillis, interesting. Senator Bill Cassidy, who? The more colorful take coming from a defense industry lobbyist to Politico, who the F is this guy? CNN's Alayna Treene is in Washington for us with all of the latest. So, Alayna, there were some substantial new announcements in cabinet announcements overnight. What are you learning about Trump as he's in route to D.C. right now?",

      "sentences": "Yes. Well, we learned that -- and this isn't that surprising. To be honest, we knew that Elon Musk wasn't going to have some big secretary, cabinet secretary position. He did not want to divest from all of his businesses and companies, but he is going to have a role in a second Trump term. And that is he, as well as Vivek Ramaswamy, Donald Trump's former Republican primary challenger, they are going to be focused on government efficiency. They are saying that they're going to be running a new department called the Department of Government Efficiency.I think if you look at the acronym there, it's D-O-G-E, play on doge, which is something Elon Musk, you know, in crypto business has been talking about, but all to say they're going to have a role that's not essentially inside government. It's a bit outside. It allows them to still have influence without actually being within, you know, Donald Trump's control. Now, it's interesting because this is always, when I talk to Donald Trump's team about Elon Musk's influence, we've talked a lot, Kate, about his growing influence with Donald Trump, seeing him at Mar-a- Lago essentially every single day over the last week, they said this is his way of still having some influence in a second term without fully having to leave his company and businesses behind.

Unclear whether he is boarded or not, unclear whether he will speak before he gets on and heads to Washington, but we will watch that closely.In the meantime, with us now, CNN Military Analyst Cedric Leighton. Colonel, thank you so much for being with us. Look, I'm of the firm belief that cable news hosts are qualified for anything, honestly. There's nothing we can't do. That aside, running the Pentagon, how complicated of a job is it? COL. CEDRIC LEIGHTON (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST:  Well, that would probably be one of the most complex jobs you could ever imagine, even for cable news hosts, John. And that's one of the key concerns, I think, in this particular case with Pete Hegseth. He is, you know, somebody obviously who has served and received two bronze stars for his service, one for his service in Iraq, one for his service in Afghanistan. But he's been working at the tactical level and not necessarily always in combat. So, his appreciation of what it means to be in the military is a bit different than it would be if he had more experience, if he had served longer, and if he'd been in the active force instead of in the guards. So, it's definitely a different kind of pick, and it's one where he's going to have his work cut out for him if he does actually get confirmed as secretary of defense.",

He's been very critical of what he calls the woke military, he's promised to get rid of any person involved with DEI inside the military. And he's spoken about his view of women in combat.

      "sentences": "Well, those could be huge, John. And here's the key problem with all of this. The Department of Defense has a promotion process, obviously, and it is a process that takes somebody through their entire career, from their time of commissioning all the way to their retirement, and really beyond. And if you start messing with that process, if you start changing people in the middle of their tours, it has a cascading effect. For every four star general that moves, you have about 50 to 60 people that move as a result of that move.So, that's just because we have a system that is basically an up or out system. And if you change the rules the rules of the game, then it becomes really hard to have an effective game. The people that are serving in these positions, many of them are now combat veterans. In fact, most of them probably are, at least in the Army and the Marine Corps. And that is something that is -- you can't get rid of that. You can't take that out of the military services regardless of what their political positions are, because it is an apolitical military and it needs to remain that way. Yes, that's the concern that many have that would politicize the role and force many of these generals and admirals to be political, to keep their jobs.

Even before Donald Trump won the election, he had vowed again and again from the campaign trail he would be firing Smith, quote/unquote, within two seconds of becoming president. CNN's Evan Perez joins us now. The question is, where does this leave us in this moment? Because we knew Jack Smith was in talks to wind down his cases. What do we know this morning, Evan?",

      "sentences": "Yes, Kate. Look, the mechanics of how that is happening, that is still being worked out. The Justice Department and Jack Smith have to come up with a plan. And they've said this in court filings.Now, the mechanics are important because, as you pointed out, Donald Trump has said that he wants to fire Jack Smith, and so if Smith produces a report and we expect that he will finish a report, you know, certainly before the January 20th, where that report ends up is going to be an important fact, right? Because one of the things that has to happen, you know, is for the attorney general to decide whether all of it can be released to the public and, if Merrick Garland is no longer the attorney general, then it's not clear what the Trump attorney general might do. Now, part of this discussion is whether the report has to be submitted to the intelligence community for approval, for them to approve all of the parts of it. That's a lot easier because they've already had those discussions because these cases were going to go to trial. So, the mechanics of this are very important, but they're also being worked out. Now, because Jack Smith might be done and his team might be done, doesn't mean that Donald Trump and his allies are done with Jack Smith. Because, as you pointed out you know, if he gets fired, we expect that this is going to be part of an investigation by Congress. And we could very well see Jack Smith having to testify before Congress in the new year, certainly as part of the Republicans look at what happened in this investigation. Again, a lot of these mechanics are still in the works and we don't know whether the attorney general, Merrick Garland, will sign off on everything that Jack Smith has in store or has plans for.
