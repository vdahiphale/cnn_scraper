One of the worst scenes of slaughter during the Hamas terror attack on Israel was at the Supernova festival, a dance party just 3.3 miles away from the border with Gaza. More than 3,000, mostly young people had gathered in an open field. It became a killing field. The site of a single biggest loss of civilian life in Israel's history. Over the course of about six hours, terrorists killed more than 260 people there. Many were slaughtered at the site, others were ambushed or hunted down as they tried to flee. We still don't know how many party goers were kidnapped, and how many of those people may still be alive, being held somewhere in Gaza. Hamas has posted hostage videos online and desperate family members in Israel have resorted to scrolling through jihadist videos searching for any images of their loved ones. Only now is the whole story of what happened at the Supernova music festival coming into focus. Using videos from multiple sources and eyewitness accounts from survivors, we've been able to document how coordinated this attack was, and just how brutal. Some of what you'll see tonight is tough to watch. But it is for now the most complete look at what took place that we've reported so far.
