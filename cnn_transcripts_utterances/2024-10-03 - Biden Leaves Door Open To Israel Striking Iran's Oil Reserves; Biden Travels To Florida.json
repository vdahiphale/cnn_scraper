A strike, a war and a natural disaster threatened to upend the race and remake the election into a campaign about who is more fit to confront crisis.Plus, a Republican with a headline last name hits the trail for Harris. Liz Cheney tries to sell voters. And why she says the country cannot afford four more years of Donald Trump. As Jack Smith shows the country new evidence alleging how the former president tried to undo democracy. And Melania Trump silent for most of the campaign, now speaking out on one of the most contentious issues in the race. In a new memoir and video, she takes a position directly at odds with her husband's party. But the government shouldn't tell the women what to do when it comes to abortion. I'm Manu Raju. Let's go behind the headlines at Inside Politics. Up first, the crises colliding with the campaign. A major port strike threatens to unravel economic progress that is critical to the Harris reelection argument. And then, there's this. Rock is again flying in the Middle East, an overnight strike by Israel in Beirut killing at least nine people. It's just the latest episode in a week filled with escalation towards all-out war. Let's go straight to CNN's Arlette Saenz, who is in Florida waiting for the arrival of President Biden. Arlett, the president spoke at the White House about what's going on in Israel and Iran. What does he have to say?",

There's the port strike, which could have economic repercussions that they'd have to deal with if it continues on for a long time. And then there is the recovery efforts after Hurricane Helene. That is where President Biden's immediate focus is today. He any minute now, is set to take an aerial tour of the Big Bend area of Florida. That is a region that was hit very hard by Hurricane Helene when it made impact here about a week ago. This is actually the second day in a row that President Biden is touring these devastated areas across the southeast. The president will be landing here in Perry, where I am, and then travel over to Keaton Beach, where he set to see the devastation in that residential community. Many of the homes there completely destroyed. Now, President Biden is not expected to appear with Governor Ron DeSantis here in the state today. The White House did not say if the two had spoken, but he has spoken with Georgia Governor Brian Kemp in -- as Biden's preparing to head to that state a bit later this afternoon. The White House right now is really focused on trying to show that they have their arms wrapped around the response efforts in Hurricane Helene, as so many communities across the southeast have been devastated.",

Look back to July, an assassination attempt, the change to the Democratic nominee. I mean, this race has been filled with sort of one whiplash moment after another.So, I do not believe that there will be one singular event that will change the trajectory and break open this really stubbornly close race. However, so many pieces now, so many challenges now are tied together. I mean, the hurricane effort is going to show the effectiveness of the government. So that's why we see President Biden there. Vice President Harris, already visited, is going back to North Carolina. The former president visited. He's going back. You have to wonder if some of these officials are going to be like, OK, you know, send help and money, but stay away. But at this point, this is going to become a -- yes, it's seven battleground states, but it's even fights for swing counties inside these battleground states, it's so close. So, the campaigns are focused on, A, trying to get their supporters out, and B, those sliver of persuadable voters there. But for all the talk of the October surprise. I like to think back to a bit of history. The phrase was coined in the 1980 campaign by Ronald Reagan's campaign manager, worrying about Jimmy Carter pulling an October surprise by getting the hostages released that would help him. Of course, that did not happen during the campaign -- every campaign. Since then, I think it's an overused phrase. I would be surprised if there's one singular surprise that could shake up this surprise --",

And now you do have early voting in so many -- in so many states already.What is it a half a dozen states already are in the process of voting. Ballots are out. People are making their decisions now. And the undecided block is smaller and smaller. It might be 10 percent. It might be 3 percent. So, in so many ways, this election is baked in the cake. The reason why these unforeseen events or uncontrollable events. I mean, what happens on the world stage or with mother nature, is beyond the control of any sitting president from either party, no matter what they tell you on the stump.

And that even though these voters may have some disagreements with her on policy matters, it is these fundamentals that are most important. She will have former Congresswoman Liz Cheney, longtime Republican up on that stage with her tonight here to bolster that message. The campaign also investing in this strategy with a new ad featuring, a man that supported the former president in 2016 and 2020. Take a listen. (VIDEO PLAYING) MCKEND: And Manu, it's not only here in Wisconsin, where they are touting this message. They have Republican surrogates fanned out across the next four days, across the battleground states. But listen, not all Democrats think that this is the best strategy. Some Democrats tell me that they think that the campaign should be investing instead in shoring up the base of the party and key constituencies core to the coalition. By comparison, the Trump campaign isn't employing something similar. They do have Democrats, former Democrats on the campaign trail for them, but there is no Democrats for Trump equivalent. But listen, I spoke to Wisconsin Democrats here, and they endorsed this strategy. They say that it is actually one that they use cycle after cycle.

Those independent voters in that Marquette survey, that's a very trusted poll. Harris is gaining significant ground on Trump in that.So, look, I mean, look at the numbers there. That is her biggest lead, really among any cohort. So, I think it does matter to a degree. A question I have, is she also going to sort of energize the MAGA base there as well. Liz Cheney has become, really a symbol of, you know, for the Trump folks, someone who they dislike intensely. So, you know, that's one of the questions. With all this travel going on, all the candidates going, you can sort of fire up the other person's base as well. But I am anxious to hear her remarks. This will be the most high-profile appearance of Liz Cheney. She has endorsed Harris last month. She's spoken about this a bit at Duke University last month, but she's never given a fulsome speech. I'm told she will introduce the vice president tonight, and just that image there on stage. It's nothing we could have imagined all that long ago.
