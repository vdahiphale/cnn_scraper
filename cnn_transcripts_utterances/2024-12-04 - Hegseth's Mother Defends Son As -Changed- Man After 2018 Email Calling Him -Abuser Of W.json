I'm Kaitlan Collins, live in West Palm Beach, Florida. And this is THE SOURCE. Tonight, all eyes are on Mar-a-Lago, on what has arguably been the most critical day yet for the President-elect's embattled Defense secretary pick, Pete Hegseth. Hegseth was back on Capitol Hill, today, where he was vowing to fight like hell to save his nomination, amid growing doubts about whether or not he can ultimately get enough Republican support to be confirmed by the Senate. For the first time, publicly, Hegseth directly addressed some of the most serious allegations against him, including sexual assault, excessive drinking and mismanaging veterans organizations that he ran. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) PETE HEGSETH, PRESIDENTIAL-ELECT TRUMP'S PICK FOR DEFENSE SECRETARY: What you're seeing right now with me, is the art of the smear. Take whatever tiny kernels of truth and there are tiny, tiny ones in there, and blow them up into a masquerade of a narrative. I owe an answer to the members of the United States Senate, who are going to vote for a confirmation here. And my meetings with them have been fantastic. No one has looked me in the eye and said, I have concerns, and I can't vote for you. In fact, most have said, Let's take a picture, and I'm behind you all the way. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And he's somebody who Trump not just beat, but trounced in those primaries, who -- Ron DeSantis is the person who the New York Post had put on their front page in 2022, as the Future, and that obviously did not last. So, I understand why, for Donald Trump, who we know likes this kind of a narrative, about people falling in line with him, this is appealing. And DeSantis would, I'm sure, get easily confirmed. He fits a lot of the Trump agenda. He has the same program that Trump has, on what he wants for the military, and fighting against what both call, the woke military and woke leadership.

Because no other Cabinet picks so far have been allowed to go in and do media. They've been told by people at Mar-a-Lago, Just wait until your confirmation hearing is over, focus on that, and staffing up your agency. What did it say to you that he came out and did that interview, earlier today? GRETCHEN CARLSON, JOURNALIST, CO-FOUNDER, \"LIFT OUR VOICES\": I think that this is a direct play to the Republican senators. I mean, it's the same reason why his mom went on Fox News. As Maggie just said, an audience of one. I actually think it was also an audience of female GOP senators. I mean, the mom twice said, during that interview, she looked straight into the camera and said, I'm speaking to you. And maybe that's because a lot of them have become skittish on this, right now. You have Cynthia Lummis, who, Monday said that she was 100 percent in favor of Hegseth. And then, after the new revelations came out, she has taken a 180. You have Murkowski. You have Collins. You have Shelley Moore Capito. You also have men now. I mean -- I think yesterday was a really poignant moment, because Senator Lindsey Graham, who is a big Trump supporter, and also has major influence with the Senate, he said he had many concerns. And now, tonight it's being reported that Mitch McConnell has concerns. So, it only takes three for this to not happen, if every Democrat votes no. It takes three Republicans.

CNN's John Miller served as the Deputy Commissioner of Intelligence and Counterterrorism for the New York Police Department, and has been working his sources for us tonight. And John, just first off, what are you hearing about this video, and if it does show the suspect carrying a battery for an e-bike, what cops are gleaning from that? JOHN MILLER, CNN CHIEF LAW ENFORCEMENT &amp; INTELLIGENCE ANALYST: Well, it shows that, as Shimon pointed out, they expanded their video canvas. They put it not just in through Central Park, but out the streets on both sides of Central Park, both before and after the shooting, hoping that they would get images of the shooter either fleeing the scene or maybe earlier, before that. So, they come up with video, Kaitlan, at around 05:15, in the morning, on the Upper West Side, a couple of blocks east of -- west of Central Park, where they see an individual, who they believe is the shooter. He's carrying what appears to be a battery for an e-bike. So that suggests to them that he may -- he may live in that area. He may have started out in that area. They believe he took the train to Midtown, where he either had that bike stashed or pre-positioned, so he could put that fully-charged battery on, and have it ready for the getaway.",
