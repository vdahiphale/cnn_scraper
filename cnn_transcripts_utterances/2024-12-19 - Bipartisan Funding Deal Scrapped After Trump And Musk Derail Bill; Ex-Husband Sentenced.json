      "sentences": "John, this is one of the moments where Donald Trump is not free from exposure in court. There are civil lawsuits against him that are very likely to continue on in the coming years as he's the president.So the standard here in court is that lawsuits against a president if it's about things that happened not for his official duties as president -- those continue on as long as they're not a burden to the presidency. So as long as they're not a time suck people can try and get information from Donald Trump. They could get evidence from him if things go into the evidence gathering phase. They could also force him to sit for depositions that would be under oath. So that also is something that could create some sort of civil exposure. The cases against him right now that are pending -- these are still in relatively early phases or phases where they're working out legal issues that won't require Trump to sit for a deposition. They include a defamation case from the Central Park Five accusing him of defaming them when he was campaigning this past year for the presidency. There's also eight ongoing lawsuits over the January 6 insurrection. A lot of questions of whether Trump will have some sort of immunity or not for what he was doing on the Ellipse on January 6. He doesn't have the type of immunity that he's getting in criminal cases. That's already been decided by the courts. And then the last bucket of cases is about what Trump was doing when he was president but to clear protesters from Lafayette Park who were protesting the death of George Floyd. There's a big question there of whether the Justice Department will be able to stand in for Trump and protect him in that case. But those are all ongoing. There's also some cases that he has where he's suing media outlets and the book publisher Simon &amp; Schuster. And so all of these will plod along. It's something to watch in the future. We have seen him be deposed several times in the past. Those depositions are not always public but occasionally they do come back to bite him a little bit. In the E. Jean Carroll case -- a case where he was sued for defamation -- he was deposed and all of -- a lot of what he was saying that was the most damaging to him in court was played at the trial, which he lost and there's an $88 million judgment -- million-dollar judgment out there against him.",

BAKARI SELLERS, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR (via Webex by Cisco):  Oh, I think Vice President Trump is just kind of figuring out how he's going to navigate the next four years while Elon Musk is President of the United States. I mean, the fact is you have these billionaires that are leading the House GOP caucus around by their nose. And this is great theater except for the fact that real American workers are going to be devastated if the government shuts down. They only have a few more hours before that occurs. And you have this game of political theater going on in Washington, D.C. with Mike Johnson, Elon Musk, Vivek Ramaswamy. People are just tweeting and giving their thoughts while at the end of the day if government shuts down a week before Christmas that's going to affect American workers. I think the great irony in this, John, and those watching, is that you have billionaires who are -- who are guiding this discussion while the House GOP actually had the audacity to say they speak for the middle class.",

Take a listen. This was an answer, by the way, to a question from NBC journalist Keir Simmons during this event.

First of all, I don't know when we will meet because he hasn't said anything about it. I haven't spoken to him at all in over four years. Of course, I'm ready for this at any time and I will be ready for a meeting if he wants it. (END VIDEO CLIP)",
