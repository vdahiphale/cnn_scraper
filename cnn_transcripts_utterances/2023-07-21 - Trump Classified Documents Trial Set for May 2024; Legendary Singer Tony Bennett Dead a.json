We look back on his legacy and his life, that and major developing stories all coming in right here to CNN News Central.And we begin this hour with major breaking news in the classified documents case against Donald Trump. A trial date has now been set. The stage now set for federal court appearances as he runs for the White House. CNN's Senior Legal Affairs Correspondent Paula Reid joins us now. So, Paula, this is certainly not the trial date that the special counsel's office was hoping. What more can you tell us?",

      "sentences": "Well, at least it is a trial date, because defense attorneys had argued that it was too soon to even put a date on the calendar.Rahel, the central tension in the case right now, the central conflict between the defense attorneys and prosecutors is over the timing. Prosecutors, including Jack Smith, have said that they want a, quote, speedy trial, which is why they wanted to take this case before a jury in December. But the defense attorneys argued in court Tuesday before this same judge that it would be, quote, unfair to put the former president on trial at any time before the 2024 election. So, here, the judge split the difference. She put a trial date on the calendar for the middle of May 2024. She also offered a very detailed schedule for when things need to happen. There is a lot going on in this case. It is complex. It deals with a lot of classified discovery and there's a lot of discovery overall. Now, former President Trump's lawyers have also noted how they have several other cases that they are working on. So, she set out a detailed schedule for when she wants everything to happen. But it is possible, highly likely even, that this date could slide. Because when we were in court Tuesday, the judge was pressing the defense attorneys to give her more guidance, help her to understand how long it was going to take them to go through some of the discovery. They have hours and hours and hours of surveillance footage. And they have tens of hundreds of thousands of documents to go through, and they said that they wouldn't even be able to give her the guidance until November. So, we would not be surprised to see in a few months the defense attorneys try to push it back, and that's really the strategy for them, right? Get a little delay here, and another little delay there, try to push this so far into 2024 that they might be able to successfully make an argument that the former president cannot be put on trial so close to an election. But, Rahel, when we were in court Tuesday, this judge, she was not interested in any arguments from either side about Trump's status as a candidate. Prosecutors said, look, it does not matter if he is a candidate. He's no longer the president. He should be treated like any other busy American. Defense attorneys really took issue with that. She basically, said, I don't want to hear it. I am focused on how long it is going to take you to do the work to get to trial. So, we will be watching to see if it sticks. But I think in November, when those lawyers have a better sense of how long it is going to take them to prepare for trial, we could see them push for at least one more delay.",

There are certainly plenty of people, Kate, who were directly involved in what we found was an intentional multipart plan to obstruct the joint session and prevent the transfer of power. So, there are any number of people that could be included conspiracy.So, one of the challenge for Jack Smith is how broad to charge a conspiracy beyond the leader of that conspiracy, the former president.",

He gave us really important information in the form of his text messages all the way from before the election post- January 6th. But then he would not come in for an interview. I mean, we actually referred him to the Department of Justice for potential criminal prosecution.The special counsel has leverage. The special counsel has the ability to bring criminal charges and use the looming prospect of charges as leverage to get people to cooperate. That's what prosecutors do in all kinds of cases. I am not sure, Kate, whether that has happened in this matter, and Mr. Meadows has assessed his culpability and provided information to the special counsel that he wouldn't provide to the select committee. But if so, that would be huge, because he was right in the center of all of those prongs of this multi-pronged plan to disrupt the transfer of power.",
