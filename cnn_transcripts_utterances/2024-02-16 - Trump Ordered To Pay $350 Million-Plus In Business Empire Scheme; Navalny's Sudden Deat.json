For decades, Donald Trump built a brand as a self-made billionaire, king to an empire of excess luxury, brashness. It's the core of his identity and it's why voters said that they were attracted to him in the first place. It got him into the tabloids, onto the silver and the small screens, even the admiration of the hip-hop world. But tonight, the gold has shattered, a judge in New York ordering Trump to pay more than $350 million for business fraud. The judge says that the offenses shock the conscience, of course, talking about how Trump and his company inflated the value of their assets to get better loans. The punishment could erase his entire stockpile of cash. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

We called out his temperament. We called out his judgment. We called out his knowledge of foreign affairs, and all of those things came true.

And all of those things have come true, all of those negative things that we forecasted. Unfortunately, folks didn't necessarily listen, we put him in office. Now, we're facing an intimate and tragic and existential threat for democracy in this next election.And I think that what Trump does when he's cornered, when he wants to show that he has some power, when he wants to rally his base, is he does attack people in a very negative and mean way, whether it's calling people names, whether debasing their character, whether it's calling them a flat out liar. And it is always people of color that he seems to have a special kind of penchant for in terms of women of color who come after him, whether it be Fani Willis or the district attorney in New York, whether it be other folks of color, like The Apprentice alum who also spoke out on his behalf, to let folks that know that he wasn't the right leader at the right time.

And speaking of, if you're wondering what Donald Trump's reaction to Navalny's death was, you're looking at it, nothing.Joining me now is Stanislav Kucher. He knew Navalny personally and was the first journalist to interview him for Russian T.V. Also with us, Max Boot, senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations and a Washington Post columnist. Stanislav, you have known Navalny for quite a long time. His saga with Putin and this last period of time in which he's been imprisoned, it went slowly and then suddenly all at once. What are you thinking in this moment as now we learned he is dead? STANISLAV KUCHER, JOURNALIST AND FORMER RUSSIAN T.V. PRESENTER:  Well, first and foremost, I'm thinking that somebody asked me today if this was surprising or shocking or not surprising, but shocking, not shocking or surprising, definitely, it was not a surprise. I mean, the man has been tortured for three years now. First he was poisoned, and then he was arrested and kept in prison. He's been taken to a solitary confinement at least 27 times now. So, he has been tortured. I mean, this could happen literally any day. And so when President Biden says that it's Putin who is responsible for his death, well, yes, that's absolutely true, no matter whether there's been a direct order to kill him today or he died of that clot that the medical reports are talking about now. So, I'm basically thinking of -- honestly, I'm having very sad feelings, of course, not only because I knew him personally, but because this is the darkest day for millions of Russians who've lost hope. Today, I've been receiving many messages from my friends in Russia saying, it's not Navalny who just died, it's the hope that died. And that's bad news for me because I know Alexey would not love to hear that. He would not like to hear that, because his main message to Russians was don't be afraid. He liked FDR's words, the only thing we have to fear is fear itself. But fear is what is all around there.",

And then she writes that she -- she writes that she'd been crying all day and then she had this meeting she had to go to so she walks down the street and sees another woman with also -- who had obviously been crying. And they kind of look at each other and nod their heads and that's how people express their solidarity with each other. People cry in their kitchens, people cry in their homes, but they cannot express their feelings in public. Also, you know what happened to -- you said that in your intro, what happened to the mourners? Today, people brought flowers to an improvised memorial to Navalny near a monument to Gulag victims in Moscow. And later all the flowers were taken away by the police. And a few hours before then, a similar memorial to Boris Nemtsov, another Russian opposition leader who was assassinated in front of the Kremlin on February 27th, 2015.

That's because from the hours of 7 P.M. to 11, when most of the programming centers around the quote, unquote, Biden crime family, there were zero mentions of it. Zero. It's like the past eight months never happened. Repeat, repeat, then rinse. And for more on this, I want to bring in Democratic South Carolina Congressman and National Co-Chair of the Biden campaign, Congressman James Clyburn. Congressman, we appreciate you being here. With these FBI charges, will Biden be able to put these accusations behind him? Or are you concerned that the damage has already been done? JAMES CLYBURN (D) SOUTH CAROLINA:  Well, first of all, thank you very much for having me. No, there's been a lot of damage, and I think that's one of the reasons we've been seeing these lagging polls on behalf of Joe Biden. But the damage is has not gotten to the point of being irreparable. I am going to do everything I possibly can to reach into those communities where I know some of those have taken hold. And I'm restarting that come this Sunday, going up to New York. I'll be going into Pennsylvania, down to Georgia and really trying to do my part to make sure that we get the truth out there. Cuomo, some time ago, talked about this guy who was going to be this tremendous witness. And it turned out to be an armed dealer that they cannot find. Brashly came out with this guy, and now he's been indicted for having lied to the FBI. All of us are aware that this repetition that has been going on for years now must be confronted. We cannot let it just hang out there. And that's one reason several weeks ago I started raising my voice pretty loudly and regularly to combat this. We saw what happened to Hillary Clinton. We must not allow that to happen to Joe Biden.",

He has passed legislation to get children back in school, to get businesses re- opened.He has provided a job -- unprecedented jobs, closed the wealth gap, put people's health care at an affordable rate, doing the things that are necessary. But enough of us have got to get out there explaining to people what has been done because social media is a great thing. But social media have in many instances been that thing that has caused us the most problems. So, we've got to use social media and we've got to have validators out here. Tucker Carlson over in Russia, what was he doing over there but undergirding Donald Trump? We see every night on Fox News and other places, Marjorie Taylor- Greene, all of these people saying things that just aren't true. We've got to combat that. We've got to confront that. We just cannot say, well, nobody's going to believe that. Because believe me, some people do believe that stuff. And so, that's why I think it's very important for us to step up our game, become more active, get more people out here on the street. And be sure that we connect in ways that we have never connected before because this campaign this year will be the most consequential election since 1876. What was going on January 6th of 2021 is exactly what took place in this country after the presidential election between Samuel Tilden and Rutherford B. Hayes. That election brought an end to Reconstruction. That election also ended Jim Crow, and they were trying to repeat the same thing. So, I'm going out here every place I possibly can, and I'm going to tell the story. And remember, those two events, the end of Jim Crow came about because of one vote. The end, I'm sorry, the end of Reconstruction came about because of one vote. And the vote to start Jim Crow was a vote of eight to seven. And one vote.",
