      "sentences": "Hello, you're watching CNN \"Newsroom\". I'm Max Foster in London. Just ahead the latest on the fighting in the Middle East where Israel says it struck the residence of Hamas's Leader in Gaza. Then new British Foreign Secretary David Cameron makes a surprise visit to Kyiv.Vowing the U.K. is ongoing support to Ukraine amid the conflict in the Middle East. And U.S. President Joe Biden calls China's Xi Jinping a dictator again -- we'll go live in Beijing with reaction. Despite growing condemnation, a U.N. Security Council resolution calling for urgent humanitarian pauses, Israel is pressing on with this operation into Gaza. The IDF claims this operation at Gaza's largest hospital has yielded concrete evidence that Hamas used the facility as, \"A terror headquarters\". On Wednesday, the IDF published video what it says was combat equipment inside the hospital. CNN can't independently verify those findings. Gaza's Hamas-run Government Media Office accuses Israel of fabricating that evidence. Meanwhile, the U.S. President says he's confident that Hamas was running a command center under the hospital calling it a war crime. Joe Biden also discussed negotiations to free Israeli hostages held by Hamas. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "Well, Max, you know, this is a crucial moment in this military operation inside of Gaza. As we have reported for days and weeks. The Israeli military has really said that this area around the Al-Shifa hospital is one of the crucial areas that from where the Hamas military authority kind of runs its operations out of it.They describe the area in and around and under this particular hospital in the heart of Gaza City as the command and control structure of the Hamas military operation. And because of that, that's why they say despite, you know, widespread condemnation from around the world as to how Israel has managed the ground operations inside of Gaza. They felt that is militarily it was a justified attack on this area because they were going after Hamas military structures and command area so that's why this has been such a focal point of this military ground operation inside of Gaza. Yesterday afternoon, Israeli military released of some images from an -- where MRIs were conducted, where they say they found weaponry and military equipment, computers and that sort of thing. But so far, there has not been any revelation of some massive command and control area that they have discovered or so far released. Now a Senior Adviser to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says that more and more information will come to light as this operation, military operations and fighting goes on and continues around the Al-Shifa hospital. But so far, they have just released a little bit. Israeli officials say that more information that they say will prove that concrete evidence in their words, that this kind of military apparatus exists within Hamas around that hospital there, Max.",

      "sentences": "Look Max, there has been widespread condemnation of this raid on the Al-Shifa hospital as we know there are hundreds of patients still in the hospital, there are hundreds of medical staff still in the hospital. And while the Israeli military has said it is targeting Hamas positions that he believes there is a Hamas command and control center beneath the Al-Shifa hospital.Crucially, of course, as Ed mentioned there in his reporting, that hasn't been part of the evidence so far released by the Israeli Defense Force. There is still widespread concern about civilians who are being caught up in this raid and then the ongoing bombardment taking place around the Al-Shifa hospital and of course around other hospitals, in and around Northern Gaza, as well. Of course, we've heard from the World Health Organization Chief warning that there are concerns of its civilians, patients and of course medical staff on the ground Al-Shifa that they have lost contact with their teams. There we ourselves have been finding it extremely difficult to try and gather information from within the hospital because of difficulties. With communications around Northern Gaza doctors are unable to share the realities of what they all facing at this current point in time. We did hear from one doctor speaking during the initial hours of the raid in the early hours of Wednesday morning describing the terrifying situation that patients and medical staff were facing. You could hear the gunfire and shelling, as described by the doctor in the background of his -- of course, we've been hearing from a Palestinian journalist inside the edge of a complex describing the walls of the hospital is shaking from the weight and power of the shelling in the vicinity of the complex. Now, of course, CNN hasn't been given independent access to the Al- Shifa hospital. We cannot verify the claims put out by the Israel Defense Force nor the claims put out by Hamas who have said they believe this evidence provided has been in there was a lie from the Israel Defense Forces. But again, we are hearing those testimonies from people on the ground, civilians on the ground, as well as international humanitarian organizations who have been reiterating the message that the priority here needs to be the protection of civilian life and that message has been reiterated for days if not weeks, we are seeing the civilian death toll mounting as we know about one of Gaza's hospitals, Northern Gaza's hospitals rather are now in operation. That means civilians in search of or rather needing urgent medical care are facing horrifying circumstances. We're hearing from doctors saying that they are carrying out surgeries without anesthetic. And of course, as we know, as you heard there and Ed's reporting, that raid is said to be ongoing. This isn't a one day operation. And as this continues, that concern for civilian life is only mounting, Max.",

The Chinese economy is slow growing, there's a youth unemployment issue, very difficult for young people to find jobs, there's a housing crisis. So the one thing that Xi Jinping needs to do is to let the rest of the world know that China is open for business. And that's a big reason why he's at APEC. Last night, he was at a dinner where several prominent American business leaders were there, including Tim Cook of Apple and Elon Musk. And in fact, let me just read a direct quote, he said China is willing to be a partner and friend of the United States. China wants international dollars. China wants foreign investment that includes from the United States. So the fact that he was able to make that message very clear in front of a room of very influential people is something that Xi Jinping wanted to accomplish in the Chinese government as a whole. We'll have to see how that transpires. But that was a big point of interest for Xi Jinping.",
