What will Monday's trip to the border by Mayorkas entail? Well, the Department of Homeland Security calls this trip an operational visit regarding ongoing southwest border enforcement efforts. They also say Mayorkas will meet with Customs and Border Enforcement Protection personnel. Including Border Patrol leadership as well as local officials. As divided as Democrats and Republicans are when it comes to immigration, something most agree on is that urgent measures are needed to address the situation at the border. That's what a local sheriff, a Democrat, told me just before Christmas in Eagle Pass, Texas. And that's also what Denver Mayor Michael Johnston, also a Democrat, said Sunday.",

And some members of Congress are taking steps to come up with an agreement with that goal. There's no agreement yet, but this issue is tied with a larger supplemental package that would include funding for Ukraine and Israel. A package the president would very much like to deliver to those countries. In an interview with Fox News on Sunday, Texas Governor Greg Abbott said he's confident his state will prevail against the lawsuit filed by the Biden administration, which is trying to stop a new law that makes it a state crime in Texas to enter the state illegally. Abbott essentially says that because, in his view, the federal government is not enforcing immigration law, the state of Texas is obligated to do so. This is how Abbott explained it. GREG ABBOTT, (R) TEXAS GOVERNOR: The law already prohibits the mass allowance of people getting out and wandering the country for years before they ever have to go to court. The Biden administration simply is not enforcing that. They must hold the Biden administration responsible and deny them the ability to have catch and release.",

      "sentences": "Behind the scenes, House Republicans are planning an aggressive push to potentially impeach Alejandro Mayorkas sometime in the next several weeks, potentially in the first quarter of this year. This is according to new reporting from my colleagues Melanie Zanona, Annie Grayer and myself. We are hearing that House Republicans are growing increasingly confident that they can have the votes to actually impeach Mayorkas.This is a shift from some time ago when there were a lot of Republicans who simply did not know if they what they believe were essentially a policy dispute with the Biden administration rises up to that very high bar in the Constitution of high crimes or misdemeanors. And a charge that has not been leveled against a cabinet secretary since 1876. Only one other time in history. That was the Secretary of War William Belknap back then. Alejandro Mayorkas could be the second because of how House Republicans are going after what's considered a crisis at the southern border. This uptick in migrants crossing across the southern border. And what Republicans believe is Mayorkas' failure to deal with it. Now, what is shifted here is a view among some of the swing district Republicans. We talked to several of them saying that they are open to the idea of impeaching Mayorkas. Some of them said they are fully on board. Like Congressman Anthony D. Esposito of New York, a freshman Republican who told me that he absolutely should be impeached. But there is still a very narrow margin for Speaker Johnson to get this through. Johnson will have to contend with a very narrow majority that is getting even slimmer with a resignation upcoming. As well as with his top deputy, Steve Scalise, is going to be out for health reasons for the next month. So, he'll have to limit his defections, but actually to only one vote if it comes down to it. And one Republican we are told, Ken Buck of Colorado, told us that he believes that going down this path could be a dangerous precedent. He's not opposed to impeaching Mayorkas but vote counting will be central here. Now the Homeland Security Department is pushing back on this, saying the House majority is wasting, quote, valuable time in going after Mayorkas. They point to what he has done at the border and they say that impeaching him, charging him with a high crime is simply out of bounds. It simply does not line up with what is actually happening on the border. But the House GOP controls the majority and immigration has become a defining issue in 2024. One issue that is unifying Republicans, which is why many of them believe it is more likely now that Mayorkas would get impeached than Joe Biden. Where a lot of Republicans simply say they have not seen the evidence yet to suggest that Joe Biden committed a crime while in office. And so that issue is continuing to play out the investigation into Biden. But Mark Green, the chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, tells us that he expects a handful of hearings not to go on and on and on about the Mayorkas impeachment. And that potentially an impeachment vote in his committee bypassing the House Judiciary Committee. That is the plan at the moment, taking it straight to the floor. But will they have the votes to get there? That is the main question. This remains a big focus for House Republicans as they return to Washington. Manu Raju, CNN, Washington. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

She had been in her home for five days, trapped under furniture in between levels of her two-story home.We are told that they were able to get her out. They put her in an ambulance. And according to one doctor who talked to NHK, which is Japan's public broadcaster, the woman is able to speak, but she does have some physical injuries. We also heard from one rescuer who just talked about all of the elation that occurred when she was found. But conditions are very difficult. First of all, we have weather. It has been miserable for the last few days. Looking at the days ahead, it may be improved. Not as much rain, not as much snow, but it's certainly been an issue. But the broader challenge in all of this, and we talked about this from the very start, is infrastructure. First of all, we have roads that are cracked, so it's just not possible for vehicles to get in and out of that hurricane zone and to bring supplies, and supplies are needed. One local grocery store in this area opened over the weekend. There, of course, was a line, but there was a limit on how much rice individuals could buy, which, of course, is a big staple in the Japanese diet. But it shows that it is difficult to get these necessary rations into these areas. Power has still been an issue, as well as electricity. So right now, rescue workers are trying to come up with a plan of attack because thus far, these infrastructures have just become very challenging. And then another issue that is emerging is people who are out of their homes. As we saw, many of these homes were simply flattened because they were older constructions. And so now we are hearing from people who are having to make plans about where to stay. We heard from someone in their 80s. They have plans to stay at a particular apartment for three months, but then after that will likely have to go. So that is going to be a very big problem, a very big challenge, Max and Bianca, facing the Japanese government in the days, if not weeks and months ahead.",
