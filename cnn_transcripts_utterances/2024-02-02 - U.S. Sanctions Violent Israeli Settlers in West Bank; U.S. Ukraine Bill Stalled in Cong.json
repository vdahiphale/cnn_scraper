Now, that's what they've attacked in the past, but it tells me there, there's probably going to be more than just kinetic activity.

And in particular, Houthi fighters in Yemen, who are now firing indiscriminately on shipping, it seems, in the Red Sea, has sparked some complaints from one of Tehran's most important allies, and that's China. So take all of this together. Does it play into what the U.S. military response will be? That military response, which could happen at any moment now. It has to. And that's what I was getting out when I talked about the diplomatic response. All of those considerations are part of what they call the primaries committee, when the primary officials of the administration meet, talk about the different aspects of this fight. What is an advantage for the United States and what do they have to be careful of in terms of alliances. You saw the Iranians appear to pull back a little bit, based on some input from Iraq. And I think that was driven by diplomatic efforts between the United States and Iraq, saying that, hey, you've allowed these PMFs, these mobilization forces inside of your country, they're now out of control. You need to get them out of control. And I think Iraq's government passed that message onto the Iranian government. You got to remember the Iraqi government is a Shia-led government. Their prime minister is a Shia. So they're talking to their Iranian border countries about what they should do and what they need to avoid in terms of the continued fight against ISIS.
