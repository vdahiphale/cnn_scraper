      "sentences": "Thanks for joining us. Slovakia's prime minister has been fighting for his life after being shot five times in an attempted assassination. Robert Fico is expected to survive according to the Slovak deputy prime minister who said his condition is no longer life threatening, but he remains in hospital. The controversial leader who is 59 had been holding a government meeting in a central Slovak town prior to the attack, which does appear to be politically motivated.The gunman was arrested at the scene and no one else was hurt. The shooting has caused tremendous outrage both inside and outside of Slovakia which has been dealing with a deep political divide. Fico is a known Kremlin sympathizer who made sure Slovakia stopped sending weapons to Ukraine. CNN's Clare Sebastian is following all of these developments. She joins us live from London.  Good morning to you, Clare. So, what more are you learning about the Prime Minister's condition and how all this unfolded? CLARE SEBASTIAN, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Yes. Good morning, Rosemary. I can only resume I think the most important thing as you say is that the surgery -- the hours long surgery that he underwent on Wednesday seems to have gone well, according to the country's deputy prime minister. And looks like his medical situation has been somewhat stabilized after he was said to be fighting for his life at one point on Wednesday. He was shot according to Deputy Prime Minister multiple times, once through the stomach and other time through the joints in their words. But again, that surgery seems to have gone well. In terms of how this unfolded, well, it was -- you can see here in the video in broad daylight. He was at a government offsite meeting in the town of Handlova which is a couple of hours drive to the east of the capital Bratislava. He was then meeting and greeting people outside this meeting when these shots rang out, of course, the security detail bundled him in -- into their car. You can see from the images, that he was already struggling to sort of move independently. And he was taken first to a hospital in that town and then eventually airlifted to another nearby hospital with a trauma center. So that is how all this unfolded in terms of the suspect where there was a person immediately detained by police. We don't have a lot more details on that person at this moment. But then in a press conference by the country's defense and interior ministers, they immediately came out with a motive calling this a political assault really making the point that they felt that this was a political assassination attempt. So, we expect to get more today from police. And we'll watch as these details unfold, and especially, of course, about the Prime Minister's condition post-surgery.",

So, it's a highly polarized society right now. And on top of that, you have a politician stirring up, emotions stirring up stirring up hate yesterday, even though president and a number of politicians of course called for calm and for appeasing the tensions. The problem is that a number of coalition leaders accused media, journalists and the opposition of causing this. So -- and we already see attempts at different disinformation outlets to put the blame on the side of the opposition in media. So, I would definitely say what led to this is a polarization.

Last two years ago, we had a terrorist attack against a queer club in Bratislava. Also, a politically motivated 2018, we had two journalists murdered.

We now know and have lots of limits. We know that President Putin told President Xi that while he was going to do this little incursion into Ukraine and it only took a few weeks, and everything would be over quickly. She's got to be a little suspicious of that. President Putin himself doesn't like being the inferior member of these two. I mean, remember when also the union met the Chinese and the 50s and 60s and 70s, there was no question that the Soviets were the bigger power.

But certainly, everybody takes it more seriously than they did before.And that's because the trade between Russia and China has soared, as the oil and gas that would have been sold to Europe is going to China. And as the Chinese supply more dual use parts to Russia to help get around American sanctions. The Chinese have not supplied arms so far. For the Ukraine war, they've technically stayed neutral.
