According to the spokesperson for Navalny, Kira Yarmysh, she has posted on X today that the Investigative Committee in that region has extended the investigation into his death for an indefinite period. They don't know when it will be finished. They have previously said that until that investigation has finished that they will not be releasing the body and no official cause of death as of yet. Separately, we heard from the Kremlin as well today confirming very briefly without as is tradition mentioning the name Navalny, Dmitry Peskov saying that an investigation is quote, underway. So it's all a little cryptic, seems a little unclear at this point, but no sign of the body as of yet.

You're joining me now in the middle of Moscow, right outside the FSB headquarters where you can see people are still coming in, there's a lady just done that man. Some more people over here. They're coming to pay their respects to offer sympathy and condolences to the family and friends and the organization of Alexei Navalny. These are all the flowers that have been put down so far. Just go ahead -- and as I say, this is a monument to the victims of repression during the Soviet period. And so it's interesting that this is the place where people have chosen to come and pay their respects to Alexei Navalny. There's a photograph of him here, somebody is laid that. People are putting traditional red roses, children's picture over here, saying on the tombstone there, Alexei Navalny -- which means hero. And that's how, of course, many people in this country see him her as. Now, just the act of putting that flower on this memorial is risky in a country like Russia, because all kinds of dissents, all kinds of political opposition have been crushed by the Kremlin. And even though people are doing this now, it's not large numbers, but as I said -- flows, you can say, shows just how angry and how much people are sort of braving that repression to come out and put these flowers on this - - Remember, across the country, hundreds of people have been dragged from these snowy parks, in towns and cities across Russia, and taken away and detained for doing exactly this. And so it is a huge risk that people are taking, because there's a whole line of people coming here now, a huge risk that people are taking to come out and pay their respects to Alexei Navalny, Russia's most prominent opposition figure.

Soof the eastern town of Avdiivka in Donetsk, that's after Ukrainian troops withdrew. Now Russia also appears to be building up its forces along the front lines and Zaporizhzhia, for example, in the south, some analysts say a Russian force of up to 50,000 troops as gathered. Fred Pleitgen is on the story for us today. He is in Berlin, but you've been in and out of Ukraine, of course, reporting on this story for now, what is nearly two years the anniversary of the beginning of Russia's war in Ukraine just a week or so away?

They certainly believe that theywere going to be able to hold on especially to argue for a little and maybe even a lot longer than they actually have been one of the things about Avdiivka though it's a very small place. It's kind of a suburb of the very large town of Donetsk, the main town in Donetsk Oblast. It was also nearly encircled by the Russians for quite a while the Ukrainians were able to hold on however, the Russians had been pounding the place for quite some time. But I think there's several things that we can see now, that certainly are really significant for how the future of the battlefield could shape up and you mentioned a lot of them just there, Becky. Right now, the Russian is pressing on several fronts pressing, for instance, in that area of Zaporizhzhia, as you said, which is the place where in last year, the Ukrainians attempted that massive counter offensive, which of course, in the end fizzled. Now, it seems as though the Russians are pushing back on those areas. And then across the eastern front line, there are two things that really stand out. And that is that the Ukrainians are badly outgunned, of course, very difficult for them to get enough ammunition from the NATO allies that have been pledging to send ammunition but of course, the main thing is that US AID has dried up. And that's really something that you can feel on the battlefield and that we could also see when you went to frontline Ukrainian positions. And the other thing is that the Ukrainians are also very badly outmanned, as well. The Russians have a lot more soldiers who are on the front lines, the Ukrainians have had difficulty getting enough people mobilized to go to the front lines and fight there. So right now is a very difficult battle for them. And some of the numbers of the Ukrainians have been putting out had been quite staggering where they said that in order to get Avdiivka, the Russians have expended thousands, if not tens of thousands of soldiers to try and take that place and hundreds of tanks and armored vehicles. So apparently comes, huge casualties to the Russians. The other big thing that appears to have changed is that the Russian air power has become a lot more prevalent, the Russians have managed to allow their bombs to fly a lot further than they have in the past, leaving them out of range of Ukrainian air defense systems, at least in the battlefield area, so that's definitely very difficult for the Ukrainians to cope with, Becky.",

The area that U.N. says is now the most sort of populous place, densely populated place in the world, not only to put pressure on the civilians there. Although the government here says, they will get the civilians out of the way to safety. But what we saw over the weekend, civilians leaving the Rafah area where they've been hiding out in tents, trying to sort of stay warm and dry, and got caught in bombing elsewhere, so even leaving the area of Rafah, no guarantee of safety. But this is also pressure the government's putting on Hamas by giving it a deadline and saying you need to, you know, succumb to the our position on the handing over of hostages, you need to accept our terms for whatever kind of ceasefire we the Israeli government are willing to offer. And also they've been talking about, you know, where is Yahya Sinwar, the Political Leader of Hamas suggesting here that he is sort of absent that he's no longer really in command that Hamas is looking for another leader, all of which Hamas is just knocking down and saying that's not true. But by setting a deadline on Rafah, this really ramps up, attempts to ramp up negotiating pressure on Hamas, but the Israeli government is very clearly intent to move ahead militarily. And of course, this is causing massive concern internationally, it doesn't matter which NGO or U.N. department you speak to, they all have massive concerns, because the people there really have nowhere to go. They are already short of food, their medical facilities available to them that ever shrinking you've just mentioned in the Al Nasser Hospital, a second largest in Gaza effectively, you know, out of bounds to Palestinians for treatment. So all of this is causing massive concern, but a call for a ceasefire, but no one seems to have enough pressure internationally to actually get Israel and its government to change course, Becky.",

      "sentences": "OK, well, Becky, you know, atmospheric rivers provide about 50 percent of California's precipitation throughoutthe course of a year. This is yet another atmospheric river but what it's doing is adding to the De Luz that this month and previous months this winter have seen so far across the state, in fact some locations including Los Angeles chasing their wettest February on record. And this is the result of that heavy rain when you combine that with its steep terrain in the mountains. You get landslides, you get rock slides, and those are obviously extremely dangerous that can close roadways, isolate communities. Here's that moment when it happened overnight in the Del Norte region in California. Now when we talked about some of the wettest February's on record, we only have a few 100 millimeters to go really before we reach that record in Los Angeles. So this is significant. We are well above average for San Diego, Los Angeles, Santa Barbara, over 200 millimeters in some locations. And it's all thanks to this atmospheric river. What is that? Well it is in a river of moisture or water vapor in the upper levels of the atmosphere. What that does is it picks up this moisture and water from the ocean and deposited as rain and heavy snowfall into the mountain ranges of the West Coast. This time it's aimed at California. You can see the rain better in Los Angeles, there's the snow with the shading of white, that's the Sierra Nevada mountain range. We could be measuring that in feet, not in inches here going forward. So nearly the entire state under some sort of flood alerts that shading of red just to the west of Los Angeles, that's Ventura and Santa Barbara Counties. They're under flash flood warnings because we are getting the consistent rainfall and it is running perpendicular to the mountain ranges that are located across this region. So the atmosphere, almost pushing a wet sponge against the wall, kind of extracting that available water producing the rainfall, especially on those hillsides slopes. The rain continues in the day tomorrow, focusing its attention on the San Francisco Bay area but for today, it's really Santa Barbara, Los Angeles to a lesser extent but certainly some minor urban flooding. And along the northern coastline there you can see storm totals anywhere from 100 to 125 millimeters going forward. So there's a snow it will extend inland. There is also a lot of wind associated with this. We could see gusts in excess of 100 kilometers per hour on some of those higher elevations. So a stormy starts, Becky to say the least.

Youremember COVID, that bizarre time in our lives when you had to keep apart from your mates when hand sanitizer and toilet paper were in short supply and when being negative was a positive thing. But if that seems like a distant memory, the W.H.O. is urging us not to forget, because two years before COVID-19 emerged its Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus warned at the World Government Summit in Dubai that the world was not prepared for a pandemic. Last week standing on the same stage reflecting on everything that's happened since then he said we were still not prepared. He said, and I quote, the cycle of panic and neglect is beginning to repeat. The painful lessons we learned are in danger of being forgotten, as attention turns to the many other crises confronting our world. But he said if we fail to learn those lessons, we will pay dearly, next time. And that is why Dr. Tedros told me, he thinks we need or he knows we need, he says, a global pact for governments to coordinate on a future pandemic response, what the W.H.O. calls a pandemic accord. He explained what that would look like and addressed concerns over a disease x, in what was an exclusive interview that I have with Dr. Tedros, have a watch.
