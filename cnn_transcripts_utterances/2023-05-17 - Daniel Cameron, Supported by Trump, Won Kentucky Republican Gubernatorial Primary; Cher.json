He was endorsed by Trump real early in this race. He already previewed his lines of attack against Governor Beshear. We can expect to hear about crime, fentanyl, public schools, workforce participation.And though Cameron is a rising star in the Republican Party, he spoke at the Republican National Convention in 2020. This is not going to be an easy road ahead for him. Governor Beshear is popular in the state, Democrats feeling really confident. I spoke to Republicans over the weekend, Trump supporters, who also support the governor. So, that is what Daniel Cameron is going to have to contend with in the months ahead. I should also note that Cameron has earn the ire of Democrats across the country. All these lawsuits that he's participated in or brought in his capacity as attorney general, and then also his response in the Breonna Taylor case. Democrat, progressives, many others feel as though he did not adequately seek justice for Breonna Taylor. So, all of that is going to be in play in this governor's race where we will see, probably, John, a lot of money spent here in Kentucky.",

Eve McKend, grateful for the reporting live from Kentucky for us.Let's move to Pennsylvania now and more potential history in the making. Philadelphia voters are one step closer to electing their 100th mayor and their first woman mayor. Cherelle Parker clinched the Democratic nomination last night after running on a platform to hire more police and to invest in Philadelphia's working-class neighborhoods. She is all but assured to win in November because Philadelphia is such a heavily Democratic City. Julia Terruso of \"The Philadelphia Inquirer\" joins me now. Julia, walk us through. Who is Cherelle Parker and why does this matter?",

She ran with a lot of the establishment support from the party, and she won with a lot of support from black Philadelphians. She carved out a slightly more moderate, you know, platform in the race, which like so many big cities, a big focus here was crime. But, you know, she's also talked a lot about raising her 10-year-old son and how she's advocated for police reforms.So, likely, you know, I talked to voters who said they like the balance she struck there. And as we look ahead, she's been a strong supporter of the party. She backed President Biden in 2020 and actually hosted Vice President Kamala Harris at a Get Out the Vote rally back in 2020. So, in addition to inheriting a city with a lot of challenges, she'll certainly be looked at by the party as someone to turn out the vote in a key city for them.",

That if it flipped, it would have cost the Democrats their majority there.Again, that's a place the Democrats won by 2020 -- 22 points yesterday. Joe Biden carried it by 25 points the last time. Those of us in Washington sometimes try to look at elections yesterday and project them into next year. I want to be careful about doing that. But does this tell us that the Democratic formula, big turnout in the cities, the African American base, and then performing well in the suburbs, that at least the -- if you're the Biden campaign, you can think -- we think our blueprint is still in place?",

What we can't deny is that these effects have or these rulings have massive effects. The fact that the justices stepped in last month to preserve nationwide access to mifepristone, the same way that they wouldn't preserve access to abortion to Texas in September of 20201. The same way that they kept allowing President Trump to carry out policies the lower courts had blocked.You know, folks are going to disagree about whether these rulings are right are wrong. But what's happening now more than ever is that these rulings are having massive effects and we don't know why. We don't know what the rational is. KING:  And so today, three judges will hear this case not really knowing whatever they decide is going to get appealed up the chain of the Supreme Court. So, you'd think they would like some guidance. This hearing is because of what the Supreme Court did. You think they would at least like, could you give us a road map. And you write about that in the book, in deciding so much while saying so little, the justices are not only failing to provide adequate guidance for lower courts and government actors, but also exacerbating charges of political partisanship. So, those three judges today don't understand and if again, to your point, if you have a stake on this issue, whether you want the drug banned or whether you want the drug left widely available, you're thinking, you know, are they playing games here?",

But one of the points you make, I think, that's really interesting is that the Trump team -- Trump legal team sort of saw how this was working. And they, in my term, put it on steroids. They say, we can take advantage of this. We may lose some cases in the end, but we can keep our policies in place for months if we -- or longer, if we get the Supreme Court to go along with us in the meantime.And so, we've seen this upheld. The military trying to ban transgender Americans, reinstate federal execution, blocking New York COVID restrictions, declining to block, as you noted, the Texas abortion ban, keeping Title 42 in place. Talk about that. How the Trump people -- the solicitor general's office realized, we can do business here that was outside the norms of the way that office normally operates.",

During the Bush and Obama administrations, two very different two term presidencies. The federal government only asks the Supreme Court for this kind of relief, a total eight times in 16 years, once every other year. And most of those are not divisive. The court doesn't have to sense, it's just one way or the other.Trump goes 41 times in four years. And I think part of what happened is that that familiarity, that repetition made what used to be exceptional, like the Cambodia bombing case become routine from the justice's perspective where it never really occurred to them that from an institutional perspective, from separation of power perspective, this really was not a healthy way to be deciding these cases. John, especially when without written opinions, all we can look at is who won and who lost. And it just so happens that in the mind of these cases, it's Republicans winning and Democrats losing.",

Where the Biden administration keeps having these applications denied.John, even in cases where is like the Remain in Mexico case last year, the court ultimately rules for the Biden administration. That's why this is dangerous because it looks like the best explanation for why Trump gets emergency relief and Biden doesn't is the partisan veils of the dispute.

Number one, committed to America PAC. He's putting his foot out there. This is going forward and it appears to be. Number two, trying to reset around the idea that Ronald Reagan should really be the north star of the Republican Party, not Donald Trump, or maybe anyone but Donald Trump is maybe what he's saying. And number three, we saw him dabble a little bit in return to financial policy in the Fed and bank and what the Federal Reserve should be doing.
