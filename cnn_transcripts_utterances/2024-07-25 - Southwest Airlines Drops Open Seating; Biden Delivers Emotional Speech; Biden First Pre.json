This open seating policy, you know, first come best seats approach is something that Southwest has been known for, for all of its 50 years. So, this is a big change for the low-cost airline. And it's all about making more money.Southwest has been under pressure from activist investors who want to see changes in management and higher profitability. They used to be the U.S.' most profitable airline, but that's not the case anymore. In fact, they just posted a roughly 50 percent drop in profits. So, these changes will hopefully, they think, allow them to make more money on premium seating. So, assigned seating allows them to make some seats premium. This is something that their competitors, like United, American, Delta have been doing for a while now. Now Southwest will be able to do that. They're also going to be offering overnight red-eye flights for the first time. They say this will increase efficiency. They'll be using the planes more. And they hope that - you know, they say that customers have been clamoring for these issues and that when people switch to another airline, the number one reason they give is open seating. So, they hope that this will attract more fliers, newer flyers, and more flying from the people who are already customers.",

Now they're zooming in to the speaker there. After her husband passed the torch, Jill Biden there at the Olympics. It's been a very emotional time for the Bidens.All right, this is just in, President Biden very proud of something that's happened just now, touting new GDP numbers, saying they, quote, \"make it clear we now have the strongest economy in the entire world.\" And he also name-dropped Vice President Kamala Harris. The economy grew 2.8 percent in the second quarter, more than expected. President Biden added in a statement, \"the vice president and I will keep fighting for America's future.\" Joining us now, former chief of staff to then Senator Joe Biden, Susan Platt. Also, presidential historian and Rice University professor, Douglas Brinkley. Thank you to both of you for coming on this morning. Susan, I just want to get to - you know Biden. You have spent time with him. How hard this was for him to give up the race for the presidency, surrounded by his family, having to make those remarks? SUSAN PLATT, FORMER CHIEF OF STAFF TO THEN-SEN. JOE BIDEN: Well, I think it shows the character of this man, you know, the legacy of this president will be long. His love of family and selfless - selfless service to this country and never give up spirit is unsurpassed. His perseverance was never failing and the opportunities he created, as we've just heard, throughout his legislative achievements in the last 50 years, will not be forgotten. And he's told us he's not done yet. It was an emotionally powerful speech. And one of great political self-sacrifice to set the stage for the next generation of leaders to choose hope over hate, as he told us. The contrast yesterday between Joe Biden and Donald Trump was so stark. Biden has always had such pride in this country. It's not a stupid country like Donald Trump would suggest. By saying that, Donald Trump insults all Americans. And I know we all feel that. And, of course, I have layers of feelings about him leaving the race. He's a man who has set such a high standard, an example of statesmanship for me personally and for our nation. And he proves character does still matter. And he told us now we have a choice between yesterday and tomorrow. The gift of the future. I think his ability to get back up and stay the (ph) course through extraordinary personal tragedy has inspired me, particularly in the last two years, as I grieve the loss of my own husband after nearly 40 years. So, I think he thought of that, continuing to unite his party with the endorsement of Kamala Harris. That was a - that was big in his mind. The threat that this country faces. He has a history of giving qualified women a platform, as he did with me, opening the proverbial door for talented women. And, you know, it was not normal to have a woman chief of staff in the Senate in the '90s. And he gave me that opportunity. And I think he thinks that if he recognizes it's time to - to step out of the doorway for his vice president to walk through. And she has. And I think what he has done is really -",

And I know you know this, but I want to remind our viewers of a last time a president decided not to run for a second term, the year was - it was in the 1960s, the president was LBJ. Let's listen to what he said and how he did it. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) LYNDON B. JOHNSON, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT (March 31, 1968): Accordingly, I shall not seek, and I will not accept, the nomination of my party for another term as your president. (END VIDEO CLIP) SIDNER: So, you saw that there. That was from March 31, 1968.

Both at this stage in time they were running for re-election and had about a 38 percent approval rating. Very much like Biden's. But those two presidents, we pull back now, decades later, and we rave about how good they were. We look at George Herbert Walker Bush, a deal with the breakup of the Soviet Union and German reunification and handling loose nukes and liberating Kuwait and apprehending General Manuel Noriega. And you look at Jimmy Carter, and they start piling up, you know, Camp David, human rights, Panama Canal Treaty, first president to recognize the Peoples Republic of China, creation of superfund sites. The list is long, saving more of - so much land in Alaska for preservation, so much that it's the size of California.But both Bush and Carter couldn't - couldn't finish out because the public didn't understand that they were doing so well.
