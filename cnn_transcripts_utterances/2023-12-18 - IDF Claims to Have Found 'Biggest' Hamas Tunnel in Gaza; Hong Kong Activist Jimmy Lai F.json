His second trip to the country since the October 7th attack by Hamas. A U.S. official says Lloyd Austin will meet with Israeli officials for updates on the war, but he's also expected to press them to define specific operational milestones and work to drill down on efforts to boost humanitarian aid to Gaza. His visit comes as the Israeli Defense Forces says it's uncovered the biggest Hamas tunnel in Gaza, wide enough to drive a large vehicle through. That tunnel, which the IDF says was secured, quote, \"a few weeks ago,\" was made public on Sunday. An Israeli military spokesperson describes what the IDF says it found. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REAR ADMIRAL DANIEL HAGARI, ISRAEL DEFENSE FORCES SPOKESPERSON (through translator): So far, we have uncovered more than four kilometers of the tunnel's webs. This is a flagship project of Hamas. It reaches a depth of 50 meters below the surface of the earth. Inside the tunnels, we found many weapons. This is no ordinary tunnel. It is a city of terror underground that Hamas dug and built, instead of investing money in the residents of Gaza. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

In the past, we've seen tunnels that the Israeli military has discovered, where individuals would have to walk single file in order to get through them. Very narrow. But this one is quite wide. In fact, wide enough to drive a large vehicle through it, according to the Israeli military. It reaches up to 50 meters underground, and it's equipped with everything from electricity to ventilation and communication systems. The Iraeli military says that it is part of a broader network of tunnels that spans two and a half miles, or about four kilometers. This tunnel didn't actually cross into Israel, but it appears to have been used by Hamas within the Gaza Strip. And it comes out very close to one of the key crossing points between Israel and Gaza. And that is the Erez crossing, which was also a key site that Hamas militants attacked on October 7th and then crossed into Israel from there. There's no evidence at this point that this tunnel was used as part of that October 7th attack. But the size and the scale of this tunnel just shows the capacity that Hamas had to build these large networks of tunnels --",

Lai's anti-Beijing newspaper was forced to shut down in 2021, following his detention in 2020. He's being tried under Hong Kong's sweeping national security law, facing multiple charges of colluding with foreign forces and a separate charge of sedition. The maximum penalty is life in prison. CNN's Kristie Lu Stout is following the story from outside the court in Hong Kong. Yes, the -- it's a high-profile trial. It really is putting the spotlight on China's control of Hong Kong. Walk us through the case. KRISTIE LU STOUT, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT/ANCHOR: Michael, here in Hong Kong, I'm standing outside the West Kowloon Magistrates' Court for day one of the national security trial of the media mogul and very high-profile China critic Jimmy Lai. Outside the courtroom, security is tight. Authorities have warned against any disruption. Inside the courtroom, Jimmy Lai was seen wearing a gray suit. He appeared calm. He was surrounded by at least four corrections officers who were guarding him. He also smiled and waved at supporters inside the courtroom. A number of people inside Hong Kong and around the world are watching this trial very, very closely, because it's seen as a test, a test of Hong Kong's freedoms and judicial independence in the wake of the national security law, which was imposed by Beijing on the territory in 2020. Watch this. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) STOUT (voice-over): Considered by many as a father figure to Hong Kong's pro-democracy movement, Jimmy Lai always knew his actions might attract the ire of authorities, but he didn't let it phase him. JIMMY LAI, FORMER CHAIRMAN &amp; FOUNDER, NEXT DIGITAL: I think it's a good idea any time, any situation that you are in, to fight for your freedom. Because without freedom, you have nothing left.",

Voters in Chile have rejected their new draft constitution to replace an existing one, the holdover from the dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet. Electoral officials say, with nearly 100 percent of the votes counted, more than 55 percent of people oppose the change. Around 44 percent were in favor. Chile had already rejected a proposed constitution last year, written by a left-leaning convention. The new proposal was even more conservative, though, than the existing one. Chile's president says there will be no third vote. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GABRIEL BORIC, CHILEAN PRESIDENT (through translator): our country will keep its constitution, because after two referendums on two constitution drafts, none of them was able to represent nor unite Chile's beautiful diversity. The country was polarized. It was divided and on the sidelines with this clear result. The constitutional process did not channel the hopes of having a new constitution that was written for everyone.

CNN's Anna Coren brings us the story of just one of those Afghan girls. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ANNA COREN, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): In a small, dimly-lit room in the outer suburbs of Karachi, Pakistan, a 15-year- old girl we'll call Arzo lays on a cot. With eyes closed, she slowly inhales. Her skeletal frame rises slightly, an action causing pain and an enormous amount of effort. \"Don't worry, you'll be fine,\" says her mother, kissing her hand. \"We are with you always.\" Her older siblings, who asked not to be identified for security reasons, smuggled her in from neighboring Afghanistan five months ago, following a series of events that would irrevocably change the course of their lives. \"We don't try to force her to remember what happened,\" he says. \"But once I asked her, and she replied crying that she was tired and had given up all hope.\" But Arzo didn't always feel this way. Seen here in pink, dancing on cell phone footage, the teenager was happy, studious and had big dreams to one day become a doctor. But that all changed in August 2021, when the Taliban retook control of Afghanistan after the U.S. withdrawal, following its 20-year war. And one of the first edicts the Taliban enforced was a ban on female secondary education. \"She would say, I hope we move from this place,\" explains her sister. \"I don't want to be here. There is no education.\" Over the following months, her mood darkened but nothing that alarmed her family, until one day in July this year. \"She came into the room, and I saw her eyes were abnormal,\" she says. \"I asked her what had happened, and she said she'd drunk acid. I didn't believe her, so I put my fingers in her mouth, and she vomited up blood.\" Arzo's sister said she had drunk battery acid in their home in an attempted suicide. A trend that is spiking amongst teenage girls across Afghanistan, according to health professionals and human rights groups.",
