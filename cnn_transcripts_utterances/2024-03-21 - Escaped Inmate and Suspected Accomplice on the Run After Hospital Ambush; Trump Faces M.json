I'm Kate Bolduan with John Berman. Sarah is out today. CNN News Central starts now. Breaking overnight, they are dangerous and they are armed. A manhunt for two men involved in a brazen ambush that freed an inmate who was allegedly a white supremacist prison gang member. Three corrections officers were shot during a transfer from a hospital. Now, there's a warrant with a $2 million bond and an urgent chase for Nicholas Umphenour and Skylar Meade, who was serving time for shooting a sheriff and had tattoos representing the Aryan Knights.

WHITNEY WILD, CNN LAW ENFORCEMENT CORRESPONDENT:  Absolutely, John, because the big concern for law enforcement here is if they're willing to shoot a police officer, they are willing possibly to shoot anybody. And so that is why the urgency here cannot be overstated. Let's talk about Skylar Meade, and I'll just give you the context here of who Skylar Meade is and what was going on in this moment that this brazen shooting happened. Skylar Meade was serving time in prison. He wasn't even supposed to be out, John, until 20:36, serving time in prison for aggravated battery on a law enforcement officer. Again, as you mentioned, he's a documented member with the Aryan Knights. This is a white supremacist prison gang that began in Idaho in the early to mid 1990s, according to the Department of Justice. He -- basically, what happened here, John, is that while he was in custody, he was taken to the hospital for self-injurious behavior. When prison staff evaluated him, they determined that he needed to go to the hospital. And it was as he was being discharged, as he was preparing to leave the hospital with law enforcement with these officers from the Idaho Department of Corrections, that's when, police say, Nicholas Umphenour, his associate, busted in, began shooting and was able to help Skylar Meade escape in this 2020 Gray Honda Civic. Here's how law enforcement described the location that Skylar Meade was in at prison. This gives you some context about what police believe that was necessary in order to keep him away from other members of the prison population. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And when we look at these situations, that's one of the first things we look for, signs of organization and planning, because it tells us that this was something in the works for quite some time.It also tells something about the offender. This is a guy who has the kind of mental, organizational abilities and discipline to pull something like this off. It requires all sorts of things. You have to have friends, you have to have people, you have to have access to a network of people who in this case are willing to put their own lives at risk and attack law enforcement to get him out. You have to have the ability to communicate surreptitiously with those people. Most of these prison escape plans fall apart at the planning stage when prisoners do things like talk on monitored telephones to people outside of prison who they need to help them. Those calls are, of course, always monitored, and that's usually when these sorts of plots are uncovered, but not this time. This guy seems to have done a really adept job at talking to the right people, setting this whole thing up, enlisting the support of people who were willing to assault law enforcement and potentially die in the conflict.",

They are going to, with the help of intelligence analysts, understand this person, Skylar Meade's network, who are his known associates inside prison, outside of prison, family members, maybe former work associates. They're going to identify locations for all those people. They're going to start to identify communications facilities for those peoples. So, those are telephone numbers, email accounts, social media accounts. And they're going to start monitoring all of the places and individuals who might help him in this escape. This particular escape is greatly complicated by the fact that Meade is a member of a white supremacist prison gang called the Aryan Knights. So, he has access to a group of people that are committed to these sort of crimes and willing to die for him.",

But this right in the wheelhouse of what group like this does, right?The Aryan Knights are a prison gang. They were kind of started in the Idaho correctional facilities. As of 2021, they were estimated to be about 100 members strong. They engage in all sorts of activity in prison, like drug trafficking, illegal gambling, engaging in intimidation, violence, assaults on other prisoners, things like that. In 2021, everyone there, the head of their organization, a man named Harlan Hale was actually convicted and pled guilty to a RICO account offense, which is significant because it's a public acknowledgment of the fact that he was running a criminal enterprise, the Aryan Knights, and he is now serving a life sentence in a federal penitentiary. So, this is a group of very hardcore, violent, experienced individuals. Part of problem with prison gangs is they are not just in prison. Once you join a gang in prison, after you leave, you're still affiliated with that group, still have loyalty to the group. So, clearly, what looks like happens here is Meade is relying on likely other Aryan Knights members in the community who've helped him plan this escape.",

You either allow the people who won the lawsuit, in this case, the New York Attorney General's Office to come in and collect, or you put up that amount of money to assure them that you have it and continue your appeals.Right now, Donald Trump is taking the appeal route. Not only does he want to appeal that final judgment and the loss of his case, he's appealing to try and get a court's intervention in New York to put a pause on him having to put up the money. He has the assets in that he says he has the real estate that would cover about $500 million, half a billion dollars for a bond. But the people that he's going to, the companies, insurance, or underwriters, they are not willing to give him a bond of that amount and would require him to put up not real estate or any assets he has, but cash. That's a lot of money in cash. And so Trump has said to the court, he's having trouble. He's asking the appeals court for intervention. They still could step in and do something. But Letitia James, the attorney general, her team also is writing to the appeals court and they're saying, this is getting to the end of the line. He has some options here. He could try those, asking insurance companies to come together and pool enough money for him to post the bond, or he could provide more evidence. He could put his real estate holdings with the court. They, though, are making quite clear when Monday comes along and that money isn't there in a bond or given to them, they are ready to move and put liens on his assets.",

Katelyn Polantz, thank you very much for all that. Developing this morning, a different money story involving Donald Trump, this one, political fundraising. Brand new fundraising reports show that the Trump campaign has half the cash on hand as President Biden's campaign. That is a big, big gap. CNN's Isaac Dovere here with the latest on that. You know, cash on hand is one of the most coveted things in politics, Isaac. EDWARD-ISAAC DOVERE, CNN SENIOR REPORTER:  It is. And for Joe Biden, the fundraising is continuing at a pretty high rate. It's all building up to what will be a -- what may be the biggest fundraiser ever that's going to feature Barack Obama and Bill Clinton at Radio City Music Hall with him next week. But for Donald Trump, he is scrambling to raise campaign cash. There are signs from the Trump campaign that they feel like they've been more successful lately. He's also building up to a big fundraiser. In April, $250,000 a ticket for a lot of that, and then there's a chairman level that's $814,000 of donations to get there. But that's all coming as his leadership PAC that's supposed to be spending money to help him get elected president spent more money on legal bills in the last month than it did on -- than it brought in overall. There is a lot of money that is needed to run a presidential campaign to do things, from advertising to hiring campaign workers. And so far, Joe Biden is keeping a big edge over Donald Trump on all of that.",
