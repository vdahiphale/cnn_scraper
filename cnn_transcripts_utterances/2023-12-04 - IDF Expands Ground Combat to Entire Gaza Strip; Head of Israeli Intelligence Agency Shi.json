No negotiations between Israel and Hamas this morning with each blaming the other for the breakdown.And the dire warning from former Republican Congresswoman Liz Cheney. Why she says America is sleep-walking into a dictatorship. Good morning to our viewers in the United States and around the world, I'm Kasie Hunt, it's Monday, December 4th, it's 5:00 a.m. here in Washington and it's noon in Gaza where the Israeli military says they have expanded ground combat operations to the entire territory north and south, following the collapse last week of the truce between Israel and Hamas. The IDF saying this morning it has now hit about 200 Hamas targets in Gaza from the air. Israel now warning civilians to leave large parts of Gaza, including neighborhoods in the south.

      "sentences": "Sure, Kasie. So, it refers to the 1972 Munich Olympics where 11 members of the Israeli Olympic team were killed by members of the Black September Palestinian terrorist group. Now, a couple of them were killed in the initial attack, the rest were killed during a botched rescue effort by the west German authorities.And in the wake of that, Prime Minister Golda Meir authorized what was called Operation Wrath of God. Authorizing Israeli operatives to hunt down Black September operatives and masterminds responsible for that attack wherever they were in the world. Now, it was shelved after a year or so after a case of mistaken identity led to Israel mistakenly killing an innocent man in Norway. But that is what the head of the Shin Bet; Israel's equivalent of the FBI is getting at. Of course, Munich also made into a Steven Spielberg film in 2005 based on those events. But that is what the head of the Shin Bet is getting at, saying that Israel will hunt down those responsible for the October the 7th terrorist attacks wherever they are, saying and citing Gaza, the West Bank, Lebanon, Turkey and Qatar, and particular, interesting, of course, that Qatar being mentioned, not because we don't know that, that is where some of the Hamas political wing is based. But because, of course, Qatar very much involved in negotiations and mediations to try to get those 137 hostages that remain in captivity, in the Gaza strip, who were abducted during that murderous rampage of October the 7th, remain. And Israel, of course, very keen to see them freed. Kasie?",

      "sentences": "I think that's the constant concern, is that whatever kind of red lines the Israeli military and Hezbollah have established for this ongoing border conflict, that it could escalate. For now, it does seem to be a bit of an artillery duel across the border. So, those mountains over here, this is Lebanon, and we've been withinthe last hour watching Israeli shell strikes in kind of the hills and valleys in the distance there. Puffs of smoke coming up, and it's kind of a constant sound in this region of impacting Israeli artillery, thudding in the hills and valleys around here. And something that people have been living with really for a month and a half. Now Hezbollah has claimed responsibility for a number of strikes across the border in the last 24 hours. The Israeli military has said that three Israeli soldiers were in fact, as they put it, likely injured and evacuated after mortar fire in Shtula on the Israeli side of the border. That's one of the areas that the Hezbollah militant said that they targeted at around 1:00 a.m. local time. Hezbollah says that at least, three of its fighters were killed on Friday and Saturday by Israeli strikes. There is not -- you don't see the level of the intensity of the violence and the death that we've seen in Gaza. Which is such a densely-populated area. Many of the civilians in both the Israeli and the Lebanese side of the border in these border communities have evacuated. They have places they can go to, unlike in Gaza, where people are fenced in and there's nowhere, really they can run to. But one of the consequences in this town, for example, Marjaayoun, which is predominantly Christian, the schools have been closed for more than a month and a half. So, you have the teachers who are working as Red Cross volunteers right now, and everybody is really on a war footing. They're living with this reality right now, but of course, worried that this could blow up into something much bigger. We have not seen the levels of violence that Hezbollah and Israel were engaged in, in 2006, which left much of southern Lebanon and southern neighborhoods of Beirut in ruins from much more powerful weapons in Israeli airstrikes.

And of course, if there's any go-between channels which can suggest that there could be movement from either side. Israel offering Hamas or Hamas offering Israel perhaps a little bit of leverage on their strategic objectives and immediate goals here. But it's going to take a concerted, holistic effort and all of those things coming together, because right now, they're on such different pages. Kasie.",
