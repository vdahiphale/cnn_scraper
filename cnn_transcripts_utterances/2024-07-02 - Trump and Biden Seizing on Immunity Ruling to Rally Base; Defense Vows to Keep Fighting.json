I'm Erica Hill in New York.The Supreme Court rules Donald Trump celebrates and President Biden issues a dire warning to a divided nation, and we have new reporting to start this hour. The court's conservative majority's historic decision granting Trump and other presidents criminal immunity for official acts while in office. The case, of course, resolved -- or revolved rather around the federal charges accusing Donald Trump of trying to overturn the 2020 election. President Biden warning Monday night decision has upended the rule of law and will have dire consequences if Trump returns to the White House. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN, U.S. PRESIDENT:  This nation was founded on the principle that there are no kings in America. Each of us is equal before the law. No one is above the law, not even the President of the United States. Today's Supreme Court decision on presidential immunity, that fundamentally changed for all, for all practical purposes. Today's decision almost certainly means that there are virtually no limits on what a president can do. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "Yes, Erica. President Biden is really trying to use the Supreme Court ruling on immunity to try to turn the attention back to one of the central arguments of his campaign at a time when his team is still grappling with the fallout from last week's halting debate performance. Now, the president spoke here at the White House, his first speech here since the debate and since returning from Camp David, where he spent a few days with his family, who is encouraging him to stay in this race.The president spoke for just under five minutes, using a teleprompter and taking no questions. But he did issue dire warnings about what this ruling means for the power of the presidency. He said that this ruling will simply embolden Trump to do whatever he pleases whenever he wants. And the president really tried to use this as a rallying moment for those who are opposing Donald Trump, saying that they should show their dissent at the ballot box in November. But it comes at a time when the Biden campaign is also pushing back on Trump's legal team saying that they'll challenge that hush money verdict following this immunity ruling. A campaign spokesperson last night saying, quote, at the end of the day, Donald Trump is a convicted felon precisely because he believed he's above the law and was willing to do anything to gain power. That's why he's a threat and must be defeated. Now, even as the president was out there speaking publicly on this last night, behind the scenes, his campaign has been fielding calls from Democratic lawmakers and anxious donors who are concerned about what Biden's performance at that debate could mean in November. There, Democrats are awaiting polling to Biden's own reelection chances, the chances of Democrats who are running in competitive House and Senate districts. That is something that one congressman, Mike Quigley, pointed to today, saying that the president would need to make this decision for himself, but also needs to think of the broader impact you could have on other Democrats running for Congress. So, there are still many questions going forward for the Biden campaign about the path forward, but for now, they are insistent that President Biden plans to remain in this race, even as there is much Democratic angst within his party.",

      "sentences": "Well, the legal team for Donald Trump is already saying in this letter to the court in New York that the things that Donald Trump said and did while he was president, those shouldn't have been able to be part of the trial. They had said that, Erica, before the trial even began to the judge. And he said, no, we're going to take this piece by piece. And he ultimately let things into the trial, like tweets Donald Trump sent when he was president, testimony from his close adviser, Hope Hicks, for instance, who testified about statements Trump was making while he was in the White House. There was some other testimony about how Trump liked to sign checks whenever he was the president or looked at them.But the case is really about the 2016 election before he was president. And so while the court may look at this, and there is always the possibility that an appeals court or another court could say, yes, cut out those pieces of evidence from this trial, they still would look at the whole record of that case. And it takes quite a lot for any court to throw out the conviction of a jury. So, we're just going to have to see how it plays out. Trump's team wants it to potentially not only get rid of the conviction that he faces in New York State court. They are also potentially hoping that it could delay his sentencing date of next Thursday. We'll see how that plays out as well. We're probably going to see that coming in the coming days, what the court is going to say on that, on timing. Does he get sentenced on July 11th? But, of course, it's not just the legal side of things that is playing out here for Donald Trump and all of his team. He also is sending out truths on the political points, another attack by crooked Joe Biden against his political opponent. This is really bad and incompetent guy, wanted to deflect from his horrible campaign performance. Erica?",

The Supreme Court's ruling could potentially impact the classified documents case in Florida and perhaps most directly the criminal case against Donald Trump in Georgia, where he is accused of illegally trying to overturn that state's 2020 election result. Why is Georgia such a focus? Well, because, as Katelyn was just noting, some of the evidence there in that case could be thrown out. Joining me now, former U.S. Attorney Michael Moore. So, you personally have some real concerns about this, what it could mean. How do you see it playing out in Georgia?",

      "sentences": "Yes, I'm glad to be with you this morning. You know, I do think the ruling has broader implications that we're just talking about as it relates to Judge Chutkan's case in Washington, and that specifically deals with some of the facts that have been presented in the Georgia case, or at least that the indictment is charged. And one issue that has been all along is that the district attorney here charged the former president for conduct while he was president of the United States.And that essentially drew this question, right? I mean, that's the, that's the reason the Supreme Court could put their teeth into it. It's not like she charged him as she could have with witness intimidation after he had left office or other acts after he left office, but rather for conduct surrounding that. So, now, based on this immunity ruling, the court here is going to have to go through this process and really this ferreting out and the hearing and briefing about what conduct may or may not have been immune under the federal rules. And that's one problem when you have a state court trying to prosecute a federal officer or a sitting president, one of the reasons we have the removal statute in the federal law. So, you're going to have some evidence that's taken out. For instance, the Brad Raffensperger call, the secretary of state call that is so famous that we've heard. You know, the question there is, does a president have a right to call an elections official in another state? The president is the chief federal law enforcement officer. And his purview, and hopefully one day her purview, but his purview is over that election. He oversees about 12 federal agencies that are involved in every federal election, and that's what this was here. So, is that one of those things that the Supreme Court is talking about on the outer perimeter of his role as president of the United States? And if so, then that evidence may be removed and taken out of the indictment. And so you start to chip away at this foundation that had been built in the state case in Georgia.",

      "sentences": "Yes, and that's going to be tough in Georgia. Because one of the benefits for prosecutors in a RICO violation, I've heard about is, in fact, it's a conspiracy. And it says that, you know, somebody in the group is doing something wrong that the other people can be charged or blamed with that, too. That's different here, where you now have a Supreme Court say, but wait a minute, this guy is the president was immune from certain things. So, you don't get to tag onto him. You don't get to blame him with everything, nor some of the things he may have been doing may not have been illegal as it relates to the criminal statutes because of immunity. So, do those things count against other people in the conspiracy?And so when you overcharge, you know, as a prosecutor, you don't take a plate of spaghetti and throw it up against the wall and just see which noodles stick. I mean, that's a problem. These are issues they should have been thinking through from the outset of what they presented to the grand jury. And when you try to overcharge, sometimes you just get tangled up in your own web. And that's kind of where I think we are now. And that is how do we unwind some of the things that have been set forth in the indictment? Does that mean that the district attorney is going to have to re- indict? Does that mean the court even lets it go forward? Does that mean Trump has to be severed off as a defendant and can't be in this big mass of people that were charged? And were there too many people at the beginning? So, these are questions that are going to have to be answered in the Supreme Court ruling.

So, I was struck by the question that was posed in closing arguments, quote, is Karen Read a rage-filled cop killer or the convenient patsy of a vast police cover up?

When this case first began, I thought the defense theory, it's called a third party culprit defense, meaning somebody else did it. And that defense also included this elaborate cover-up. So, when the case began, I thought to myself, that just sounds too farfetched. That's going to be really, really hard to sell to the jury.But then there was a turning point in this trial, Erica, and it was the testimony of Michael Proctor. Not only did text messages come out that were just completely inappropriate and unprofessional, that's one piece of it, but the other piece is that his text messages and his testimony put the whole investigation in a light that it just did not have -- it was filled with impropriety. And what the defense needed to do was sell a couple of jurors that on the fact that the prosecution did not prove their case beyond a reasonable doubt, and they were really successful with that focus on law enforcement and the investigation and just some inconsistencies with respect to that issue.",

And one thing that they did in this trial was charge Karen Read with an intentional murder. So, their case was that she had an acrimonious relationship with O'Keefe and she intended to hit him that night. With that, there were lesser included offenses, which means it's a reckless state of mind. And then there's leaving the scene of an accident, causing injury or death, which is a negligent state of mind.I think the prosecutors, they may drop that intentional murder charge because then they can focus on the issue of recklessness. Remember, there was significant evidence that she was intoxicated at the time that her blood alcohol level was way over the legal limit. So, focusing the case on that aspect and maybe thinking this intentional theory, she was overcharged. The other piece of this that's going to be very relevant to what happens moving forward, exactly as Jean said, Proctor is under internal investigation. What has yielded from that? What with respect to the investigation comes out of that? And also the DOJ is investigating how this case unfolded. So, is there going to be some clarity from that respect?
