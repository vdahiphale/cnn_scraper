IDF tanks are lined up near the border with Gaza, where the prospect of a ground incursion is looming.In Gaza, the Al-Quds Hospital says Israel has demanded the immediate evacuation of the building ahead of a possible airstrike. The World Health Organization says such a demand would be impossible to carry out. The hospital currently houses around 12,000 displaced people, plus, of course, hundreds of patients. And an American woman and her teenage daughter are free now, following their surprise release late last night. They were visiting family at a Kibbutz close to Gaza from Chicago when they were taken hostage by Hamas. The IDF said today, it believes 210 people are being held hostage in Gaza.

But it's important to be clear that it's really a drop in the ocean in terms of what is actually needed, the scale of the humanitarian catastrophe. To put it in some context or perspective for you, the U.N. told us that before this war, so two weeks ago, three weeks ago, roughly 455 trucks of aid would go into Gaza every single day. So, now, you've had two weeks with zero aid. Today, you've got 20 trucks of aid. The World Food Program saying that might be enough for 30,000 people. And the demand they have right now is for 900,000 people. They need at least, according to the U.N., 100 trucks a day to be able to cross. They're hoping that starting tomorrow or starting Monday, potentially, that U.N. trucks will start to flow through as well, and that there will be a sort of more continuous and sustained humanitarian corridor established.",

We have apparently 10 more Americans, but there are also nationalities from a variety of other countries. And then, of course, there's a lot of Israelis and, you know, Hamas may have a different view about the non-Israeli hostages compared to the Israeli hostages.

And, you know, when they seized these 200 plus, we still don't really, I think, know the exact number of hostages.They had really no idea if somebody was an American, an Israeli, or somebody from some other country. I mean, they were targets of opportunity, unfortunately. They seized whoever they could. But, you know, they're going to, as you know, in the past, Victor, they've cut a very, very tough deal if they have to release just one Israeli soldier for a thousand Palestinian prisoners. So, when it comes to the Israelis, I think it's going to be a different matter than what we've seen already, unfortunately. And, you know, obviously, this is a huge issue also for, there's a big, I think, contradiction Victor, between destroy Hamas, which is a stated Israeli position, and we need to save the hostages. I mean, those are two very diametrically opposed kind of ideas. So, you know, we can only hope that this is the beginning that Hamas behaves in a responsible fashion when it comes to this particular issue.

So, again this is a $105 billion package to break it down in the numbers at $61 billion for Ukraine, $14 billion for Israel, and about $9 billion for humanitarian aid. It also includes funds for border security as well as the Indo-Pacific region. So, a big ask here going to Congress, which as you mentioned, the House does not have a speaker.

And so, all of these factors are what the White House is monitoring.

Speaker shutdowns, things like that. People ripping down posters. Universities can take a strong stand against those things. Those are actionable misconduct under many existing university policies.
