White House spokesperson Andrew Bates telling CNN, quote, \"Bigotry, hate and anti- Semitism have absolutely no place in America, including at Mar-a-Lago.\"Holocaust denial is repugnant and dangerous and it must be forcefully condemned.\" No surprise this is how the Biden White House would be responding. President Biden based so much of his 2020 campaign on the former president's response to the clashes down in Charlottesville. And he has spoken out against extreme hateful rhetoric as well as prejudice in this country. Now on Sunday President Biden is returning to Washington with a long to-do list for him to confront, including trying to fund the government, as that government funding is set to expire on December 16th. The White House is also hoping to fold in additional funding for the pandemic, Ukraine and disaster relief. The president is also hoping he can sign a bill protecting same-sex and interracial marriage once that comes up for a vote in the Senate later this week. While here in Nantucket the president expressed a desire to try to get some new gun legislation passed, including a possible ban on assault weapons in the wake of that spate of mass shootings in this country. Of course, he's facing an uphill climb, as the votes simply don't exist for an assault weapons ban to pass in Congress -- Arlette Saenz, CNN, traveling with the president in Nantucket, Massachusetts.

They've already taken about 4,000 pictures at the scene. They've also collected about 100 pieces of evidence. They've done 3D scans and there's more to do. There that's all in addition to the hundreds and hundreds of tips they've received, about 1,000 so far. And authorities say they've already done about 150 interviews. So it's going to take a lot of time and a lot of money. Governor Brad Little already pledging up to $1 million to help in terms of resources for this investigation. And we've seen those resources there. Officers even working on Thanksgiving Day. In terms of the case and the timeline, it's pretty much the same. What authorities have been telling us is that these four students went out on Saturday night, November 12th; came back on Sunday at around 2:00 in the morning. They're believed to have been killed during the early morning hours, stabbed multiple times while they were likely sleeping. Some of them did have defensive wounds, so it's possible that some of them fought back. But there are still so many questions as to what exactly happened that night. One thing, though, that authorities are saying, is that they believe this was a targeted attack -- Camila Bernal, CNN, Los Angeles. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

That's why we have seen people across this country really trying to take the matter into their own hands. Not only do you see people taking to the streets, demanding their freedom, clashing with security forces but also even here in Beijing, for example, residents are seen tearing down fences that were put in place to seal them off. All of that culminating Saturday night into Sunday morning, with multiple vigils and protests, often spearheaded by young people on the university campuses. They're seen holding up white paper, white being the color of mourning not only for the victims but also indicating there's so much anger and frustration pent up inside themselves.

That was such a watershed moment in the minds of so many people. So far even opponents of the policy have been dancing around this, saying the policy may not be all wrong and the leadership, really, their heart was in the right place. But blaming the local enforcement and pointing a finger at overzealous and incompetent officials, protesters in Shanghai directly challenging the legitimacy of the Communist Party and its leader. As you know, that's simply not tolerated here. That's why there's a lot of concern and worry about the protesters. Some of them have been taken away by police. We understand that's why a crowd has, again, gathered up in Shanghai on the same location, demanding their release. So I think there is a lot of concern there. But not to mention, of course, from the government's perspective, there is also a lot of fear this kind of chanting and protests could inspire others across this country. Kim.",

On Thursday we heard from the United Nations human rights chief. He is urging the regime to listen to its people, to address their legitimate grievances, saying this is the typical narrative of tyranny, as he described it. And saying that this approach, this fortress mentality, that doesn't work anymore, asking him to listen to the people. And he's saying what they're doing is only aggravating the situation. And this is exactly what we've been seeing for over two months. The more the government cracks down, the more people getting killed, the more people getting arrested, this is making people angrier. It's feeding the anger of those out on the streets, making them more determined to protest and demand regime change. That speech made by the supreme leader, Kim, he was addressed the Basij, the paramilitary forces you mentioned that is a branch of Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps. And it has been at the forefront of this crackdown. It's been leading the way in the violent repression of the protests in an attempt to crush them, as it has for years. So people looking at this see this as the regime not in any way softening its position, standing its ground, a green light essentially to continue with this crackdown. And it's coming at a time where we've heard the warnings from the United Nations and others. More than 300 people have been killed. The U.N. say that's a conservative estimate. More than 14,000 people have been arrested. The numbers are believed to be much higher than that as well. And at least 16 protesters have been sentenced to death for taking part in the demonstrations. So the concern is with the regime not backing down, the protesters saying they're going to continue and they're not backing down either, the concern is the situation is going to get much, much worse, Kim.",
