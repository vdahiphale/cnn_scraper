As a -- since you're a former Republican and congressman, let's start there, in terms of what you saw with Donald Trump and Nikki Haley. But I also -- I'm also very curious what your read is on those hundred thousand people that voted uncommitted for President Biden and what they might do in a general election, if in fact, this Biden-Trump rematch materializes. FRED UPTON (R), FORMER MICHIGAN CONGRESSMAN: Well, you know, they were only expecting -- they were hoping for 10,000 people to vote uncommitted. And they got ten times that, more than 100,000. And it shows how weak both of these candidates are in the general. As you said, 70 percent of America doesn't want a rematch between these two. You look at the numbers from South Carolina two or three weeks ago, and the Biden win there. Yes, he got 96 percent of the vote, but less than 5 percent of the voters actually turned out. You look at Nevada. Yes, Trump won big. But the \"none of the above\" was a strong second. That's what we're seeing, really, across the country, which is why No Labels, which is looking at a unity ticket, a Republican and a Democrat, and ballot access in all 50 states, has a real pathway to get 270 votes come November.",

But can we dig into the reality here for these -- this is a huge Arab American Muslim community. Many of them are very upset with how things are playing out in Gaza. And specifically, the president's support for Israel in the context of that war. [06In the general election, they're going to face a choice, most likely, at this stage, between someone who called for a Muslim ban and someone who, as president, has been supporting this war. They obviously wanted to send the message. They did that. But what, when the rubber meets the road in November, what is this going to mean for that community? How do you think that they are going to act? Because really, Michigan could be the entire ball game here when we start counting electoral votes in November.",

And my sense is that a good number, that 100,000, and it will be -- of course, there'll be even more voters that turn out in the general election versus the primary.I think they'll stay at home. I think they'll sit at hands, which is real trouble for the Biden administration. Because you've got that. You've got the UAW and the knocking on Biden and electric vehicles and how it's going to cost jobs in manufacturing in Michigan. And you have the African American vote, too, that they don't, in many cases feel that they've not done enough for them. So you've got three major voting segments on the Democratic side that are not happy. And as a consequence sitting at home really does help Trump. And then you've got, of course, on the Trump side of things, you've got a lot of people that are upset with him, which is why that number 70 percent breaks. All records. It's -- it's never been that high for not wanting to participate in that happy with the candidates of the two strongest respective party.",

His -- his argument that No Labels has a path to 270 Electoral College vote was a little optimistic.So look, you know, I think most Democrats agree that the shortest path to 270 Electoral College votes for Trump -- excuse me, for Biden -- is to rebuild the Blue Wall and to hold the three states that Trump took away in 2016, which is Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. And of those three, Michigan has looked -- since Trump's victory, has looked the best for Democrats. I mean, Democrats have done very well in Michigan. Whitmer won in '18 and '22. He won it by 150,000 votes. They've won the legislature. They've done a lot of things. But I think that Fred Upton is right that, if the election was held today, Biden would probably lose Michigan. And this 100,000 the votes is so important, because -- precisely because there are so many other challenges that he is facing in Michigan. Economy is the perfect storm and it's -- it's not hard to imagine a world where, in a close election, it's hard for Biden to hold Arizona and Georgia. He can tough out Wisconsin and Pennsylvania.

I mean, the fact that Fred Upton was there talking about how everything is terrible and what about No Labels when there's no candidate, no plan, and no -- I don't know what is going on with No Labels. I found completely baffling. And there is still this strange question mark that Nikki Haley really was trying to exploit last night. A very pointed interview with CNN of saying, like, we can get out.

We -- certainly, they did overshoot the 10,000 estimate. I think there's other policies probably stacked up into that, where folks are just realizing, Hey, I'm going to vote for this \"uncommitted\" guy. Because I'm -- I'm not aligned on some of these policies. That's going to follow the Democratic Party. That's going to follow Joe Biden. CORNISH: Policies can be addressed.

It's what we've seen. He walked -- while winning big in South Carolina and New Hampshire, he lost college graduates. He's only won about 40 percent of independents. A lot of people living at or below the median income are going to be -- it's going to be hard for Biden to win them back because of how scarring inflation has been. His pathway is improving on even what he did in 2020 in white-collar suburbs, where you've got voters who really haven't been as inconvenienced by inflation, are more receptive to the arguments on abortion, more receptive to the arguments on democracy.
