Democrats, they're reckoning with all five stages of grief, all at once, after Joe Biden's debate performance triggered panic. Tonight, Biden delivered a standard but important speech, especially given the context. The subtext of it, that the rumors of his political death and his mental decline are greatly exaggerated. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN, U.S. PRESIDENT: Let's remember, the fact that NATO remains the bulwark of global security did not happen by accident. It wasn't inevitable. Again and again at critical moments, we chose unity over disunion, progress over retreat, freedom over tyranny, hope over fear. Again and again, we stood behind our shared vision of a peaceful and prosperous transatlantic community. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

But Democrats, well, the party is supposed to unify behind him, and yet, they are glum. They're basically holding a wake over on Capitol Hill. Funeral vibes was how the mood was described at an all-hands meeting about the president and his campaign's future. That's according to some of the Democrats who attended.So, given the funeral, we're going to walk through the full range of emotions the Democrats seem to be experiencing right now in public. There is plenty of denial that what the American voters saw elected Democrats didn't see, or that it was simply just one bad night. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

No one is -- very few Democrats are publicly calling on Biden to move to step aside while privately they're fretting about what they can do. And some of them think like it will take another big event to convince him himself or to give them the courage to say this really can't go on. They're thinking maybe it will take a huge stumble at the press conference on Thursday to prove -- to get them to say something, to get him to admit this can't go on on his own.

Do you think that this is all dead, that it's over, the push to get Biden out? REP. MAXINE WATERS (D-CA): Well, I think we have to be careful when we talk about how many and what does a lot of them mean. We have 213 members, Democrats. And so if you talk to three or four of them, that's not a lot of them. And so I do believe that we have a team and that we're not really at a position in a time, and of the opinion, really, collectively, that we can get a new candidate, someone else, someone new coming in. Biden- Harris is a team. She supports him, he supports her. Many of us support Biden. I'm a strong supporter of Biden. I was at the Essence Festival this weekend, where I spoke to several thousand people, all supporters of Biden. I think we have to be a little bit cautious about coming to conclusions right now. I think that when we talk about Biden and, you know, is he too old, is he competent, what have you, we better compare him with Trump. And when you take a look at Trump, and you add up his negatives from the time he talked about grabbing women by their private parts to the lies that he had told, the lies about abortion, on and on and on, in the final analysis, people will compare.",
