Because if you're establishing that an individual number one didn't file his taxes, and number two tried to evade his taxes, it probably isn't relevant that he was doing so in order to pay off sex workers or buy drugs or whatever else.Now, maybe prosecutors can say that you have to know why -- where the money was going in order to establish sort of his intent to not pay his taxes, but it creates this little bit of a legal quagmire over, is this just designed to embarrass this defendant, or is it relevant information? And a judge is going to have to sort out every -- sort of every little bit and piece here. You know, it's a valid question -- back to what you were talking about with Evan as well, it's a valid question as to what took so long now. Look, a prosecutor can bring a case wherever there are facts to suggest that that crime took place. And this is, we should note, Los Angeles, as opposed to Delaware, there, I guess, are some factual differences between the two cases. But, you know, that doesn't -- that's not presented to the jury. It's not for them to decide why cases brought when it was. So I think there are political questions surrounding it. But, you know, this is not going to end and someone going to jail for 17 years, I will say that.
