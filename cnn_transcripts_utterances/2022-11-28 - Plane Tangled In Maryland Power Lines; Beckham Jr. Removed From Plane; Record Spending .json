You know, long, dark, cold hours of those two people on board that single-engine Mooney stuck up in that transmission pole of these high tension wires which are run by power company Pepco here.Sixty-five-year-old man, 66-year-old woman. We are hearing that they are both OK, taken to a nearby hospital after they were rescued about 12:30 this morning. They were brought down from a cherry picker that firefighters used to take that man and woman out one by one. The big issue is that they had to stay suspended in the airplane in those power lines as crews deenergized the line to make sure that they could make a safe rescue. What's also so incredible here is that the two on board were able to communicate with firefighters, about 100 of them, on the ground here via cellphone. It was only after those two people on board that plane got on the ground, I want you to listen now to firefighters when they were able to realize the full extent of their injuries. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) CHIEF SCOTT GOLDSTEIN, MONTGOMERY COUNTY FIRE DEPARTMENT: Both patients have been transported from the scene to local area trauma centers with serious injuries. There is a hypothermia issue as well, but there's also orthopedic and trauma injuries from the crash. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Also saying that at the root of this was an overzealous flight attendant.Let me read with you the statement from Beckham's attorney saying, the overzealous flight attendant refused to simply allow Mr. Beckham to fasten his seat belt and proceed with the flight and instead immediately removed everyone from the plane. So, that is what we are hearing from the Beckham camp. Now, on the other side of this, when you hear from the police statement, they describe this very differently, say that according to the flight crew, he was going in and out of consciousness. They tried to wake him up to fasten his seat belt. That didn't work. They called police. When officers arrived, they say he refused to get off the plane. At that point they got everyone else off the plane, and then police escorted him out. So, two very different accounts of what led to Beckham being pulled off that plane.

They are parts of these communities. And they say that based on what these grants -- how the grants are being arranged and based on past history, they don't expect to see much of this money.I want to introduce you to one of these groups. It's called Dia de la Mujer Latina. It's in Texas. They are a group of women in the Latin community. They set up a call center to help answer questions during Covid and encourage vaccination. They were praised by President Biden. They got a letter from President Biden saying thank you, thank you for everything you did. But then, when they applied for a federal grant, it was part of a huge federal grant with dozens of recipients, they were told, oh, it was a good application, but, sorry, we're not going to give you the money. So, I want to read you a quote from the president of that group, Venus Gines, and this is what she had to say. She said, we will always be in the kitchen. We'll never be invited to the dining room table. That's how we feel. What she means is, they expect us to do the work, but they don't want to pay us. This is especially sensitive given that this is women from the Latino community. Now, we asked the CDC about this. They weren't the ones who turned her down for the grant. That was a different government agency. But the CDC has also come under criticism here and a CDC spokeswoman said, we are confident that grant recipients will fund and work with community- based organizations in their communities. In other words, she's saying the CDC is giving money to state and local health departments. We're confident that they, in turn, will subaward to these community groups. Bianna. Jim.",
