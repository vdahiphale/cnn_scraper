It's somewhere back out there in the Atlantic Ocean.We're told that there were U.S. Coast Guard and Naval vessels that were already in the area. And once it was shot down, they began to make a perimeter of that wreckage so they could make sure they could kind of get all of it in that area. We're told that from a senior U.S. military official, that there will be Navy divers that can go down and assist with the recovery. But there are also unmanned vessels that can go down and bring the structure up and get it onto one of those recovery ships. Now, look, initially that official says that the Navy thought that this was going to be downed in much deeper waters, but they've determined that it actually came down in about 47 feet of ocean water here, which they say is going to make the recovery fairly easy. Now, here's the thing. They don't know exactly how long it is going to take to get all of the wreckage out of the ocean. They say that same official saying, I don't anticipate months and weeks, but there is still some time that's into this. Here in Myrtle Beach, they've told people, look, if you see debris that washes up onto the shoreline, please don't pick it up, please don't take it home.

And that is important, according to defense officials, because they want to know exactly what is inside that balloon. And U.S. officials who were briefing reporters yesterday said that actually, they believe that by shooting it down over the ocean as they did, they are going to be able to discover many new and important things about China's intelligence gathering and surveillance program, and particularly what the Chinese were actually able to discover once -- when that balloon was actually over U.S. territory. So this was a very deliberate action by the President and his team. And now, of course, it remains to be seen, given that this debris is scattered around 7 miles, how long it's going to take for them to recover it all and analyze it. Guys?",

What went into this decision on when to shoot this balloon down? What is the White House saying?",

      "speaker": "JASMINE WRIGHT, CNN WHITE HOUSE REPORTER",
      "sentences": "Yes, Amara, well a lot went into that decision. President Biden yesterday, speaking to reporters, says that he was adamant that he gave the order to the military to shoot down the suspected spy balloon. He said that it really was his first inclination to do it when he was first briefed about it, we know from sources.And then he officially gave that order on Wednesday. But he was recommended by the military to wait because at that point, the balloon had drifted over densely populated areas, really presenting a risk to property and people below. And so he accepted that order. And that is when the military really hatched that plan to shoot down the balloon over open water. And that happened about seven days after the balloon first entered U.S. airspace. Now, because the President waited those days, he is being sharply criticized by Republicans, some Democrats are questioning, and Republicans really labeled that as a weakness, saying, why didn't you shoot it down earlier to prevent serious information from being fed back or transmitted back to the Chinese. Now, the White House has really been in defense mode over this, defending the President's decision to follow military recommendations. I want to read you a statement that a White House official gave me yesterday because it's pretty strong. They said that, \"This is the responsible action for the commander in chief to take, waiting, of course. He prioritized the safety of the American people. He ensured that the military take steps to protect against the balloon's collection of sensitive information, mitigating any intelligence value to the PRC, the People's Republic of China.\" [07:10:11] And they said also that the time that they took those seven days to shoot it down, they were able to learn more information from the payload. So, of course, this will be their defense when they handle these domestic issues, as lawmakers have promised that they want more information from the White House. But then diplomatically, of course, they're going to have their issues to sort out there after this White House. And the President himself really spent months, painstaking months, trying to iron out these issues with China, trying to enter into warmer relations. Obviously, this is now a setback. Boris, Amara?",

Jasmine Wright, thank you so much for the update.Let's get the Chinese perspective on this and go now to Will Ripley, who's live for us in Taiwan.

      "sentences": "Yes, I mean, it's ironic, isn't it, considering that you had this Chinese surveillance balloon, according to the Pentagon, weather balloon, according to China, hovering over the United States for seven days.But China is really doubling down on this claim that this was a civilian, you know, research airship. In fact, they even fired the head of China's weather service just to reinforce, analysts believe this claim that this was -- the ship was had a civilian mission, it was meteorological purposes, and it was not conducting surveillance over sensitive military sites in the United States, which it happened to hover over, for example, missile silos in Montana. Now, so let's just set that aside. Let's set aside China's claim that it is a weather balloon and let's assume that it is a spy balloon. The question still remains, why would China do it? Why would they do it on the eve of a crucial visit between Secretary of State Blinken and China's President Xi Jinping, who reportedly had been preparing for this meeting, was planning to meet with the U.S. Secretary of State. China wants a dialogue with the United States because there's a laundry list of contentious issues they need to deal with. This balloon now added on to that. And on top of it, they apologized. They said that they were sorry. They said that this was an accident, that this, in their words, civilian balloon had drifted off course and got caught up in the westerly winds. OK, so if it was not an accident, then was it an act of diplomatic sabotage? Were they trying to do something to stop this meeting from happening? Which doesn't make a whole lot of sense when China was preparing for it. Were they trying to test the U.S. military, or were they trying to test President Biden himself? These are the key and perhaps never to be answered questions because, as we know, Boris and Amara, China is a black box when it comes to transparency, especially at that kind of government and military level.",

So it's going to be the technological aspects of it and then, of course, whether we can determine what, in fact, the Chinese were able to survey. A lot of people online are wondering, you know, they have such sophisticated satellite and spy capacity, spying capacity, why would they do this? And part of it is the sort of common term, a hovering aspect of what the balloon actually can do. It can hover over certain areas, get more detailed pictures, get more granular in its capacity to pick up the intelligence. We have to believe that's what they were doing, as well as reporting. We don't know why and whether they lost control of something that had been done, as we now know, in the previous -- in the Trump administration.

So the Biden administration had to respond quite publicly.Because once you're -- I mean, I started seeing Twitter pictures online as of Wednesday. And so, part of it is what kind of airspace was it in in the Pacific? It clearly becomes in our airspace when it's over our homeland. It then becomes a challenge for the Biden administration. So what you basically saw over the week was a really sort of planned different pieces of an overall strategy, but we want the balloon down. Wednesday, Biden gives the orders. The military says the best way to implement those orders, because they're the experts, is when it gets over the water. That happens midday Saturday. And now that's the second part of the mission.

This balloon debris field is roughly seven square miles off the Atlantic Ocean, off the Carolina coast. Talk us to about the logistical challenges of looking at an area that large. DR. DAVID GALLO, SENIOR ADVISER FOR STRATEGIC INITIATIVE, RMS TITANIC INC. AND OCEANOGRAPHER: Sure. Good morning, Boris. That's -- the size of that debris field is difficult, of course, because you've got some things that are floating, some that sank directly to the bottom, the floating ones are being pushed around and winds. And as -- you might be looking for something as tiny as a memory card, maybe even smaller than that. So, the good news is they know where the balloon bits hit the water, so they don't need to go through that exercise, so they know where the haystack is. And now, the trick is to find all those needles and it's not going to be easy. You know, just because it's shallow water, it doesn't mean it's going to be easy. And any of those divers can tell you there's nothing routine about doing this kind of work.",

GALLO: Yes, and you're a diver, right, Boris? I mean, you know, getting into the water, and it's -- it is a tough task because you're not just on a -- enjoying the environment. You've got a job to do. And that's not to miss any piece of that payload. And so, you've got to be very careful. You don't want to miss a spot because you probably won't go back. Visibility might be good, then again it might not be good. The water might be calm, they might be -- you might have a longshore current and things like that. So, it's -- you know, the bottom line is you've got a job to do and it's more than just having a look around.",

And then in the future, I don't think you can keep people out of there forever. So, yes, they're going to be poking around looking for things.",

Well, I don't know how big a piece they will find but I'm sure there are bigger chunks and maybe that's -- no more than fist size. And you know, when I look at the video, it looks to me like they did hit the payload. It didn't go right through the balloon. That's just the way it looks like to me. And so, there would be a lot of little bits. It's like smashing something with a baseball bat on a piece of electronics. So, there's going to be all sorts of stuff scattered around. Time will tell. But there is a chance they might find a big chunk. We won't know until they are done look.",

But thank goodness, that should be fairly flat and covered with sand and mud and things, so, fairly flat, except there are currents that go through there. If it had gone just a little bit more out to sea, the sea floor drops off to full ocean depths, so, we're talking 15,000 feet not from there.
