And that is a problem that they've not been able to solve for as we are here on Election Day.But they tell me that they are encouraged somewhat by some of the data that they've seen of how men, and specifically male Democrats, are not showing up in the numbers that they had expected they would for the Harris campaign. They've also said that they feel encouraged by some of the signs that black voters and rural - or, excuse me, and urban voters are not turning out as much as they thought as well, but rural voters are. So, these are just some of the tea leaves that they are reading. I cannot emphasize this enough, Kate, though, that we have no idea what is going to happen. The Trump campaign does not know what will happen. Polls do not close for several hours. So, everyone's just kind of waiting by to see, you know, how this will all turn out.

And we were with her in Pennsylvania yesterday as she wascrisscrossing the state. And it really illustrated how she has run her campaign more broadly, trying to appeal to such a diverse coalition of voters, right? Everyone from Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, to Liz Cheney, under the same umbrella. Bottom line, the message from her is that she wants to be a president for all of America. And now, of course, it's time for voters to decide. But take a listen to how she's made this argument. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KAMALA HARRIS, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE U.S. (D) AND U.S. PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: America is ready for a fresh start. Ready for a new way forward where we see our fellow American not as an enemy, but as a neighbor. And we are ready for a president who knows that the true measure of a leader is not based on who you beat down, but based on who you lift up. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

However, we have found within the crowd of people casting their ballots here in northern Virginia Trump voters as well.

And what I'm seeing within that momentum, what is it that is pushing people to go to the polls and to break for her? And we have seen in the early data that the voters who have decided in the last two weeks are breaking for the vice president.I think that a lot of what we've been hearing from Donald Trump, the Madison Square Garden hate rally, the insult to Puerto Rico, calling it an island of trash.

One, convincing low propensity Republicans, some of them, to participate early. And two, they do feel like that they tracked down this election in the month of October. I mean they were - you know, Harris had a great rollout and lead for a good chunk of the fall, but they really feel like she had a rough October and they tracked it down.

The people who aren't connected to the news, that don't do much in our politics. Did he turn them out or not? We'll find out tonight. CARDONA: So, on the early vote data, because it's not party talking points. I did do a deep dive with two friends of mine who are analysts on early vote data. Scott's right, this year is very different from 2020 and even from 2022. And you can't extrapolate and make comparisons and then try to divulge what is going to be the end game. You can't do that. So, you're absolutely right about that, Scott. But what you can do is make comparisons, party to party, and then look and see who those voters are. And so two things have emerged. Both parties are down in early vote from what they were in 2020. We expected that because it was a pandemic. And we've talked to groups of voters. For example, there are a lot of the - of voters in the black community who have said they're going to vote on Election Day. A lot of women have said, they're going to vote on Election Day because they're excited about doing it because they can and they couldn't in 2020. That's number one. The second thing is that you can actually look at the early vote data and compare to see, were those voters, voters who voted before in 2020? A lot of the voters that Republicans have seen or are in the early vote data are voters that voted in 2020. So, right now there is no data that shows, or proves, that the strategy for low propensity voters that Republicans have hung their hat on is actually coming to fruition.",
