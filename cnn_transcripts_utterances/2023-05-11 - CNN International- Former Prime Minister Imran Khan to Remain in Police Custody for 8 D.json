But what is really important to note is that Imran Khan was not arrested by the police. He was arrested by paramilitary troops on Tuesday afternoon here in Pakistan. And the military has sent out a very strongly worded statement along with the Prime Minister condemning these protests. The military has in fact said that they're going to take very strict action against anyone who tries to damage any military or property that belongs to law enforcement officials. Pakistan's Prime Minister has actually gone out and called those people who have been protesting terrorists. Now we're waiting to see how today is slightly calmer. It's only the early hours of Thursday morning. But we're going to have to wait to see whether people will continue to come out or will these words by the military make any difference to the people coming out in the streets -- Bianca.",

And if you are just joining us, let me bring you up to date with our top stories this hour.The COVID era immigration policy Title 42 is set to expire later today. Border officials say they are prepared. But several towns say they expect a surge of migrants like no other. And Republican Congressman George Santos has pleaded not guilty to 13 federal charges, including fraud and money laundering. He was released on bond and had to turn over his passport to authorities. Santos says he will not resign his seat. A top Republican lawmaker says he has incriminating bank records involving President Biden's son Hunter and his business dealings. What James Comer didn't show, was any evidence tied directly to the president or in fact, that any of it was illegal. CNN's Sara Murray is in Washington. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SARA MURRAY, CNN POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): House Oversight Chair James Comer offering new details to bolster his claims that members of Joe Biden's family, including his son Hunter, received millions of dollars in payments from foreign entities in China and Romania. REP. JAMES COMER (R-KY): I want to be clear. This committee is investigating President Biden and his family's shady business deals that capitalize on Joe Biden's public office and risked our country's national security. MURRAY (voice-over): Committee Republicans cited new bank records they obtained via subpoena that include payments made to companies tied to Hunter Biden.",

REP. NANCY MACE (R-SC): These people didn't come to Hunter Biden because he understood world politics or that he was experienced in it or that he understood Chinese businesses. They wanted him for the access his last name gave them. MURRAY (voice-over): But, so far, Republicans have failed to unearth any payments to Joe Biden while he was vice president or after leaving office.

And you have to understand that first of all there are human casualties. For us, the victory is when a soldier returns from the battle. And not when he dies. There is a proverb that you should not die for Ukraine but you should fight for Ukraine. (END VIDEOTAPE) ROBERTSON (on camera): And in the past 24 hours President Zelenskyy spoke with European broadcasters and that was a message that he echoed there. That he doesn't want to see needless sacrifice by having a counteroffensive too soon. But on the other hand he knows that he needs to balance that against the international expectations. And I think when we hear from President Zelenskyy so close to what could be this major counteroffensive, you have to also understand that although he is speaking to that European constituency that has given him so much support, there is a counter message here to try to get into the psyche of the Russian thinking. When will it come? Is the president really speaking the truth? Is it going to be tomorrow? Is it going to be in a month? So, there is a massive psychological game -- not game but effort here to confuse the Russians in all of this.",
