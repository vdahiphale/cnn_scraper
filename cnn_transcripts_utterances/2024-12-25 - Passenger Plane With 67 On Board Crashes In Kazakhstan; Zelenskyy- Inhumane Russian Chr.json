From Bethlehem to Ukraine to Ivory Coast, Christians are marking the day with festivities, and for Jews around the globe, Hanukkah begins at sundown. The eight-day festival of lights starting on Christmas for the first time since 2005. More on the holidays later this hour. But now, turning to the day's news. An investigation is currently underway after a fiery plane crash in Kazakhstan. Authorities say 29 people, including two children, survived the disaster, but at least 38 were killed. The Azerbaijani Airline was traveling from the capital of Baku to Southern Russia when it crashed near the city of Aktau. One witness says bloodied survivors emerged from the wreckage of the plane, which burst into flames as it hit the ground. An aviation watchdog says a bird strike may be to blame for the emergency, but the cause is still unknown. We have new video from social media that appears to show passengers wearing oxygen masks before the crash, and damage to one of the wings. Earlier, I spoke with CNN's safety analyst and former FAA safety inspector, David Soucie about the rescue operation and the next steps in the investigation. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

      "sentences": "I think it is way too early to make that determination as to what caused it or not, but the crash site and the movement of the aircraft does not indicate to me that it was a bird strike set or bird strike, or a flock of birds that caused the problem.The aircraft not only went up and down like with power issues, but it was going left and right. It was pretty much out of control for a good amount of time before the accident. So I am not there with the bird strike yet, but it certainly is a tragedy and it is a tragic accident to have had to experience that for these folks to come through that for 20 minutes, to wait to see what is going to happen, and then have survivors is truly a miracle on Christmas Day.",

And looking at video from the site of the crash, some people actually just walking out of the plane, it appeared that the fortunate ones were sitting in the back. What do you make of that?",

      "sentences": "Well, this particular flight path and the nose down attitude of the aircraft, when it hit the ground, it quickly broke in half. And so what happens is the energy. This is much like you see, like you said, it is very rare.But in the Sioux City accident, which is many years ago, the aircraft did something similar, which is where the tail breaks off of the aircraft. So all the energy from that impact is transferred and absorbed by the front part of the aircraft wings forward. The tail of the aircraft you can see in some of these videos is a long, long distance from where the initial impact site is, and that energy is all dissipated by the time it comes to rest. There are survivors, in this case, 22 survivors that were able to walk away from that tail section.",

It is known to have a pretty strong safety record flying in and out of the EU and meeting their standards there. It is an Embraer 190 plane.What are investigators going to be looking at as they try to put the pieces together with the black box in particular?",

      "sentences": "Well, as you said, Azerbaijan is one of the top safety airlines in the world really. They've done a great job of keeping their safety record up. The next steps on this is because it is a modern aircraft, there will be flight recorders, there will be data recorders, everything that needs to be recorded from that flight will be on there, and we will be able to get some information out of there as soon as the investigation is concluded, but that would be the start.Of course, the first thing on any accident site you do is the safety of those survivors and the passengers there. And secondarily, you can see that there are the videos, a lot of people coming up to help and assist, and there are a lot of hazards and dangers there. And you notice a lot of them are not wearing masks or don't have protective gear on, and so the safety of those folks is really important as well. So managing the site is what they are focused on right now, it is to make sure that everyone is safe. It is there, and clearing that area out. The next steps of this is going to be continuing to make it secure and safe, and then with due respect to those folks who have who have passed in the accident, those have to be taken care of as well respectfully.

The difficult thing about interviewing survivors is that the stories are going to be very, very different and they can actually dissuade you from a certain investigation, so it is important the investigators look to the facts and keep it that way.With regard to the criminal investigation, Azerbaijan and the folks in that region do see every aircraft accident as a criminal investigation. That's how they start it. In the FAA, we don't do that. We don't bring in the FBI or anybody else until we see other issues that have to do with other than the aircraft operations or the mechanics of it. So over there, that's not uncommon for them to open it as a criminal investigation. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Ukrainian authorities say Russia launched more than 70 missiles, including ballistic missiles and more than a hundred attack drones, of which 50 missiles and a significant number of drones are said to have been intercepted. However, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has confirmed that they were hit with at least one person killed. Zelenskyy said President Putin chose to carry out the attack on Christmas Day describing Russia's actions as inhumane. Ukraine's energy operator, meanwhile, says it was forced to impose emergency blackouts in several parts of the country. This, of course, comes after a series of attacks by Russia in recent days, including an attack on the capital, Kyiv, which was targeted on Friday. Ukraine's largest private energy company said this marks the 13th time this year that Russia has carried out a major attack on Ukraine's energy sector, leaving the country in a precarious position as the war grinds into a third winter.

He has also been outspoken recently on what's been going on in Gaza, calling recent airstrikes cruelty and also being in regular contact with the Catholic community in Gaza.Now, Pope Francis making his remarks after launching the Catholic Church's Jubilee Year, an ancient tradition that focuses on forgiveness and pilgrimage and which began on Christmas Eve when Pope Francis opened the doors of the Holy Door of Saint Peter's Basilica. Normally cemented shut, the door meant to represent God's mercy, the Pope said, and that Francis is hoping that the message of the Jubilee can be one of hope and one that can impact not just in Rome, but globally. Francis is 88 years old. He has got a packed schedule of events during the Jubilee. He will be opening a Holy Door in a prison tomorrow, Thursday, the first time a Holy Door has been opened in a prison. But nevertheless, despite the difficulties the Pope has when it comes to his physical mobility, Francis is determined to carry out the celebrations of the Jubilee and hoping that the message that the Jubilee represents will resonate across the globe.

I knew that was my life and I needed to walk out of a backstage door. However, when the Rockettes audition came around, I did not know who the Rockettes were, and a peer said to me, Jennifer, you should go to the audition. You would make a great Rockette. And being very green in the business and very nervous at auditions that morning, I decided to go to the audition, and when I got to Radio City Music Hall at 10:00, the time of the audition, there was a line of women wrapped around the Music Hall. Beautiful long legs. They knew how to do their hair, makeup, and I got at the end of the line and I thought about leaving numerous times. I thought I could make my favorite jazz class at 11:00, because I figured they were not going to pick me, and I thought about leaving numerous times, and then a voice inside me said, stay.
