I mean, no one thought this was going to go well with Donald Trump on the stand, but the fact that they have just taken a break and they are less than an hour into this testimony and the judge has repeatedly admonished Trump and just threatened to remove him from the witness stand and said that he would draw every negative inference that he could. That's not good. That would essentially be Trump not appearing or taking the Fifth, because the judge's discretion here is quite high in making the determination, it's the highest, actually, in making the determination of what these damages are going to look like.Because at the heart of this case, what's been decided is already known here that Trump is liable for fraud. The question is how liable and how much he is going to have to potentially pay here. And this is threatening everything that he's ever had, his entire real estate empire here. And you just saw Trump walk out of that courtroom. He did not speak. When a reporter asked a question about how it was going in there. Instead, he just made the motion to zip his lips. Certainly that was not what was happening on the witness stand. That was to the incredible frustration of the judge, who was repeatedly telling Trump's attorney, telling Trump himself, just answer the question yes or no here, and Trump was not doing that. They are now in a 15-minute break. And I think the question is, is how much longer Trump is going to be on that witness stand, because the judge here clearly is fed up with how he's answering or not answering these questions. And Paula, I think them taking a break here is a sign that the judge is really considering or reconsidering what the rest of this day is going to look like.",

And he appears to believe that the best way to handle this politically is to continue to antagonize, continue to paint himself as a martyr, the victim of political bias.He has taken on the judge directly, repeatedly, throughout this hearing. That is a choice. And legally may not have great results, but politically, this appears to be the direction he wanted to take. Again, weren't sure at the beginning of the day how this would go. And so far it's been a mess, both for the Attorney General's Office. They're not getting evidence. Trump could be in additional legal peril.

Yes, you may win the battle of Public Opinion. Yes, you may get some great campaign donations. But at the end of the day, that's not what this is about. This is about your civil case and your exposure. So I am trying to rail or bring my client back in, get him on that tight leash, bring him back, not let him hang himself, proverbially. But I'd be very, very concerned because this judge is going to ultimately make a, you know, a determination. And one other thing I would say if I was Judge Engoron, I would be giving Donald Trump ample leeway. I would be giving him ample space. I would allow him to do what he's going to do, and then at some point I'd pull that. But I think it's a little too early and hopefully it's a little more calm.",

And maybe what Trump's doing is for political gain, and he may think it is for political gain, and maybe it does help in a primary. But there is some indication in new polling just out today that losses in the courtroom could hurt Donald Trump. The numbers you're looking at in the screen are from six battleground states from \"The New York Times\" poll.Currently, Donald Trump leads Joe Biden by three points in these six battleground states. But if he's convicted this question was specifically about the election fraud trial, the federal case. But if he's convicted in that, Trump is then Biden leads by nine points in these six states. So it's a 12-point political swing if these cases start to go against him. So just because Trump thinks it helps politically doesn't make it so. Back to the legal here, negative inference. This judge just threatened to take a negative inference from Trump's testimony today. Does that mean basically that his time on this, you know, Trump lost his time on the stand? Is that a fair way to look at it?",

Here we are, one hour in and all heck has already broken loose, and the judge has two options. One, he can continue to admonish and instruct and ask Chris Kise to try to control the witness and just keep up with that. The other is what you just said, which is the actual remedy with teeth. He can say, I will end this and I will draw every inference. I will assume the worst about what every one of your answers would be.If I'm the judge, I'm thinking, is this really going to get better? Realistically, is Donald Trump really going to say, you know, I thought about it at the break and I'm going to bring it back in, or is this just going to keep going?

      "sentences": "Well, that's right, because tomorrow court is closed because it's Election Day. And Wednesday, Trump has a big political event. He is hosting his rally outside of Miami to counterprogram the Republican debate. And this is just one version here of what we are seeing is likely to be a juggling act between these multiple trial appearances and actually trying to run campaign.Now, I do want to go back to the first thing you asked me there, which is, what is Donald Trump doing? And I think when you really watch what he is saying here, he is trying to use the Court of Public Opinion. He knows that people are watching this. Obviously, we're not watching on cameras, but we have reporters in the room. We are getting this information and he is putting his narrative out there on the stand. He is not answering yes or no. And as both Kaitlan and Paula have noted, that is standard for Donald Trump. But he is also portraying this and painting this through this political light, saying that this judge is unfair, that this trial is unfair, that they are going to rule against him anyway because they always do. Those are things he says in private and public and that is the way he tries to spin all of this. Now, we were not anticipating that this is exactly how it would go. I don't think anyone was anticipating that. However, we did believe he was going to at least try to do this in front of the cameras and now turns out that he's also doing it in the courtroom. Now back to again, this is a big balancing act for Donald Trump and for his campaign team. They are all looking at how exactly it's going to look as he runs for President in 2024. And he is bouncing back and forth between these different trial dates. And I am told that this essentially means that the legal team and the campaign team are working hand in hand. It starts with the legal team. They are giving out dates of when they think potentially Donald Trump is going to have to sit in on various trials and then they are trying to work campaign events around that. But if this does spill over, as you mentioned, onto Wednesday, this will be an opportunity that I can assure you, that Donald Trump's team will take to say that this is going to interfere with his campaigning in 2024, and then they will use that to perpetuate the argument that they continue to make that this is election interference. But it really will be, Kate, the first time that we see this lining up of him having to appear in court and then have a campaign event, that is the first time if this does spill over into Wednesday. But it just gives you such an idea of how the lines have really blurred between what is his legal strategy and what is his political strategy.",

And it looks like after the first question, Trump got on the stand, he once again launched into what is described as a speech. And this has been, a pointed contention with a judge who has repeatedly asked him to answer yes, no questions concisely, and not launch into what the judge described as essays or speeches.Now, this break gave everyone a chance to take a moment and reflect on how they have proceeded so far during today's court proceedings. The judge has the opportunity to give Trump a little more leeway here. That's what Trump's lawyers have asked him to do. Just let the man be heard. The lawyers for the government, for the Attorney General's Office, they also have an option here to change up a little bit of the way they've been questioning this witness. And, of course, Trump has the option to be more deferential to the judge. So far, he certainly does not seem to be changing the way he has approached this. The judge, it does not appear so far, has admonished him. But we're watching and waiting to see if anyone in this courtroom used that break as a chance to change up the strategy or if this will just continue to devolve into what it has been so far, which is chaos. I mean, Kaitlan, there are no winners here, right? I mean, the government's not getting any answers, really, any evidence. The judge appeared to have lost control of his courtroom. And while, yes, politically, some of this could play to Trump's base, legally, he's really expanding potential peril. COLLINS: I think what I'm watching is to see if Trump changes the way he's been answering these questions or his attorneys change the way that they've been handling running interference between the judge and Trump after that 15-minute break, I don't even know if it went the full 15 minutes. Trump did not speak notably outside of the court, as he did when he entered the courthouse. The courtroom this morning and of course, was attacking the Attorney General. He said nothing on the way out. He said nothing on the way in except giving a thumbs up as he returned in there. And so I think that's the question here, because Trump has not ever been someone who listens to his attorneys and takes their advice that, well, I mean, you can speak his own former attorneys would admit that, I think. And so that's kind of the question here. I also think that they may see a strategy in this in the sense of it's very clear they're going to appeal this decision. I mean, they have basically telegraphed that and the other testimonies that have happened. And so the question is, if they are goading the judge essentially into revealing his frustrations, which he has multiple times, which will be on the record, and how does an appellate court hear that? How do they respond to that? Is that something they think has influenced the decision making here? That could be a strategy that you're seeing Chris Kise and others take here potentially.",

His attorney is likely endorsing this approach for either a future appeal or just to try to prevent really, this from being in any way constructive for the Attorney General's Office.But for the judge to suggest that he could draw every possible negative inference, I mean, that is just about the worst thing that could happen to Trump.

I would let the judge and Trump's lawyers have it out, and I would just sort of sit back and let them go at it. Because other than -- everything that I've seen today, I don't see any appeal issue at all. Based on what we're hearing, there's no way an appeals court is going to say anything that's happened thus far is reversible error.If the judge takes the drastic step of saying, day over, testimony stricken, I'm assuming the worst about all of it. I'm not saying it would get reversed on appeal, but that would be an appeal issue. If I'm the AG, I'll sit back, let him go at it, and I'll get out of this safely.",

The reason that he's being shut down is he's not answering the assistant AG's questions. But this is a bench trial. And so if he were called by the other side, if Chris Kise said, once the plaintiff rests, the AG rests, and it's time for the defense to present their case, I call to the stand Donald Trump.They could say, what did you want to say about this? And he could go on and on and on. So it's a little futile to try and shut him down now. I think they should give him a little leeway.",
