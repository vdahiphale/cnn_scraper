      "sentences": "OUTFRONT nextGiuliani bankrupt. Trump's longtime attorney says he's broke. His legal bills are piling up. While special counsel Jack Smith is pressing the Supreme Court to rule quickly on Trump's case. Will the court act? Professor Laurence Tribe is my guest tonight. And new video on CNN this hour of the Texas National Guard appearing to ignore a mother and her baby as they plea for help in the Rio Grande River. This powerful video is a disturbing video but it shows the reality of what is happening right now in the U.S. southern border. And it has been 16 days since top critic Alexey Navalny went missing. His daughter Dasha is my guest tonight. Let's go OUTFRONT. And good evening. I'm Erin Burnett. OUTFRONT tonight, bankrupt. Trump's longtime attorney Rudy Giuliani filing for bankruptcy today. The move just one day after a federal judge ruled Giuliani has to start paying the nearly $150 million that a court, majority ruled, that he owes to two Georgia women, he falsely accused of trying to overturn the election. But, Giuliani, of course, is Trump's right-hand man, the person who made himself indispensable to the former president by doing his dirty work so he could stay in power. By the way, Trump could have paid Giuliani's bills incurred for doing Trump's work. But, he is not helping. So, here we are. This is Giuliani's filing for bankruptcy. It's 24 pages, voluntary petition for individuals filing. It says 24 pages, and it actually goes to the depths. It's pretty incredible. The details half a billion dollars in debt. I mean, just remember, Rudy Giuliani and all of this talking about America's mayor and to greatness that he once had, was worth $52 million at one point, $52 million. He told \"Time Magazine\" years ago that he was raking in lucrative consulting fees after he had been mayor of New York from all over the world because he had, quote, done some remarkable things. Well, perhaps not the humility there, but it was true. Now, Giuliani owes nearly $150 million to just two people, two Georgia election workers that he defamed. The bankruptcy filing as I said nearly half a billion, $1.7 in legal fees -- $1.7 million, I'm sorry, nearly a million dollars in back taxes due to the IRS and New York state, $30,000 in phone bills. It's all outlined here. Again, it's 24 pages of a voluntary filing. And it comes as there are developments as well in Trump's January 6th case tonight because the special counsel, Jack Smith, again filing with the Supreme Court, demanding that the court quickly make a decision, a ruling, on Trump's claim that he is immune from charges in connection with January 6th. This has to be decided before the case can move forward. So, Smith is making the argument today that, quote, the public interested in a prompt resolution of this case favors an immediate definitive decision by this court, the charges here are of the utmost gravity, this case involves for the first time in our nation's history criminal charges against the former president based on his actions while in office. So, Jack Smith wants this to move quickly, to adjudicate it, to get it to trial, to get an answer to voters before the election. Trump's lawyers are trying to do the opposite. They're asking the court not to intervene, a move that can delay the start of Trump's trial which is currently slated for March 4th, the day before the crucial Super Tuesday in the GOP primary. And as Trump tries to delay that, he is now facing a disgraced, bankrupt former attorney, who knows more about where skeletons are than almost anyone else. And, by the way, Giuliani's dire straits and aspirations are not just limited to this bankruptcy filing. And we take a look at the lawsuits Giuliani still faces. That includes three defamation cases, a lawsuit from Hunter Biden, by the way, he includes possibly having to pay that in his bankruptcy filing, and a lawsuit over unpaid legal bills. So, all of this is still out there. There's a lot to break down here tonight, several moving cases this hour. I want to start with Kara Scannell, though. She's OUTFRONT in New York. And, Kara, you've been going to these 24 pages, and there's a lot of information in here. It really fascinating, what stands out to you?",

Trump now is trying to delay this case with a special counsel, Jack Smith. And Jack Smith today asked the Supreme Court again, move quickly, he says, bypass the appeals process, give a ruling on whether Trump is immune from the alleged crime he committed in office regarding efforts to overturn the 2020 election. The question is, Professor, will Jack Smith prevail? Will the Supreme Court move on this?",

And the Supreme Court is undoubtedly going to recognize that the strategy of delay, delay, delay, which is inconsistent with the very fact that Donald Trump asked for an appeal on this issue before the trial on the ground that every day that the threat of a trial hangs over him, his rights are violated. He's trying to have it both ways. He's saying, I'm entitled to a quick ruling, but not so quick as to --",

Now, this is a phone call. According to a phone call on November 17th, 2020, Trump is on the phone call, right? So, Trump is on the phone call with just people certifying an election in a state, and he is telling the two Republicans that they look, quote, terrible that they signed the certification adding, quote, we got the fight for our country. We can't let these people take our country away from us, later saying he'd take care of lawyers for them. According to this report, which is just breaking, the chairwoman of the Republican National Committee, Ronna McDaniel, was also on the call and then told the two canvassers, quote, if you can go home tonight, do not sign it, we will get you attorneys. And that's when Trump replied, quote, we'll take care of that. Craig Mauger who broke the story is -- from \"Detroit News\" joins me on the phone. Craig, I just have a chance here to read this as you -- as this is crossing, your breaking news. I just want to emphasize, this is at best time the president of United States on tape recorded for four minutes of a longer exchange talking, pressuring these individuals. You've heard much of this tape. Can you tell us what you hear Trump say? CRAIG MAUGER, REPORTER, THE DETROIT NEWS (via telephone):  What I heard listening to the audio of this conversation was the then president of the United States encouraging, pressuring, contending, arguing in favor of these two Republican county canvassers not signing the certification of the 2020 election for Wayne County. Wayne County is a Democratic stronghold in Michigan and the state's largest county as well.",

There was immense pressure put on them, there were a lot of arguments made to members of the public and public comment, encouraging them to certify and eventually deal with brokers.The Republicans agreed to both certify the elections, both to certify, if they could also demand an audit be done on the election. So, with that deal, they voted to certify the election. However, after casting that pivotal vote, they left the meeting without signing the statement of votes, you know, confirming what the vote tallies were in Wayne County.

It's an incident that was filmed by an immigration activist who is in the area working on a project about public safety. And this happened on December 12th. Now, the Texas military department denies that the members didn't help when asked.

They had the ability to return the short distance back to the Mexican shore. The soldiers remained on site to monitor the situation. But, Erin, it is situations like this that underscore how untenable the U.S.-Mexico border has become as more migrants cross on a daily basis. And just today, President Biden speaking with Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador about replacing pressure on the Mexican counterpart, to supply more assistance to stem the flow of migrants. Now, the two agreed that urgently, enforcement is needed. And senior U.S. officials are heading down to Mexico in the coming days to continuing those discussions -- Erin.",
