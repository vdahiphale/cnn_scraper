Chris Christie, who is the chief Trump critic, or at least a best-known Trump critic of them all within Republican circles running for president, look at this, a minus 44- point net favorability rating with Republicans.

Encouraging supporters to donate saying, I think today is a great day to give to my campaign. They posted. I'm joined now by CNN political analyst and White House reporter for the Associated Press Seung Min Kim. Thank you so much for being on. First, Trump's mugshot being used to fundraise.

And that certainly has applied here, and that certainly is what -- is an attack that the president and his team are taking.They have said on the -- on the former president's indictments, whether it's the cases in New York or these most cases -- most recent cases in Georgia, they are taking a vow of silence. And a lot of it is because in the two cases that are brought by the federal government that are brought under the special counsel, Jack Smith, he's getting a lot of you know pushback from Republicans saying it is Biden's Justice Department that is doing this. Now, let's point out that Attorney General Merrick Garland appointed a special counsel to handle these matters, take it out of the Justice Department. But President Biden doesn't want to be seen anywhere near -- any -- doesn't want to get any notion of sort of being involved in matters involving -- the criminal matters involving Donald Trump at all.

And that is not a great number for members of your own party to think of you on matters as such -- as so important to your reelection chances as the economy.Now, you know, some may think that he hasn't done far enough to improve the economic stances. You know, a lot of Democrats obviously support the broader so-called Bidenomics agenda. So right now -- right now, they're on a very aggressive sales pitch. You're going to have more and more events. They really want to make that connection between what the president has done in his first two years in office and the tangible impact on everyday people's lives.

Well, first of all, it's quite interesting that since Vladimir Putin has spoken about the subject now and of course, offered his condolences, and then also talked about Yevgeny Prigozhin, that it seems as though a lot of other people in Russia are now doing the same as well, including the Kremlin spokesman. And you mentioned the fact that he said any sort of speculation that the Kremlin might have been behind it or the Russian state might have been behind it, which once again, the Kremlin blames on the West, that all of that is an absolutely -- an absolute lie.He also confirmed that there is an investigation going on and that there would be a genetic examination of all of the debris and of course also of the bodies. And then the Kremlin says that they would say no more. It was quite interesting because all this happened on a conference call with journalists and the Kremlin spokesman. And he was actually asked there whether or not Vladimir Putin might attend the funeral of Yevgeny Prigozhin. And to that, the Kremlin spokesman said they simply weren't sure about the timings at this point in time. But again, right now, there are more people inside Russia who are starting to comment on this and also some allies of Vladimir Putin. Alexander Lukashenko of Belarus, for instance, coming out today, of course, part of Wagner moved to Belarus after that mutiny took place. He said he couldn't imagine that Vladimir Putin would be behind all of this. It's also quite interesting to get a picture sort of from on the ground inside Russia, Kate. And there have been some sort of makeshift memorials springing up in various Russian cities to Yevgeny Prigozhin, to also some of the others who were presumably killed in that plane crash. People laying down flowers. And some of the sort of voices that we've heard and seen from the ground are saying that they believe that someone like Yevgeny Prigozhin for an organization like Wagner that he was so defining for that organization that he probably couldn't be easily replaced as many people who were speaking there have put it. So, that's one of the things that we've also sort of been speaking about over the last couple of days that when it now seems as though large parts possibly the leadership of Wagner seem to have been essentially decapitated if indeed it is confirmed that they have been killed that this -- in the future could be a very different organization than it has been so far.
