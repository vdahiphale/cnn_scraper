The Israeli military says it has begun a new round of what it calls extensive strikes on Hezbollah targets, this time in the Bekaa Valley and several areas in southern Lebanon.Right now, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is hosting a security briefing on those strikes. And all of this has happened just hours after Israel launched an airstrike in the suburbs of Beirut, Lebanon's capital. The IDF claiming the strike killed a senior Hezbollah commander in charge of the group's missile unit. Israel and Hezbollah are trading waves of strikes today, part of a for tat escalation since the war in Gaza began. Israeli attacks on Monday killed more than 500 people in Lebanon, according to the law Lebanese Health Ministry. We have CNN military analyst, retired Air Force Colonel Cedric Leighton, here with us now to talk more about this. And if you could just talk a little bit about the toll that the Israeli military has extracted from Hezbollah so far as we are tracking this new round of strikes in the Bekaa Valley in southern Lebanon. COL. CEDRIC LEIGHTON, (RET), CNN MILITARY ANALYST: Yes. That's actually quite -- quite amazing. Brianna, because when you're looking at all the different things -- this is the Bekaa Valley right here, the Baalbek area. And we have Beirut in this area. And of course, the southern city of Tyre right here. So what the Israelis are basically doing is they're going through a major air campaign. And if you look at this particular area right here, notice the concentration of bomb strikes right in this area. They have about 1,600 -- done about 1,600 strikes in this area, far fewer in this area. But that doesn't mean this isn't important. This is basically the resupply area for the Israelis, right here in the Bekaa Valley. This is the area where Hezbollah could launch things against Israel and every single dot that you see here is a dot that represents one of the targets. And in some cases, multiple targets. Because what they've found is that the Israelis have gone in and they know that some houses are being used as launching sites. I -- and they've warned the civilian population, if you've got a launcher in your -- in your living room, you better leave. If you've got a launcher in your garage, you better leave. If you've got a rocket there, you better evacuate this area. So this is basically also the zone of evacuation as far as the Lebanese are concerned. And the Israelis have told them to leave most of this area.",

There we're people fleeing trying to get away from it.But one of the stated goals of Israel is that you have so many displaced Israelis in the north since October 8th, when Hezbollah has been firing rockets into northern Israel. They want to get those Israelis back to their homes. And that's certainly one of the goals here. Israel, in its quest to make this happen, hasn't ruled out a ground invasion. But can they sustain that, the second front in this war?",

The northern area of Israel, basically from a line right this way, is going to be a critical area for -- for the Israelis to really repopulate.So that is a major goal of Netanyahu's right here. Can they sustain a major operation with all of their forces? That is going to be really tough for them to do. But they have moved the 98th Division from Gaza to this area right here, to the northern area. And if they start calling up the reserves -- so that's going to be a key indicator. If they start calling up more reserves on the Israeli side for the IDF, then it will probably be an indicator that what we have seen here, with all of these strikes in this area, this is basically softening up the target area. And this is where they would then move their forces into to if they did a ground incursion.",

And also say they're heroes amongst you. And they also said there was counselors here ready to serve. We saw those therapy dogs coming in mass also to help the kids, talking to some of the students.

It just strikes me that we so often shift the burden of responding to tragedies like this to schools, of addressing gun violence to schools that have so much to think about every day separate from this threat.

Others were leaders during the actual tragedy. So we rely on each other for that -- that expertise, that -- that learned experience, that lived experience. But as far as financial resources, those are needed as well. Mental health professionals, as was mentioned previously in the segment, mental health professionals are there helping those students and staff right now. But it's critical that all of those folks helping have that trauma training because mental health professionals are wonderful, but there really needs to be that experience and expertise and how to deal with the traumatic event to effectively help everybody through this journey.

KATELYN POLANTZ, CNN SENIOR CRIME &amp; JUSTICE REPORTER: Well, this would be evidence that the Justice Department has collected against Donald Trump in this 2020 election case. A case that they're saying they have evidence that is known publicly, but they also have things that nobody has heard before and they want to put this all in a very large filing. There's been a fight over whether that filing can be submitted to the court. And Judge Tanya Chutkan, the trial judge, overseeing this case against Trump, she says, yes, go ahead. So, Jim and Brianna, there's not going to be a trial before the election against Donald Trump in this case. There's not going to be a final report from the special counsel's office on their findings. But they do have this filing coming that they say is going to contain a lot of meat, 180 pages of legal arguments, or thereabouts, plus exhibits on top of that, evidence that they want to submit to the court. As you said, it will be sent to the court under seal. But they're also going to give Judge Chutkan a redacted version that she can release very quickly. All of this is going to the court on Thursday, so a lot to watch here, especially with so many weeks left until the election.",

She says that Donald Trump's arguing that the Justice Department's own policies prevent them from putting out information into the public in an ongoing investigation about two months before an election. That's not a hard and fast rule at the DOJ. And Judge Chutkan today says he's not explaining why that would hurt him as a criminal defendant in any way. And also, the court isn't bound. Like she can't tell the Justice Department what to do here. And so the judge just is not buying these arguments from Donald Trump as much as his team has tried to push this off as far as they can following this Supreme Court decision around presidential immunity.
