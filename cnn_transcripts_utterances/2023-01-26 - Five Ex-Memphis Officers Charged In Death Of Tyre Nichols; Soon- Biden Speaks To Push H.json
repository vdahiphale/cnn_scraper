      "sentences": "Hello, I'm Victor Blackwell. Welcome to CNN NEWSROOM.Five former officers have been charged in the death of Tyre Nichols. The 29-year-old was killed more than two weeks ago after an encounter with Memphis police. Now, court records show the ex-officers had been charged with second-degree murder, aggravated assault, and kidnapping. They were fired less than a week ago after an internal investigation. Now a source says in the next hour, the district attorney for Memphis will announce the criminal charges. And now a warning, the image you're about to see is disturbing. This is how Nichols looked after his encounter with the police. They pulled Nichols over, they say on suspicions of reckless driving earlier this month. Now, the Nichols family saw the video of the incident and they described the beating of their son as savage. CNN's Don Lemon is in Memphis. He's leading our coverage there. Don, what are your sources telling you about the release of that video?",

They're so coordinated -- coordinating, still meeting, and so that is the plan for now unless it changes. They believe that video will be released sometime tomorrow.To give you an indication of just how bad they think the officers' actions were on this video, the police chief has been speaking out releasing a statement earlier this morning about what she thought about what the officers did and also releasing a statement moments ago.

There is no indication here, no indications that there will be violence. What they're trying to do is tamp down the violence. They know what's on the video, and it's obvious according to the police chief and others that it is bad. It's not good.So, what they're trying to do is get people used to the idea that what they're going to see may be very disturbing, and therefore to try to quell any violence that is a possibility here. But so far, they don't believe that is going to happen. They're just trying to bring the temperature down. Two people who I believe can agree with that, they've been reporting since the very beginning and that is our Shimon Prokupecz and our Sara Sidner, both had been here reporting. Good afternoon to both of you. Since we last spoke this morning on \"CNN THIS MORNING,\" there have been several developments, major developments here, as far as the investigation getting word on the charges of the officers and what's going to be said at that press conference coming up. SHIMON PROKUPECZ, CNN SENIOR CRIME &amp; JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT: Right. So, certainly, the charge is extremely significant here. You are seeing now all five officers charged with murder, kidnapping, assault, and there's an acting in concert counsel, they're all acting together. Those are the allegations, according to the records. The murder charge very significant, obviously. But seeing that kidnapping charge, there's obviously allegations there that the DA is going to claim that they forced, you know, this victim into this location didn't let him leave, they didn't let him free himself. And so that is very significant. Of course, the murder charges are what everyone is going to be thinking about because it's so significant to see five officers in such a case charged with murder. And based on everything we know about this video from the police chief, the sound you just played, and from what the family wanted, it seems that this is what obviously authorities thought was appropriate in this case and bringing these charges second.",

But the family has certainly said that they have raised the issue with how they treated him when they first stopped him, that there wasn't a de-escalation, that they escalated the situation.And think about -- you know, Sara, you talk about his mother and the home, this happens 80 yards or so from his home. And that is also certainly something that is very significant for authorities when they were thinking about this. And you talk about the community and law enforcement all around the country is sort of on edge. It's because I think in many ways, they fear what they know has happened previously in these kinds of situations, like a George Floyd. They have not had an opportunity, I think -- you know, in George Floyd, they didn't have the opportunity to prepare the community for what they were seeing. That was a completely different video. That was a bystander that took a video. This is something that has been in the control in the hands of authorities, something we don't normally experience or see them prepare people for what they're about to see.

And I think that's why we haven't seen the video yet.They're trying to get as much in -- out front of this as possible, firing, charges, all that sort of thing, and get people psychologically ready to see what they're about to see because they're trying to avoid a George Floyd-type situation.

That is not a double jeopardy problem. You can have both federal and state charges relating to the same conduct.And the charges here, the federal charges that could be in play, are what we call a criminal violation of a person's civil rights. And if you want an example, look no further than Minneapolis, the officers involved in the killing of George Floyd. They were charged and convicted in the state of Minnesota.

Consumer spending, that slowed down but it stayed positive. Business spending also stayed positive. The big negative though, was housing. That's not a big surprise that housing has been a negative. That's because mortgage rates have come up so significantly. We also got new numbers today on jobless claims. Initial claims, they unexpectedly dropped to the lowest level since April.
