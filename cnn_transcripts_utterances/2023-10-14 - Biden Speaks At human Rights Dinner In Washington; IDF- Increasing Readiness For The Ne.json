MAI ABUSHAABAN, MOTHER AND SISTER STUCK AT THE GAZA/EGYPT BORDER: Hi, Julia. So thank you so much for having me on your show. Before we begin, I just want to say that my heart aches for all the Palestinians that are currently suffering, those with family members in Gaza, those with friends, and it's just devastating to see this humanitarian crisis unfold. The last I spoke to my family in Gaza was probably a couple hours ago. They do not have a Wi-Fi at the moment, and we have to call them via international calling, and sometimes it's really unstable, and it takes anywhere between two to ten attempts just to get on the line. So it's really terrifying. And a lot of times we don't know what's going on. Everything is up in the air and we're just praying for their safe return.",

On top of that, there -- they have a war going on, there's a blockade. And you're asking 1.1 million people to evacuate into a area that is already overly and densely populated. It's really scary because, A, will they be able to find shelter? And, B, will they be able to safely evacuate? Just this morning, and I was talking to my family, they mentioned that there were people evacuating on the, um, safe route that the IDF designated for a Gaza residence. And more than 70 people were died or were either injured as a result of the bombing on that road. So, um, evacuating for Palestinians in Gaza, does it necessarily mean that you are going towards safety? You know.

Mai, you used a very important word, I think, which is devastation.

It is unclear what happened to the pair, but they're among the tens of thousands of people on the move, after Israel's military called on nearly half of Gaza's population, some 1.1 million people to get south in a matter of hours.But along the safe passages specified by the IDF, utter horror. You're looking at the carnage and chaos on Salah Al Deen Street, one of the designated evacuation routes. In the aftermath of explosions, families killed amid their belongings. CNN has geo-located this video and four other clips from the horrifying scene. The UN calls Israel's evacuation advisory impossible and a violation of the rules of war. And Palestinian officials accuse the IDF of bombing civilians, even as they fled. Dozens of evacuees were killed or wounded by Israeli airstrikes, according to Hamas. CNN has reached out to the Israeli military for comment. The victims are flooding into Gaza's overwhelmed hospitals. And again, it's the youngest caught in the crossfire. Nearly half of Gaza's population is children. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (through translator): What did the children do to deserve this? This woman says, did they fight you? Did they fire rockets? My niece and her whole family are dead. The only survivor is a 2-year-old girl. ABDELAZIZ: The health care system is on the brink, a complete siege making it impossible to get aid into the enclave. And already, there's a shortage of everything, even space in the morgue. We're keeping the dead in ice cream trucks so the bodies don't rot, this the doctor says. Gaza is in crisis. Gaza needs help. For those still able to move south, this is one of the neighborhood's families are expected to flee towards Khan Yunis where Israeli airstrikes have wreaked havoc. This is a genocide, not a war. It's genocide, this man says. And it's an attempt to force all Palestinians out of the Gaza Strip. Finding refuge is proving dangerous and deadly.

We should be a little easy on it when it comes to humanitarian law. No, that's not what the law requires. Now, one thing, you know, with respect to these warnings that I worry about, the last time we saw warnings like this was in 2006 when Israel fought Hezbollah in southern Lebanon. It issued these broad warnings, evacuate southern Lebanon, and it then targeted and killed anybody who was left, just assuming they were Hezbollah when in fact many civilians couldn't flee. They were afraid to flee. And I'm afraid we may see something like that here in Gaza again. These warnings come out. Many people won't go. They're afraid to go. They're unable to move. If Israel now starts indiscriminately bombing civilian neighborhoods pretending that anybody left is Hamas, that's a blatant war crime. That's repeating what happened in 2006.",

Does it -- what's it going to do with the people of Gaza? It may be occupying Gaza. Does it want the people, you know, hating the Israeli government for having slaughtered so many civilians from the air? Or does it recognize that, ultimately, Israelis have to live with Palestinians.

This is something a commander should never say.Now, with respect to President Biden, you know, he, you know, appropriately expressed, you know, utter outrage at what Hamas did. He called this pure unadulterated evil. It was. But he has been much less outspoken in pressing the Israeli military to respond lawfully, you know, maximizing protection for Palestinian civilians. Just in the last day or so, there has been concern about humanitarian aid getting to Palestinian civilians, and that's quite appropriate. But there's still -- I've heard nothing about, you know, other than generic references to the laws of war, nothing really focusing on how this war is fought. You hear, U.S. officials say, oh, you know, the Israelis, they don't target civilians the way Hamas does. That's a very low bar. That's the language Israel's comfortable with.

Now, they haven't unleashed them yet, of course. There's been some confrontation, some exchanges of fire. There have been mortars coming over from the last few hours from the Lebanese side, from Hezbollah positions. The artillery run by the Israeli military here of return fire. There have been rockets come over from Syria as well, and there's been an Israeli response to that, too. But we haven't seen that massive barrage of Hezbollah missiles yet that would constitute an opening up of this -- of this second front, the level of -- you know, the level of confrontation so far, according to the Israeli authorities, has not reached the point of escalation. And so that's something. But, of course, that situation may change very quickly. Once the ground invasion of Gaza begins.

It really doubles down on that -- on that message and doubles up the amount of deterrent capability that the United States can bring to bear in the region, not just deterrence, but also strike capability as well. So if there is action by Hezbollah, or any of the other countries in the region who try to make, who may try and enter the war, once the land invasion of Gaza by the Israeli forces gets underway, I mean, it's possible that the United States could become involved in the fighting at that point, at least in a supporting way to Israeli forces.

So for the Hamas, this is a two-phase operation. It's a 1,500, 2,500, 3,000 people in the offensive phase to do as much damage to Israel as they could all the ground, continue to fire rockets. Some of those rockets might get through and kill people even proving that they could strike Tel Aviv and the airport up there at Ben Gurion Airfield. But that's just the first phase. So they knew there'd be a second phase. Second phase would be a defensive phase. In this phase, they would use their prepared positions. Their underground tunnels. They'd use civilians as human shields. They'd use the media around the world to provoke outrage of what the Israeli offensive operation is doing and they'll -- and they'd call on all our allies to stage big demonstrations in Arab countries to have sympathy attacks in Europe, perhaps in the United States. So this is unfolding right now according to the way we look at it exactly is where Hamas has planned it. Now what they can't know is how effective the Israeli ground operation is going to be. And they can't know whether the Israelis are going to be able to persuade the people of Gaza to get out of the way and that's what the struggle is about today that we're watching. Hamas doesn't want those people to leave. Hamas wants those families there. Hamas wants that little girl that we saw a few moments ago to be right there in the line of fire and be hurt.

But this is, again, what we have seen over the course of the last week is that overwhelmingly the fighting is Hamas. The fighting has been planned by Hamas. The fighting has been perpetrated by Hamas. And, of course, Gaza is where this war is. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Another video claims to show Israeli jets bombing Gaza, but neither is real. This video is actually footage from a video game called ARMA 3. And this is actually video of soccer celebrations in Algeria. It's all part of a tidal wave of viral mis and disinformation circulating around the Israel-Hamas conflict. Adi Cohen works with Memetica, an online threat intelligence service. He's been monitoring misinformation like this, a fake BBC news report that falsely claimed Ukraine had provided weapons to Hamas.
