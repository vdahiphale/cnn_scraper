Congressman, we appreciate you being with us this morning. Spain, Ireland, Norway. What's your view of what they decided and the Israeli response? Do you think this shows that terrorism pays? REP. RO KHANNA (D-CA): No, it doesn't. We should recognize a Palestinian state. That has been the United States' policy, a two- state solution. And 143 countries at the United Nations voted for it. Nelson Mandela called for a Palestinian state when he was in the United States in 1990. And it is time that we recognize that. I don't believe Hamas should have any role in a Palestinian state, but recognizing the self-determination of the Palestinian people and a Palestinian state is in no way saying that Hamas should be involved.",

That doesn't mean that they should go arresting Israeli leaders. I just don't think that that's going to help get to a two-state solution or a peace process.

That bag was with me on a hunting trip that I took in the fall where I was using the rifle that uses that type of ammunition, which is a very, very specific type of hunting ammunition that is hard to source, frankly. I don't ever recall having that in my ammunition. I never saw it whenever I got the bag off the shelf. You know, I did a quick check of the bag, gave it a little shake, you know, off we went. We went through TSA in Oklahoma City. It was never discovered there. And on our way out of TCI (ph) the customs agents kept doing multiple scans of the bag. They basically disassembled the bag in order to find where they had slipped down in between the lining. And they extracted it. The moment they extracted it, I recognized it and, you know, I apologized. I did not - I've never traveled with ammunition before, but I've heard stories of some of my hunting buddies that have, you know, had certain mishaps in the states and I thought, oh my gosh, my mistake.

I - I can't - I haven't tried to let my thoughts go there yet because I'm just so hopeful that it can be resolved in a different way and that 12 years is not what they're going to sentence. It's going to be really hard. The kids, growing up without their dad. That's not ever something we've ever even imagined. Not something I want for them.
