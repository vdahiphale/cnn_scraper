I heard from a source that patient zero, the first agency to detect this and to report it back to Microsoft was the State Department. So, that makes sense from an espionage perspective that the Chinese hackers would go after potentially high-ranking officials at the State Department to try to comb some of their emails for intelligence. I believe CNN was first to report that. And it's one of several agencies that we think have been hit by this. It seems to be a very targeted espionage campaign. They're not trying to sweep up random people's communications. It seems to be high-level people with -- that the Chinese government would be interested in, Phil.",

You know, this is why journalists FOIA things and get an answer three years later.But Beijing can get an answer quicker if they have, you know, a line into the email system of the State Department or others. So, this is very much a developing situation. I would also add that the White House in their on the record statement last night to CNN and others, you could tell there was a little bit of undercurrent of frustration with the fact that they had to report this to Microsoft rather than vice versa. The Biden administration has been pushing agencies - or, I'm sorry, companies, software providers, to improve their security, to get a better handle on when these vulnerabilities are being exploited by hackers. Now, Microsoft is the most popular software company in the world. They literally have, I don't know, a billion users. They have - they numerous, numerous users. So, they have a very wide attack surface, and that's why they're often targeted. Ironically, in the first few months of the Biden administration it was alleged Chinese hackers that hit Microsoft -- a different Microsoft software, and that caused a big hoopla in the administration. So, there's a bit of a less patience here for this kind of vulnerability to go unnoticed, Phil.",

And if you take a look at U.S. futures, you get a sense of what the reaction is on Wall Street. Dow futures popped about 200 points just after this crossed. So, 3 percent. The index increasing 3 percent on an annual basis. That is better than expected. And month-over-month prices increased 0.2 percent. That is better than expected. Core inflation a bit of a different story. So core inflation, guys, this is when you strip away categories like energy and food. And it gives us a better sense of underlying inflation. That index increasing 4.8 percent. So, why is this happening? Well, if you look at this chart here, you see that peak there, that's 9.1 percent in June of last year. So when you're comparing price levels now to price levels then, you can understand that it is a smaller increase, right? And so you see a lower figure now. Also got some help in categories on a monthly basis, like airline fares, they went down, used cars, those prices went down, and household furniture. Now, on an annual basis, gasoline, take a look at this. Remember last year when prices were like $5 a gallon? Well, gasoline prices have come down a lot. Food prices, not so much. Shelter prices, not so much. What does this mean for the Fed? When the Fed meets in two weeks to put this in context, guys, we still expect them to raise rates, even with reports like this. And the reason why is because remember their inflation target is 2 percent. So even with 3 percent on a headline basis, even with 4.8 percent on a core basis, we're still pretty far from their target.",

And right now we are still waiting for President Biden to appear at this event with G-7 leaders. It is there where we are expecting these G-7 leaders will be rolling out some long-term security commitments that they can each make to Ukraine as they're trying to hope - to provide Ukraine with the ability to defend themselves, but also deter possible future attacks.Now, this comes as there had been quite a bit of tension heading into this summit about the idea of Ukraine looking for a pathway to membership within NATO. Ultimately, that is not something that the leaders gave Zelenskyy a clear timeline on here at the summit. But these announcements that are coming from the U.S. and other G-7 allies are expected to give Zelenskyy something to walk away with, some assurance that allies will be there for them in the long term. Now, after this event with G-7 leaders where the president is expected to speak, we will then, a little bit later, see President Biden and Zelenskyy sit down face to face. They already had a brief interaction earlier today as that Ukraine NATO council came together. That was the first time the two men interacted during the summit. But as they sit down, it could give them an opportunity to talk about the differences that they have about that pathway to membership. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan, earlier today, said that President Biden plans to be very straightforward in explaining why he took the position he did at this moment, but he also wants to focus on listening to what Zelenskyy needs right now. The U.S., of course, has been one of Ukraine's top providers of support and heading into this summit the president has really been trying to show that there is strength in unity within the NATO alliance, trying to send a clear message to Russia. So, we will see President Biden and Zelenskyy in just the coming hours as the two men sit down face to face here at the summit.",

You have some heavy lifting, some incredible heavy lifting that you've been doing and you need to continue to do before we can get you on to a path to join NATO. You're not going to join NATO now. That's just not going to happen. Their infrastructure has collapsed. They've had a migration of over millions of people. These are the intellects. These are the ones that have money and have intellectual mobility and the freedom and they've departed Ukraine. Whether they're the right people or not, but they've departed Ukraine. Are then -- are they going to come back and invest in this rebuild? Nobody knows that. Their economy is in the tubes. So, is Ukraine ready to be a fulsome member of NATO?

Ukrainians acknowledge that as well.Have they seen anything from the White House perspective that gives them optimism that perhaps there could be a major breakthrough or there could be a substantial shift in the dynamics that we've seen over the course of the last several months?",

But I think that this White House is willing to be patient with the Ukrainians and understanding that the Ukrainians are following a deliberate strategy with this counteroffensive, and they're not going to be knocked off that strategy by events that may pop up here and there. So, there is hope within the White House that this - that a counteroffensive can make some progress. And there's also an understanding that it hasn't made the progress that it has yet, which is why -- part of why we have seen these cluster munitions get sent out to the Ukrainians. That package approved earlier this week.And also just a general concern about running low on ammunition, which is certainly something that the Ukrainians are dealing with and something that the White House is trying to backfill here. So, I think they're optimistic about the prospects of the counteroffensive, but they're also realistic about it. They're going to do what they can to help. But to the general's point, I mean, you know, the Ukrainians are always going to say, this isn't enough, this isn't fast enough. And that is, ultimately, at the center of some of the frustrations between the White House and the Ukrainians is this notion that Zelenskyy is always going to take a maximalist position. He's going to say, I need 120 percent, hoping that he gets 60 percent. And in some ways it's a strategy that's worked.",
