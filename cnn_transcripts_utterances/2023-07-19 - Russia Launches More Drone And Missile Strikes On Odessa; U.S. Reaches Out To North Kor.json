The mayor of Odessa calling it a fierce air battle, and the scale of which they haven't seen in almost 17 months of war. More than 30 cruise missiles were fired. Ukraine's air force says, five times the number we saw the previous night, and a similar number of attack drones targeting Odessa and other regions. The air force claiming that it shot down more than half of those targets. Well, clearly, Odessa is the key focus here, images surfacing of damage at the port and in residential areas. President Zelenskyy accusing Russia of deliberately targeting infrastructure related to the grain deal. This comes, of course, just two days after Russia pulled out of that deal, sparking international alarm over food prices and supply. And we're now also hearing from the agriculture ministry in Ukraine that says 60,000 tons of grain was actually destroyed in Chornomorsk, another port just down the Black Sea coast. That grain, supposed to ship out through the grain corridors to find under the Black Sea Initiative around 60 days ago. The Russian Ministry of Defense, for its part, makes no mention of grain facilities, claiming it was targeting military and fuel infrastructure and claiming without evidence that all of its targets were hit. President Putin, meanwhile, briefed on Wednesday on a separate incident, this time in Crimea. The pro-Russian head of that region saying that a fire broke out at a military training facility in the east of the peninsula. Video on social media showing rolling explosions. Mid-reports, this was also an ammunition dump. Crimean officials are saying that more than 2,000 local residents had to be evacuated. The cause of that is not yet known.

Really trying to expose, I think, the flip-flopping we've seen from Vladimir Putin as he wrestled with this unprecedented challenge to his power. And so, the appeal that was made here in Prague, the last European capital before Ukraine, to see Russian tanks on its streets in the 60s a long time ago, the appeal to disaffected Russians to spy for the United Kingdom, I think also trying to seize upon that sense of weakness within the Russian elites, discombobulation, confusion. Also, too interesting to point out, Zain, that during this speech, Richard Moore talked about Iran's role in this as a regular supplier of weaponry towards Russia and that some of the drones you heard about there that have been used attacking Odessa over the past days, some of the other military supplies had in fact caused fissures at the very heights of Iran's government, division about whether they should indeed be doing this. And so, some interesting insights certainly and also too, a belief that still despite the slow progress of Ukraine on the battlefield at this stage, Richard Moore did not believe that Russia would regain the momentum on the battlefield at this point, but still interesting to see a man with that access to that kind of information still saying, listen, we really have been watching what's been happening with that failed rebellion in Russia and ourselves being at times baffled and amazed by it.

The U.S. has been actively reaching out to North Korea regarding the American soldier who made a run across the demarcation line into North Korea on Tuesday. But a defense official says they have not heard anything back from Pyongyang. Private Travis King had faced disciplinary action, according to an Army official. Court documents reveal he was brought to a South Korean court on assault charges last year. The incident comes during a sensitive time with Pyongyang ramping up its ballistic missile tests. Two short-range missiles were launched early Wednesdays. CNN's Marc Stewart joins us live now from Tokyo.

Private Travis, or rather, the private king was supposed to be flying to the United States to begin the process of separating from the U.S. military. He was taken to the airport by escorts, but one those escorts left is side, he somehow left the airport and then the next day appeared on this tour of the demilitarized zone and then, to use the words of a government official, willfully made the trek into North Korea. But as far as his insight into all of that, that's a bit mysterious. We have not heard from North Korea. In fact, right now there are no diplomatic relationships between the two nations, so we have no idea on his condition.

Senator, so good to see you. Obviously, President Herzog's role in Israeli politics is largely ceremonial, so I do want to talk about the elephant in the room, and that is, of course, the judicial overhaul happening in Israel right now. How should President Biden walk the fine line between obviously standing shoulder to shoulder with Israel. The U.S. and Israel are allies that go back many years, but at the same time, holding Israel accountable for what is clearly democratic, backsliding. Your thoughts, Senator. CHRIS COONS, U.S. SENATE FOREIGN RELATIONS COMMITTEE: President Herzog gave a very strong and impressive speech today to a joint session of the U.S. Congress and he did speak to that issue of the widespread, nation-wide protest now over many, many weeks about a controversial proposal to revise the judicial laws of Israel in a way that would make the judiciary more subject to action by the legislative and executive branches of government. He spoke generally about the importance of respecting the right to protest and to express one's views peacefully and the importance of reaching consensus in any path forward that might reform the structures of Israeli government. President Herzog has deep credibility. It was his own father who spoke to the American Congress in his role as president, and it was his grandfather who was the chief rabbi of Jerusalem at the time of Israeli independence. So, his role in the Knesset, his role in speaking as a protector of the democratic institutions of Israel, I think was important at this moment. And to your question, Zain, President Biden, who has been very actively engaged in the U.S.-Israel relationship for five decades now, is striking, I think, the appropriate balance of delivering any concerns or criticisms privately and of sustaining this robust and bipartisan relationship.",

The fact that President Biden is meeting with Netanyahu at all at this particular time, at this particular juncture in America and Israeli politics, as the country seems to be sliding towards basically autocracy.

Let me speak more directly to your question. I think it's important that in my caucus, in the Senate, among Democrats, and in the Senate more broadly, that we continue to sustain a decades-long, deep and bipartisan commitment to the U.S.-Israel relationship. You saw that on the floor of the Congress in the House of Representatives here today, where the applause and the positive response to President Herzog's speech was very common, very similar across both parties, both houses. We've got our Vice President, Kamala Harris, and the Speaker of the House, Kevin McCarthy, of standing and applauding at virtually the same moment throughout the entire speech. I do think it's important for us to deliver our criticisms, our questions, our concerns about current Israeli political decisions privately and to not hold back from them. And President Herzog said he welcomes criticism, questions, concerns from his friends in the United States. So, I think that's the approach we need to follow. We are about to take up later tomorrow, the bill that I lead along with Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, that is essential to our contributions to the U.S.-Israel relationship, the development relationship, the security relationship. I expect that to be unanimous in our committee. So, I think there is strong bipartisan support for the U.S.- Israel relationship at the same time that there are concerns about the direction in which Israeli democracy may be going in the weeks and months ahead.",

Obviously, when you have higher fuel costs, it also leadsto the higher cost of pretty much everything, especially food. And President Tinubu is implementing some measures to help poorer Nigerians, including trying to pump more money into the agricultural sector, trying to protect farmers, for example, from being kidnapped for ransom, which can happen in Nigeria. Just walk us through whether or not any of these measures are actually going to make a difference in the short term. BUSARI (on-camera): So, Zain, one of the measures has already hit a roadblock. President Tinubu announced last week that he was planning to give 8000 Naira, which is equivalent to about $10, to the poorest of the poor as a monthly conditional cash payment, and this was going to be done for about six months to about 12 million households. But he faced a barrage of criticism, because quite frankly, it's not just going to touch the sides. We've got inflation of 22.7 percent and like you say, every day, the cost of living increases. You walk into a shop and there's signs everywhere saying, due to current situation, we're forced to increase our prices. It's across the board. So that 8000 Naira per month is just really inadequate. And that money is coming from borrowing. And Nigeria is already in huge public debt. So, he's had to go back to the drawing board and he's going to be announcing new palliative measures to help to ease the burden. And he's faced a lot of criticism also about how this has been handled. Many say there should have been palliative measures announced before this fuel subsidy was removed, Zain.",

The tenuous path towards democracy has proven tobe elusive in several nations across Africa, especially Sudan, where despite numerous ceasefire attempts, fighting rages on. Four years before the current chaos we're seeing today, Sudan seemed to be on a path towards democracy. After tens of thousands of people took to the streets of Khartoum calling for change, the popular uprising succeeded in toppling President Omar al- Bashir, whose nearly 30-year rule was marked by fear, violence and economic collapse. Civilian and military factions agreed to share power in a three- year transition and promised elections would eventually be held. But that never happened. Instead, pro-democracy activists took to the streets again and again, risking their lives, demanding transition to civilian rule. Instead, all they got was empty promises and infighting between two generals leading a nation to the brink of civil war. Time now for The Exchange. The U.N. says that between 2020 and 2022, Africa experienced at least six coups, a sharp rise from the previous two decades. The U.N., along with the African Union, has launched an initiative to help countries going through complex political transitions. Ahunna Eziakonwa is the regional director for Africa at the U.N. development program, and she joins us live now. Ahunna, thank you so much for being with us. I do want to start with Sudan.

And what we are finding is you have a lot of enthusiasm and even warm reception of military rule at the beginning. But you know, it's more like a cry for democracy, for a renewal of democracy.

And they want elections that are fair, that are transparent, and that are inclusive where every citizen feels that their vote really counts, not sham elections that legitimize, you know, existing ruling parties.
