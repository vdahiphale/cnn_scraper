And that is that he believes as does his team, that he could compete in Minnesota come November. Now, Donald Trump also claimed falsely that he actually won the state in 2020, despite us knowing that he lost the state to Joe Biden, by seven points. However, he did come very close to a shocking upset in 2016, when he lost the state to Hillary Clinton by less than two percentage points. But listen, his team has really repeatedly laid out some of the data saying that they believe that he can be competitive in this state and that they plan to have a presence on the ground in Minnesota despite it being a traditionally blue state that really no Republican presidential candidate had won since the 1972. And that, of course, was when Richard Nixon had had that victory. Alayna Treene, CNN, St. Paul, Minnesota. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

And so this is going to be President Biden speaking to the whole black community, the whole black electorate.I don't know if you've ever been to an HBCU graduation, but they very closely resemble a family reunion. It's a big, big deal. Most of the students are the first in their family to get a college degree. And so we can expect them to hear the President lay out everything that he's done. He's not just talking to the students. He's talking to their parents make no mistake about that. He's talking to their grandparents. He's talking to the whole black electorate that he has to turn out in big numbers, if he wants to succeed. You know, the polling numbers, by the way that show Donald Trump surging with black voters that can be turned around in an instant.

Because he didn't have to do it at all.So this is setting it up exactly as President Biden wants it. He wanted it early so that he can recover if there is some kind of a mistake or a gap. He wanted it to be without an audience so that there'll be a minimum of disruption. He wants mics to be cut off so that some of the things that we've seen, some of the disruptions from his opponent, Donald Trump, that we saw four years ago won't be a factor.

Other Trump allies are expected to follow suit in the coming weeks.  BLACKWELL:  And investigators said one of those allies, Rudy Giuliani was hard to find. But on Friday, Arizona state prosecutors say they were able to finally serve Giuliani with the indictment for his alleged role in the fake elector scheme. But prosecutors say it took them weeks to find Trump's former lawyer, but eventually served him last night in Florida. Giuliani is expected to appear before a judge in Arizona on Tuesday.",

He said he used Schiller as a conduit to speak with Trump, to say the Daniels deal was resolved and he was moving forward. But an intense exchange inside the courtroom that could undermine his testimony, Blanche showed records that moments before the brief, one- minute and thirty-second call, Cohen sent a text to Schiller for help with prank calls he was receiving from a 14-year-old. There was no mention of Daniels in the text. Blanche showed the text messages. Cohen said, \"who can I speak to regarding harassing calls to my cell and office, the dope forgot to block his number.\" Schiller responded, \"call me\". Cohen told the defense attorney today he didn't remember the harassing phone calls, but after confronted with them, maintained, he spoke to Schiller and also Trump. Blanche pacing the courtroom, his arms flailing and his voice rising, said to Cohen, \"that was a lie. You did not talk to President Trump on that night. You talked to Keith Schiller about what we just went through, admit it?\" Cohen calmly replied, \"no, sir, I don't know that it's accurate.\" Blanche moved to show the jury texts between Cohen and the team, Cohen writing, \"this number has just been sent to Secret Service for your ongoing and continuous harassing calls over the past three days. If you are a minor, I suggest you notify your parent or guardian.\" The prankster replied, \"I didn't do it. I'm 14. Please don't.\" Cohen responded, \"please, have your parent or guardian contact me before Secret Service reaches out to them.\" Before getting to the phone call, Blanche spent the morning trying to paint Cohen as a vengeful liar. Cohen confirmed he has insulted Trump countless times, including on his \"Mea Culpa\" podcast. Blanche played clips for the jury.",

He ended up teeing off, took a few holes for him to settle in, but he ultimately didn't waste much time cementing himself as a favorite to win the PGA Championship.
