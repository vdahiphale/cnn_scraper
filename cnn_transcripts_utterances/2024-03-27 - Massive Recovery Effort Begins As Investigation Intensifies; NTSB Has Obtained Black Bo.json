Right now investigators are on the cargo ship that brought down the Francis Scott Key Bridge in Baltimore, trying to figure out what went so tragically wrong. We're on the scene with all the breaking developments.Plus, was the 2020 election stolen? Of course, there is zero evidence of that. But sources say, it may be a litmus test for potential hires at the RNC, now that Donald Trump is the party's presumptive nominee. And Barack Obama, Bill Clinton, Queen Latifah and Lizzo, they're all part of the Biden campaigns new push to get out the vote. And we have new reporting on what role Joe Biden's former boss will play on the trail. I'm Dana Bash. Let's go behind the headlines at Inside Politics. We will start in Baltimore this hour. This what you're looking at is all that is left of the Francis Scott Key Bridge. Divers continue to search for bodies of the six people who were presumed dead. Today the National Transportation Safety Board chairwoman says, her team recovered the so-called black box from the ship that hit the bridge, hopefully providing new clues on what happened. CNN's Gabe Cohen is on the scene in Baltimore. Gabe, are you hearing anything yet from those officials who have found the black box about what could be in it? What it could tell us?",

Though, I can tell you we are expecting an update from officials at a press conference in the next 30 minutes or so, although that timeline a little bit fluid. But we do know that about two dozen NTSB investigators are here. They have been on that ship. And they are interviewing the crew and collecting electronics including what you mentioned that data recorder, essentially the black box of the ship.It is at a federal facility right now. It's being analyzed. And we have been told that at some point today, it could be at that press conference in a little while. But they were expecting at some point today, they would be able to offer a little bit better timeline of how this played out. What led up to the catastrophe, including that near total blackout on the ship in the moments before it crashed into the column of the bridge, where the pilot lost power, lost the ability to steer the vessel and ultimately, it ended in that collapse. And I can also tell you, Dana, in terms of that search and recovery effort, conditions are brutal out here. The rain has really picked up, conditions on the water presumably even worse than where I'm standing now. There are choppy waves out there, visibility is low, it is cold. And it's difficult for those divers who are working to find the six missing construction workers. And look we're starting to hear talk as well about actually removing those massive pieces of the bridge that are still there in the river. That is going to take a lot of time, though. Officials not ready to really talk about rebuilding this bridge, although we have heard Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg talk a little bit about that. Here's what he said about the recovery ahead here in Baltimore. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

So, we're rapidly approaching if they haven't depower the voyage data recorder yet and removed it from the ship to take for read out to the lab, then they should do so immediately. I assume they already have. I would hope so. And then any other perishable evidence should be collected rapidly. So that it doesn't suffer, you know, loss from the elements and from time override.",

Sources tell CNN the RNC officials that new ones that Trump installed. They're asking potential new hires whether they believe the 2020 election was stolen. There is of course, no evidence of widespread election fraud in the last presidential race.Joining me now to discuss this and much more, Jeff Mason from Reuters, CNN's Alayna Treene, who brought us this new reporting, Bloomberg's Mario Parker, and Republican strategist and former RNC communications director, Doug Heye. Alayna, I want to go to you first. I should say the Washington Post reported this first. You and Daniel Strauss have done some amazing reporting on this as well. Part of your story reads as follows. Trump advisers have asked current and potential RNC employees about their views of fraud during the 2020 election, with the question serving as an apparently litmus test for hiring. Trump advisers have also told potential new hires that they should plan to move to West Palm Beach, Florida, where Trump's campaign is centered. That second part is pretty normal. You go where the campaign is? OK. Maybe -- may be less over for the RNC, but it's more normal than the first part, right. What are you hearing?",

And they felt that -- essentially, they argued, is this some sort of loyalty tests to show our loyalty to Donald Trump.But also, it was described as a lot of these people are -- those who have worked in key states, already in battleground states and where they're looking to maybe hire people in some of these battleground states. And the argument from the campaign and the RNC is, we want to just know where people are on this, right. But of course, I think the context here is what's really important. One, this comes after the RNC and the Trump campaign have effectively merge their operations. I mean, when I talked to trump campaign advisers, when I talked to people at the RNC, they argue they're operating largely as one and the same. And a key focus of both the Trump campaign and the RNC is what they call election integrity and kind of previewing that they're going to be looking very closely at claims of fraud, even as we lead into November. And that's also something that Donald Trump, we know, very much cares about. It's something that really led to that fracturing of the relationship between him and Ronna McDaniel. He still privately harbors resentment toward her for what he argues was not -- the RNC not doing enough around the 2020 election in his claims of fraud.
