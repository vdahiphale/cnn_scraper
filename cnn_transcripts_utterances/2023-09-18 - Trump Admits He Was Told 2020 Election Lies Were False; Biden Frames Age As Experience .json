It doesn't surprise me that people, because you made up the point during your interview, they said he was too old in 2016. They said he was too old in 2020. And as Gavin Newsom made the point, and look at what he has been able to accomplish.So, you know, but again, we keep talking about it. So, it's not surprising that when you ask voters, do you worry about it? When they've seen lots of stories asking about it, sure. And I'll tell you, the internal polling that I've seen, and also if you look at what happens when voters go to the polls, they're voting for Joe Biden, they're voting for Democrats 2020, 2022, and that recent special election in Ohio. So, you know, I think it shows that when it comes down to the agenda, people are supportive of what he's trying to do with the country. And I agree with him. I mean, remember, he and Kamala Harris have been presiding over a country in crisis since day one. It was only a couple weeks after January 6th when they took the oath of office.

And this latest work is just a continuation of that kind of fixation.The idea that he would do so at the act of omission is frankly nothing surprising or new in the American context. People have routinely dismissed and rendered invisible the contributions of Black artists and or female artists through a long history around music.
