I think that they have absolutely been normalized. And so that's something we have to watch out for. And, again, I think that it could be dangerous to just say, oh, this sexism is influenced by one person or even foreign parties because these issues have absolutely existed here.",

That doesn't mean everyone supports that. But it is gaining traction. What do you say to the women watching right now who do have real concern that perhaps some of their rights will be rolled back under a Trump presidency? What do you say to them?",

      "sentences": "I think if people have real concern, they probably should get their information somewhere not Reddit.Look, if having access to abortion was a number one issue for you in this election, then the top of the ticket didn't matter, because post- Dobbs, it's a state's issue. And if having access or pushing pro-life agenda was a number one issue to you, that meant the top of the ticket didn't matter to you, because post-Dobbs, it's back to the states. The Dobbs decision said that this issue is now up to the people and their representatives. And so if you live in a state where that access has been more restricted or access is completely unrestricted, both states, of course, exist, then you can make decisions based on where you live and you can vote on that way. But this idea that post-Dobbs, Trump wasn't clear, I don't think that that's entirely accurate. I think he was very clear. He said he would not sign an abortion ban. He said he did not support having that be decided at the federal level. He said he supported the repeal of Roe, which was simply Dobbs, which put it back to the states. And so I think that the fearmongering and the trying to make people terrified of their own government didn't work as an election campaign. And I think moving forward, we just need to speak with a little bit more truth and honesty about what the threats are and are not.",

And I do think that's a really relevant part of this conversation as well, because, Margaret, to bring you back in, these 10 states had abortion the ballot this election cycle. And seven of them -- we have a map up here -- seven of them were successful in protecting reproductive rights, including states where Trump won, like Missouri and Arizona. What do you think about that, the idea that the electorate, that voters largely indicated they want abortion access enshrined into state constitutions, but also rejected a presidential candidate who positioned herself as a champion of reproductive rights, Margaret.",

      "sentences": "Well, Pamela, we expect this meeting between President Joe Biden and Israeli President Isaac Herzog to kick off any minute now.It is unclear, though, whether President Biden will specifically bring up this 30-day deadline that is today for Israel to meet some standards to try to surge additional humanitarian aid into Gaza. You will remember that, about a month ago on this day, Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin had sent a letter to Israel outlining certain steps they wanted them to take to surge more aid into Gaza, while also saying that, if they did not, it could risk violating U.S. law that governs foreign military assistance, really raising questions about whether the U.S. might withhold any additional military aid for Israel. Now, sources have told our colleagues M.J. Lee and Jenny Hansler that they are not expecting any formal announcement from the U.S. today or any formal report on this matter. There is a belief within the U.S. government that there are more steps that Israel can take, but so far the White House and the State Department in the U.S. have not outlined whether they will be responding in any way to this 30-day deadline. Now, as you noted, there is a group of about eight humanitarian aid organizations who have said that Israel has not met those standards that were set by the U.S., part of those standards including about 350 humanitarian aid trucks going into Gaza each day and about 50 to 100 commercial trucks being able to enter in Gaza. These aid groups say that that simply was not met. But this meeting is also playing out not just as there is this deadline for Israel to surge more aid into Gaza, but also as the U.S. is quite eager to end this conflict in the Middle East. But, so far, it seems that those cease-fire and hostage release talks really have been at a standstill, leaving open the question of whether this can even be achieved before President Biden leaves office in January.",

So if they wanted to exert the leverage that they have, they could. Indications from the reporting that M.J. Lee has from sources that the Biden administration isn't going to make any policy changes in response to this letter and what Israel has not done when it comes to surging resources to make sure that humanitarian situation in Gaza is in a better place than it was 30 days ago. The fact that they're not going to make policy changes is going to create a lot of criticism for them. It's going to open the floodgates because you have these humanitarian organizations who are saying not only has Israel not lived up to the criteria that were very explicitly laid out by the Biden administration, by the secretary of state and by the secretary of defense, but also that Israel has made the conditions even worse in Gaza in the last 30 days. So, these humanitarian and aid organizations, rest assured they're going to be quite frustrated that the Biden administration penned this letter and now isn't actually going to do anything with the pressure, with the threats that they said could potentially be imposed if Israel didn't follow through. So I think that's an area to watch. It also begs the question as to how effective a letter like this even was to send. BROWN:  Right.",

Authorities say that's because there was groups of people who were throwing around stones, wooden pallets, poles, and, yes, fireworks, some of those fireworks landing in that tram, setting it ablaze. Riot police were quick to move into the square in the western part of the city. They made three arrests, according to the authorities. They warned people to stay away. And this is just the latest round of arrests. As you mentioned, there's been unrest, violence in Amsterdam for days now that really crescendoed around this football match between a local Israeli team and a local Dutch team on Thursday evening. After that match, dozens of Israeli soccer fans were chased down, beaten, wounded, injured. The violence was described as antisemitic by Dutch authorities and foreign leaders. Prime Minister Netanyahu scrambled planes to evacuate Israeli citizens still in Amsterdam. At the time, the Dutch prime minister was quick to hop on the phone with Prime Minister Netanyahu and promised that calm would return to Amsterdam. Israel's foreign minister said he expected to see arrests, he expected to see severe punishment for any perpetrators. And, clearly, you see that the Dutch authorities are making those moves on the ground, trying to restore calm and bring any assailants to justice.",

They have also asked people to submit any social media videos, to submit any material that might be able to help them identify the assailants behind this attack. Again, the Dutch prime minister was unequivocal in his language. He described these attacks as horrific, as antisemitic, said that they are appalling and shamed the country, absolutely vowed to take these steps. But Prime Minister Netanyahu has said he will take his own steps as well.

Now, I am still curious if she changes her mind, because, one, I was told that there were people who really wanted her to go within Trump's orbit, thought it was very important for the former president. And, two, I was also told when she went to Rosalynn Carter's funeral, that part of the reason that she went was because she didn't want the media narrative around the fact that she wasn't attending. So this idea that now this has become a story makes me wonder if she will shift her thinking at all. But, as we know, she made it very clear on the campaign trail that she really wants nothing to do with this. I mean, she appeared three times total in the span of two years. One was at his announcement. The second was at Madison Square Garden, where she made brief remarks. And then the third was standing on that stage on election night. And we were told that's because she didn't want to be in the spotlight. Now, there isn't a huge amount of pushback from Donald Trump's team, but obviously a lot of questions as they break another norm with her not showing up. I will say the biggest moment we saw in the campaign of her not being there was with that debate with President Joe Biden. Everyone else in the family was there. Everybody's families were there. I mean, that is a key moment in any campaign to have that first debate and she was nowhere to be seen.",
