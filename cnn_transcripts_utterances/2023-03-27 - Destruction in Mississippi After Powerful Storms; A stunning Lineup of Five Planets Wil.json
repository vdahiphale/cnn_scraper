Scientists say Venus is most similar in size though its atmosphere is said to be a poisonous inferno. This Tuesday we`re going to be able to look up into the nighttime sky and see a rare phenomenon, a parade of planets and one of them is Venus. Now, it`s more common to be able to see two or three planets in what`s called a planetary parade or planetary alignment. But this time, experts say, we`re going to be able to see five planets at the same time, all lined up beneath the moon in the same part of the sky like pearls on a necklace, they say. They also say that the sky has to be clear and that our best chance to see this planetary parade will be by looking towards the horizon in the west just after sunset. Are you going to be watching? If so, snap a pic and tag me at Coy Wire. Have you ever had anything delivered to your home via drone? The idea of having hovering crafts, dropping packages at our doorsteps has been around for years, but it`s not anywhere near mainstream yet. Because of regulations from the Federal Aviation Agency, or FAA, and because of neighborhood safety and privacy concerns, those are just some of the factors that have hampered companies abilities to deliver any sort of product or food from above. But the race for drone deliveries is heating up, and a fully autonomous home delivery future is closer than ever. The startup Zipline is giving us a closer look at what that future might look like. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) KELLER RINAUDO CLIFFTON, CO-FOUNDER &amp; CEO, ZIPLINE:  What we`ve heard again and again and again is that customers really also want a way of delivering directly to homes. And so, over the last three and a half years, Zipline has been designing all the technology. But behind the scenes, to enable instant autonomous home delivery. They can be less expensive. There`s zero emission, and it`s just a better delivery experience to boot. It`s more reliable, it can operate with higher service level guarantees, and it can serve more homes. Ultimately, we do think it`s quite inevitable that you`re going to see this transition towards these more efficient, faster and zero emission ways of delivering. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
