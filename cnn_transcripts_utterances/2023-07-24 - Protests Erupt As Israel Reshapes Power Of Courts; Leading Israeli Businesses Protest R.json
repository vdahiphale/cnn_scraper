Now thousands of Israelis, tens of thousands I'm guessing are still on the streets tonight. They are protesting against the measures. Dozens of people have been arrested outside the Parliament, the Knesset. Today's bill passed by a vote of 64 to zero. Now, that was because opposition lawmakers refused to vote against this, they walked out of the chamber in protest. After the opposition lawmakers walked out, their move was intended to send a message that the country has become a dictatorship. Following the vote, the prime minister said there is room for agreement. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER (through translator): We all agreed that Israel must stay a strong democracy and to maintain the rights of everyone not to become a Halachic state and the judicial and the law system will not be controlled and ruled by any side.

      "sentences": "I mean, this was important just in the fact that it was the first of the legislation to actually pass and it does havea major impact because the Supreme Court is the really only check on government actions because of the parliamentary system and the way the parties in power work. And so by removing their ability to stop government actions, because the Supreme Court deems it unreasonable, that will obviously pave the way for things like ministerial appointments that before have been blocked. And now, whoever is prime minister can appoint whoever they want as minister. Now, for those who are in favor of this, they say that's exactly how a democracy should work. If the voters voted these people in, they should be able to serve, but what's down the pipeline will likely potentially have more impact, because these are things for example, like how judges themselves are selected and that is probably going to be one of the biggest major fights coming up, it will be about the judges' selection committees and a few of the other issues. Now in his televised speech to the country, Benjamin Netanyahu is still saying that he was extending a hand to the opposition saying that he's willing to delay further legislation till November in order to have time for negotiations. The question, of course, how those negotiations will look, especially after what's happened in the last few days with the last minute negotiations over this specific legislation trying to delay it, having fallen apart so spectacularly in the last few minutes really before this vote came through, so much so that the opposition lawmakers just walked off the parliamentary floor in protest instead of voting against it. And now, we are seeing these protests. The Israeli Medical Association is announcing a strike. There could be more strikes, and we still have those questions of those military reservists and whether they will still heed the call to serve, because this legislation has now passed.",

As we can see, there seems to be some sort of negotiations also going on right now between the police and the protesters, but I think a lot of the people who are out here on the street, they do indeed believe that potentially, time is running out for them. One of the things that you mentioned that Hadas mentioned as well, is that the Reasonableness Act that was passed today by the Knesset, that is only one of several measures that this government wants to take that would essentially take more power away from the Supreme Court of this country, also make it easier for the government to appoint judges, and I think that many people here feel that their moment could be slipping away as well and they don't want it to slip away. And that's why we're seeing so many people who are coming out here, who are saying that they want to stand in the streets and I think there's several things that are important about that, Richard, we have seen a lot of families here among the protesters, people coming here with their teenage children to say, look, at this point in time, we took a stand for democracy in Israel, because it's so important and they do feel that this country is potentially at such a turning point as they feel that it is such a dangerous turning point, that right now, they believe they simply can't be silent -- Richard.",

Two of the country's largest malls were closed, their stores 200 tech company said they would either close or let their staff attend the rallies. A recent survey suggests the reforms will have a major impact on Israel's vital tech sector. It found some 68 percent of startups have begun legal and financial steps like withdrawing cash reserves, moving their headquarters out of Israel, relocating staff, and conducting layoffs. Merav Bahat is the co-founder and CEO of Dazz in New York. She is with me now. The problem with, of course, threats is that you don't see the results until after it has happened, and the threat is carried out and in many cases, the threats aren't carried out. But is it your view that there will be more tech leaving? MERAV BAHAT, CO-FOUNDER AND CEO, DAZZ: Yes, so absolutely. I think at the short term, we're going to see more tech leaving, we're going to see less investments, but I'm really optimistic that this is going to change with time, and I think that Israeli tech is really, really strong. Investors want to invest in Israel and that is going to change. They will continue to invest. We are going to continuously see the growth in the frustration of Israel. It's just a matter of time that, you know, we need to go the streets.
