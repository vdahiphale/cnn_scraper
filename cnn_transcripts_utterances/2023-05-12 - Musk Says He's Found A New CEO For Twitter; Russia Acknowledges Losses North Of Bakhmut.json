      "sentences": "A warm welcome to First Move. Fantastic to have you with us this Friday. Almost the end of another busyweek, but not quite yet. Still ahead and coming up this hour, a new Twitter CEO Chief Twitt Elon Musk saying he has hired a woman who will lead the social media company. I think there's been a sigh of relief for Tesla investors on this news. That stock higher. Plus, secret support for Russia? A U.S. envoy accusing South Africa of providing weapons to Moscow. Our live report just ahead. And forget Concord. It's all about hypersonic travel. We'll talk to the designers of a plane that can travel at nine times the speed of sound. That means you can fly from Tokyo to New York in just 1 hour. Wowzers. But first, fly by Wall Street. U.S. features in the green ahead of Mother's Day in the United States this weekend. Regional Bank PacWest up pre-market after losing more than 20 percent during Thursday's session. Over in Asia, stocks closed mostly lower. Hong Kong, Shanghai and Seoul all ended the week in negative territory. As you can see there. This after a series of weak economic data from China, including shrinking import growth and slower export growth. And lots to get to this hour. But we do begin today with the latest from Ukraine and new developments in the fight for Bakhmut. Russia acknowledging its forces have pulled back on the north side of the city, saying they've moved to more advantageous positions. The Ukrainians say they've pushed Russian forces back by around 2 kilometers. It comes as the leader of the Wagner Russian mercenary group invites Russia's Defense Minister to come and see the situation on the ground. His forces are on the front lines in Bakhmut and he repeatedly complained in public that they're not getting enough ammunition and support. Sam Kiley joins once again this time from Dnipro. Sam, great to have you with us. Perhaps an unavoidable admission from the Russians here.",

      "sentences": "Yes, completely unavoidable, I think is exactly the right words there because, of course,there is video evidence applied to CNN from May the 8th showing the results of the Ukrainian attack on Russian positions of the 72nd Brigade. That's part of the regular army and indeed of Wagner. Now, a commander on the ground there has told our own Nic Robertson and his team that the dead that they had routed, the forces that they had driven from that location were indeed Wagner mercenaries. And then it was the 72nd Brigade from the Russian Armed Forces that stood and fought. Now, this is significant in the context of Prigozhin's ongoing, very public, very aggressive spat with the Kremlin and indeed the Russian Ministry of Defense, because what it demonstrates is fractions and fractiousness within the Russian Armed Forces. That bode very well for the Ukrainians if that's the way that the Russians are going to be doing business on the battlefield. If they are having infighting, if they are blaming different units for military tactical failures, then they are vulnerable to collapse. And it is collapsing the Russian Armed Forces breaking their will to fight, ultimately, which is going to be the objective of the summer offensive when it gets underway, Julia.",

The South African presidency said there's no evidence to back up the claim. The U.S. ambassador, meanwhile, said he would bet his life, quote, that it did happen. David McKenzie is in Johannesburg for us now. David, I have a couple of questions on this.

To answer your first question now, there hasn't been any direct evidence shared with the public. It's kind of unclear whether it's been shared with some aspects of the South African government. The government spokesman, the presidential spokesman told me that the U.S. would only -- said they would only share it with an independent inquiry if that was set up. And they say they're going to do that. Why now? Well, I think, in part, it's the fact that the U.S. government has, over time, grown more frustrated with the South African government saying that they are neutral when it comes to the Russian invasion of Ukraine. But acting at least in the eyes of the U.S. government, not quite neutral in terms of hosting naval exercises with the Russians and the Chinese, making multiple statements that are seen by many as pro-Russian, and now this allegation that the South Africans or someone in South Africa supplied arms and ammunition in a covert operation, it seems, overnight, in the nighttime hours in December of this sanctioned Russian vessel. So it could be one of those things. Julia?",

      "sentences": "Well, actually what you see in front of us -- and I'm just off camera, so you can see better --is within just the last two or three minutes, there's been an Israeli airstrike in the Sheikh Zayed area of northern Gaza. We don't know the target -- the targets, but certainly this isn't the first that we've seen today. In fact, we've seen a variety of strikes. Some of these strikes are what are called knock -- preceded by what's called a knock on the roof, whereby a small bomb is dropped above the building to warn the inhabitants to leave. In other instances, somebody from the Israeli military actually calls people in the house to tell them to leave. And what we've seen today is a pretty steady Israeli strikes, not constant, but steady on the Gaza Strip, not only the northern part, but also in the south, in the Rafah area as well. Just a few hours ago, we saw two large barrages of missiles fired out of Gaza. They were intercepted right above our heads. No targets were struck, we understand, in those strikes. But yes, those previous strikes that were targeted in the direction of Jerusalem, that's the first time that that has happened since 2021. And that certainly raises the temperature of this now four-day-old conflict that's going on. Now what's -- another interesting thing is, in previous conflicts between Gaza and Israel, Israel always said that they hold Hamas, which essentially rules Gaza to be responsible for anything that happens in Gaza, certainly in terms of missiles being fired out of it. In this round, which we have not heard that, Israel says that they're going after Islamic Jihad, they have not struck any Hamas targets. There are reports in the Arabic media, however, that there is pressure growing within Israel on the Israeli military to strike some sort of Hamas affiliated targets, to put pressure on that organization to bring an end to these strikes by Islamic Jihad. Now, in other news, there was a press conference in Gaza today where it was said that the power plant that provides power to the more than 2 million people in the Gaza Strip may run out of fuel within the next 72 hours. Keep in mind that the economy in Gaza has come to a complete standstill. There is nothing being exported, nothing being imported. All the crossings are closed. Also, significantly, under normal circumstances, thousands of workers from Gaza have permits to go to Israel, that's come to an end as well. So what we're seeing is that if this goes on much longer, the humanitarian situation inside Gaza is going to become increasingly difficult. Julia?",

And 2018, we actually deployed to Japan. So Andrew is a lieutenant commander in the U.S. Navy Reserves. And we were actually living in Japan doing ship repair for the Navy. And it was living overseas that we realized how big the world really is. And Andrew, as a former professor, and then, you know, at Virgin Orbit, had been watching this new type of rocket engine that had been coming down the pipelines. And he said, you know, there's this new engine that, well, we could send more things to space with it and said, I actually think we could put it on a plane, and we could be home in an hour. So that was really the origin of the idea. And we got back to Southern California. And at some point, this rocket engine, this new type of engine was actually proven. And we said, all right.

But at the end of the day, detonation is just -- it's supersonic combustion. So it's really high-speed combustion. Think camp fire is a really slow burn, and a detonation is a really high speed burn. And so anytime you detonate propellant, you just get more energy from the same amount of fuel. So at the end of the day, if you don't have to carry as much fuel -- rockets, you know, anybody that's launching a rocket is pretty much an entire fuel tank with a tiny little payload at the top. But this rocket engine is so much more efficient that we don't have to carry as much fuel.

So you'll actually take offfrom a runway with normal jet engines, and then get up away from city center, because rockets are loud. And so then you turn on a rocket booster. And it would be about a 10 minute boost to 170,000 feet, which is you'll actually be able to see the curvature of the earth, you'll be able to see the stars. And then from there, you actually become a glider. And so it's a gentle climb. We've actually had the folks at NASA Johnson Space Center, their human factors folks look at kind of the G's [ph] that you would undergo. And it's pretty similar to what you experienced when you take off from a jet or an airplane, you know, on the runway. And it would be about 10 minutes of that and then ultimately just become a glider, slowly bleeding off speed, come down on the other side of the world. And, honestly, that's what the space shuttle did. So that when the shuttle would come out of orbit, it would slow down to about, you know, Mach 10 and then glide from Japan to the United States in like 45 minutes, so we're really just kind of repeating that path.",
