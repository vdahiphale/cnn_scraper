      "sentences": "Jim, of course, this is incredibly significant, and it's the first -- earliest debate in modern presidential campaign history.And the reason is, both candidates agreed to this debate. They want to try and define their opponents, define themselves and, frankly, shake up this race. For all of the changes, all of challenges in the country and the world, this race has largely been much of how it's been for the last several months, if not year. Donald Trump has had a narrow lead nationally and in some battleground states. President Biden has been defending his record. Well, on stage tomorrow evening, President Biden will, of course, try and draw that contrast with former President Donald Trump. Jim, history is probably not our best guide for this, because we have never seen two sitting presidents side by side like this, making the case about one another. But think of all the differences over the last four years. One thing I'm struck by is, we follow these candidates and listen to them and talk to voters. So much has changed that's different, but foreign policy is chief among them. There will be a vast difference in that. Of course, the invasion of Ukraine has happened, the war in the Middle East. But one thing that former President Donald Trump has been saying again and again is that he does not want another World War III. He said that President Biden has led to instability in the world. Of course, President Biden will take the converse view of that. He is heralding his administration as one of building alliances, increasing stability in the world. So, foreign policy often does not decide elections, but look for that to be a central, defining difference between these two candidates, certainly one difference of so many, many between them, Jim.",

It is going to be a throwback, two candidates on stage standing for 90 minutes with two commercial breaks, two moderators. And, interestingly, presidents are never without their advisers. They're rarely without their aides or their note cards. This time, these two sitting presidents, one sitting president, one former president, will be walking into this stage and studio alone. They will not have advisers around them, so they will be taking questions. The answers will be defined by a topic, and they will be talking for two minutes, with their rival getting one minute to respond, and then the original candidate getting one more minute to speak. And the microphone certainly is an issue as well. We saw so much interrupting in the debates four years ago. This time, the microphone will only be on for the candidate who is talking. Of course, the question is, will some of the other sound bleed over? Will that be used to distract President Biden perhaps or vice versa? So, but the big difference, Jim, no audience, of course, but voters certainly will be watching. And, again, we should point out this is in battleground Georgia. Joe Biden was the Democratic winner here four years ago --",

      "sentences": "Well, Jim, nothing traditional about Donald Trump's debate prep, which I guess is not that surprising.He hasn't had any mock debates. He hasn't had someone sitting in for Joe Biden or the moderators, Jake Tapper or Dana Bash. Instead, it has been a series of conversations of what they call -- quote, unquote -- policy sessions focusing on things like abortion, like democracy, how to answer those questions about what happened on January 6 and Donald Trump's role. But what most of his advisers are trying to get Donald Trump to do is to focus on three key issues. As Jeff said, this is really unprecedented to have two sitting -- or one sitting president and one former president up on that stage together. And Donald Trump, they want him to contrast his record to Joe Biden's on three issues, the economy, particularly inflation, crime and immigration. They have seen recent polling that shows that people, voters favor Donald Trump when it comes to these three issues over Joe Biden. And that's what they want Trump to hammer home. Now, one thing we have heard from senior advisers really in the last several days is a tempering of expectations. Remember, they spent months saying that Biden was incompetent, that he couldn't string two words together to make a sentence. Now we are hearing that he is a formidable opponent, a lot of that coming from this idea that he was holed up in Camp David really having this intense debate prep, something, of course, Donald Trump was not doing. Now, we did hear from Trump last night in an interview talking about some of his preparation. Take a listen. (BEGIN AUDIO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES (R) AND CURRENT U.S. PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  I think I have been preparing for it for my whole life, if you want to know the truth.

So his preparation, he sees it as just live life every day, right, engaging in the give-and-take that he does with individuals and out on the stump. He stops, talks to police officers, takes photos. So that's how he's preparing for it, right? And that's probably the best way he can prepare. And, Meghan, how does that affect the debate preparations for President Biden?

And Justice Barrett, if you're in the audience looking ahead, she's toyour far left. And she started out by actually highlighting some of the potential First Amendment concerns here, saying that there were enough statements that came from the administration that were super provocative. And she referred to one example where an official who was frustrated with Facebook that it had removed a particular post involving potential misinformation about COVID-19 said, last time we did this dance, it ended in an insurrection. So she was pointing up some of the, as I said, provocative posts, but then quickly pivoted to the reality is that you need to show an injury to be able to bring a case in federal court. And neither the two states, Missouri and Louisiana, or the five social media users could demonstrate standing. Now, Justice Alito did not read his dissent from the bench.

And it is a long time coming, because when you look at the regulations that are currently in place, they're really focusing on the telephone companies, on the broadcast networks, what are considered public utilities. And there is a major question of if and when these social media companies will be determined to be public utilities, because let's be honest, more people are online than they are on the phone or watching broadcast networks. So there's a question of whether this will be determined. It has not been determined yet. We didn't get sort of a major standard issued by the Supreme Court. There was a question about whether they would issue some sort of standard on when a government reaching out to a social media platform will be considered coercion, would be considered some sort of censorship. We did not get that yet, but we might be getting them in one of these other cases. There are several cases out there. As Paula noted, we're still waiting to hear from the Supreme Court on this. In the meantime, though, this means that things will continue on as they have been. The administration can still reach out to the platforms, flag things for them that they believe violate these platforms' own policies. But the platforms are still free to do what they wish with their own moderation policies.",
