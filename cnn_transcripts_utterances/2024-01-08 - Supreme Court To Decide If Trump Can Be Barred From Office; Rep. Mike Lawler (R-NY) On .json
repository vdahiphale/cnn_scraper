But given Republicans' razor-thin majority in the House, will key swing district members get on board? We're going to talk to one right now -- Congressman Michael Lawler of New York.

When I visited the border last week with Speaker Johnson, it is far worse than even I thought. This is a catastrophe. You have, in Eagle Pass, a facility that can handle 1,000 migrants at a clip.

Lloyd Austin, who is facing a lot of criticism this morning for keeping White House officials, his own deputy, and the president in the dark for days about this hospital stay. He remains in the hospital. You sit on the Intelligence Committee. We are in the midst of -- obviously, the war in Ukraine continues but also what may be an expanding conflict in the Middle East. Do you think it is appropriate how this was handled?",

The murder of civilians in their home, the sexual assaults, the abuse of civilians in the process of this terrorist attack is unthinkably horrible, right, and must be called exactly what it was -- a horrific terrorist attack.And Israel, as a country, has the right to go after those who perpetrated the attack in order to keep their citizens safe into the future. That is indisputable for me. There are also Palestinian civilians on the ground in Gaza and we have seen enormous suffering not just because of shellings of buildings but because it's been so difficult to get humanitarian aid into the area. And so, in a long-term perspective -- and I joined with other colleagues who have an intelligence or a military background and I worked counterterrorism cases pretty much for the entirety of my time with the agency. Terrorism is about, yes -- going after terrorists is about, yes, going after the fighters. It's also about going after the ideology.",

And part of going after the ideology is ensuring that civilians and people who are vulnerable -- vulnerable and victims of a terrorist organization living amidst them -- that those individuals are not suffering unduly. That they have access to food and water, and basic humanitarian necessities.",
