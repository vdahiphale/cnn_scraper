We have been seeing severe weather across the country all week, and now there are concerns the forecast here down on earth, not in the stratosphere, could actually be a problem for the much-anticipated solar eclipse. Meteorologist Elisa Raffa is watching this one for us, and she's joining us now. What are you seeing in terms of forecast now?",

And here's the bullseye where a severe threat would be right over Dallas, parts of southern Arkansas there, right in the path of totality. The jet stream or the path of storminess kind of sitting right there. And that's where we can find that storm development and the clouds.So our risk of seeing some rain is pretty high over parts of Texas, Louisiana, Arkansas. Another storm system up in the northern plains as well. And you can see where we can find some showers as we go into Monday, and that would, of course, come with some cloud cover. So when you look at the cloud cover, you could see it does look pretty cloudy, especially on the southern half of the path of totality here from Texas into Arkansas, maybe a little bit more clear up in New England, places like upstate New York and Vermont on that path of totality. And again, if you're learning what this eclipse even is, we've got the moon that comes around the earth and the sun that's around both of them, where's we're going to get a shadow because the moon is just going to be right in the direct line of the three. And that's what we'll be looking for on Monday.",

And James Baker held out a phone number for the State Department to say, when you're serious, give us a call, you have the number.But what does this actually change, this mounting pressure? As you heard from Arlette, it's unlikely to change any shift towards sending military aid to Israel. But that is precisely what governments around the world, Israel's allies are being asked to do, including here in the U.K. Defense minister, former prime minister and foreign minister David Cameron has said that he has demanded to his Israeli counterpart an immediate investigation into this appalling attack on aid workers. And he said, we want to see that happen very, very soon. The problem here is that all the allies say that Israel has a right to defend itself after what happened on October 7th, but that it must act within the rules of the international world. They are international laws that include not firing on civilian convoys. And let's not forget, this one like the others were heavily coordinated with Israel. This is what the U.N. humanitarian chief told me about the World Central Kitchen assassinations or attacks on Monday. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "Well, John, it was largely, largely a mirror image of the conversation that President Biden had, or the statement that President Biden had issued earlier this week, that he was expressing outrage over this WCK strike. Secretary Austin apparently told the Israeli defense minister that he, too, is outraged by this attack, and he urged them to conduct a swift, thorough, an independent investigation into this attack.And importantly, something that we've heard from other administration officials, as well, they want the results of this investigation to be made public, and they want someone to be held accountable for this tragic mistake, which is what the Israelis are characterizing it as. But the administration is really at this point kind of withholding judgment about whether or not this was deliberate. And for that reason, they are not giving any sense of what whether or not they're going to shift their policy towards Israeli defense and arms sales, which have been ongoing. As we reported earlier this week, the administration is set to approve an $18 billion F-15 sale to the Israelis where the jets won't necessarily be delivered for another four to five years. There are questions about why the administration, while they're expressing outrage over the strike, while they're expressing outrage over the fact that Israel does not appear to be doing enough to protect civilians, is engaging in these arms sales with the Israelis and thereby kind of affirming that they view them as a professional military that is capable of carrying out these operations in a way that is consistent with how the U.S. would expect their allies to. And so while Secretary Austin did reiterate that he is angry about this strike, it remains to be seen whether anything is actually going to change when it comes to concrete U.S. actions, because at this point it does not seem as though the Israelis are necessarily listening to what the U.S. is saying. And we're seeing that play out in real time, of course, with the operation that they're planning in southern Gaza, in Rafah.",

Cranes are still arriving, but their work has hardly started with crews still surveying the scene, leaving the river blocked and the Port of Baltimore at a near standstill. Crews have opened two small channels for essential commercial vessels. We went through them for the first time. COHEN (on camera):  This one is about 14 feet in depth. Officials have said this is the first step toward opening the Port of Baltimore, back up with be first essential commercial vessels being able to pass through it, but the governor has said that for large ships like the Dali to pass through this channel, they need 35 feet of depth. GOV. WES MOORE (D-MD):  We are still a long way from being able to get the size and the cadence of the commercial traffic back to where it was before the collapse.
