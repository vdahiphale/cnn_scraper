We had an incident that caused some confusion, you might say.But president -- but Secretary Blinken had a great trip to China.

One of the fundamental reasons that I believe the U.S.-China relationship is not in the space as with the U.S.-Indian relationship, is that there's an overwhelming respect for each other because we're both democracies.And it's a common Democratic candidate -- character in both our countries that in our people, our diversity, our culture, our open tolerant, robust debate. And I believe that -- we believe in the dignity of every citizen. And it is in America's DNA and I believe in India's DNA, that a whole world -- the whole world has a stake in our success, both of us in maintaining our democracies, makes us appealing partners, and enables us to expand democratic institutions across -- around the world.

They signed a deal during this visit to build high-performance military jet engines in India.President Biden was asked about his comments recently describing the Chinese leader Xi Jinping as a dictator. He did not back away from those comments. President Biden saying it's something that he sees as facts. Modi pressed on ongoing questions about anti-democratic moves in his own country, discrimination, etcetera. He said that democracy runs in our country's veins. He says there is absolutely no discrimination is his -- in his country. We're joined now by CNN Chief International Anchor Christiane Amanpour, also White House National Security Correspondent for The New York Times David Sanger. Christiane, to you first, what is Biden's motivation here in warming up to India at this time? Is that about pulling India closer as the U.S. standoff worsens with Russia, certainly but also China? Is it about making them a friend in all this as best they can?",

And I asked him about the complicated visuals of President Biden's pledge to defend democracy as it collides with autocracy and liberal Democrats such as Modi, and obviously authoritarians, like President Xi.And he said life and the world is complicated. This is about national security in many instances. It's about supply chains, as you heard there. It's also about trying to get the best deal for your own security when you can. He said, if I was to talk to Modi, which I have done many times, I would explain to him that cracking down for instance, on the minority in India is eventually not going to be good, obviously, for the Muslims, but nor for the Hindu majority, either. Because we've seen how ethnic suppression can cause countries to disintegrate. He said, you know, he spoke to Xi, obviously, he knew him well, and to Modi to get them involved in and onboard with the Paris Climate Accord. So, there are many reasons to do it. But there are also many questions about the genuine commitment to democracy in Modi's India.",

We do of course have the breaking news. We're continuing to follow in the search for the missing tourist submersible. The U.S. Coast Guard says they've discovered a debris field on the seafloor in the search area near where the vessel was originally headed to view the Titanic wreckage site. This is the remote-operated vessel that found that debris field. We're going to get an update from the U.S. Coast Guard about these findings in less than an hour. We don't yet know if the debris found is indeed from the Titan. Officials did estimate on Sunday, the crew trapped inside had a total from that point of four days of the oxygen. Today is day five. Officials have sent medical personnel to the site as well as a hyperbaric recompression chamber on the possibility that they would be able to bring folks up alive from the vessel underwater. CNN's Miguel Marquez has been covering this. Miguel, a little under 40 minutes from now, we're going to get an important update from the U.S. Coast Guard, particularly what this debris field could be. What are you hearing where you are?",

It's very, very concerning the way the Coast Guard put that.And the other bit is that they wouldn't think that -- the Coast Guard wouldn't put out that information, knowing the effect that it would have on the community. So, I think there was -- there was hope going into today. I think that news sends a bit of a shock through the community here that something much more catastrophic may have happened to the individuals on board that submersible. But all that said, there is a ton of resources, just several surface ships to 10 surface ships, and airplanes still looking for it. There are ROVs or remote-operated vehicles that can get down to the sea bed now. There's a lot of sonar out there that maps the Titanic, the area around it, and has done for many years now. So, they have a pretty good picture of what's there and what's new. And that is the concern that people have now that whatever this is, indicates something that is new -- that they hadn't seen before. What is not clear as well is whether they have eyes on it, basically, and do they have that the entirety of the sub. So, they are operating on the assumption, as far as we know that this is still a search and rescue mission. But there is a possibility that even though they've gone past the 96 hours of air that they were believed to have when they set out on Sunday, that if they conserve their air, if they -- if they slept, if they were very calm, they could -- they could keep as much oxygen and prolong the time they could stay down there.
