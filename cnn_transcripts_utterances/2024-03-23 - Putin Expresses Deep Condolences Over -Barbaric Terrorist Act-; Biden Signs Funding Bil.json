And we're watching several breaking news stories this hour.In Russia, fast moving developments on the shooting at a Moscow area concert venue that has left more than 130 people dead. And in the U.K. and around the world, shock and sadness over news that Catherine, the Princess of Wales has cancer. CNN anchor and royal correspondent Max Foster is standing by outside Buckingham Palace. We'll take you there in a moment. But first, let's focus on what's happening in Russia, where moments ago, Russian state media published a reported confession from one of the suspected attackers on that concert hall. CNN cannot independently verify the veracity of the report or the statements made by the alleged attacker, which may have been made under duress. President Vladimir Putin is vowing all of those responsible will suffer an -- inevitable punishment after armed gunman opened fire on the crowd. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) (END VIDEO CLIP)",

So, that's their primary objective.And you can see, they are having difficulty kind of putting the pieces of this narrative together. But essentially, it all goes back to Ukraine in their view. And President Putin coming out with that kind of indirect statement or crossing the border and a window prepared for them. So, it's not really clear, but they want to put the finger on Ukraine, and try to go with that narrative. But I think the domestic considerations right now are really, really important.

Of course, during the U.S. withdrawal, ISIS-K was tagged with responsibility for the devastating suicide bomb attacks that killed so many who were trying to flee as well as U.S. Marines and soldiers. And as Jill points out, as Kim points out, ISIS-K, the propaganda, the history has been against Russia, against Afghanistan, against their growing allegiance. So, it's a narrative that makes sense. At the same time, Putin has to rewrite that narrative carefully. One that accepts the rest of the intelligence communities of the world may attribute this to ISIS and ISIS-K. But he needs to, to make this more than just a security failure, but try to recast it as Russia's October 7th.

And they finally did it at 2:00 a.m. It now heads to the president's desk where he's expected to sign it. So, we're not expecting to see any lapse in federal funding. This bill funded the remaining government agencies. So, that includes the Department of Defense, the Department of Homeland Security, and the Department of Health and Human Services, among others. So, now, that the government is funded through this fiscal year, we can just take a step back and realize how chaotic and tumultuous this was. We always knew it was going to be challenging to fund the government in a divided Congress. But this really was next level. Republicans have such a small majority in the House and Democrats control the Senate. And what made this really challenging was Republicans tried to put a number of partisan policies into these appropriations bills, which set up a stalemate and long painstaking negotiations with the Senate. So, we saw lawmakers passing this short-term extension, usually, right up until the 11th hour, until we got to this point. I mean, think about it. Kevin McCarthy essentially lost his job for his handling of this back in October, when Republicans ousted him as Speaker. House Speaker Mike Johnson now is facing a threat from Republican congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene over his handling of the appropriations process. We'll have to see how that plays out. But now that lawmakers have funded the government through the end of this fiscal year, they have time to reflect before they have to do it all again soon, Fred.",

I think what's interesting, you know, it hasn't been 24 hours since that was released. But the change in tone here in the U.K. and across the media has been quite extraordinary.

Former President Donald Trump is now just two days away from the deadline to post nearly a half a billion-dollar bond in his New York civil fraud trial -- well, case rather.This week, Trump claimed that he has nearly $500 million in cash to cover the sum, but his lawyer has since clarified that, saying he doesn't actually have that much money on hand. Trump's lawyers argue it's nearly impossible to get the amount needed for bond. And New Yorks Attorney General Letitia James is now taking steps to possibly seize Trump's assets and properties if he can't pay up. The cash crunch uncertainty is now raising questions about the future of his business empire and how it might impact his campaign for president. Joining us right now to discuss this is David Swerdlick. He is a senior staff editor for \"The New York Times Opinion.\" Great to see you. So this is interesting, David, because the president, especially on the campaign trail, likes to declare that he's a victim. If the attorney general is successful in seizing property, whether it be his bank asset or his properties in real estate, will be able to kind of turn this around in his favor to say, see, here I am a victim again. DAVID SWERDLICK, SENIOR STAFF EDITOR, \"THE NEW YORK TIMES OPINION\": Great to see you too, Fred. Look, President Trump is a wealthy man, but he's not an Elon Musk or a Jeff Bezos or a Robert Smith. he's working in millions, not billions. So over the course of the last few days, he's tried to do something that's very difficult, which is to cry rich and cry poor at the same time. He and his attorneys haven't been able to secure a bond for this almost half billion-dollar judgment. And at the same time, he wants to portray himself as someone who has the money. So he went on Truth Social yesterday saying he had almost $500 million and that this is a political witch hunt. So that basically the judgment is all about draining his coffers so that he can't run for president. It's a real pile up of contradictions. So what the president is doing here is trying to beat the clock, find a way to get a bond or get to this appeal on this case. Because like his criminal trials, Fred, he's trying to race to Election Day. Because if he gets to Election Day, you can make all of this -- and win, key point, all of this go away. If he loses, he probably can't make any of it.",

On the other hand, Fred, I don't think we're going to see seizures next week if he can't come up with a bond. I think that the New York attorney general's office has played this pretty well so far, and they're going to continue to be patient and see this out. The other thing that's going on in the background is that Trump media, which owns Truth Social, is about to merge with Digital World Acquisition, which is a fund that's going to merge with Trump media and then go public. Trump stands to make potentially, at least on paper, billions of dollars.

We can't just move Trump Park or Trump Tower like you can move a three-bedroom house in the suburbs, right? So that's number one. On the political side, Fred, I don't think this is that big of a problem for former President Trump. He's up in the polls in a lot of swing states, President Biden is down in approval ratings, somewhere above or below the 40 percent mark.

In fact, in 2024, about a half of those, some four jackpots, were hit. So that really is quite telling in terms of the numbers here. But then to answer that earlier question, Fred, of why. There are multiple factors in all of this. And we've taken all the numbers of what we've seen in the last 10 years there. One of them is both major lotteries, Mega Millions and Powerball, they basically tweaked the rules last in the last decade, making it even harder to win. So every time that there's no winner, that amount rolls over, gets even larger. And because of that, those jackpots continue to rise. Also rising interest rates may have something to do with it. They actually affect the advertised jackpot, which are actually based on annuities. So a reminder that any winners, they have -- they have the option of either taking the lump sum, in this case, which is $1.1 billion right now, you get about half of that, or the payments over several years. And then, finally, more people are playing. NerdWallet finding that when a jackpot exceeds $1 billion, people who usually don't like to play the lotto will basically throw their hat in the ring and will buy themselves at least one ticket. So more people playing, more money going into this jackpot. And that is one of your answers here. But ultimately, Fred, let's -- let's be real.
