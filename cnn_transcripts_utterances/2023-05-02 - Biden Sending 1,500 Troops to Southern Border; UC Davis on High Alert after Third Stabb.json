The Biden administration, we have just learned, is making plans to send an additional 1,500 active duty troops to the U.S.-Mexico border in anticipation of the influx of migrants from the Title 42 public health authority expiring next week.Title 42 allowed the U.S. to deport people immediately on COVID grounds.

We are learning that the Defense Department plans to send additional active duty troops in support roles.There are currently around 2,500 National Guard troops already along the U.S.-Mexico border. A U.S. official said that at the request of the Department of Homeland Security, DOD is going to provide an additional increase of 1,500 personnel for CPB. They will be doing ground-based detection and monitoring and data entry and warehouse support and we should note that it is not in a law enforcement capacity. But as you said, John, it is part of the administration's plans as they anticipate the lifting of Title 42. With that, the influx of migrants at the U.S.-Mexico border prompting them to take additional measures in the coming days for those numbers and which, by the way, we have seen an increase of. A source said they are seeing 7,000 daily encounters, which is a number that is going to be climbing in the coming days, according to their projections.",

And we can't make a living that way.And so, our proposals are to ensure that there's a writer's room on every single show. And they have refused to even discuss that proposal with us. Another sticking point is that we want to make sure that writers are paid the same in streaming as they are on television. My first show was for TruTV, my second show was for Netflix. The show had the exact same format, but on Netflix, we had no minimums, we had no protections, we were paid less. The residuals are literally 1 percent of what they were under broadcast.

The positions in the wake of the president's phone calls to the top four congressional leaders, to set the meeting one week from today have hard to some degree.The White House made clear they will not negotiate, they want a clean debt ceiling increase. Then they can have a longer discussion on budget issues. Speaker McCarthy was traveling in Israel yesterday. He made it clear that while they understand that the House-passed legislation, which would contain significant cuts to go with or to be part of a debt ceiling increase, is unlikely to be passed by a Democratic Senate, that is their starting line. This is the start of the process. The president said he would not meet with McCarthy on the debt limit and he is still doing that, making this meeting with the four congressional member. But they're sitting down. That starts a process. But there is a limited amount of time to complete the process and avoid financial catastrophe. Janet Yellen said the scale would have an acute and almost immediate widespread effect on families. This is something that has never happened in American history. The way out of this -- and I think this is the real problem right now -- nobody is actually sure. Obviously the two positions are not compatible. There's no way between no negotiations and the Republicans' proposal. What White House officials are talking about formalizing that longer term fiscal budget and spending process. That is a traditional offramp to some degree. How do you formalize something that gives everybody a little win? Speaker McCarthy, how much leeway does he have to make a deal related to that? There's a lot more work to come. And there is not a lot of time, John. BERMAN:  Right. Meanwhile, economic environment is not happy, markets down more than 500 points just before 11:25 am.
