CNN is told there are still about 4,500 civilians, including children, in the region.The Ukrainian military has not made a decision to withdraw from the city but, of course, that is a major question this morning.

That is where the most difficult fighting is taking place according to President Zelenskyy who says those Ukrainian defensive positions are just getting pounded by Russian forces. He says that the Russians are taking significant casualties but we know that the Ukrainians are as well.And this morning, Kaitlan, a spokesman for the Ukrainian military here in Eastern Ukraine says that no decision has been made about whether to pull back from the city but it is clearly something that they are considering at this point as the Russians press forward -- as they try to loop around the city encircling Ukrainian forces in and around the city. The Russians claim that they have taken some territory north of Bakhmut. And now, according to that same spokesman, the Russian forces that are -- that are at the -- at the -- at the front if you will are the most experienced Wagner mercenaries -- fighters who have seen combat elsewhere, like in Syria and in Libya. And Kaitlan, we did speak with a Ukrainian soldier inside the city just yesterday who said that the situation is 100 percent more difficult than Ukrainian officials are willing to admit. But this same soldier saying that they are not going to give the city up without a fight. That they are standing their ground as long as they can, Kaitlan.",

I'm about to get on a boat with a whale scientist and go on an adventure to study those amazing creatures. But while we're here we got this news out of the National Snow and Ice Center in Colorado that for the second year in a row the South Pole is shrinking. The ice down here is shrinking. It's sea ice so it's not affecting sea level rise much the way that when ice cubes in your glass melt they don't spill your drink. But it's very worrying because Antarctica is a continent surrounded by oceans and that sea ice protects those ice shelves from unlocking all of that ice, which if it dumps into the oceans en masse would rearrange every city from Miami to Shanghai along the coasts around the world. So what is troubling about this is the speed that it has declined. Just to give you some perspective, in the early 2000s, it looked like Antarctica was growing even as the Arctic was shrinking in alarming ways and scientists weren't sure why. In 2014, the sea ice around Antarctica, seven million square miles. Now, less than a decade later it's under 700,000 square miles, so that's a 90 percent drop. And they're just worried that this could be a tipping point that makes that vulnerable and then on from there it's just one domino after another of the kind of disasters we really don't want to imagine but have to think about, especially for people -- leaders who live on coasts.",

A new study finds that if you spend that time -- that same amount of time doing moderate exercise that you're going to live longer -- a lot longer than 11 more minutes. Our chief medical correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta joins us now. So, Sanjay, just so -- we went to the break. It was like four minutes ago and this will be like four-five minutes or whatever. So in the time that we went to the break and did this segment people would have -- you would have been done and you would have had some really -- it would have been beneficial to your health. Tell us about it. DR. SANJAY GUPTA, CNN CHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, this is really interesting. Oftentimes when we look at these exercise studies they're sort of presented in binary terms, meaning if you do this amount of exercise that's the sweet spot. That's what you need to do to get the health benefits. What this study really tried to do was say hey, look, let's not think about this in such strict terms and figure out how much benefit you get from lower amounts of exercise or shorter amounts of exercise and movement. So I thought that was pretty interesting. And I'll show you these results but I'll preface by saying it's a big metanalysis. Some 30 million people were sort of analyzed over 10 years and they were looking at moderate forms of exercise like the kinds you see on the screen there. Walking fast, water aerobics, doubles tennis, pushing a lawn mower. Think of it as a type of exercise that gets you breathless enough where you can still talk but you can no longer sing, for example. Now, that's the way they sort of -- they put it to -- how they analyze these types of movements. Here is what they found. They broke this down -- again, 150 minutes a week is what the recommendations are. That's what you're going to hear from just about every major medical organization. They said well, what about half of that -- 75 minutes a week? And on the other side double that -- 300 minutes. And for all cause mortality you can see the numbers there. There's a 31 percent reduction with the sweet spot -- 150 minutes. But you've still got 23 percent reduction with half that time. By the way, as you look at these numbers keep in mind what medication can do that -- can give you that sort of benefit? So mortality is one thing. Heart disease -- cardiovascular disease is another thing. And again, we looked at sort of comparing those numbers and you do find, again, that 150 minutes give you 27 percent -- significant. But 75 minutes, 17 percent. And the final thing was cancer and they looked again at the benefits comparing these different lengths of time. And look, it's not as good when you're -- when you have less movement. That is clear. But there is still significant benefit. And I think that's what these researchers wanted to get across.",

But I think we put this together for you anticipating this question.But if you see -- if you look at this curve, what this curve basically means is risk is your y-axis and you can see risk goes down pretty significantly right away as you start to move. But overall, as you start to move more and more -- that's going to the right on the screen -- your risk of all these different types of health maladies -- it may drop a little bit but not as much. What is that sweet spot? That's about 300 minutes a week, so roughly five hours a week of exercise. Of movement the way that we described it you're not going to get much benefit in terms of these health things.
