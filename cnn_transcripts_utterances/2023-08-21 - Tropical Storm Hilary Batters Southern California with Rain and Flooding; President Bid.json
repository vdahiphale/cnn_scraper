Just ahead on \"CNN Newsroom,\" strong winds, mudslides, and flood warnings in effect this hour as Tropical Storm Hilary batters Southern California.A busy week ahead in U.S. politics, the first GOP primary debate without the front runner, and Donald Trump set to turn himself in to authorities in Georgia. What it all means for the party and for the former president. Plus, two countries step up to provide F-16s to Ukraine in their fight against Russia. We'll have a live report. And thanks for being with us. So, we begin in Southern California, which is facing the first tropical storm to hit the state in more than two decades. Tropical Storm Hilary has been lashing San Diego and Los Angeles with powerful winds and record-breaking rainfall. More than nine million people in downtown L.A. and surrounding areas are under flash flood warnings. Thousands of flights were also cancelled or delayed in the U.S. Sunday, many due to the storm. This is what Hilary unleashed on Mexico's Baja, California Peninsula, where it made landfall early Sunday. At least one person was killed when their vehicle was swept away in the floodwaters. Amid the storm, a 5.1 magnitude earthquake also rattled Southern California. The epicenter was in Ojai, between Santa Barbara and Ventura, and there were no immediate reports of injuries or damage. So, let's turn now into our meteorologist Karen Maginnis. So, Karen, what is the latest on all of this and how long will Tropical Storm Hilary continue lashing Southern California?",

And this is a major thoroughfare in and out of Palm Springs that willtake you out to Interstate 10. And what I've been doing as I've been standing here is watching that the water is rolling downhill and that is the exact reason why they have closed off this road because of the fact that is a road that they know is prone to flooding and they don't want anyone on this road right now and into the evening as we see more effects of Hilary. But we are already starting to see mudslides. We're already starting to see some of this cascading earth, not a full on mudslide, but happening off the side of some of the highways and this is why they're asking people to stay home. Many of us getting alerts on our phones now since we are all based in Los Angeles, telling us to beware of localized flooding within L.A. County as well. Overall, though, here in Palm Springs, they're asking people to just stay put unless they're trying to flee some water or some danger, otherwise just stay put. Los Angeles County, they say that they're prepared for this. They've already staged some vehicles that are high water vehicles in different parts of Southern California to help get people out if they need to. So, lots of preparations have been taken, and now it's the time that people just have to stay put and ride this storm out if they can because as you can see, Hilary is really starting to make her impact felt here.

You know, we have a lot of polls that show warning lights for him in terms of how the public is responding to that. The overall picture is somewhat muted now because voters are indeed reluctant at this point to say they want four more years of Joe Biden as well. But when you have a majority of independents consistently saying they believe he committed a crime or that his actions threaten democracy, that is a warning signal for Republicans if they go forward with him as the nominee and certainly, he has an enormous lead right now.",

      "sentences": "Well, you know, historically there is a lag between economic improvement and voters' perceptions changing. So that's kind of a given as a baseline. Other presidents have had the same problem. But I think there are two additional factors that are really a play here. One is that inflation has clouded out -- eclipsed a lot of the other positive news, which is really tied to a surge in investment in new plants and facilities, a lot of new manufacturing jobs and low unemployment.Inflation is something that people feel every day. And I was wondering, even though inflation is slowing down, that doesn't mean prices are going down. I mean, you know, for many Americans, particularly on more limited incomes, there is a continuing sense that things cost more than they did when Joe Biden became president, which also means they cost more than they did when Donald Trump was president. I think that is a big factor. And the other are doubts about Biden himself, you know? I mean, there's no question that we have seen consistently in polling that a majority of Americans are concerned that he is too old for another term. Now, having said all of that, I think the belief in the Biden campaign is that rather than counting on kind of national shifts in perception, that their job is much more targeted and limited. It's using the enormous budget they will have to improve perceptions of his performance in the economy in the six or seven states that are almost certain to decide the winner in 2024. And as you may know, they have announced today they are starting their advertising in those states historically early.",
