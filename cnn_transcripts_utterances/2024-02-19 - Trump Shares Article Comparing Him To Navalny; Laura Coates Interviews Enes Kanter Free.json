Putin took away the most precious thing that was my closest and most beloved person.\" And as world leaders condemn the death of a man who knew he was risking his life for the sake of his country, Donald Trump apparently just couldn't resist making it all about, well, you know who, sharing an article on his social media comparing himself to Navalny and going on a rant claiming that Navalny's death made him -- quote -- \"aware of what is happening in our country\" -- unquote. Take a look at a couple of key words there, words that may tell you what's really getting underneath Donald Trump's skin. Judges. Grossly unfair courtroom decisions. Hmm. Could that possibly have anything to do with the 35 -- sorry, $355 million fine that he was hit with in the New York fraud case, combined with the $83 million judgment against him for defaming E. Jean Carroll? Only in Trump world could the former president make Navalny's death about him. I'm going to be talking to the perfect person to weigh in on Navalny and what it's like to speak truth to power or speak the truth about power as well. I want to bring in NBA player Enes Kanter Freedom. He is an outspoken critic of human rights abuses and a big defender of democracy. He has called out Vladimir Putin as well as other leaders around the world, including the president of Turkey, the country where he was raised, and has faced backlash for speaking out. Enes, thank you so much for joining us this evening. Just thinking about what you must be feeling when you hear about Navalny's death. He repeatedly stood up to Putin, never gave up his fight for democracy, and his wife is vowing to continue that fight. What is your reaction to his death and his legacy moving forward?",

And this is no disrespect to Kenny Smith. But Candace Parker, celebrated WNBA player, Hall of Fame level player, NCAA champion, is right there and is a TNT broadcaster.

So, I think, yeah, some of the prejudice, some of the bias, and some of the not being used to the fact that this is old black music, the fiddle, the banjo, deriving from African antecedents, this is black music.
