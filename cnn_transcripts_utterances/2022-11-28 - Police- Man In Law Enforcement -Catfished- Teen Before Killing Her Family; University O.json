And especially if you go with the credit cards that are the store credit cards. Those APRs can go even higher, up to 26, 29 percent. Which I say stay away from those cards.

They know how to speak to the community. They are members of this community. I want to introduce you to one of those groups that's called Dia de la Mujer Latina (ph). They're based in Texas. It's a group of Latina women that talk about cancer and infectious diseases, and all sorts of things for more than 25 years. For COVID, they set up a call center and they got a letter of thanks from President Biden saying, you did great work during COVID. They then applied for a grant, not from the CDC but from another federal agency. And that agency said, wow, this is a great application, but we're not giving you any money. And so they are really concerned. They and other groups say, wait a second, you want our work, you want us to do things, but you're not going to pay us. So the head of that organization, her name is Venus, and she said we will always be in the kitchen. We'll never be invited to the dining room table. That's how we feel. In other words, you want us to do the work, but you don't want to pay us. We asked the CDC about this. They weren't involved in Venus' application. But they have this $4 billion that likely is not going to see community groups really soon. It might later, but there are some doubts about that. And the CDC spokesperson said, \"We are confident that grant recipients will fund and work with community-based organizations in their communities.\" In other words, the CDC says we're giving money to health departments. And we think that -- we hope that -- we've asked those departments to give community groups money, but there are no promises -- Victor, Alisyn?",
