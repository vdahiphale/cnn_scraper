Israel's Prime Minister is defendinghis military's raid in Nablus on Wednesday one of the deadliest in the West Bank in the years. The UN's envoy for the region calls the deaths of civilians appalling. Raid happening in broad daylight 11 Palestinians were killed the IDF says it targeted three suspected militants, including one accused of killing an Israeli soldier. How it all unfolded is eliciting new outrage from Palestinians? They say Israel used rooftop snipers and dropped tear gas from a drone. Palestinians report nearly 500 injuries. Well, earlier today, Israel launched airstrikes in Gaza following a rocket attack. Israel's military says that a Hamas weapons manufacturing site and military compound were hit.

That is because Russia's full scale invasion of the country will be one year old in less than 24 hours. Ukraine's neighbor to the west Moldova is feeling its own pressure from the war. The Former Soviet Republic is dismissing accusations from Moscow that Kyiv is \"Preparing an armed provocation against Moldova's pro-Russian region of Transnistria\". Well, CNN's Melissa Bell covering this for us she is live from the Ukrainian Capital of Kyiv. And I wonder whether this follows a pattern by Mr. Putin in Former Soviet Republics.

That Moldova for its part has denied that any such thing is happening. And you're quite right. This really does follow a playbook. In fact, the playbook that you refer to Becky was born in Moldova that country that was born of in the Soviet Union. And that when the Soviet Union collapsed in the early 90s, sort of Moldova nationalism that led to this tiny strip of land, and I think it's significant to look at a map to understand exactly where Transnistria is announcing its independence. Now that hasn't been recognized by the international community. And yet that tiny strip of land that exists between Moldova and Ukraine maintains its sense of independence. It argues that it is an independent part of the country. It has the presence of Russian troops inside it that very playbook, which was essentially mulled over at the end of the Soviet Union turning towards NATO, turning towards the European Union, the fans of Moldova, nationalism being reemerging, really seen as a threat by Moscow. And that stoking of an independent breakaway Republic that playbook playing out again in 2008, in Georgia, with South Ossetia and Abkhazia, and of course, here in Ukraine in 2014, and you'll remember, Becky. That war that we're marking the anniversary of tomorrow began in the run up to it those crucial weeks in the run up to February 2022. It was Russian claims that in the Donbas there might be provocation on the part of Ukraine to justify an invasion fear of false flag operations on the American and Western side and by Kyiv. And this kind of story is once again playing out in Moldova fears of false flag operation and fears that there are Russian troops present in that breakaway part of Moldova might be used in trying to stoke some kind of new front. Now, what we have seen over the course of the last year is a series of fairly small scale attacks in Transnistria, that have been blamed on Russian separatists or Russian backed elements. There is no reason for Moldova to want to open a conflict there turning as it has to the EU with its candidacy status that is now achieved. And there is simply no reason for Ukraine to want to open another front. The fear has been very much this could be used by Moscow as another way to cause trouble in that part of the country, Becky.",

Then you have that news team that was also shot and injured the reporter died.

So, seeing some improvement for the photographer, that was hurt in that shooting. That's good news, and certainly welcomed among us journalists here that have been covering that. But let's step back and talk about how exactly we got here. Yesterday right around 11 o'clock in the morning, deputies received a call that a woman had been shot in a car, the reporter of the news team went out to cover them. And about five hours later, they were shot, the reporter died. Then the suspect went to a home, shot a mother and her nine-year-old daughter that nine-year-old died. But in looking at the motive here that remains the big question the sheriff saying during a press conference that he doesn't know if the news team was actually targeted, still a lot of concerns. But that suspect was a 19-year-old by the name of Keith Melvin Moses. And I will tell you I actually just spoke to a woman who helped him process paperwork when he needed a bail bondsman related to a drug charge stemming from two years ago. And she said, look, when I saw his photo on the news, I instantly went back to that moment and she remembered him as being rude and disrespectful in that moment that she felt uncomfortable.

But in the last century, populations of the endangered African penguin have plummeted due in part to human disturbance, egg poaching and climate change.",

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (voice over): Historically, African penguins made nests in bars of guano layers of accumulated seabirds and bad thesis. But in the 19th century, humans began to exploit guano supplies and sell it as fertilizer, leaving penguins and their eggs exposed to predators in the scorching sun.",

Right now, the deepest guano remaining in any of the colony's measures in the centimeters the only thing left is bare gravel bears a while nothing that they can burrow into and that took away their entire nesting ability. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (voice over): In 2016, the African penguin nest project dived to the rescue. A coordinated effort between Dyer Island Conservation Trust, Dallas Zoo and other organizations its mission is to design and deploy artificial nests that give penguin parents a safe and cool place to raise their chicks. After two years of development and studying or guano nests, project experts settled on a final design, which they started deploying in late 2018. The aim was to emulate Mother Nature as closely as possible.",

It looks a little bit strange when you look at it, but it's an exact copy of what the penguins build themselves if they were given the opportunity. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (voice over): Each nest is fitted with a sensor that measures temperature and humidity, which enables researchers to track the nests microclimate.",

      "sentences": "Eggs are an extremely delicate structure. They're only set to be incubated at about 38 to 39 degrees, any higher than that. And there's avery real risk of the eggs dying, we're going to constantly be looking at the performance of the nests when it comes to the usage rates, are the penguins using them, are the eggs hatching or the chicks fledging. But so far, what we're seeing is that the artificial nests are fledging chicks at a much higher rate than any other option that they have. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (voice over): Funded by donations or by people sponsoring individual nests, Graham says the project has so far installed more than 1500 nests around South Africa's penguin colonies. Next year, the project hopes to expand to penguin colonies in Namibia. The end goal is that every penguin that needs a nest will get one. But while nests are vital to populations bouncing back, the birds still face threats from climate change and to overfishing.",

Now, bad weather in regions like Spain and North Africa being blamed for the shortages. The European Commission has decided to ban TikTok from official devices over cybersecurity concerns. Social media platform is now responding. It says it's disappointed and calls the decision misguided. That's not the first challenge for TikTok. It's already been banned from U.S. government devices that fears that user data could wind up in the hands of the Chinese government. Rahel Solomon, covering this story for us, Rahel!",

But it is certainly the latestsetback for the wildly popular app, which according to some estimates has more than a billion users globally, if not more than that. And so, you have governments around the world, both here in the U.S. and the EU, and frankly, other places around the world who are worried about how large it has become and how much data and how much access it really has. So, this announcement today from the European Union, essentially banning the device banning the app from federal official devices for its executive branch for the commission, Tik-Tok wasting no time slamming the decision, saying, as you said, Becky, that it's misguided. But also pointing to some steps that it has taken to try to address some of these concerns, saying that it's establishing three data centers in Europe to store user data locally, further reducing employee access, I think we can get this pulled up for you employee access to data, and minimizing data flows outside of Europe. Of course, the concern Becky, is that because Tik-Tok is owned by Beijing based Bytedance that some of this information this personal data could be used or could be seen by the Chinese government. There are also larger social media concerns about whether it could spread propaganda misinformation and such. But this is not the only time this has happened. As you pointed out, U.S. government officials have banned the app from federal devices more than 30 states. I think we can get this pulled up for you more than 30 states have banned the app as well on state government devices. And some in congress say even that is not enough and are pushing for more so, all of this to say Becky, more to come.",
