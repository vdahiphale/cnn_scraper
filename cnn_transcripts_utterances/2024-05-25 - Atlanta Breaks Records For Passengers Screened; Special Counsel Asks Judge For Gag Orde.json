Although one big wild card, even for those staying put this weekend, is the weather. Parts of the U.S. have already been devastated by unrelenting severe weather lately. And severe storms could threaten many celebrations this weekend.There were more than 300 storm reports yesterday and it's not over yet. Nearly 70 million people are at risk for severe weather today. The U.S. Storm Prediction Center warns a large portion of the Great Plains could see violent tornadoes, extreme hail and corridors of widespread damage. Some 77 million are at risk for severe weather on Sunday as the system moves east. And that could, with the running of the famed Indianapolis 500 in jeopardy. Now the weather doesn't seem to be much of a deterrent for people wanting to get out of town any more than high gas or airline prices. This Memorial Day, travelers are expected to come out in record- setting droves across all methods of transportation. AAA is projecting nearly 44 million people traveling. CNN's Ryan Young is at the airport here in Atlanta. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

We won't know how the judge decided on these more complex legal issues until those jury instructions are read to the jurors. Those will not be made public beforehand. But let's walk through exactly what's coming up next. On Tuesday when court resumes, seven men and five women and the six alternates will return back to court. And they will hear closing arguments from both the prosecution and the defense. Now that can likely bleed into Wednesday. After those are complete, then the jurors will hear the jury instructions from the judge. We expect those to take about an hour. And then deliberations of course, begin. Nobody knows how long deliberations will last. However, we understand the former president will stay in the courthouse in a sort of separate war room while that is happening. Now when a verdict is rendered, our understanding is that each count, the 34 separate counts, will be read one-by-one, a guilty or not guilty verdict for each. Now if there are any guilty verdicts, it's going to be up to the judge to make the penalty, the punishment for that. Our understanding though, of course, is you have the first set, a sentencing date, and it's possible he may not set that until after the election. So what that means, voters could be going to the polls with the former president on the ballot as a convicted felon -- Brynn Gingras, CNN, New York. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

And that has many wonderful aspects but one challenging thing is it doesn't really allow the government to be the arbiter of truth, to decide what is correct information, what's misinformation.Not only that but the government can't go to private companies like social media companies and tell them, hey, you got to take this down or you got to fix a label to this. There's a Supreme Court case going on right now that's exploring how much the government and whether the government even overstepped earlier and just communicating with social media companies. So basically, as much as we love free speech and as great as it is, it means it's really just up to the companies to decide how to handle this and what to do. And that's -- that is a little unsettling. That's in the U.S. In E.U. and other areas, there are other -- there's a lot more legislation and other regulation moving forward.",

It's just kind of robbing us of what it means to be human. And Scarlett Johansson is very famous and has a lot of clout and power. But it's kind of like we all have this concern. We all feel like we could be in the situation that she found herself in. But she has the power to stand up and fight back. So it's -- I think she's kind of the right person at the right time to stand up and say, hey, this is enough.
