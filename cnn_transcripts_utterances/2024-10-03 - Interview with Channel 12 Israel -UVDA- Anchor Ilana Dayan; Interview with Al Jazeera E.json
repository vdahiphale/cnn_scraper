Welcome to the program, everyone. I'm Christiane Amanpour in London. The war of threats is escalating between Israel and Iran. Israel's U.N. envoy, Danny Danon, warning that retaliation for Iran's ballistic missile attack, quote, \"will be soon.\" And Tehran warning of broader bombardment if Israel responds. Meantime, Israeli bombs struck Central Beirut for the first time in 18 years, killing at least nine people. The IDF also says it struck Hezbollah's intelligence headquarters in the south. It too has suffered casualties. In the past two weeks, more than a thousand people in Lebanon have been killed. Let's go straight to Beirut, where Jomana Karadsheh is joining us. Jomana, we talked to you last night. Things just seem to be escalating where you are. And now, for the first time in nearly 20 years, this strike on downtown Beirut.",

They went out. They were sleeping in parks, on the sidewalks, the iconic waterfront of Beirut, the Corniche. People were just sitting there, families with young children. And when we return today, you still have so many people who are out on the street because they have nowhere to turn. You have mattresses, you have tents now that are set up there. And it's because of the sheer numbers. More than a million people, according to the government, have been displaced in a matter of days. And they are trying their best to set up these shelters, turning schools into displacement centers, but they really can't keep up with the numbers, especially as you're seeing more and more of these evacuation orders. And, you know, I mean, you look at the numbers we're getting today from UNHCR, 160,000 Syrians and Lebanese citizens cross the border into Syria because they have nowhere else to go.",

The American administration, the last thing they want now is an all-out war here, four weeks before the elections there. But, you know, that which nobody wants to happen might still happen. Will Israel -- that's the question now facing Israeli government and the Israeli public, will Israel, for a change realize the limits of power, seek for a point of exit, and understand that eventually there will have to be a diplomatic arrangement following the military act?

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator):  The only cameras working here are those of the terrorists. Short clips and footage that show the neglect of that day, and the tragedy underway during those hours when the terrorist were operating freely in Be'eri without worry of fear. During these hours, when no army is there to defend its citizens, most of the muders take place. During these hours, 30 people from Be'eri were kidnapped. Women and men, elderly and young. The terrorist record everything, live broadcasting all of it. But out of all the footage we won't show, there is one picture that we are showing with the family's permission. This is Kineret Gat. Be'eri's legendary educator. A mother, grandmother, and spouse. In a short time, her son Alon will be kidnapped, her daughter- in-law, Yarden, her young granddaughter, Gefen, and shortly, her daughter, Carmel. This footage is seven seconds long. What was Kineret thinking during these moments, and did she know she'd be murdered in one hour? At this moment of abandonment, she uses the only weapon she has.

Now, yes, leadership has managed to -- you know, to transform it into a political issue. And I know that for many Israelis this is still not a political issue. Still, truth has to be told, Sinwar doesn't really want a deal, you know, as much as many Israelis want. He did refuse to many of the outlines that were on the table. He is now not communicating. He is, you know, unplugged somehow, not communicating. And so, you know, we can just hope for the better. But I -- you know, I know and I interviewed the people who came back, and we know about this father who told his daughter before she was released, and he stayed there, just make sure they don't forget me. I just interviewed a couple of weeks ago an old lady who came back, and she told me she spoke to this person before she was released. He was in a cage, in a tunnel.

It was a very tough day for everyone in Palestine, simply because the -- that day has turned and changed the lives of millions of Palestinians now upside down. Clearly, we were forced to leave our homes and houses under really heavy Israeli bombardment. We were forced to move from one neighborhood to another looking for some sort of safety. We we're forced to leave the north of the Strip after following the Israeli military orders to no longer remain the north of Gaza because it will be an active military war zone. And for me, alongside my family members, we have been displaced for over five times since the war began and the situation was catastrophically very dire.

Then I justmanaged to be absolutely joining the field here in Gaza Strip to follow up every latest development on the ground and how the course of actions are ongoing in Gaza. We have been filming and documenting all the security and humanitarian developments across multiple areas in the Strip in the north and central areas and in the southern part of Gaza. It has been a very tough job since day one because you are operating in a very active military zone that had been day by day getting much more worse with the very systematic and deliberate destruction of residential homes, key infrastructure, and the mounting numbers of attacks on journalists who at least must be -- have some sort of special protections according to the international humanitarian law regulations. But in Gaza, every day for Palestinian journalists is a question of life or death. Like you leave your house, you're completely unsure if you're going to return back to your family or not. And this is a proper reflection about the systematic targeting of Palestinian journalists. We're talking about more than 160 Palestinian journalists were killed since the war began, some of them were killed alongside with the family members and others as they were practicing their professions on the ground. Even sometimes when we are moving in areas that could be so much active in terms of the bombardments, people sometimes are so much afraid of our existence there because they have more growing feeling that the journalists are completely illegal to target for the Israeli military because they have been targeted, all Palestinian journalists who were trying to cover the Israeli latest crimes in Gaza. We have, in fact, Christiane, lost recently two of our colleagues in the north of the Gaza Strip in a very deliberate attack on the vehicle as they were heading to film a report in Al-Shati refugee camp. This is very devastating in fact, and it is a moment that makes everyone look and think twice about his job. But the resilience and the determination of Palestinian journalists is completely unwavering. They are working on the ground, especially in light of the Israeli ban of the international journalists to access the Gaza Strip, except in some -- in cases for some media channels who managed to get a partial access to particular parts in Gaza, including Rafah and Beit Lahia in the north. And they have some sort of controlled trips by the Israeli military. And even their content has been verified by the army before it could be released on air for their viewers.",

Palestinian journalists, in fact, since day one of the fighting, have been doing their best by all sorts of their even capabilities on the ground to keep reporting despite all their humanitarian and technical challenges that they have been going through, represented in communication challenges, lack of safety, lack -- even of humanitarian resources. International journalists have been only given access to areas where the army exists, but they did not really get closer to Palestinians in hospitals, Palestinians in evacuation centers, those who are sleeping in open areas, in the corners of the streets who have lost their homes, and even there are jobless right now. They can have much greater understanding about the reality of this ongoing conflict and how Palestinian people have been widely impacted from this ongoing work. So, we believe that the international journalists have a very profound role in raising the awareness of the International Community.

And this, you know, control of time and space extended out into the West Bank, where, you know, there are roads for Palestinians and then there are roads for Israeli settlers, which immediately set off my -- you got two different roads for two different classes of people. So, that immediately sets off alarm bells for me. You know, you're seeing in the territory and you can see one place where settlements are and where settlers live and they're marked in a certain way. And then, you can see other areas where they're Palestinian villages and Hamlet's and where they live. And you can see that these are completely separate. You go to the old city of Hebron, as I've talked about, and their streets where I am allowed to walk down, if it is made clear to the guards that my mother was a Christian, that I am a Christian and my grandmother was a Christiane, but my Palestinian guys do not have access to. That's just in brief of what I saw. So much more, but that sets off certain things for me. And then, I came back and had to do the reading and the research on top of that to understand the governance and the structures that are beneath that, that make that possible and, in some ways, mandate that. And I was left with the conclusion. And in fact, what I was witnessing was separate and unequal, that it was, you know, the closest that I would see in my time to the Jim Crow that my parents were born into.",

You went for 10 days. This is a nation state that has existed in its current form for 75 years at this point. But this is -- these are people who have indigenous claims to this land for centuries. You have to -- not just the Palestinians have indigenous claims to this land, but also the Hebrew people, the Jewish people have indigenous claims to this land, and these borders have moved back and forth for centuries. This is one of the things people often criticize journalists for. They say, well, you go someplace for 1- days, and then you're entitled to tell the world about it. So, what do you say to that?",

And there is perhaps a half a mile between those two- group of people, and one group has direct access to water and the other does not. There's very little that I'm going that I can imagine seeing -- there's nothing that I can imagine seeing that allows for a society in which there are tiers of citizenship, and at the top tier of that is a group of people, be they Jewish or whoever, but in this case, because it's Israel. Be they Jewish, you have the top tier of citizenship and everyone else is something less. There's not something that I would have seen in 30 more days. And I will add that even that criticism is familiar to me. Because, in fact, during the civil rights movement, what white southerners would often say is, you white northerners who come down here and start stirring up trouble, you don't know the Negro like we do.

That viewpoint is not unrepresented. On the contrary, it's one that I was very much exposed to. And what the purpose of that last essay really is, is I am someone who went somewhere and saw something and came back struggling with how it could be that what I saw was so different than what -- than the story that I was consuming in my media on a regular basis. And I really wanted to understand why. And I thought that the way to do that, my tool for doing that was to privilege the words of those who I believe have been, you know, unjustly pushed out of the frame, and that is, you know, the Palestinians. My feeling is that many of the publications that were large, that criticism, would do well to look at their own bylines and count how many Palestinians they've published over the past 10 or 15 years. And so, it is quite rich to me that I am being criticized or that I would be criticized for not talking to people who would defend what I believe to be an unjust order, you know, in publications that I think are actually part of how that order maintains itself.

You know, and I am wary of singling, you know, Israel out as somehow singular or more evil or whatever. But the point I would make is that I am responsible as an American, and particularly, as a citizen of a country that takes somebody like Martin Luther King as its patron saint, that walks around talking about, you know, with great pride about the triumphs of the civil rights movement and equality. How can I then go to a country where we boast about our special relationship with and see a two-tiered society literally with citizenship is decided by ethnicity, religion and rights are decided by ethnicity and religion, and then just say, you know what, there's a lot of other evil in the world too?
