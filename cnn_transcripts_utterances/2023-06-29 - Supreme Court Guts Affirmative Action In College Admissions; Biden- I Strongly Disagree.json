Protesters gathered outside of the U.S. Supreme Court today, after its landmark decision, saying that colleges can no longer take race into consideration as an expressed factor in admissions. Now, this overturns a long-standing precedent that has benefited Black and Latino students in higher education. Chief Justice John Roberts wrote the opinion for the conservative majority, saying the admissions program for both Harvard and the University of North Carolina violated the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment, and failed to offer measurable objectives to justify their use of race. The court suggests that colleges can still consider how race has affected the applicant's life, but in their dissent, the courts three liberal justices slammed their conservative colleagues, saying this ruling makes it practically impossible for colleges and universities to take race into account.

      "sentences": "Confusion and uncertainty because admissions offices are going to try to figure out how to reconcile two concepts, that you can have an applicant discussing race as part of their identity or experience, or their personal journeys for the application process, but they cannot consider it as an actual factor for admission. That's confusing to think about the actual application execution of it.And I will say, a lot of the discussions that we are hearing today seem to fundamentally misunderstand how affirmative action actually works. It's not as if they begin with race, and then you decide a separate branch to figure out whether you can now get in. You are otherwise qualified, you are otherwise meritoriously considered for the position in the school, you have met all the other criteria, and then there's also other holistic considerations ahead to come, like whether somebody was a veteran, or a legacy student, or a violinist, or an athlete among other things. And so what this Supreme Court decision has now done is suggest that race cannot be used in that considering factor for the holistic application, but I don't want anyone to think this was a Supreme Court saying or that are talking points are about from other people has suggested that the people who were not otherwise qualified, and race somehow made them qualified. PHILLIP:  Yeah, I mean, I think what kind of touched on that in our earlier conversation, and people interpret the data differently, but the process is what you just described. Sherrilyn, I want to ask you about this, Justice Clarence Thomas wrote a lengthy majority concurrence, and part of what he wrote includes this. He says, whatever their skin color, today's youth simply are not responsible for instituting the segregation of the 20th century. And they do not shoulder the moral debts of their ancestors. And, at the same time, in her own dissent, Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson said, quote, deeming race irrelevant in a law does not make it so in life. What's your take on this back and forth between these justices? SHERRILYN IFILL, FORMER PRESIDENT &amp; DIRECTOR-COUNSEL, NAACP LEGAL DEFENSE FUND:  My take on it. Well, first of all, Justice Thomas's statement is one that could have been said when he was the beneficiary of affirmative action in the 20th century, that he did not bear the weight of 19th century mores in this country. What I really appreciated is that for so long, Justice Thomas has been the only African American voice on the Supreme Court to talk about affirmative action and to express his opposition to it. To put his interpretation of the history of the 14th Amendment to play, and to talk about our constitutional rights as black people in this country. But now, Ketanji Brown Jackson is able to offer a competing view. It matters that she, like Justice Thomas, is a child of the south. And it matters that she has really steeped herself in the history of the Civil War Amendments, including the 14th Amendment. And the clarity with which I think she speaks is so powerful, and important, because she has the ability to speak about both the history but also about the contemporary reality of race in this country. The majority of the Supreme Court, including Justice Thomas, cloaked themselves in these ideals of what they hope this country will one day be, but what they didn't do, is kick the latter out from under those who are doing the hard work of helping create a multi-racial democracy in which this access and opportunity for all. And they confuse people as, your guest Kenny Xu appeared to be confused, but also in the very sad belief that he has nothing to learn from students who haven't scored a particular score on the SAT. That's precisely the reason, I think, why these admissions processes are so important. So students can understand what it means to be with other students who have different experiences, who are also qualified to make it into those schools, and to have students understand how much they have to learn that's not on a piece of paper, not in the book, and that's from their colleagues who are sitting at the desks next to them. A terrible decision today, powerful dissents that are important, but a watershed moment in our attempts to create a healthy, multi-racial democracy.",

One of the things that the Supreme Court has looked to do is clarify confusion, if there's a debate between two circuits, if there's a debate between states or issues, we can get some clarity, so we can order our allies in such a way we can follow the president, and in a consistent way across the United States. And so, any indication that has, on the one hand, what appears to be a finite and fix rule, on the other, the allowance, including by the way, a footnote on the military, it can lead to confusion and additional lawsuits to seek that clarification.

He could be being held about the role he played, if any, in that attempted military takeover.But, look, it's interesting, because these documents were obtained by the Dossier Center, which is a Russian investigative group. They were shared exclusively with us, so we've had a good look at them. And they show that General Surovikin was designated as a VIP member of Wagner. Now, it's been long known that he's had close ties with Wagner. He's worked with that mercenary group in Syria, with Russian forces. He's worked with a more recently in Ukraine as well. He was the liaison for sometime, really, between the Russian military and Wagner forces on the ground. But the idea that he's actually a member of the organization, a VIP member, is something we haven't heard before. And that's new. It's not just him either, or you can see from those documents there, they blot out the other names, but General Surovikin is alongside watch the Dossier Center say is at least 30 other members of the Russian military and intelligence services, high-ranking figures, who have also been designated VIP members of Wagner as well. Now, it's not clear what VIP designation means, whether there's any financial benefit of that, whether it means they are on the payroll or not. That's not clear at this point. But it does imply that the Russian military is perhaps overly close, or has been overly close, to this mercenary organization that, as we know, last weekend, stage and attempted military rebellion in Russia, and was not prevented from moving into a major Russian city, for instance, by the security services there. At the very least, it implies, as you mentioned, divided loyalties. And that may well be something the Kremlin wants to look into further.",

It's a scene we last saw during the sentencing trial for the shooter, when a jury in that case came back and sentenced the shooter to life in prison instead of the death penalty. Now, from the very start of this trial, Peterson's attorney felt that the jury was going to come back with a not guilty verdict on all of the counts. But especially when it came to the child neglect charges, the defense attorney Mark Eiglarsh felt that a lot of this was centered around whether Scot Peterson was, quote, a caregiver, and that is a designation that is normally not applied to law enforcement officers, and so as every single day passed by, and there was more deliberations, the defense attorney thought that their chances of getting a not guilty verdict were pretty good. The defense going into this case said that Scot Peterson never went into the building where the shooting happened because he did not know exactly where the gunfire was coming from, or where the shooter was. The state tried to counter that argument by bringing forth other law enforcement officers who were at the school, and they testified that while they also didn't know exactly where the gunfire was coming from, or where the shooter was, at some point, they made their way inside of the building. Here now, is Scot Peterson, after the verdict, as well as the father of Joaquin Oliver. He was one of the students killed that day. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

On the one hand, it's very unusual to see somebody, law enforcement officer, or a school resource officer, charged criminally based on their failure to respond to a mass shooting incident. This charge was really one-of-a-kind.And so I think other prosecutors may look at that and say, okay, I wouldn't be the first prosecutor to bring these types of charges, they were brought in this case in Florida. So, in that respect, this creates precedent. But, of course, the verdict here was a not guilty verdict. That doesn't necessarily dictate what any other verdict will be, each case stands on its own facts, but I think that's a note of caution to be sounded to other prosecutors. That you can't just reflectively charge any law enforcement officer with a crime for failing to respond fully or adequately to a mass shooter incident.
