We're not going to likely be able to broadcast that live due to the gruesome nature of the crime scene. And that's something we heard a lot about during those opening statements from both the defense and the prosecution. Both of them using them to try and prove their own case.

One man killed by falling missile fragments.This latest round of attack comes, not coincidentally, just hours after the U.S. and several European allies vowed to send tanks to Ukraine, something President Zelenskyy has been asking for, for months.

Just said, well, this might delay things a little bit. But, of course, it's the punitive actions, it's the punishment that they're meeting now with these 55 missiles that they shot at Ukraine last night, again targeting, of course, civilian infrastructure, not military. Again, a violation of the laws of land warfare. But, at the end of the day, this is a very significant development.

And also that as we tighten further the economic, financial and personal sanctions in export controls on Russia, that we can convince Putin that this war is unsustainable on the home front as well. That's got to be the objective because until Putin recognizes that he's not going to achieve his ultimate goals and that the war is not sustainable, there won't be meaningful negotiations.
