Zelenskyy will be having an all-senators meeting today and then he'll meet with Speaker Johnson who, of course, is an even deeper Ukraine skeptic than former speaker Kevin McCarthy was. So this is a really critical time. This comes as the GOP in both the House and Senate are growing increasingly skeptical and are growing against Ukraine aid.

Talking about him being too old to campaign. He told me he didn't think Biden would be up to it. I said to him, \"You got into this campaign saying that you were trying to strengthen Biden maybe,\" and he said, \"That's impossible. His weakness, now I see, predated me.\" And he's gotten also into all sorts of other policy prescriptions that are really far from where he started as a moderate. I said to him, \"What do you make of this campaign? -- that is pretty far from, as you said, getting into it and saying he wasn't in this to demean the president. And he said to me, \"It's not what I intended.\" It's things that are surprising to him and that he's getting much more -- a much more negative view of the state of democracy, the state of the Democratic Party, and even the state of Joe Biden than he ever thought going in.

The reason why they've set on that number is because in 1968, that's what Eugene McCarthy got against Lyndon Johnson. Johnson won the New Hampshire primary but was so embarrassed by the Democrats turning away from him that he ended up dropping out of his campaign. Phillips says that that's what he wants to happen for Joe Biden and he's going to keep on making that case into the spring -- into June -- maybe even into the convention. He points out that in 1968, Hubert Humphrey won the nomination despite not winning even one primary then. McCarthy and Hubert Humphrey, both Minnesotans, he points out now. And he also points out that he's a superdelegate himself, so he will have some role at the convention no matter what, even if it's a very small one, and that he intends to keep on pushing this.
