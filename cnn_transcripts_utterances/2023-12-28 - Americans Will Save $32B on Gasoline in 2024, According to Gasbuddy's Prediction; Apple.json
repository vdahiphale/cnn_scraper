So, that's nothing to sneeze at. And the timing here is significant. I don't know if you heard, but it is an election year next year, and we know that Americans hate high gas prices.So, this could be very helpful for White House that is certainly struggling to sell voters skeptical on Bidenomics. It could also help the Fed and its war against inflation. One surprising point here is the why? The United States is pumping record amounts of oil, more oil than any country on the planet, and that is huge. It is really helping to cushion consumers against shocks elsewhere around the world.",

But yesterday, Apple won an emergency appeal in federal court blocking that ban.So, that means the Apple Watch is back. Sales on Apple's website are set to resume today at 3:00 p.m., eastern, rolling out in the stores as well. So, this is good news for everyone hunting for an Apple Watch. But this court order is only temporary. The patent dispute is still making its way through the complex legal system. So, we need to keep an eye on this.

Those crossings were shut down by the Biden administration in an effort to redirect personnel to process migrants. DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas and the Secretary of State Antony Blinken, they just met with Mexico's president.With me now is \"New York Times\" White House Correspondent Zolan Kanno- Youngs, who, by the way -- Zolan, you've also got extensive experience covering issues surrounding the border. Can you give me a sense -- this agreement or at least this progress in the discussions we've been told about between U.S. officials and Mexico presidents, what's the significance there? ZOLAN KANNO-YOUNGS, CNN POLITICAL ANALYST AND WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT, THE NEW YORK TIMES:  Details are still light on the specifics of this agreement. But we do know what the priorities were for each of the government's going into the agreement, as well as just the intractable and sort of magnitude sense of the crisis at this time. This migrant surge, record migrant surge, that really is different than years passed has forced both countries to the table here. We know that the Biden administration, really, throughout the past two -- more than two years, the Biden administration has tried to get Mexico to increase enforcement at its southern border, as well as push Mexico to open almost in-country refugee programs to deter migrants from making this dangerous journey north. As far as the meeting, specifically, that just occurred. We also know that for both nations, how this migration surge in the redirection of resources at the U.S.-Mexico border impacted legal ports of entry, and also commerce between the two countries was also a concern. So, we know that both countries were trying to reach an agreement on that going in. We also know that going into this meeting, just from talking to folks and DHS and state side of the Biden administration, that getting increasing collaboration when it comes to cracking down on human smugglers was also a goal. But I have to say, even with the goal that's going to be reached, just the magnitude of this surge as well as the fact that it really is impacting the entire hemisphere, no longer just a select few countries in Central America are the source for this record surge migration. You're seeing countries like Venezuela as well, as well as Colombia. all the way through Costa Rica. So, you really are going to need a regional strategy when it comes to this crisis at this time.",
