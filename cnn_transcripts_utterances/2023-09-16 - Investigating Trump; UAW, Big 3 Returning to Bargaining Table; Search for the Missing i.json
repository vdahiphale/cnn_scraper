He says Jack Smith is trying to rob him of his First Amendment right to free speech.Smith's office had asked a U.S. district court judge to impose a court order limiting what the former president can say in public about the case against him. The Justice Department says the order is needed to protect the integrity of his upcoming trial. Trump spoke about it before a right-wing women's group on Friday. Here he is. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT: In a true sense, I'm being indicted for you. Thanks a lot, everybody. I appreciate it. I appreciate it. And you see today that the deranged Jack Smith, he's the prosecutor, he's a deranged person, he wants to take away my rights under the First Amendment. Wants to take away my right of speaking freely and openly. Never forget, our enemies want to stop us because we are the only ones that can stop them. They want to take away my freedom because I will never let them take away your freedom. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "The special counsel's team is laying out a long list of reasons why they want the judge to step in immediately and order Donald Trump to stop making statements, both online and in person, that could really end up intimidating witnesses, court officials or even the jury pool.The special counsel did reveal on Friday that numerous witnesses have faced threats and intimidation because of those statements from Donald Trump. So now, they're asking Judge Tanya Chutkan to do something about Trump's words. And they're laying it out this way, saying \"The defendant's repeated inflammatory public statements, regarding the District of Columbia, the court, prosecutors and potential witnesses, are substantially likely to materially prejudice the jury pool, create fear among potential jurors and result in threats of harassment to individuals he singles out. \"Put simply, those involved in the criminal justice process who read and hear the defendant's disparaging and inflammatory messages, from court personnel to prosecutors to witnesses to potential jurors, they may reasonably fear that they could be the next target of the defendant's attacks.\" And because of that, the special counsel wants Judge Chutkan to issue this order restricting Trump from making certain comments. And the special counsel really is laying out a number of social media posts and comments from Trump over recent weeks that have targeted Jack Smith himself, the special counsel; even former vice president Mike Pence and even a prosecutor on Jack Smith's team. Now it's interesting to note that Judge Chutkan already ordered Trump to refrain from disparaging comments. That was during his arraignment. But obviously, he's made those comments anyway. And now the special counsel wants the judge to issue an order, an official order in writing, prohibiting Trump from naming witnesses, making statements about them or making any statements about anyone, including attorneys and potential jurors, that are disparaging or intimidating. So this is really a significant move and request from the special counsel. And even though the judge has warned Trump once, this is asking the judge to make this order official and ironclad against Trump, with possible repercussions if he were to violate any order -- Jessica Schneider, CNN, Washington.

      "sentences": "Hi, there, Kim. There is certainly symbolism and there is some substance behind this meeting. Let's first talk about the symbolism.As you mentioned, this red carpet welcome in Russia for Kim Jong-un, especially today during these different military visits, he first went to an airfield accompanied by the Russian defense minister. We know he likes these photo ops. Kim Jong-un sees value in these photo ops, feels that it is perhaps a way to demonstrate his worthiness and his relevancy on the world stage. So it's not a surprise that he saw different types of aircraft, military fighter jets, attack aircraft, even a long haul passenger jet. He also, as you mentioned, went to the port to tour a warship. He was not alone, he was with the commander of the Russian Navy. In fact, he was given a gift, a model of that warship and also wrote in a guest book. It's not clear though exactly what the North Korean leader's message was written inside. So that's the symbolism of this. These are pictures that are certainly going to go around the globe. And then there is the broader question about the substance of this visit between Vladimir Putin and Kim Jong-un. They met on Wednesday. As we know, Kim Jong-un traveled to Russia in an armored train, very, very powerful, mighty vehicle if you will. What these two nations want from each other is still to be determined. But it is very clear that they are isolated on the world stage, especially because of Russia's involvement in Ukraine. But Russia, perhaps, may want to have a stronger alliance with North Korea, especially when it comes to munition and military supplies, which, analysts have pointed out, may be a point of weakness for Russia. And then North Korea, also, they want to gain from Russia perhaps advanced military technology. It could be as simple as food. These are the different interests that could be at stake; of course, under a very watchful eye. There are United Nations treaties and, of course, this has created a lot of concern from both the United States, Russia -- the United States, Japan and South Korea, I should say. But these are two nations which are on their own on the world stage. In fact, it was just in July, Kim, you will remember that North Korea actually hosted the leaders of Russia and China, where I am now; again, nations that have not taken a strong position to condemn Russia against the war in Ukraine, Kim.",

But the main reasons were corruption, the fact that people are getting poorer every day, the fact that people think that they are humiliated. And the government of Iran, until, we can say, until a few years ago or at least until last year, they tried to have this facade of legitimacy and tried to address people's needs economically. They had these poverty allocation programs. But since last year, they have given up on any kind of legitimacy claims. So they are confronting people with brute force. And that's why we are seeing the huge presence of all different kinds of armed forces around the country, especially in the places where we had the protests last year.",

As Ivan Watson reports, he is the latest top Chinese official to disappear from public view.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) IVAN WATSON, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Where is China's defense minister? General Li Shangfu was last seen in public in Beijing on August 29th. But nine days later, he did not show up for this planned meeting with top military officials from Vietnam. Beijing didn't offer a public explanation why. Asked on Friday, where is the defense minister, is he under investigation? The Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson answered, I'm not aware of the situation. Li's disappearance from the public eye is reminiscent of the mysterious case of China's former foreign minister Qin Gang. In July, Qin seemed to disappear. He stopped showing up at regional summits and high profile meetings with top U.S. officials, until he was inexplicably replaced by his predecessor only months after getting the job. The U.S. ambassador to Japan, Rahm Emanuel, has been trolling China on social media. \"Chinese President Xi Jinping's lineup is now resembling Agatha Christie's novel, 'And Then There Were None,'\" he wrote, adding #MysteryInBeijingBuilding. Li is still listed on the Chinese Defense Ministry website and users can still search his name on China's heavily censored internet. That's where people are starting to ask questions such as, \"General Li Shangfu, it's been 16 days. \"What's going on?\" And things are so opaque.",

Alexander Mattison of the Minnesota Vikings shared two of those messages on Instagram Friday.

The Vikings and the NFL have also condemned the comments as unacceptable. Most of Spain's World Cup winning soccer players are refusing to play in two upcoming women's league matches following the unwanted kiss controversy. More than 3 dozen women, including 21 from the championship squad, signed a joint letter condemning the royal Spanish football federation. They wrote that it hasn't made enough structural changes to make the players feel they are in a safe and respected place and that women's soccer is supported. On Friday, Spain postponed the announcement of the team lineup for the matches. The developments come after ex Spanish soccer chief Luis Rubiales' unwanted kiss on star player Jenni Hermoso following Spain's World Cup win. Meanwhile, a judge in Spain has now signed off on a restraining order against Rubiales following a hearing in the country's national court as the court investigates that unwanted kiss at the Women's World Cup. Al Goodman has more now from Madrid. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",
