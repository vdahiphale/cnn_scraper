      "sentences": "Well, this happened two months ago, John, back on April 11th. This Southwest 737 Max 8 coming into land in Lahaina after departing from Honolulu. Typically only about a 20-minute flight, but the data paints a really scary tale here. The weather very bad at the time. Low visibility and rain. The pilot set up to come in to land at Lahaina, but decided to abort the landing according to the data. It's known to be an especially busy time in the cockpit of a large airliner. Typically, you bring the airplane down close to the ground and then climb again. But the data shows the plane, instead of climbing, dropping at a rate of about 4,000 feet per minute. Pretty high. While only about 600 feet above sea level. And then ultimately came down to about 400 feet above sea level before climbing rapidly again.The question here will be the cause. And investigators really have their work cut out for them. \"Bloomberg\" reported a memo that indicated that it was a newer first officer flying the plane at the time who may have inadvertently pushed forward on the yoke, the control column, of the 737. Now, Southwest says in a statement, quote, \"nothing is more important to Southwest than safety. Through our robust safety management system, the event was addressed appropriately as we always strive for continuous improvement.\" Remember, this is similar to an incident on a United Airlines flight back in December of 2022. The National Transportation Safety Board found significant miscommunication in the cockpit of that incident. Lot of people might be asking if this is a Boeing problem. It is not. Likely pilot error here. Pilots simply outclassed by the problem that was unfolding in front of them. Although the FAA is investigating here. We will wait to hear of the NTSB also throws its weight behind this investigation. That seems likely, John.",

No ceasefire has been agreed to as of yet.CNN's Ben Wedeman is live for us in Beirut. You've spent decades in the region, Ben. You know it better than anybody.

There were five people in the war cabinet, Netanyahu, the minister of defense, one seasoned politician but not a military man, Benny Gantz and Gadi Eisenkot. Eisenkot and Gantz left, leaving just three. There really wasn't much purpose for the war cabinet after that.The war cabinet was formed five days after the beginning of the war in Gaza to have sort of a smaller group to focus on the decisions required to conduct the war. Now, matters relating to the war are going to be disgust and decided in what's known as the security cabinet, a - which includes more ministers. Among those ministers, however, is Bezalel Smotrich, the finance minister, and Itamar Ben-Gvir, the national security minister, both hardliners, and I mean real hardliners. These men basically categorically refuse any ceasefire agreement until Hamas is completely destroyed. They want this war to continue until Hamas is absolutely obliterated, which means that it's going to be ever more difficult for Prime Minister Netanyahu to agree to a ceasefire. A ceasefire which at this point after efforts made by President Biden and Secretary of State Antony Blinken doesn't actually seem to be going anywhere anyway. Sara. SIDNER: Yes, it is a huge disappointment and certainly the fear in Gaza growing by the minute. Thank you so much there, Ben Wedeman. Appreciate your reported there from Beirut. John.",

The boat ramp, the ship ramp is not working that well. We've had to move it again. We know there were reports of imminent starvation. So, politically, Israel wants to do something to get the pressure off. But at the same time, the reason they're walking it back is, there's a lot of pressure from the right wing and Israel says, just finish the job. Get these - get rid of these people. We don't care about the humanitarian situation in Gaza. It's a war. They started it.And so the Israeli government, its military sort of balancing between these two forces. You can't really alienate the United States because the United States is providing military assistance. And President Biden's been fully in support of Israel. But on the other hand, President Biden as his own political considerations to worry about. And Israel, in one way or another, is trying to be somewhat sensitive to those.",

If you could eliminate the Hamas military leadership, which some people have jokingly said, or maybe it's not a joke, is ten stories underground somewhere in the Rafah area, then you could perhaps say that you had been successful in this, and that would move things forward. Otherwise, what you're going to do is you're going to continue to put troops in, you're going to continue to respond to intelligence that you've got an enemy force here, you've got Hamas there. Put some forces in there and see if you can bring them to the surface. Mass fires against them. Yes, there are going to be civilian casualties, but you've got to move the war on. And that's not a very successful recipe. It hasn't proved successful yet.So it's really about getting the right intelligence to take out the leadership of Hamas. That's what's going to be required to really move it toward a ceasefire, in my view, John.",
