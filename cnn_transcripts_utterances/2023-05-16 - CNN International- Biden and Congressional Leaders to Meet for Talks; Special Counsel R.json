Now Durham is being invited by the Republican House judiciary chairman to testify about the report.

The 300 plus page report sharply criticized the FBI and the Justice Department throughout but does not recommend any new charges against anyone. Or any wholesale changes to the way politically sensitive investigations are being handled. And the report falls well short of expectations that were set by former President Trump and his allies who have long claimed that it would proves that the FBI's investigation was a political witch hunt. Nonetheless, Donald Trump claims vindication. Posting on his social media platform that it was evidence of a scam. Durham's report finds many mistakes by the FBI including what he calls confirmation bias. He concludes that the FBI discounted or willfully ignored material information that did not support the narrative a collusive relationship between Trump and Russia. Republicans in Congress have already called for Durham to come up to the Capitol for a hearing to discuss more about his investigation. Evan Perez, CNN, Washington. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

And we knew that they went on to use that information to weaponize it to hurt Hillary Clinton's campaign by releasing it on the eve of her convention.Then in July -- at the end of July -- we learned that months earlier before that information was released, a member of the Trump campaign, George Papadopoulos, told a representative of a friendly foreign government, a trusted friendly foreign government, that they had been offered exactly that assistance by the Russians. So, we knew how what the Russian's took. We know how the Russians used it. And then we learned that the Russians offered to do exactly what they had done before they did it to the Trump campaign. So, with that information, that unverified intelligence, actual information, we opened a full investigation.

They call them hypersonic, which are actually just ballistic missiles.But previously -- even just a few months ago -- Ukraine was saying that they had nothing that could intercept these missiles. Then just over a week ago we heard that they had used the Patriot batteries to intercept one of them. The U.S. officials later told CNN that the missile had actually been targeting that Patriot battery. We don't know if that's the case in this overnight assault. We don't know if the Patriots were used. But I think this clearly shows that the Ukrainian air defenses are becoming more effective. The defense minister -- the Ukrainian defense minister called this an unbelievable success for the Ukrainian air forces. And this, you know, is likely to change the calculus for Russia. They don't want to waste their missiles if they get shot down. Especially a missile that was previously thought to be unstoppable by Ukraine.
