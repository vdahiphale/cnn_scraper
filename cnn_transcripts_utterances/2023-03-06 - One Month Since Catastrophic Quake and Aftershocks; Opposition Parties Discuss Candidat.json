Tonight, I speak to UNICEF's Executive Director who's just returned from a trip to the epicenter of that disaster. First up, Russia on the cusp of capturing Ukrainian City Bakhmut for the first time in eight months but Washington cautions it's unlikely to change the tide of the war. Iran's Supreme Leader says the poisoning of school girls across the country in recent months is an unforgivable crime urging authorities to pursue the issue further. Migrants in Tunisia are experiencing fear and turmoil after the President there made seemingly racist comments about illegal immigration. An Egyptian football Legend Mohamed Salah emerges as a star when his team beats Manchester United 7-0 the worst ever defeat for Liverpool's archrivals. Welcome back. This is the second hour of \"Connect the World\". And it has been one month since the cataclysmic earthquake that wrecked Turkey and Syria and the situation still dire. UNICEF says two and a half million children in Turkey need urgent humanitarian assistance. But it is in Syria where the situation is even worse. 3.7 million children, let me quote here a catastrophic combination of threats, face problems, the emotional impact of a deadly disaster, plus the threat of contagious waterborne diseases, the impact of a decade of conflict, meeting recent tragedies. So tonight, we ask, has the world abandoned, serious kids? All those figures come from humanitarian organization UNICEF. So let's bring in the UNICEF Head Catherine Russell, who recently, as I said, returned from Syria and Turkey. And I have to start by putting that simple question to you. Has the world abandoned serious kids?",

And I think you know, UNICEF has been there we've been there before - stay people are there trying to help. But I think the scale of the problem is so enormous. I mean, a woman described it to me as she felt like when this happened that the world was ending. And I think you can see the images on the screen.

I mean, just one thing after another. And I think remember, that all comes on top of COVID, which had such a dramatic impact on education around the world everywhere. I mean, we estimate that 70 percent of 10 year olds in the world now in the whole world can't read or understand a simple sentence. So the work that we have to do is enormous in every place. And I think, you know, we look at it as we can't turn our eye from one problem to the next, we have to keep our eye on all of these problems. And I think the challenge I think is for the international community to find the support that they can give to all of these issues. Because really, you know, we say this all the time, a child as a child, no matter where he or she lives, no matter what circumstances and we have to do everything we can, as an international community to try to help them.

We see many countries in the Western part of the world, Europe, North America; we see them as democratic examples to follow. And in these countries, in the same countries, we see a lot of racism, we see xenophobic discourses, we see a lot of practices against immigrants, refugees, minorities. So, this is just the trickle-down effect of global North discourse against minorities that is now witnessed in the Global South. In fact, in the words of very famous Tunisian philosopher who is in fact the founder of sociology and Khaldoun? He says the defeated wants to imitate the victor. And this is this is why I'm not very surprised, because for a lot of Tunisians in times, if you look at colonialist and new colonialist power dynamics, this is only a result that is expected by Tunisians to be reproducing the same representations we're seeing in Western countries, now fortunately.",
