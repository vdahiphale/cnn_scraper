The fate of his student loan forgiveness plan now in their hands.Plus, people are waking up to winter storms from coast to coast. Parts of California seeing more than 6 feet of snow. And the final moments of the Alex Murdaugh trial as the jury is about to hear -- about to head to the scene of the crime. This is what we're watching at this hour. Hello everyone, thanks so much for being here. I'm Kate Bolduan. Right now, the Supreme Court is hearing oral arguments on two cases that will affect millions of Americans. At the heart of this fight is the Biden administration's $400 billion student loan forgiveness program. The challengers argue that the President overstepped his legal authority here when he authorized the plan that would forgive up to $20,000 in federal debt for 40 million Americans. That's a lot of money for a lot of people, and it's all been hanging in legal limbo for months now. Signs of just how much interest there is in this court decision. Take a look at these crowds that were outside the court starting early this morning. Jessica Schneider, she's also live outside the Supreme Court as this all plays out, and she joins us now. Jessica, you've been listening to this first hour-ish, if you will, of oral arguments. What have you heard so far?",

And given the price tag whether the President, by way of his Education Secretary, actually has the power to implement this student loan debt forgiveness program, because here are the numbers.40 million students are eligible for this program. 26 million have applied so far. 16 million have been approved, but that has all been on hold since the lower courts here put this program on hold and now they're waiting for a decision from the Supreme Court. But the key number here in all of this is more than $400 billion. That's the price tag of this program. And given the price tag of this program, the conservatives are really asking here, shouldn't it be Congress who's actually deciding whether or not to forgive this debt and not the President? Here's the Chief Justice. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) CHIEF JUSTICE JOHN ROBERTS, U.S. SUPREME COURT: Most casual observers would say, if you're going to give up that much amount of money, if you're going to affect the obligations of that many Americans on a subject that's of great controversy, they would think that's something for Congress to act on. And if they haven't acted on it, then maybe that's a good lesson to say for the President or the administrative bureaucracy that maybe that's not something they should undertake on their own.

But, Kate, we've seen from these conservative justices, they have repeatedly brought blocked programs that the Biden administration has put into effect because of COVID We saw it with the eviction moratorium, the Supreme Court blocked that. Also with the vaccination or testing program for large employers, the Supreme Court blocked that. So it is quite likely here that if they can overcome this hurdle of standing, which is another issue in this case, the Supreme Court might actually strike down this program, which is a distinct possibility. But a lot on the line for these millions of student borrowers who are wondering if, in fact, their debt will eventually be forgiven. Kate?",

And this is the White House trying to say, we really want to help people who are low-income earners who now have their college degree but are held back by all of this debt.

And also, a lot of people have gotten debt and then they don't get the degree. And that is the worst thing that can happen because now you don't have the college degree, which we know you earn more money on average if you have a degree than if you don't.

There are a bunch of conservative justices who really have problems with the program, with its size, with its legality. But there's another part of this that's technical, but no less important, about who can challenge federal programs like the student loan program.But like any other policy from this or any other administration, there's a real question about standing in these cases. And whether these six red states led by Missouri are the right parties, whether the two private plaintiffs in the second case, they are the proper parties. Kate, that matters because if the justices say, yes, if on the way to reaching the legality of the program, they actually say, these guys, these states, these private parties can sue, that's going to open the doors toa lot more lawsuits, not just against this program, but against any future. Biden administration policy, against any future, even Republican policy in a future presidency. That's why this case is so important.",

And you take it -- you say that it's not just key to this, it's key to much more when you're looking more broadly at states and the Supreme Court. What do you see? What is this trend that you're tracking and why is it so troubling you? VLADECKYou know, Kate, that's one state. Multiply that by 50, and all of a sudden, what you see is the possibility that this case might open the door to the Supreme Court saying anytime, any president of any party takes any step that produces even indirect effects in states which, of course, any federal policy will, those states can march into court and can challenge those policies. Kate, that would be a pretty big shift in how we have historically thought about the role of the courts, that the courts are there for disputes, usually between private parties and the government where someone has suffered a concrete direct injury. And I think part of the issue that the justices are going to have to grapple with here is, does their hostility to this program lead them to really weaken the historical limits on standing, limits that the court has justified as preserving the court's limited role, used to be the political branches? Or, right, is this really a political dispute where if there's really such broad opposition in the policy, the right place for that opposition to be ventilated is at the ballot box.

And so this is a lifelong issue.And it is true that what Christine was saying to you before we came on is really important, that this is about dealing with what has happened in the past. And the question is where and whether there is a desire to deal with the structural issues that get people into the place where they have so much debt in order to get a basic, you know, college education or even graduate education. That is something that we've heard from the likes of Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, and they tried to push it into the forefront of the conversation.

It's used to control plants and other things. It is toxic. And they were concerned that there might be issues there with this chemical. There can be respiratory issues, there can be irritation of mucosal membranes and other issues. And so these professors were, you know, concerned about this. The EPA is saying, look, we're not -- well, let's -- we'll let them say it in their own words. The EPA put out a statement saying, the long-term risks referenced by this analysis, meaning that one at the universities, assume a lifetime of exposure, which is constant exposure over approximately 70 years. EPA does not anticipate levels of these chemicals, that levels of these chemicals will stay high for anywhere near that.
