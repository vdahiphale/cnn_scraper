The Celtics riding an 11-game winning streak coming into this one. They built a 22-point lead with nine minutes to go in the game, but the Cavs came storming back thanks to Dean Wade. The reserve power forward just caught fire. Wade making five threes in the fourth quarter, scoring 20 points and singlehandedly outscoring the Celtics in the period. You can see Jason all pumped up -- or Travis, I should say. He also got the putback dunk here with 19 seconds left to put the Cavs up for good.
