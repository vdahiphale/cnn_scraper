      "sentences": "Well, Pamela, there's been a long delay this morning, but we are hearing that the jury has finally entered the courtroom this morning, a sign that they are likely about to get started.Now, there was a long delay this morning over a motion made by the defense telling the prosecution and the jury in this case that they plan to play 911 calls and video during their closing arguments. The prosecution was very opposed to this because the defense wanted to show edited portions of that material. So that's just a reminder of how much of this case has been about bystander video, as well as what people there reported to have seen and heard. And that's important because the full sequence of events that led to Daniel Penny putting Jordan Neely in that fatal choke hold was not captured on video. We only see the aftermath. Now, the defense will go up first to deliver their closing statements, and they have focused on justification, that Daniel Penny wanted to protect passengers from a threat placed by Jordan Neely, as well as causation, that it was not the choke hold that killed Jordan Neely, but rather a combination of other factors, including the fact that Neely was high on K2 at the time and that he suffered from sickle cell disease, as well as the fact that he was experiencing mental illness. Now, the prosecution has argued that Penny had no intention of killing Neely, but that by using the choke hold maneuver that he used, he disregarded the risk. Now, they say that Penny was well aware of this risk because he was trained on it as a Marine veteran. He knew exactly just how dangerous this maneuver could be if you put a person in it. They also showed evidence that showed that he did not let go even after being offered help by other bystanders to keep Neely on the floor. If he is convicted, Mr. Penny is facing up to 15 years in prison, if he is convicted of the criminal -- of the mass slaughter charge and up to four years if he's convicted of the criminally negligent homicide. It looks like jurors will start hearing those closing arguments any minute -- Pam.",

These wearable devices help people monitor sugar levels in the blood with real-time updates.Well, now these devices are also being marketed as wellness tools for everyone, even those without diabetes. CNN's Meg Tirrell wanted to find out what that means and how they work. So, Meg, you tried it out for six weeks. What did you find?",

      "sentences": "I did, Pamela.I was a little nervous about this. It looks like a needle on one of these things. And you're putting it onto your arm. It can also be worn on the abdomen for people with diabetes. But you kind of -- you click this thing on, and then essentially a little wire lives under your skin for -- these sensors last for two weeks. So I did three different sensors over six weeks. And within an hour, you're starting to see your glucose levels come through on an app on your phone in real time. The idea behind these things for people without diabetes is that you can see how you react to different foods, to exercise, to sleeping patterns, to stress, and maybe make changes that could lead to sort of a more healthful life. And so I wanted to see how that worked. But what I found was that it made me extremely anxious. When I could see the immediate reaction to what I was eating on my phone, it made me not want to eat something like an apple, for example, because I could see a big spike afterwards, whereas, if I had a cheese stick or an egg, I wouldn't see that kind of spike. But does that necessarily mean that an apple is less healthy for me than a cheese stick or an egg? I mean, when I looked at something like a piece of pizza or a bowl of ice cream, that wasn't particularly surprising to see a spike like that. But that's the kind of thing. The idea is, will you see something unique to you? And talking with our colleague Dr. Sanjay Gupta, he has actually tried this along with his wife, Rebecca, and they have found that they have unique reactions to different foods, so much so that he's actually made changes for himself. I have to say, though, Pamela, once I got over my anxiety, mostly what I felt was apathy about what I was seeing. (LAUGHTER)",

So I was, like, wondering what was going on, and I tried the glucose monitor. And I was pretty shocked to see how certain foods, like -- I guess it's not surprising, but cereal, for example, something I would have every morning, how it would impact my sugar levels. And it did cause me to change my habits. But I also, like you, had a lot of anxiety and wanted -- I was like, wait, I shouldn't eat that because it spiked my sugar on things that like an apple,where you maybe should be eating more of. So where does the evidence stand on keeping glucose levels low for people who don't have diabetes?",

That's when Mamie Eisenhower took steps to boost the Christmas spirit at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. Jackie Kennedy would later introduce themed White House Christmases, which continues to this day. And along the way, we have seen gingerbread houses like this one with Nancy Reagan in 1987. And even the first pets have gotten it on the action. Here's the Clinton's cat Socks with his very own stocking. A White House historian tells CNN that the first ladies often incorporate causes that they personally champion into the decor. Michelle Obama did so here with a tree adored with cards and ornaments from an initiative that supported military families. And in the age of social media, even the White House Christmas designs can't escape critiques. These cranberry topiary trees from Melania Trump sparked a lot of commentary online. A Season of Peace and light is the 2024 White House holiday theme. And here's a glimpse of some of the year's seasonal decor. First lady Jill Biden is set to officially unveil the White House decorations later today. The White House says more than 300 volunteers from across the U.S. helped decorate the presidential residence. One of those volunteers is Dawn Ahner, who joins us now. She is also the owner of Ahner Florist and Greenhouse in New Baden, Illinois. So, Dawn, you're there at the White House. You have been busy at work decorating. You're there now. The work is done. You're there for a reception. What was this experience like for you?",
