Mark Harvey's account and they both told the publication they believe that their old boss is approaching Hurricane Helene with a similar mindset.

We're still seeing a motive --sort of a lack of enthusiasm around Black male voters between the ages of 25 and 45. So, for me, I'm going to be its -- I'm going to be curious to see how he tries to engage those voters beyond just doing the big rallies. Does he do podcasts that are specifically targeted to Black men? Does he go into barbershops? Like, how does he try to galvanize that particular group? And the second thing is, they feel like they've got to have Obama level turnout in order to win. I mean, that's just what Harry sort of pointed out a little bit that she's lagging in the polls compared to him. They've got to exceed his turnout in order to offset potentially so what we might see with White women voters, where Donald Trump is making some grounds with less than educated voters. So, yes, I mean, he's essential to her win. But there's also one other thing, Anderson, I've noticed having done some campaigns after President Obama. I used to work in the White House for him, so I think they're exceptional but after that, is some of the admiration and love that voters feel, Democratic, voters feel for the Obamas doesn't always transfer over to candidates.

President Biden sending a letter to congressional leaders warning them that at least one critical disaster relief program is set to run out of money before they return from recess.In the letter obtained by CNN's Kayla Tausche, President Biden says the Small Business Administration's disaster loan program is nearly used up. Officials tell CNN the program needs $1.6 billion to meet the demand of the 3,000 applications that SBA is getting from homeowners and business owners affected by Hurricane Helene. Biden says that both FEMA and the Pentagon are fully funded for now, but that a comprehensive disaster relief package will be needed as soon as Congress returns November 12th. More now in the presidential race. The former president's rally in Butler, Pennsylvania tomorrow, notable for two reasons. It's obviously a return to the site of the first assassination attempt against him back in July. And one of his major Super PAC donors, Elon Musk, will be there. Now things have definitely changed from just over two years ago when Trump called him a BS artist at rally. And Musk responded online, saying in part, \"I don't hate the man, but it's time for Trump to hang up his hat and sail into the sunset.\" The next day, Trump responded online, as he's want to do, criticizing Musk, quote, \"Electric cars that don't drive long enough, driverless cars that crash, or rocket ships to nowhere.\" He also said that when Musk visited him in the White House, quote, \"I could have said \"drop to your knees and beg,\" and he would have done it.\" I'm joined now by the New York Times's Ryan Mac, author of \"Character Limit: How Elon Musk Destroyed Twitter,\" and Philip Bump, national columnist for the Washington Post.

If they want to go after military capabilities and you would look at strategic assets like the nuclear sites that are just south of Tehran and places like Fordow and Iraq and stuff like that, the danger of course, is that you have to go deep into the territory and you may lose a pilot. Same thing as if you go up north to Tehran. The other challenge, by the way, with going after regime change, the downside is you risk civilian casualties. And what you don't want to do is to have the Iranian people rally around that regime, particularly since it's so fragile right now. And they are really not happy with the Iranian regime. The other set of military targets would be, of course, ballistic missile production sites, storage sites, drone production sites, things like that. I think they will take out air defense regardless.

Leadership has been knocked out. I mean, they still haven't announced Hassan Nasrallah's replacement, let alone buried him. And so that said, they still have 20,000 to 50, 000 fighters out there. They have -- if Israel's numbers are accurate, half of their missile and rocket inventory left, which could number 70,000 or 80,000, if that's accurate. So that said, I don't think they're going to -- they're trying to do with Hezbollah what they've done with Hamas. My sense is what they want to do is get rid of the infrastructure along the border. That's the tunnels, the fighting positions from which they're shooting directly into Israeli talent villages and communities. And then they also want to knock out as much of that missile capacity as possible. And then third, they want to push them back to the Litani River, up to the north, 18 miles and get them in compliance with U.N. Resolution 1701, which was passed in -- after the 2006 war, but was never followed through by Hezbollah.
