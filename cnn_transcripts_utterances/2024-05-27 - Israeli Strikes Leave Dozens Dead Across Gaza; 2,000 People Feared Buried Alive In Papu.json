A ground stop just put into place by the FAA at Atlanta Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport. The FAA also warning of ground stops down the East Coast today -- Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Baltimore, D.C., Charlotte, Chicago. Also, San Franciso on the list. Thunderstorms could have a pretty big impact today. Also, the low cloud ceilings and the low visibility that comes along with that. Of course, so many people anticipated to drive. AAA anticipated that 38.4 million people would drive the previous five days over this Memorial Day travel period.

The 38-year-old candidate, who has run for Congress multiple times in Georgia, appealed to the voters by focusing on bringing Libertarian values to a broader audience. Both Donald Trump and Robert K. Kennedy Jr. spoke at the convention over the weekend with Trump facing loud booing throughout this short speech. Now, while Trump attended and he spoke, he did not submit the paperwork to be considered as the nominee when it came time for the party to vote. Joining me now is Democratic strategist, Chuck Rocha, and former spokesman for President George W. Bush, Pete Seat. Good to see you both. Pete, let me start with you. Trump usually speaks in front of a warmer audience. He's not used to having his ego bruised like he did. What does it say about where his campaign is right now that he would go to something like this? What do you think? PETE SEAT, VICE PRESIDENT, BOSE PUBLIC AFFAIRS GROUP, FORMER WHITE HOUSE SPOKESMAN FOR PRESIDENT GEORGE W. BUSH:  Well, the bullish way of looking at it is this is a move of confidence. That the Trump campaign feels good about their position in polling and their position moving into the November general election. So they're starting to branch out and reach to different constituencies that he normally -- as you say, normally, speaks to the base, and the Libertarian Party convention not the base. But the bearish view is that they are afraid of the impact that Robert F. Kennedy Jr. might have on this election, and he's got to go scoop up each and every single individual vote that he can get. So it really just depends on your point of view why he went there.",

That's just not the case in a multimedia world that we're living in today.So, Donald Trump is looking for something that he is not. He wants to pick somebody like a person of color, like Rep. Donalds or Mr. Marco Rubio, or somebody in that vein so he can maybe get a little more African American vote or a few more Latino votes.

I did a lot of bad things selling drugs. And the jurors put that aside and they take the testimony.But this is a little different. This particular star witness is a convicted perjurer -- one who lies under oath. He's lied about the lies he's told and he admitted to this jury stealing from his own client.
