I'm Pamela Brown in for Abby.And tonight, the feds are asking for a limit to gag order on Donald Trump and the former president is firing back, essentially daring the judge to give him one. The special counsel's team wants to impose restrictions on what Trump can say about the election interference case, accusing him of telling lies, intimidating witnesses and threatening prosecutors. It is a pretty extraordinary move given the circumstances of Trump being a presidential candidate, and Trump, for his part, wasted no time firing back. He called Jack Smith deranged, and just moments ago, accused the feds of trying to silence him during a campaign. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT:  Did you see today that deranged Jack Smith? He's the prosecutor. He's a deranged person.

A Trump lawyer left a voicemail for Michael Flynn on the eve of his guilty plea suggesting Flynn would stay in good graces if he stayed close. As president, Trump also ordered his White House counsel to publicly lie about efforts to fire Mueller after Trump fired FBI Director James Comey. He threatened Comey with tapes if he talked. And during a live hearing, Trump personally attacked the former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine who was asked about the tweet in real-time.

There are clauses that they're asking for the government and he cannot possibly comply with that. He is not allowed to talk about the merits of the case. That's what the proposed order says.

They're called to their civic duty. And you heard Senator Romney mention this week how there were members who are afraid to vote on impeachment because the former president was tweeting about how they should vote and they were scared for their safety.

Hi, Neil, thanks for your time tonight.So, the Chamber of Commerce is blaming President Biden for this strike. Why do you think he bears responsibility here? NEIL BRADLEY, EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT, U.S. CHAMBER OF COMMERCE: Well, I think part of what we're seeing going on in this strike and really a summer of strikes, over 200 strikes so far this year and counting, is this kind of sense of unrealistic expectations of what can economically be done. No one is talking about not raising employee pay. In fact, you just showed the graphic yourself, bringing in this segment, a 20 percent pay increase that are being put forward by the major auto company. So, the question is, what kind of pay increases can be absorbed in this moment? And I think what we've come to realize is that when you want to increase pay by 40 percent and you want to get paid for five days but only work four days, these are the types of kind of demands that just aren't grounded in economic reality. And if they were to be forced upon these companies, what it would mean is that they're going to have to shutter their operations. And so no one wins in a situation which unrealistic demands means that companies can no longer operate. And so that's what concerns us quite a bit at the U.S. Chamber.",

That's going to be compounded by the fact that the demands that are being made by the unions today are going to have to be made up somewhere. That's going to be made up in higher costs paid by consumers.Not to mention the fact that you have all the other collateral damage that's done. We talk going auto parts suppliers. We're talking about the restaurants, the service industries in these areas. When they lose business, there is no way to make that back up.

Because as we saw in an earlier interview, just throwing out numbers, well, we'd take 30 percent or 32 percent. That's not exactly how the negotiations go because they're different trades.

And then there's lots of difficulty throughout the rest of the supply chain because there are a lot of companies that sell to the auto companies that buy cars, auto dealerships, for example. And so, you know, who has the upper hand in all of this, I think, is really hard to tell at the moment. I think it is fair to say that the workers' expectations need to be managed here, not only on the amount of pay that they are asking for. And I wholeheartedly agree that they deserve a raise, particularly since prices have gone up across the economy and lots of other workers have gotten raises. They deserve a raise. But some of the other things that they are asking for beyond those eye-popping raises, I think are going to be really problematic and are probably going to make the companies that they work for much less competitive in the long run and that's going to be an issue during this EV transition. I'm thinking things like demanding that the companies continue to pay workers even if a plant is shut down entirely, which is one of the things that the union is asking for and is sort of a version of a -- of a famous policy that these unions used to have in their contract going back to the 80s. That was problematic and that caused a lot of financial problems for these companies. You know, the big three, as they are known, maybe dominant or semi- dominant in this industry today. But, you know, there's a transition coming, there are a lot of upstarts, and these companies need to maintain a competitive edge. So, it's a difficult dance here.",
