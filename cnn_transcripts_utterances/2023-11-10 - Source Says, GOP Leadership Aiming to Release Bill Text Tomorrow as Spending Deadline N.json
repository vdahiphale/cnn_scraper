Let's begin this hour in Washington, where Congress now has one week to reach a deal and avert a government shutdown, another one. This is because they barely reached a deal the last time, which gave them -- they could only get it together to get the government funding for just 45 days. This time, it is also a new House speaker that is now forced to navigate the choppy political waters that are not just between the Democrats and Republicans on any day, but also from within the House Republican conference as well, though a source is telling CNN that the House Republicans could release text for a potential funding bill as early as tomorrow. Let's get back over to CNN's Lauren Fox who is on Capitol Hill. So, Lauren, will that funding bill have any legs and any chance of survival?",

These comments come just one day after Israel agreed to a humanitarian pause each day in Northern Gaza to allow people time to escape to the south. Today's window closed about an hour ago and reports from the Israeli government show over 130,000 people have fled the north in the past 48 hours. So, to talk about it all, let's go to CNN's Oren Liebermann, who is live in Tel Aviv for us. Oren, now, the U.S. is giving its full support to Israel here, but the secretary of state has been pretty critical here of what's happening in Gaza in particular. What are you learning on your end?",

But he also says he was pushing for humanitarian corridors and pauses over the course of the past several days, if not longer, and trying to make it happen, hoping it would have happened already. But the U.S. certainly pleased with the fact that these humanitarian corridors are in place. They're announced every day by the Israeli military. We saw it open for six hours and thousands of Gazans fleeing the deepening and growing Israeli campaign in Northern Gaza, heading south at the same time. The Palestinian Authority Ministry of Health and the occupied West Bank and the Hamas-controlled Ministry of Health in Gaza say more than 11,000 Palestinians have now been killed since October 7th. That as Gaza's hospitals are facing a growing crisis, and that prompted Secretary of State Antony Blinken to warn essentially of the situation there. Listen to this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And just hours after the U.S. launched an airstrike targeting that weapons storage facility in Syria, the groups again launched four additional attacks on U.S. and coalition bases in Iraq and Syria, and that wounded an additional three U.S. service members, two of which were diagnosed with traumatic brain injury. So, this is a very serious situation, and the Pentagon says that they are treating it as such, and that is why we have seen those retaliatory strikes being taken by the military to try to deter additional attacks by these Iran-backed groups, and importantly, to try to degrade the infrastructure and the weaponry that they had been using to carry out these attacks. But, look, obvious questions being raised here about whether it's actually working, because the U.S. conducted similar airstrikes against a weapons storage facility being used by Iran, and its proxies roughly two weeks ago, and the attacks did not stop, and as we saw on Wednesday, additional attacks after that latest U.S. airstrike. So, these groups are clearly not deterred. And the question now that the administration has been facing is whether this approach by the U.S. to continue launching these retaliatory strikes is sustainable, because the proxy groups, they're able to launch these attacks on U.S. forces using small drones, rockets, and they're causing damage, they're causing injuries. So, the question now is how do you stop it? And that is one the administration is grappling with, Omar.",

I'm just reporting that we now know that he will utilize the intimidation, the threat of violence, the things that he does as an extension of his campaign.He's not hiding it. We're not airing it, but you just go on air and online and you see what he's saying. It is about the rigged election. It is about individuals who are within law enforcement, within the processes of the judiciary, judges, prosecutors in the Georgia case. We know it. We don't have to. And so, therefore, because we know it, we can prepare for it. But if Donald Trump gets the nomination, we ought not to be surprised. We can be dismayed. But we ought not to be surprised if he utilizes the use of this intimidation as relates to the election. And it's not just him. It's others who listen to him, and so not a surprise. So, I think that we have to be cognizant of what 2024 will entail in terms of violence as part of the election process and be ready for it and report it and speak out about it because that's the only way that people then will feel like there's consequences for it, including jail time in this guy's case.",
