Niger's coup general speaks out, blaming the country for its deteriorating security situation. The special counsel has brought additional charges against former U.S. president Donald Trump in the case alleging mishandling of classified documents. And Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu speaks to CNN after a chaotic week in Israel. Welcome to the show. And we start in St. Petersburg where Russian President Putin is pointing fingers at enemies and making promises to allies. It is the second day of this Russia-Africa summit and his war in Ukraine is in the spotlight. A short time ago, Mr. Putin said that a peace plan proposed by African leaders to end the war would be discussed in the coming hours. Meantime, as global food prices skyrocket, Putin also spent Friday shaking off blame, saying it is the West that has made, quote, \"one mistake after another.\" We have our correspondents across this for you. Our Nic Robinson, our international diplomatic editor in London standing by as well as CNN international correspondent David McKenzie in Johannesburg. Welcome to both of you. Nic, I want to start with you. A lot on the agenda including that peace plan for Putin and Putin deflecting the impact on food and energy rising prices not being a result of the war, of his own war. Take us through the top lines here.",

What is said is that this is a case of the U.S. and the European Union not planning for thechange in use or the transition in use of fossil fuels and leading, therefore, to print money which is what he said that they did during COVID, and that he said that has forced up global food prices and fuel prices. It's the inability of Russia to sell its oil and gas to Europe and to some of the nations as well that's contributed to that. But Putin very clearly blaming it on the West as he was doing yesterday, accusing the West of hypocrisy and being the reason why Russia can't export its grain around the world. These are pictures that he hopes are going to resonate with these African leaders there. We've heard as well from some of those leaders from Mali, from Central African Republic, presidents of both those countries praising their relationships with Russia and saying that they have been beneficial to their countries. These of course are countries that the Wagner Group led by Yevgeny Prigozhin, that mercenary boss, has been at the forefront of the Kremlin's agenda in those countries, fostering relationships there. So, look, there are certainly people within that audience who have come, leaders, and Cyril Ramaphosa, the president South Africa, among them as well, who have been praising the relationship with Russia on that peace plan. This is a peace plan that calls for both sides to de-escalate tensions. Laudable in anyone's eyes to try to find a way to calm the conflict and to end the conflict. But it doesn't seem to address neither Russia's position as the invader of Ukraine nor Ukraine's position that Russia needs to get out of Ukraine before, you know, you can have substantial peace talks. So that's something that Putin says is important and will get discussed. It's not quite clear if it actually meets Russia's needs either because he doesn't seem to be in the mood for de-escalation at the moment and he invaded in the first place.",

Here he is in 2006 in Cape Town. The U.S. Treasury sanctioned Vekselberg in 2018 and again in 2022 for supporting Putin's invasion of Ukraine. Last year, Spanish authorities and the FBI seized his $19 million super yacht Tango. Despite the sanctions, Vekselberg still holds an important interest in UMK, according to business records held in Cyprus.

According to publicly available declarations, since 2021, UMK and Chancellor House combined have contributed at least $2.9 million to the financially struggling ANC. (On-camera): This is a highly lucrative operation and anti-corruption activists say that these alleged linkages pose serious questions.

And he is the leader of the presidential guard. This is the specialized unit of soldiers that were detaining President Mohamed Bazoum on Wednesday and then on the night of Wednesday declared that they had taken the government, removed President Bazoum and shut down the borders, suspended the constitution, shut down aerial and land borders, and essentially suspended every single thing that works in a functioning democracy. He was appointed by the previous president of Niger and was retained by President Bazoum, and this is his explanation for why he decided to overthrow his boss. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GEN.

And they're afraid of possible sanctions from the regional body ECOWAS, the West African -- the Economic Community of West African States. But this coup at least in the public telling and in the pro-military quarters we've seen is a rejection of Francafrique, this French influence in West and Central Africa. You see for instance President Emmanuel Macron saying he's spoken to President Bazoum. He rejects this takeover and he's praising President Bazoum as a democratically elected president and a courageous man. But the people on the streets do not want France involved in the affairs in Niger. They don't want the 2,500 French troops in Niger and in neighboring Chad. They do not want any French influence in that country. That is why, for instance, you saw the burning of the French flag and some of them raising Russian flags that said done with France, seemingly opening up themselves up to some kind of cooperation with Russia. This creates an opportunity for Russia to expand its influence in the country and in the region. The Wagner Group is already active in neighboring Mali, in the Central African Republic not too far from there.

One of the reasons why they were doing that is because they suspected, they had information to believe that there were still more documents that were missing, that the former president was holding on to, and that there was an effort to conceal those boxes of documents including classified documents. And I'll read you just a part of what the prosecutors laid out in this new indictments. It says that one of his new codefendant whose name is Carlos De Oliveira, he's the head of maintenance at Mar-a-Lago. De Oliveira asked a Trump employee how many days the server retain footage. This is referring to the server that contained the surveillance footage. And the Trump employee responded that he believed there was approximately 45 days. They go on to describe the interaction, and they said De Oliveira then insisted to Trump employee number four that the boss wanted the server deleted and then asked, what are we going to do? De Oliveira is charged as part of this indictment now. He is expected to appear in a federal court in the Southern District of Florida next week. The former president is also charged with retaining an additional document. There were 31 documents listed in the indictment in the initial stage. This new indictment now lists a 32nd document. And this is a document that the former president has alleged to have been waving around during a meeting in July of 2021 where he was talking about a battle plan for an attack on Iran. Prosecutors say that this is one of the documents now that he was retaining and they have a recording of that meeting where he describes holding it.
