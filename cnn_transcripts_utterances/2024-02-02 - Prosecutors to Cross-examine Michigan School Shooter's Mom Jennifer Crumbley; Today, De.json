You remember that she is the mother on trial because her son ended up in a school, and shot and killed four people. And she is now being prosecuted for potential involuntary manslaughter. There is so much going on in this case.CNN's Jean Casarez is watching every single minute. We also have attorney Areva Martin who is joining us. They have been out talking about a really important issue that, Jean, you brought up before. What could happen here? Could we actually see text between the attorney and Crumbley?",

      "sentences": "Well, and that is normally attorney/client privilege, right? And the judge just said on the stand, you know, this is for me to waive, attorney/client privilege. That is a very serious situation. And she's not ready to do it right now but here is what it is. Yesterday, when Jennifer Crumbley was on the stand, they were talking about them staying in Detroit, staying at motels for a couple of night. Prosecution's theory is they fled, that they were going -- I even (ph) heard in opening statements, Canada potentially, they thought they might be going to. But the defense is saying they were getting threats and we have seen some of those threats on social media, purporting violence against them.They were scared and she testified to that. So that's why they were going to a motel and went to a place in Detroit, always intending to turn themselves in. Well, apparently, there are texts between Jennifer Crumbley and her attorney about them out of the jurisdiction, turning themselves in. Prosecutors said you opened the door. Jennifer Crumbley opened the door yesterday. We should have all of that. And so, the judge is now looking at these communications between an attorney and a client, to see if she is going to waive that privilege and can be cross-examined because the defense doesn't think that she was going to turn herself in -- prosecution. SIDNER: And just so you know, the prosecution. So, just so you know, this is such a huge issue because attorney-client privilege is sacrosanct. It is really a big deal to open that up to a jury. We are still watching the judge. The judge is talking on the stand right now. Usually, they would have started already. But there are all these issues they are trying to work out. Viva, I want to bring you in. Can you talk about what -- how they would do this? Would the judge decide exactly what the prosecutors would get? I mean, someone other than the prosecution is going to have to look at these texts to make sure that they are not going beyond the scope of what was said on the stand. Correct?",

But it's dangerous. I mean it's risky because, as you just said, you could open the door inadvertently, just by making a statement, and before you know it, you can find yourself in this kind of dispute that's happening before our very eyes in real time.I'm sure that Jennifer and her lawyer went over her testimony for hours and hours and hours before she took the witness stand. But even after you have been fully prepared by an attorney, it's so easy to make the kind of comment that Jennifer made on the witness stand. And it is so easy to find yourself in a line of questioning that was not anticipated by the attorney. So, it is always risky.",

And this all has to do with the allegations that have been brought by some of Trump's co- defendants and Trump himself eventually, that she had an inappropriate relationship with the lead prosecutor she appointed to this very case. And now, that threatens to derail one of the very serious criminal cases against cases against the former president.CNN's Zachary Cohen joins us now. He has got much more on this. And Zach, you have had some exclusive reporting throughout on Fani Willis' thinking, her plans, but what are you expecting to happen today?",

      "sentences": "Yeah, Kate, this will be the first time we are going to see Fani Willis directly address these allegations that you mentioned of an improper romantic relationship with her lead prosecutor. And sources are telling me that it is going to focus heavily on disputing the legal argument raised by Trump's attorney Steve Sadow and Trump's two co-defendants that she should be disqualified from this case because of these allegations. And they also argue that the case itself should be thrown out.So, that will be a heavy focus of Fani Willis' response that we anticipate getting today. Fani Willis has been personally involved in crafting this language, I'm told that by multiple sources. She's been quiet publically, but behind the scenes, really focused on these allegations and on this effort to get her pushed out of the case. And it really does set up a crucial two-week window for Fani Willis. We have this hearing, a hearing on these allegations scheduled for February 15th and Fani Willis has been subpoenaed to testify at that hearing. Looking ahead, the judge has really made a point to want to project fairness in this case. And so, it is entirely possible that Fani Willis will be forced to take the stand in this hearing in about two weeks, and that hearing will be dictated and set up around her response today.",

The FAA says the pilot reported engine failure before disappearing from radar about three miles from the runway.CNN's Omar Jimenez has the latest details on this for us.

We are just learning though from our preliminary FAA report that was just released this morning, yes, this happened just past 7And again, as we understand from authorities, this plane was -- did put out a distress signal, essentially the pilot saying, mayday, mayday. So, it alerted Air Traffic Control that there was some sort of issue and clearly something that the pilot was conscious of at the time. The plane then went off of radar around three miles or so past the Clearwater, Florida airport runway. This is where this happened, in Clearwater, Florida. Where the plane went off the radar, that is the location of the trailer park, mobile home area where the plane crashed into one. There was either some sort of explosion, at the very least flames that then spread to four other mobile homes as well. And again, as we learned from the FAA, one person killed, believed to be the only person inside this plane, again, based on preliminary data, the pilot being the only one, and then the two that were killed were on the ground. Though authorities did say last night, they were working to try to put out some of the hot spots, so they could work through the scene and try to see if there were potentially people trapped under debris or just to make sure they're covering all their bases here. Now, the only other thing will say is that, yes, the FAA, according to them, this was due to engine failure. That what was reported last night. This report though, interestingly, says that the aircraft crashed under unknown circumstances. So, this could just be a situation where they're trying to be as cautious as possible until they have a final conclusion, but at the very least, a tragic situation.",
