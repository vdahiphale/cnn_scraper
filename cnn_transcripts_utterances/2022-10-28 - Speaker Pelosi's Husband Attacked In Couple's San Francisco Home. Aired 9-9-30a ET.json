Paul Pelosi, the husband of Speaker Nancy Pelosi is hospitalized, we've learned, after he was attacked inside their San Francisco home. CNN's Whitney Wild is joining us with some of these details. So, this is just unfolding as we're learning some of these details, Whitney. But so far, what do we know? And how is he doing?",

He's expected to make a full recovery. We have very few details at this point. Notably though, the suspect is in custody. We are still collecting more information, Erica, but certainly this is a very disturbing case. And we'll keep on it.But right now, again, very few details. All we can tell you at this time is that Paul Pelosi was attacked early this morning in their San Francisco home. The Speaker was not at home. Erica.",

But notably, I mean, when you look at the timing here, it is particularly disturbing. These are all details about that Capitol Police will continue to investigate. The big question now is what was the motivation for this attack? That is certainly a top of mind for Capitol Police as they investigate this attack.",

I also want to - I do want to share - we do have a statement from the Speaker's office in which she notes that early this morning, assailant broke in to the Pelosi residence in San Francisco, in other words of the statement violently assaulted Mr. Pelosi.As you noted, Whitney, the assailant is in custody. The motivation for this attack is under investigation. And as it goes on to say that Mr. Pelosi was taken to hospital, as Whitney also noted is expected to make a full recovery. The statement going on to say the Speaker and her family are grateful to the first responders and medical professionals involved, understandably requesting some privacy at this time. So, in terms of how this would work. Obviously, there are people who have more than one residence, especially when they are a lawmaker, they often have a place in Washington and of course, they have their home where they live in San Francisco. I know the Pelosi's has also have other - other homes as well. With no information right now, in terms of a motive, how did the Capitol Police come in here? Would there have been some sort of security on site given that the Speaker wasn't there? And by that, I mean, additional security, Whitney/",

      "sentences": "Yes, it certainly will be. And you bring up such a great point there that this field office - field offices were opened around the country. But that's specifically there is one in the San Francisco area, which would obviously make it very easy for the Capitol Police to be fully in and involved on this investigation. Almost from the moment it began, given that proximity, Whitney stay with us.I also want to bring in Nia-Malika Henderson, you know, and even like, as we're looking at this, as Whitney just pointed out, one of the things the Capitol Police will likely be looking into is, were there threats, we don't know, it's important to know, we don't know of a specific threat to Paul Pelosi, to the Speaker, to their San Francisco home. Again, this is breaking news. So, we are - we are rolling this as we get more information. But important to note at this hour, we do not know of a specific threat. But the fact that there has been heightened concern for lawmakers, as we know that as Whitney pointed out, the Capitol, Police could be looking into any potential threats which may have been received for protectees. This really puts into sharp focus the climate in which we live now. NIA-MALIKA HENDERSON, CNN SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST: Let's think about what Susan Collins said earlier this month, the senator from Maine said she would not be surprised if a senator or House member was killed. She had someone throw a brick through her house in Maine, and she is speaking about the overall threat that lawmakers feel. And we've heard this from other lawmakers as well. So, in some ways, this is in line with what we've been hearing from lawmakers and what we've been hearing from law enforcement officials as well that there is this sort of increased atmosphere, and a sort of language around violence and actual violence, or attempted violence as well. So, this is deeply, deeply concerning. Well, obviously get more and more information as the day goes on. But for now, this is where we are, right. This is where we are, there is a sort of threat of political violence that political leaders have been talking about and fearing for many, many months.",

      "sentences": "And for really, Nia, if we go back years even, I mean, let's remember what was happening in the wake of the election in 2020. The incidents that we saw in airports where different lawmakers were being approached in airports or when they were home, trying to speak with their constituents or maybe on their way to something by people who were frustrated, and actually downright angry with them because they didn't agree with statements they had made, or what they had planned to do in terms of certifying the election. Those are all very real moments that have been adding up.",

      "sentences": "That's right. And listen, this has certainly been put on steroids over the last few years, certainly in the wake of Donald Trump's rhetoric, in the wake of what we saw in January 6th. A big example of political violence, attempted violence, violent language, threats of violence, hang Mike Pence, ideas about bringing Nancy Pelosi out of her office and doing, God knows what to her.But this is the atmosphere that has had not only lawmakers, but law enforcement officials are concerned over many, many months. So again, we'll see what happens with this. And you imagine that if you're a lawmaker, at this point, many have already stepped up their security. You imagine many might want to step up their security more particularly at this time, where if you listen to some of the rhetoric on the campaign trail, it is sort of laced with a maybe subtext of violence, threats, sort of this idea that there's a good side and a bad side and a good and an evil. And that kind of language falls on the wrong ears and this is the kind of thing that might end up happening.",

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY): The state where we're going downhill is Georgia. It's hard to believe that they will go for Herschel Walker. That seat, we're in danger in that seat.

New this morning, Elon Musk now in control of Twitter, his first big move, firing the company's top three executives. The billionaire has said he plans to loosen the company's content restrictions that could of course mean accounts that were once banned for violating the platform's rules could be reinstated. And number one at the top of that list, people are wondering about former President Donald Trump, could he return to the Twittersphere?Well, Musk tweeting overnight after his takeover, The bird is freed. Let's bring in Chief Business Correspondent Christine Romans and Will Oremus, who's written extensively about Elon Musk for The Washington Post. So, Christine, first as we look at what this means, right now, the impacts of this takeover will be felt. There were concerns about layoffs, the fact that he came in and immediately got rid of the leadership reportedly, this is a lot for employees to take in this morning.",

And he said, in a note to advertisers, he said, he's not doing this to make money. He's doing this for humanity. And he does it with humility, humility and Elon Musk, two things that sometimes don't go together very hand-in-hand.But he said, Twitter obviously cannot become a free for all hellscape where anything can be said with no consequences. But that's exactly what many people are worried about, because he has sort of said that this should be a forum for free speech, people should be able to say what they want, you shouldn't have people in a Right-wing echo chamber and a Left-wing echo chamber who aren't talking to each other. So unclear if he'll bring back people who have been banned from the space and how he will actually moderate this content.",

We know that Elon Musk has vacillated a bit between saying that he really wants to open the gates to unfettered free speech on Twitter, and then saying, well, you know, I don't think we want it to be overrun by extremists.People who have worked in the social media industry for a long time have come to realize for the most part that those two visions aren't really compatible. And if you don't have rules, you are going to attract the most extreme voices. And we are going to see that starting today probably. I mean - I'm already seeing in my Twitter feed people testing out the boundaries, seeing if they can now use racial slurs with impunity, make antisemitic comments, and now that Musk is in- charge, they're hopeful that he'll be sympathetic and that he won't ban them. So, we will see how that plays out. I mean, Twitter has never been the most civil place as anybody who uses it regularly could tell you, it may get a little wilder in wilier (ph).",

There won't be an SEC to look under the hood anymore because he doesn't have shareholders on Wall Street to where - public shareholders on Wall Street, pension funds and the like. So, he doesn't have that kind of pressure.Is this a vanity project for him? It's unclear and it's unclear what he'll do with it next.

OREMUSOnce rocket start launching for SpaceX, and there's a new Tesla car coming off the line. You know, there have been some initial reports that he might install himself as the CEO, I think he's probably going to find that that's not tenable that he needs a deputy to run the company. He has that at SpaceX, as part of SpaceX's success is that he has a deputy who really keeps things going day-to-day.

Speaker Nancy Pelosi reporting her husband Paul was attacked, violently attacked, according to a statement from her office inside their San Francisco home. He is now hospitalized. That statement from her office noting, it was early this morning, an assailant broke into the Pelosi residence in San Francisco and violently assaulted Mr. Pelosi.Also notes that the assailant is in custody. The motivation for the attack is under investigation. The statement also notes the Speaker was not home at the time, and that her husband is expected to make a full recovery. Key inflation measures just released this morning show prices still rising at a pretty uncomfortable level for folks. The prices consumers paid for goods and services up 6.2 percent for the year ending in September. So, new spending, earnings numbers also just released within the last hour. So, what does all of this mean? How do we translate it? This is when we turn to our good friend Rahel Solomon from CNN Business. What should we make of all these numbers and where things stand this morning, Rahel? RAHEL SOLOMON, CNN BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: Well, Erica, stop me if you've heard this before, but inflation continued to rise in the month of September. I hate to say it, but prices rose modestly 0.3 percent on a headline level. Core inflation, which strips away categories like food and energy, those prices rose about half a percent. So, on an annual basis, as you pointed out, Erica, prices are about 6.2 percent higher than they were a year ago. Of course, the Fed who by the way, they actually checked this report a bit more closely than they do, some of the other inflation reports. The Fed would like that 6.2 percent number, Erica, to be a lot closer to 2 percent. That is the target. So, clearly a lot of work ahead for the Fed. Now on the other hand, we also got some consumer spending data in the same report which showed consumer spending held on continuing even when adjusted for inflation was positive, which is what we saw in yesterday's GDP report too. So, yet another sign that even despite these higher prices, even despite these rising interest rates, consumers are hanging tight holding on and still spending.",
