Votes are still being counted as control of the House of Representatives remains up for grabs. Republicans only have to get seven of those remaining uncalled seats to take the majority in the House but Democrats are taking a big victory lap tonight after keeping control of the Senate with a late-night win in the crucial Nevada race. And Democrats are enjoying that feat that seemed very unlikely. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY): This is a very happy day. We had great candidates. They had flawed candidates. Our candidates were talking about the issues. They cared about people. The incumbents have gotten a lot done. Their candidates were off talking about lack of democracy and all -- spreading the big lie and all kinds of other things. REP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA): This is so -- such a cause for a celebration. Chuck Schumer was so correct when he said it was a victory for the people and for the country. I personally know that it is a joy to Harry Reid in heaven as he is that his state came through.

      "sentences": "So this is currently the makeup of the U.S. Senate. The Democrats have 50 seats. The Republicans have 49. There is still a run-off in Georgia, which takes place on December 6th. But no matter what happens there, the Democrats will maintain control of the Senate. If the Republicans manage to win that run-off in Georgia it will be a 50-50 split, the Vice President Kamala Harris would break the tie. But if the incumbent Democrat Raphael Warnock does win in this run-offin December the Democrats would have a 51-49 advantage, an outright majority, which, believe me, they would enjoy. It would mean the committee assignments don't have to be even. It would mean they could lose at least one Democratic vote in key moments in the Senate. So this is what it could look like going forward. How did we get to this point? The last Senate seat to be called was in Nevada. It was Catherine Cortez Masto over Adam Laxalt. Some of the mail vote that came in over the last several days helped her make up the deficit. She had been trailing by more than 22,000 votes just a few days ago, now leading by several thousand. So the Senate has been decided. That leaves the U.S. House of Representatives. This is something. Not many people would have thought that the Senate would be called for the Democrats before the House would be called for Republicans, but we just can't yet. There are too many outstanding races. Right now the Republicans control 211 seats. We projected they will win at least 211 seats. The Democrats 204. You need 218 seats in the House of Representatives to have a majority. 218, which means the Republicans need seven more, the Democrats would need 14 more. There are currently 20 seats that have not been called. 20 races that have yet to be called in these races right now. The Republicans lead in 10. They only need seven. They lead in 10. The Democrats lead in 10. They need 14. So you can see it's an uphill battle. The Democrats on this map right now would need to hold every district that is currently blue and then pick up four of the uncalled races that are still in red. Some of them are quite close. Let me just show you. In California, California's 13th Congressional District for instance right now, there is just a margin of 84 votes with 46 percent reporting, so the Democrats could potentially, potentially pick up a few of these seats. This district right here you can see Riverside County, that's just a county there, but you can see in this district right now California's 41st, the Republican leads by 2100 votes with just 53 remaining. So again, if the Democrats were to hold every blue district, every blue congressional district on this map, and pick up four of these red Republican ones, they would maintain control of the House. It's an uphill battle, but at this point not impossible. John Berman, CNN, New York. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Why do you think that happened in Pennsylvania? What does it tell us about the rest of the country? What happened with these midterms?SEN. BOB CASEY (D-PA): Well, Jim, I think what John Fetterman did in our state is a strong template for Democrats across the country heading into yet another election cycle. And I think it has national implications as well, which means that, number one, you have to perform well in the base of our party, in urban and suburban communities, and John did that where he was running even better in suburban and urban communities than President Biden. And as you remember, President Biden won our state by one. John is ahead by a little more than four now. But he also was able to reduce some of the margins of defeat in rural counties. We have mostly rural counties in Pennsylvania. So John did both. And I think that's a strong template. I think the foundation of it, though, wasn't simply his campaign. It's who he is. People knew John as lieutenant governor. They know he's been to every -- as he said, every county, every vote. And that connection he had to voters proved to be enduring despite an avalanche of negative advertising against him.",

Of course, it happens on both sides where Democrats had to concede some races. But it's part of the foundation of our democracy that we move forward after an election.And part of that is conceding defeat. But I'm happy that's happened in a number of races. But we have a long way to go, though, I think, to fortify our democracy. Part of that, I think, in the Senate, is continuing our fight to pass the Voting Rights Bill which will knock down some of the barriers to the right to vote that are being erected in some states.

But, you know, I think privately a lot of Democrats were scratching their heads and wondering whether or not that was the best strategy and that maybe focusing on more bread and butter issues, the economy, and that sort of thing was the way to go.What did you think when the president did that?

But if we had lost the Senate that would come to an end. And we stillhave some judges to confirm by the end of this year but it is critically important because on a lot of days the final word on what the law is isn't even the Supreme Court because a lot of cases don't get there. The final word on what the law is can often be at the appellate level. So it's critically important that we continue to confirm judges.

And should an opening come up in 2024, we heard Mitch McConnell say with Merrick Garland, that's not going to move forward in the Senate because it's an election year and so on.And then of course 2020 rolls around, Amy Coney Barrett gets on the Supreme Court.

I could see it in Pennsylvania in terms of the vote that we saw in this election.So there's no question that if a vacancy occurs we've got to get it filled.

But I think we should keep trying because that 60 vote rule is an impediment to progress. And, look. I'm hoping that Raphael Warnock, Senator Warnock wins inGeorgia not only because he is an extra vote but mostly because of who he is. His character, his commitment to public service, his commitment to the people of Georgia. And I think they deserve someone in the Senate who not only has proven in his short time in the Senate that he represents Georgia with distinction, But he'll fight the battles that they hope that a senator working on their behalf would fight.

They've spoken by phone and by video conference five times up to this point. But, Jim, as you know well, the president very much prefers face-to- face interaction with foreign leaders. And the goal here when you talk to White House officials is basically just better understanding, understanding red lines, really sharpening the perspective on priorities for each side. Areas where each side could potentially work together. More than anything else trying to find some type of pathway to set this relationship, which has been in a very low place into a better place. There is an understanding that the consequences of things continuing down the path they've been on the last two years are horrifying to some degree, probably not just for the bilateral relationship but for the entire world. There is a necessity to shift that. Whether they're able to in the meeting in a couple of hours I think is the big question for President Biden here in Bali.",

We heard one a week ago when Chancellor Scholz of Germany was visiting in China and we heard the Chinese leader issue a call that no country should threaten or use nuclear weapons to resolve a dispute. Well, that was a pretty clear message to Vladimir Putin. At the same time, what's hanging over this entire meeting is a growing sense of an alliance that is emerging between Russia and China. That's exactly what Nixon was trying to avoid when he opened up the relationship with them. I reported with one of my colleagues from Asia in this weekend's \"Times\" that there is a division of opinion inside the administration about how big that alliance is. We've heard from the Pentagon that they believe it is being nurtured and it's real. It's a real anti-American alliance despite the long, historic tensions between China and Russia.

We think they probably are. I'm sure that Xi looked at what happened to Putin and said, could this happen to me? And it might give him pause.

We won't know if that path is closed.At least I couldn't tell you that. Other people may. But what we do know is that if it does not close tonight that path could potentially narrow.",

Investigators from the National Transportation Safety Board are now on the scene at the Dallas Executive Airport documenting the wreckage of not one but two airplanes involved in this midair collision. Both part of volunteer organizations that keep World War II planes flying.The larger airplane, a B-17 Flying Fortress, you've seen it in the movies, famous for the daylight bombing raids over Europe in World War II. The other airplane an extremely rare P-63 King Cobra, a single seat fighter plane. In both cases only a handful of examples flying worldwide. Airplanes like this do not have a flight data recorder or a cockpit voice recorder so investigators say they'll listen to the recordings of radio traffic. They are also asking for witnesses to come forward with photos and video, more examples of the horrific scene keep getting posted online by spectators. Nobody in the crowd was hurt. In fact airshows in the U.S. a spectator has not been killed in more than 50 years. Airshows are heavily regulated, highly planned, very choreographed. And the pilots must have special qualifications. They accept the most risk here in the name of keeping history alive -- Jim.",

Of course we'll remind our viewers what took place on January 6th. The vice president was up on Capitol Hill at that time to preside over the counting of those electoral votes, putting President Biden over the top to become the next president of the United States.There were rioters and insurrectionists up on Capitol Hill chanting \"hang Mike Pence\" at that time. But now nearly two years after all of that occurred Mike Pence saying in this interview with ABC News that Donald Trump's words on the day of the Capitol Hill insurrection were, quote, \"reckless.\" All of this comes after Trump and many of his followers suffered heavy losses during the midterm cycle. And Mike Pence obviously putting some distance between himself and the former president as he considers whether to run for president in 2024. Now to an update on the midterm elections. These are -- there are votes still being counted we should note at this hour, as the House of Representatives remains up for grabs. 20 House races remained uncalled and right now Republicans have won 211 seats, Democrats have 204. 218 -- 218 is the magic number needed to control the House meaning Republicans only need seven of the remaining seats to retake that chamber. But Democrats are taking a big victory lap tonight. Of course it was a feat that seemed very unlikely just days ago that they would hold control of the Senate for at least the next two years. But they've done exactly that. A late-night call that Democratic Senator Catherine Cortez Masto will keep her seat, will keep her seat in Nevada pushing Democrats over the number to keep control of the Senate. More votes are coming in throughout the night. We are expecting a new vote count. Our Kyung Lah was just talking about that a few moments ago. A new vote count from Arizona. That could be coming in in just one hour. Those numbers as they come in could decide the governor's race in that state, that very closely watched, highly contested race between Katie Hobbs and Kari Lake. CNN is watching all of these very closely and we'll continue to keep you updated throughout the evening on all the latest developments. So stay tuned with CNN for all of that. In the meantime, Dolly Parton is being honored and it's not for her many musical talents. The country music legend and longtime philanthropist is the latest recipient of the Jeff Bezos Courage and Civility Award. It comes with $100 million with no strings attached, if you can believe that. Parton has donated to various causes for decades. And Jeff Bezos spoke with our very own Chloe Melas about this decision.
