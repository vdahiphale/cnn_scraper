The humanitarian crisis in Gaza is escalating, and the president is under growing pressure to help get desperately needed aid, food, water, and other aid to the millions of civilians stuck in this war zone.This morning we are continuing to see Israel strike Gaza. Some of those airstrikes were right near the border crossing between Gaza and Egypt. That crossing remains closed as Israel's blockade continues. And this is new video of smoke rising near the border wall there. It is the same border crossing where vital humanitarian aid has been piling up. The World Health Organization is now warning that water is running out for hundreds of thousands of Palestinians.",

The Israeli military is calling it an attempt at, quote, psychological warfare, and expects more videos to be released. Here is what the woman's mother said this morning.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KEREN SCHARF SCHEM, MOTHER OF MIA SCHEM WHO'S BEING HELD HOSTAGE IN GAZA:  I didn't know she's dead or alive until yesterday. All I knew is that she might be kidnapped. And I'm begging the world to bring my baby back home. She only went to a party, to a festival party, to have some fun. And now she's in Gaza.

He says that when we have done that in the past, that is what has resulted in Hamas's leadership being let out of jail and able to return and plan attacks like the ones we saw last Saturday. He said there is no appetite for that at the moment. The preference would be to go into Gaza, to uproot Hamas, and then to try to rescue as many of those hostages as possible in sort of operations on the ground.

DAVID AXELROD, CNN SENIOR POLITICAL COMMENTATORanswer to your question was contained within it. This is a really complicated matrix for the President. He wants to show solidarity with the Israelis. He's done that very well so far, wants to send a strong message of solidarity, at the same time privately counseling discretion, because the story, as it unfolds out of Gaza, is going to shape a global opinion. It's going to potentially, as Christiane mentioned inflame other actors, to get involved and may cause moderate Arab states that were moving toward Israel to move away from Israel. There are a lot of implications here, and on top of that, you've got American hostages.

On the wider war issue, the US, you heard John Kirby say they have no evidence that beyond rhetoric right now, Iran is planning to get involved, or indeed, that Hezbollah is planning to get involved.And if you wouldn't mind, I just want to read you something very instructive from Hassan Nasrallah, the head of Hezbollah after the 2006 war, which essentially, they fought to a draw with Israel, which I covered.
