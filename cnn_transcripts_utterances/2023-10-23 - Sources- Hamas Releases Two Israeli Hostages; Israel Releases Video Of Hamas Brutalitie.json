Hamas has released two more of the hostages it kidnapped from Israel during its October 7th terrorist attack. That's according to multiple sources who say the hostages are Nurit Cooper and Yocheved Lifshitz. The Lifshitz family said in a statement that the women were handed over to the Red Cross and will shortly to Israel. We happened to be at the time with Israeli Defense Forces spokesman Jonathan Conricus, when the news came in, and this is part of his reaction. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And the White House believes a handful of those kidnapping victims are Americans.A U.S. official told CNN today that Israel believes at least some of the American hostages are still alive, and sources say the U.S. has been pushing Israel to continue delaying its ground incursion into Gaza to allow more time to get hostages out, as well as allowing crucial humanitarian relief into Gaza. I want to bring in CNN's Alex Marquardt, as well as CNN's Jeremy Diamond, who is in Ashkelon, Israel. And, Alex, we're hearing that these two hostages are Israeli citizens, all that we're hearing some other information about maybe one or both of them also might be dual citizens. I'm not quite sure.

This is, of course, the second release of hostages we've seen since Friday. Judith and Natalie Raanan were released on Friday, American citizens. Now, we have the release of Yocheved Lifshitz, 85 years old, and Nurit Cooper, 79 years old.The results of these ongoing and rather intense negotiations that Hamas is speaking with both Qatar and Egypt. Qatar, certainly leading those efforts from our understanding. So we got word not too long ago that these two Israeli women were being released by Hamas. There are released into Red Cross custody. We understand from the Lifshitz family statement, from Yocheved Lifshitz's daughter, that they were given to the Red Cross at the Rafah crossing. That is the Gaza border crossing with Egypt, and that they will soon be back in Israel, and we assume handed over to Israeli officials. Yocheved Lifshitz's daughter says she can't put into words the relief that she is now feeling that her mother is now safe. But Jake, we should note that her father is still among the more than 200 hostages still in Hamas custody. So, this is the same mechanism, the same model, if you, well that was used for the release of the Raanan women on Friday. They are still in Israel, I understand. They're going to be de-briefed by U.S. officials so that the U.S. can glean what they can in terms of intelligence, how they were held, how they were moved around, whatever the U.S. can learn about that time in custody in Gaza. Jake, I should also note that one day after the release of these Raanans on Saturday, Hamas said they were reeling to release two more people. And at the time, over the weekend, the office of Prime Minister Netanyahu, he called that false propaganda from Hamas. So I think they're going to be a lot of questions right now for the prime minister. We also have to see what will happen now, Jake. This is sort of a slow trickle of these hostage releases, one of course, Israel, the U.S., and all these other countries who have hostages are demanding that they all get released immediately, Jake.",

Alex Marquardt and Jeremy Diamond in Ashkelon, thank you so much.Today, here in Israel, there's a renewed effort by Israeli officials to try to not only dispel myths and rumors, but also be clear about Hamas's brutality against innocent civilians. The Israeli Defense Force has gathered hundreds of international journalists today to show them proof, to show them videos such as this one, which the IDF released today, proof positive, evidence of Hamas brutality. The IDF says this is proof of the brutality of Hamas. They showed up for mass gunman shooting a driver on an Israeli highway. Beyond this video that they released today, they also showed another 40-minute long film from the GoPro data on the bodies of dead Hamas terrorists, 40 minutes. This was shown to CNN and other journalists, both last week and today. We're not going to show you these videos, this 40 minutes, so graphic, so disgusting, so disturbing from the point of view of the terrorists. But you should know what's in them, some of the images that the journalists who saw them witnessed. Such as, a father and his two young sons, maybe seven or eight, running for their lives into a shelter of some sort, a terrorist throws a grenade into the shelter, the dad is killed, the boys are wounded. Another shows a terrorist trying to be had a man with some sort of garden hoe. Another shows a truckfull of terrorists throwing the corpse of a woman onto the road. Images of burned babies. I asked IDF spokesman Jonathan Conricus why, why does Israel feel the need to show this evidence? To show this proof to the world? (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

The question now, how direct is the support? Officials say it's not that Iran is necessarily saying go carry out these attacks, but according to these officials, it appears that Iran is encouraging them and doing nothing to stop them. A far more direct link than U.S. officials believe around had with the initial October 7th attack carried out by Hamas. In that case, U.S. officials said Iran was surprised by the attack. Here, there is no surprise. There's a much clearer link that the U.S. is seeing, and it comes, as you point out, with a number of attacks that have taken place against U.S. forces in Iraq and Syria on the U.S. positions there. It also comes as just a few days ago, we saw the USS Carney, a destroyer in the Red Sea there, intercepting a number of drones and missiles that the U.S. says where intended for Israel.

The big debate here is whether we should deal with Hezbollah first. And it was a debate I had written in the Israeli press about the possibility that maybe we should contain Hamas because they're not going anywhere, right? They're trapped. We can continue getting them from the ground, from the air, any different way. But Hezbollah as a force, a threat, is about 15 times larger than Hamas. They have 150,000 rockets. They can could hit anything in Israel with a bigger payload, and many of these rockets are very accurate, and they have a terrorist force that is been killing Syrians by the hundreds of thousands for ten years. So they are vicious, vicious, vicious. And there's a fear, and I think of a base fear, that one Israel isn't by -- Gaza, bogged down, the troops are tired, maybe running low on ammunition, that's when Hezbollah will strike us. That's almost a conventional wisdom here, that Hezbollah at a certain stage will not be able to stay at. The big question is, who strikes first? Who gets the preemptive?",

Places of worship, refugee camps, schools, where innocent civilians are trying to stay safe are caught in the crosshairs because as we know, Hamas uses innocent civilians as human shields. They embed themselves within the populace.CNN's Jomana Karadsheh reports now from southern Israel, and a warning, some may find her report disturbing. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JOMANA KARADSHEH, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): This is a war on Hamas, Israel says. But it is the people of Gaza who are paying the heaviest price. No place safe, no place spared Israel's wrath. Danger looms around every corner of this besieged land. Every day, every minute spent in fear of one death may strike. Many now write their children's names on their legs so that if they're killed, their little ones are not just a number. Israel says it doesn't target civilians, it's Hamas, they say, that's using them as human shields. They tried to avoid civilian casualties, they say. But the numbers and pictures tell a different story in a place where it is the innocent who are the majority. Hospitals, schools, mosques have been bombed, and on Friday, Gazans absorbing another horror, one that hit their tiny Christian community. An airstrike on a building at the compound of the Saint Porphyrius Orthodox Church, one of the oldest churches in the world, where hundreds had sought refuge from the relentless bombardment. But this was no sanctuary. A scene of chaos at this house of worship, with no power, they use their phones to light up the rubble and big bodies and survivors out of the carnage. Daylight brought the painful scenes of those searching for shrouded bodies for their loved ones, the inconsolable grief of those who found them. The gut wrenching grief as the father warned his children, and a grandmother, her little George. RAMZI AL-SOURI, GAZA RESIDENT (through translator): With no prior warning, they bombed civilians in the church. They killed my three children. They killed my cousins. My whole cousin's family was wiped.",
