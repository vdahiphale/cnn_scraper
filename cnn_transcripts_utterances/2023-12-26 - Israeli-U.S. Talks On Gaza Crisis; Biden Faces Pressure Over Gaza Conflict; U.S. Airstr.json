And as you mentioned there, it is a critical time as the U.S. looks for Israel to move away from its high- intensity war as that death toll grows in Gaza. So, Ron Dermer will be meeting with Secretary of State Antony Blinken and National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan this afternoon. He is a close confidant of Israel, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. He's also a member of the war cabinet and previously Israel ambassador to the United States.Now, Israel has assured the United States previously that it plans to move toward a lower-intensity war. More precisely strategy that targets Hamas leadership. But there hasn't been a timeline as to when that will happen. U.S. officials have previously said that they would expect those localized operations to happen in January. But again, publicly, we haven't really received any sort of clarity in terms of when that phase of the war would begin. So, that's a big question going into the discussions today. And so far, U.S. and Israel have described their conversations as good. A senior Israeli official saying that the U.S. and Israel are on both -- are on the same side, even if there are some differences. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

We say that all hostages must come back home, 129 of them.And we will also guarantee that Gaza will no longer pose a terror threat to Israelis ever again once we are done. So, these are the goals.

You're looking at video of the massive caravan of migrants marching toward the U.S. border on Christmas Eve. And this comes as CNN is learning that more than 11,000 people are already waiting in shelters on the Mexican side of the border, hoping to get in through legal channels to the U.S.  Secretary of State Tony Blinken is headed to Mexico tomorrow to try and hammer out new agreements to better control the flow of migrants. We have CNN's Rosa Flores. She's there in Eagle Pass, Texas for us. Rosa, I know you have some new reporting on migrant apprehensions in the region that you are in. Tell us about this. ROSA FLORES, CNN CORRESPONDENTenforcement source who says that the daily apprehensions in the Del Rio sector, which includes Eagle Pass, where I am, they were about 2,000 yesterday. Now, this number is significant because just last week, that average number was 3,000 daily. Now, we're seeing the effects of this because if you look behind me, you can see that there is an open field. Just last week, there were thousands of migrants who were waiting to be transported to immigration processing facilities. And we're not seeing that today. But a CBP official telling me that this does not mean, that the agency is out of the woods yet, because here is what they're dealing with. First of all, there's about 11,000 migrants who are waiting in northern border cities in northern Mexico, waiting for legal pathways to enter into the United States. Now, organizations there that are familiar with the thinking of these migrants, they say that some of the migrants are losing their patience and they're entering the country illegally. So, there's that factor. Then there are smugglers who are waiting to be transported to the United States. And they're waiting for legal pathways to enter into the United States. And then there's those individuals who are working to push migrants through the U.S. southern border illegally. And there's two different types of migrants that they try to push through. Migrants who just simply turn themselves in. These are moms and dads with children who just turn themselves in to U.S. immigration authorities. And then there's those individuals that smugglers try to sneak into the United States who have criminal pasts. They're also trying to sneak in drugs. And so Border Patrol, they're trying to manage all of this. The Biden administration is trying to manage all of this. And when they're trying to manage all of this, there is a surge. The Biden administration usually surges resources to the southern border to try to deal with that. That's what's happening right now. They're also using methods like decompression. That's when migrants from this area where it has been saturated are transported to other areas like the Rio Grande Valley and Laredo and Del Rio to make sure that those migrants are processed swiftly. And I want to take you to Del Rio. We have video. We were there yesterday of a mass that took place there. This group of migrants actually, entered through Eagle Pass, you know where I am. But they ended up there because of decompression. And the priest there that is nearby that center told us that on Friday, he saw about 200. The number fluctuates. Yesterday, it was about two dozen. And he normally feeds them three times a day. But yesterday on Christmas Day, he also celebrated mass with them. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

I remember covering the migrant surge in 2019 under President Trump and 1000 apprehensions a day was a huge surge in the Rio Grande Valley that used to be the epicenter of this. And this just shows you to how the smuggling networks also orchestrate. And that's what border patrol is so worried about because it creates gaps in border security.
