The former president is still leading the way in Iowa, New Hampshire and indeed nationally, but voters, of course, have not cast a single ballot. So, he is hoping that they will listen to his argument.Now the question is, in this race for second, did Haley or DeSantis make any movements? The Iowa Republican voters we spoke to after the debate gave both of them high marks in different ways. Haley, they said, was presidential. DeSantis got his conservative record through. Of course, evangelical voters so important in Iowa. So, at the end of the day, perhaps the biggest winner once again was not on stage, Donald Trump. But there is no doubt it was the smallest stage yet. But perhaps the most consequential, biggest debate of all. Again, the votes start in less than six weeks. Jeff Zeleny, CNN, Tuscaloosa, Alabama. (END VIDEOTAPE) NOBILO: Last hour, I spoke with the director of the Center on U.S. Politics at University College London and I asked how he thinks the candidates fared. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) THOMAS GIFT, DIRECTOR, CENTER ON U.S. POLITICS, UNIVERSITY COLLEGE LONDON: Haley and DeSantis they're both vying to be \"the\" and not just a Trump alternative heading into Iowa. And so, it got negative. And I think it really felt like a tag team effort to me where you had De Santis and Ramaswamy throwing grenades at Haley. Haley trying desperately to defend herself and relying considerably on Chris Christie. I'm not sure if that equation works to Haley's advantage, given that Christie is also going so hard at Donald Trump. But ultimately, I don't think there was a clear winner.

So, he has been in Israel sites ever since that, but especially now, of course, in in this war.And I think, you know, looking at the video that the idea has put out, I think hopefully we can show it again, of the battles in Khan Younis, you get a sense of -- there's just the intensity of fighting going on at the moment. The effort that it's taken to get to this point street by street in this town. Obviously, this is IDF video. We can't verify it. They have blurred the faces. And crucially, what this doesn't show is the civilians. Because we know that even before the war, some 400,000 people lived in Khan Younis. We can only assume that it's more now because of the displacement from the north. So, there's again, even as they try to track down Sinwar, is an extremely delicate moment in the conflict where Israel needs to prove to the international community that it can do this while protecting civilians.",

The agency has initiated a murder case following the incident. And police are investigating how she obtained the weapon and brought it to school. And we'll bring you more details as they come in.
