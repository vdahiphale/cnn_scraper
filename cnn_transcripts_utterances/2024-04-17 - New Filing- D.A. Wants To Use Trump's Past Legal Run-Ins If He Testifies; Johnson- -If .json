What could be coming at the former President if he ends up taking the stand? An impeachment trial ends just hours after it began. Yes, a Biden cabinet member now keeps his job, while the Speaker of the House is clinging on to his. After teeing up a vote, it's only expanding a right-wing revolt. And a new blow to Boeing, as a whistleblower testifies the aviation giant is knowingly putting out defective planes that could break apart during flight. Our source tonight, is an engineer, looking at the safety at Boeing, who also lost his sister in a deadly plane crash. I'm John King, in for Kaitlan Collins. This is THE SOURCE. A shot across the bow to Trump. Arguments not yet underway in the former President's first criminal trial. But the prosecution just revealed what it wants to use against him, if, big if, he ends up testifying in his own defense. That is a giant if despite the former President's claims. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP (R), FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT AND 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I would testify. Absolutely. It's a scam. It's a scam. That's not a trial. I'm testifying. I tell the truth. I mean, all I can do is tell the truth. And the truth is that there's no case. They have no case. And again, you have to read the scholars, read all of the legal scholars. I haven't seen one legal scholar that said this is a case. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

It's a long list. We don't have time for all of it.But prosecutors say they would ask the former President, about the recent verdicts against him. How, for example, he was found liable for business fraud, ordered to pay tens of millions of dollars to E. Jean Carroll for defamation. And prosecutors say they would bring up how he was fined for violating a court order, by publicly attacking a judge's law clerk, despite being warned not to do so. There will be a hearing eventually on whether all of that is fair fodder. But it does beg the question, whether prosecutors are hoping to discourage Trump from testifying, by showing him all of he would face if he takes the stand. The trial resumes tomorrow, with jury selection continuing. Seven jurors seated yesterday. Five more needed, plus alternates, six of those most likely. On this off day, Trump's on another one of his trademark fact-free tears, carping today about not being allowed, quote, \"Unlimited\" strikes, meaning disqualifications, when picking the jury, ranting because he says his side can't veto any prospective juror they want. Each side only gets 10 strikes. That's New York State law. And his lawyers certainly know that. We've got legal sources from all perspectives, tonight. From the prosecution table, our CNN Legal Analyst, former Assistant U.S. Attorney, Elie Honig. From the defense side, veteran New York attorney, Arthur Aidala, whose past high-profile clients have ranged, from Harvey Weinstein to Rudy Giuliani. And bringing us the view from the bench, former New York State Supreme Court Justice, Jill Konviser. Arthur, I want to start with you. With this list, it's a routine step. Prosecution says if your defendant takes the stand, these are some of the things we'd talk about him. If you're Trump's defense counsel, and you look at this list, does that dissuade you? Does it make it less likely you would say testify?",

So, that's my first motion for a mistrial. My second motion for a mistrial is I wanted to know this, and this judge's ruling, before he start picking the jury, because I may want to stand up there and say, Mrs. Jones, my client may very well testify here. And if he does testify, you may hear that another judge has sanctioned him. How is that going to affect you assessing his or her credibility? So, none of that has taken place. So, those are the steps I would take legally. Also, Mr. Trump, his lawyers can ask the judge, to give him more than the 10 trials, that the more -- the more strikes. There's a case law that goes back to the 1970s, where a judge has the power, to give more challenges. In the long run, John, my client's not testifying in this case.",

Pentagon leaders now worried the tide shifting, dramatically perhaps, in Russia's favor. A lot to discuss with David Sanger, the White House and National Security Correspondent, for The New York Times. His new book, \"New Cold Wars\" is out now. Sanger has covered five presidents, starting with Bill Clinton. In the book, he describes how a fundamental misunderstanding of countries, like Russia and China, influenced U.S. policy. For instance, Sanger writes, quote, \"Each President claimed he had achieved meaningful progress toward integrating America's adversaries into a world order Washington had created and nurtured for seventy- five years... Each new bond... A sign the world's most powerful nations were rowing together. They were not.\" David Sanger, grateful for your time tonight. Let me just start. I think one of the most provocative things is just the title, not New Cold War, but plural, \"New Cold Wars.\" The mess is everywhere. DAVID SANGER, CNN POLITICAL &amp; NATIONAL SECURITY ANALYST: Well, that's right, John. And what I want to try to make clear from that title is that the old Cold War was sort of a singular event, between the United States and the Soviet Union. It had a predictability about it. We understood who had launch authority for their weapons. We understood pretty much what they would do and what motivated them. This is a new era in which you have Russia, China, to some degree, Iran, gathered together, in something that the Iranians call the Axis of Resistance to U.S. influence. It's a huge shift. Just nine years ago, during the Iran nuclear negotiations, the Russians and the Chinese were sitting on the American and European side of the table. Hard to imagine that today. So, we're in a very different environment. And the question the book tries to pose is how did we get here? And how do you get out of it? KING: Well, let's dig into that.

That China would do something similar in order to keep open to the markets. We were, to some degree, projecting our motivations on them. And what President Biden has inherited is the wreckage that has come from the discovery we weren't watching carefully enough. There's a scene, at the beginning of the book. And I think you may remember this, John, from when George W. Bush and his wife are floating down the Neva River, in St. Petersburg, with Vladimir Putin, one of their two dozen meetings. Joe Biden has had one, and probably will never have another with President Putin. And on the boat, they're talking about joining -- having Russia join the European Union, having Russia maybe, one day, join NATO, the alliance that was created, in order to contain them.

Seven jurors are already selected.And we already have a pretty good idea, as to how the next 11 are picked. Six jurors and six alternates will have their social media intensely scrutinized. We have that idea, because of what the transcripts -- transcript -- excuse me -- tell us about jury selection so far. I want to bring in, for this conversation, veteran tech journalist, Kara Swisher, a Contributing Opinion Writer for The New York Times, and the host of the great podcast, \"Sway.\" Kara, great to see you. I want to read a few of these tweets. I guess it's a sign of our times. Dug up by Trump's lawyers and flagged during the trial. One person, who was a prospective juror posted, \"[G]et him out and lock him up,\" and \"Watch out for stupid tweets by DJT.\" Another posted an A.I. video titled, \"I Am Dumb As\" insert expletive \"Trump.\" While another prospective juror's husband posted a picture of Obama and Trump from 2016, and said, \"I don't think this is what they meant orange is the new black.\" The last juror was not dismissed, because it was her husband's posts. What do you make of this? Is there some karma, some irony, in that Donald Trump, the king of offensive social media, sitting there, listening to tweets about him?",

I think if they can do their jobs and be fair, that it's possible. You can have political opinions, and still be able to judge someone based on the evidence. And I think that's really where the rubber meets the road. And I think the judge has been knocking out stuff that seems ridiculous. And if someone's very clearly anti-Trump, they shouldn't serve on the jury. But in general, making jokes or passing around memes is sort of table stakes, these days.",
