      "sentences": "Hello, everyone. Thank you again for joining me. I'm Fredricka Whitfield.And we begin this hour with discovery of more classified this hour with discovery of more classified documents at President Biden's Delaware home. This afternoon, the White House announced that additional pages of classified material were found Thursday at the president's private residence in Wilmington. CNN previously reported that 10 classified documents from Biden's time as vice president were also found at his former private office in Washington, D.C., and this comes as U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland has appointed a special counsel to take over the investigation. For the very latest, let's bring in CNN's Arlette Saenz at the White House. Arlette, what more can you tell us about this statement from the Biden administration?",

      "sentences": "Well, Fred, we're getting new details about exactly the number of classified pages that were found at President Biden's residence up in Wilmington, Delaware. And really based on CNN's reporting and also these disclosures that have been made by the White House Counsel's office, it appears there were approximately 20 documents of classified markings that were found between the residence in Delaware as well as that Washington, D.C. office that President Biden used when he had left the vice president's office.Now, today in a statement from White House Counsel, they had previously said that they had found one document amounting to one page in an adjacent room to the garage in vice president -- or in President Biden's home up in Delaware. But today the White House Counsel is saying there were actually an additional five pages that were found in that adjacent room. The way that this is explained by the White House Counsel as well as the president's personal lawyers is that the personal lawyers who were conducting these initial searches of these sites, they do not have security clearances. So when they have come across documents and pages that have classified markings, they have stopped their work there, have not searched through other boxes, and they have called and notified the proper authorities. At first it was the National Archives. And now since the Justice Department review has been under way, it's been the Justice Department. So when Biden's personal lawyers came across this one document with one page, they stopped their search there and notified the Justice Department. Then on Thursday, the White House Counsel, Richard Sauber, went up to Wilmington, Delaware, to facilitate the transfer of those documents. It is at that moment where they found an additional five pages that were then handed over to the Justice Department. Now, the White House Counsel released a very thorough statement in which they also said, quote, \"The president's lawyers have acted immediately and voluntarily to provide the Penn Biden documents to the Archives and the Wilmington documents to DOJ. We have now publicly released specific details about the documents identified, how they were identified, and where they were found.\" The White House is insisting that they will continue to cooperate throughout this investigation that the special counsel will be conducting. But certainly, this is just the latest trickling out of information that has come from the White House since Monday when it was first revealed in media reports that there were classified documents found at that Penn Biden Center office here in Washington, D.C. So there's still so many questions about how they've handled this. One thing that the president's personal lawyer, Bob Bauer, tried to stress in a statement today is that the reason that they are limited in what they can share is because they don't want anything to impact the investigations that are under way. But certainly, this White House will continue to face questions about their handling of this, who knew what when, and the decisions on when they decided to disclose things. But for the time being, the White House says that they will continue to cooperate throughout this process with the special counsel and that, ultimately, they believe that the review will find that these items were simply inadvertently misplaced.",

At a transfer station is where they found a hacksaw and torn up material including some blood-stained clothing material that law enforcement is looking at. That was at the Peabody transfer station. Then also at Brian Walshe's mother's home, investigators there were taping up the area near the dumpster. That is another area where they have been collecting evidence and in Swampscott. And last, it was at the Walshe's home where law enforcement sources confirmed to us they found blood stains and a damaged, bloody knife in the basement of the home. I wanted to speak to a forensic expert about what the next couple of days are going to look like as this investigation continues to unfold. Here's what he told us. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DR. LARRY KOBILINSKY, FORENSICS EXPERT:  The analysis can be completed in a day or two. That's if it's a high-priority case. Otherwise, it would take several weeks.

And Fredricka, people need to know 85 to 91 percent of women who are victims of homicide are killed by intimate partners, male partners specifically. So when you see something like a phone call to police, so it had to bevery serious to raise to that level, where she wants the police to know as a matter of record her husband threatened to kill her and her friend. We don't know the circumstances exactly around that, but that later, didn't want to cooperate, charges dropped, nothing ever happened with it. We see that all the time in domestic violence cases. And keep in mind we're not always talking about physical violence, but a lot of emotional and psychological violence, if you will. Love bombing, we call it, after such an incident -- flowers, dates. And they're married a year later, which is astonishing, and so have been married the last seven years. Who knows what goes on behind closed doors?

I'm getting notices about evacuation warnings, or evacuations that are happening just a couple miles away from my house right now. Sheriffs are going door-to-door. Fortunately, we're safer and sound here. We've been very lucky that my neighborhood has been spared from the worst of the flooding, but it's so close. It feels just like it could be any moment that it could, it could come here. It could be on our doorstep, the flooding. And it's incredibly unnerving for everybody in the community.",

You'll have a choice about where you do want to set roots. And the state is being hit by extreme weather, and there are recent reports that it's accelerating.
