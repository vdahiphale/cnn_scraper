Well, you can do it one consecutive term.So, I do have to ask you, governor. You pulled off a surprise, come- from-behind upset victory in a state, a commonwealth that a lot of people thought was pretty solidly blue. Maybe it's purple now. You are term limited. Are you giving any thought to running for higher office such as president? YOUNGKIN:  Well, first of all, thank you for that humbling question. You know, I just have to say that 40 years ago, I was in Virginia Beach, and I was washing dishes and taking out trash at Belvidere Coffee Shop. And I had an extraordinary with great education and people took interest in my professional career and I thought I was in my dream job when I had a chance to take over a firm that I worked at for 25 years. And then I found myself with this real clear view that Virginia was heading in the wrong direction and maybe there was a different way to do this. Maybe there was a way to bring people together around common sense, bring people together around values that aren't that controversial. We just need to express them clearly to one another and get moving. And I have been so pleased by the fact that all the things we campaigned on, we accomplished. I have a big job. I love my job. Thank you for hiring me. Thank you for letting me come to work every day and go to work for 8.7 million Virginians. That's where my focus is right now. And I believe there's an enormous amount of work yet to do in Virginia. We have got a budget to negotiate. We have a lot of work still to do in education. And every morning I wake up and I thank the Lord for putting me there. I ask him for help and then I go to work with a spring in my step. So, again, thank you for hiring me.",

And all it does is raise the bar and want me to get more done faster in our second year, so we don't lose a generation of kids and that Virginia can return to what she once was, which was a place where people came from all over the world to come to Virginia for our schools, for our great K through 12, for our great universities.

Also, prosecutors in New York signaling that Donald Trump could be facing criminal charges over the hush money payment to Stormy Daniels. This is according to The New York Times. But this is no slam dunk. So, will we see a former president indicted for the first time in American history? And what would this mean for his presidential campaign? Plus, new developments in the deadly kidnapping of four Americans, two of them killed, in Mexico. Why the cartel suspected of being behind this kidnapping, the so-called Gulf Cartel, has issued a handwritten apology letter. Also, what a woman who was traveling with those four Americans is saying tonight about what happened. Plus, Tennessee's lieutenant governor is responding after posting some supportive comments and emojis on a young gay man's Instagram photos. We'll have to tell you about the posts and the emojis. This, remember, is in a state that's been passing laws to restrict LGBTQ rights. We have got a lot to talk about tonight. So, let me bring in our panel. We have the always compelling L.Z.

Let me read a portion of it. They said, here it is and here is a picture of it, the Gulf Cartel apologizes to the society of Matamoros, the relatives of Mizereli (ph), that was the Mexican citizen who was also shot and killed, and the affected American people and families. The Gulf Cartel, Scorpion Group, strongly condemns the events of last Friday. For this reason, we decided to hand over those directly involved and responsible for the act who, at all times, acted under their determination and indiscipline and against the rules in which the Gulf Cartel always operates.Chemali, is this for real?",

I look at this as just like any authoritarian leader that tries to throw their people under the bus, where they were trying to say that, you know what, these were rogue elements, they had nothing to do with how we normally pursue policies. In fact, I heard that the leader of this cartel said that they normally don't target innocent civilians, which I am certain to be untrue. And so I don't know what they think that their goal will be from this. It's probably they think that they will get some kind of lenient response from Mexican authorities in particular.",

That were the relationship between the United States and Mexico and particularly between authorities and the drug enforcement agency fell apart last year when the president disbanded decades of work between these two sides.

GRANDERSON, OP-ED COLUMNIST, LOS ANGELES TIMES:  Well, yes. I mean, in a word, yes, it is scary. And it's important that we remind Americans that this is scary, because we think Cancun, we think vacations, we think, well, we can be Americans everywhere. And it's like, no, you can be an American in America. And then you can be a responsible tourist or visitor everywhere else.

But if you look at this as a strategy through the Manhattan D.A.'s office, of course, they changed district attorneys after the elections, so there was a reassessment of this case. But when they circled back to it, they do the Trump corporate case. They indict the company. Weisselberg testifies. His lawyer testifies.And what's revealed in that case is a pattern and practice of concealing what money was actually for, where money actually went, how people were paid and compensated, what the reasons for that was. So, they have set the table for now something where it is not the corporation being charged, it is an individual Donald Trump if a grand jury elects to indict him. And that is a case where you are going to have some of the same witnesses talking about some of the same practices. And while there is an issue of the taxes here, there is also this argument that, A, they couldn't have done this a long time ago because the Office of the Legal Counsel says you can't indict a sitting president while in office, but, B, this money was paid to her to be quiet because he was running for president.",

Sometimes some kids feel guilty and sometimes some kids feel victimized and sometimes some kids feel badly about the sins of their fathers. That does happen. That's real. But I have never seen a classroom nor have I even seen an example of a teacher teaching a child to feel guilty. LZ GRANDERSON, OP-ED COLUMNIST, LOS ANGELES TIMES:  And I don't think an example has been shown, which is why this is so disappointing and what he said is so disingenuous. Because there is value in teaching the good and the bad. And it isn't to make people feel bad. It's so that we don't repeat mistakes so that we don't keep doing the same things over and over again. This reminds me of what happened to Kolin Kaepernick and how they rebranded his protest to make it the protest of the National Anthem as opposed to a protest to draw attention to promote justice.

I don't think that's a hateful position and I think it's a nuanced conversation that we should have and let this been dismissed out of hand. There are people who simply think there are certain materials that should not be introduced to a classroom to children at a certain age. I think the majority of people who hold that position do not come from a place of hate.
