Each one of them is an extremely serious federal charge. The evidence laid out in a newly unsealed indictment today against the three-time Grammy winner is disturbing.

This is just a sliver have what is in the skating 14-page indictment. CNN's Elizabeth Wagmeister brings us up to speed now on Combs' alleged crimes and an investigation that we're told is still ongoing. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ELIZABETH WAGMEISTER, CNN ENTERTAINMENT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Sean \"Diddy\" Combs arrested Monday night in New York and taken into custody, charged with racketeering conspiracy, sex trafficking, and transportation to engage in prostitution. The grand jury indictment charges the music mogul with running a criminal enterprise over decades. DAMIAN WILLIAMS, U.S. ATTORNEY FOR SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NY: Between at least 2008 and the present, Combs abused, threatened, and coerced victims to fulfill his sexual desires, protect his reputation, and conceal his conduct.",

(END VIDEOTAPE) WAGMEISTER (on camera): Now, Jake, literally right now, as we are speaking, Combs's attorney is fighting for his freedom in a courtroom. He could be in prison just moments from now, prosecutors say, that not only is he a flight risk, but that he is a danger to society. They say that he has been in touch with witnesses in recent days. Now, Combs's side, they say that he's not a flight risk. He's not a danger to society, that he has been cooperating.

And they said that this entered surprise consisted of him as the alleged leader. His employees, assistants, staff allegedly that were able to procure women and alleged male sex workers to engage in performances for his own sexual gratification.Where it differs from a mob indictment, it has all the elements of putting together this racketeering allegation of all these moving pieces using resources from his businesses. But the fact that this is about an allegation of sexual gratification being accomplished by alleged human trafficking, it's one of the most unique indictments I've ever seen in this area and the area of sex crimes because they're not -- the government isn't actually prosecuting the sex crimes other than the human trafficking or the sex trafficking. They're not prosecuting any type of alleged sexual abuse to woman -- women, although that's part of this racketeering scheme. But the actual charges are racketeering conspiracy, sex trafficking, and transporting individuals over state lines to engage in prostitution. The reasoning around all of this, his alleged motivation as presented in that indictment by the government is for his own personal gratification. And that's just the strangest type of indictment I've ever seen. But I agree with you, this indictment reads -- it's very disturbing. The facts presented are out of a very bad Hollywood story and a lot of the evidence alleged evidence that's been gathered in this case was from those two raids that were conducted on his personal homes in Miami and Los Angeles, and the indictment names the things seized that he allegedly made videos of these sexual performances that have been named freak offs. And there's seems to be a ton of evidence allegedly tying this scheme together. So it's an interesting way of prosecuting it. But I understand why they did it that way.",

Appreciate it.Next to the deadly attacks across Lebanon, pager devices in the hands of members of the Iranian-backed group Hezbollah detonated at the same time. The blame for this attack is ahead. Plus, the new state-level investigation launched to the apparent assassination attempt of former President Trump. But why a state probe when a federal probe is already underway? We'll explain. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) [16:16:21] TAPPER: Topping our world lead today is a story we need to tell you right now upfront. It contains a lot of graphic and disturbing images. Lebanese officials say that thousands of members of the Iran-backed Lebanese group, Hezbollah, which the U.S. and many other countries designate a terrorist group, that they have been injured and at least nine people killed when their pagers exploded today. Here's CNN's Nick Paton Walsh. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) NICK PATON WALSH, CNN CHIEF INTERNATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): At the fruit display, at the checkout, in the streets, hard to overstate the psychological impact of hundreds of blast across Lebanon, mostly in Hezbollah areas, pagers exploding at about 3:30 according to the group. Security forces asking Lebanese to stay off the road so the sheer volume of emergency vehicles could get to hospital. Nearly 3,000 patients, at least 170 critical. Easily, the most widespread moment of violence did across Lebanon since the 2006 war with Israel, who Hezbollah is now firmly blaming for these new attacks on their TV channels. We blame the Israeli enemy with full responsibility, the TV anchor said, to this criminal attack but also harm civilians. Israel themselves declined to claim the attack. To blame perhaps these tiny devices, according to posts on social media, CNN can't verify, the race now, to work out how was it just one type of device, a cyber attack, the battery bomb that they just hit Hezbollah areas. It comes at yet another critical time. Monday, Israel's defense minister hinted meeting the U.S. envoy that the time for a diplomatic solution of how to get tens of thousands of Israelis home to the war- plagued north had mostly passed, that a military option is all that remains. The hope had been for calm after the death of Hezbollah commander Fuad Shukr, also killed in a violation of Hezbollah stronghold in southern Beirut led to great fury but minimal fire. With Hezbollah's retaliation restrained, perhaps by preemptive Israeli strikes, many felt the moment of conflagration had passed. Now, it seems back again with Hezbollah once more under pressure to hit back hard, but only because another sophisticated attack has made them look weak. (END VIDEOTAPE) WALSH (on camera): Now, Lebanese security source saying that these devices were purchased by Hezbollah in recent months. So this suggests very extensive, lengthy operation here, and I should point out, it does appear to have hurt some civilians as well. But the question is, why? Why now? Is this a prelude to something larger? Whoever was behind this, have they sought to create utter chaos in Hezbollah's ranks? Remember, they're going to be members of that militant group unsure who's unharmed unsure, who they can ring safely now, to even think about some kind of retaliation. Is this a prelude to something larger or is the strength of that disruption now, violation of their most secure communications is that the message whoever was behind this wanted to send. And that's simply enough, Jake. We have to see in the days ahead.",

The level of vitriol is red hot and leaders cannot agree -- cannot come together on the road ahead. Joining us now, Democratic Congressman Jim Himes of Connecticut. He's the ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee. I want to start with something that I just saw on Twitter, Congressman. So, David Frum, who is a Republican Never Trumper. He's very critical of Donald Trump and he writes for \"The Atlantic\", said that the difference, I'm reading here, the upsetting things said by Trump and Vance are not true, meaning I presumably the stuff about the Haitian immigrants and such, the upsetting things said about Trump and Vance are true. To this J.D. Vance -- and here's the tweet up on the screen -- to this J.D. Vance says, I'd say the most important difference is that people on your team tried to kill Donald Trump twice. And I'm kind of shocked to be honest. First of all, David Frum is not a Democrat. He's obviously a Trump opponent. But to suggest that the David Frum, that these two would-be assassins are on David Frum's team, what's your response? REP. JIM HIMES (D-CT): Yeah, it's so dangerous, Jake, and it would -- if it weren't so dangerous, it would be funny. There are no teams here. Nobody supports violence. And so to say that two apparently crazy disturbed individuals who took a shot, maybe we'll find out on the second one what was going on, at Donald Trump, is somehow on the Democratic team, what that does is, you know, 350 million people in this country, people here that somebody is going to say, doggone it. We've got to go after the other team, and it's going to perpetuate the violence. The other two things, you just talked to Lee Zeldin, who I will tell you having served with him is one of the more reasonable members of the Republican Party, but he did to profoundly dangerous things. Number one, it was this sort of, oh, it's all the same stuff, you know. Oh, look at Portland and somebody through brick through the Chase Bank in Portland, that's just like January 6. It's nothing like January 6. And it's really important to Republicans right now to make it seem like its all the same thing when there is a radical difference between the language used by Donald Trump, which as David Frum said, is both inflammatory and often inaccurate, and people saying that they believe that Trump is a threat to democracy. Why? Because Donald Trump said, ill be a dictator on the first day. When you say that you're going to be a dictator on the first day, you are a threat to democracy and I'm sorry if that sounds bad, but it has nothing to do with violence. And the second thing, I just want to make this point, Jake, you know, the whole Lee Zeldin presentation and I'm hearing it all day today. It's all about what-about-ism. Well, they do it on the other decide, too. We don't, Jake, accept that from our three-year-old children as a moral defense. And yet that is the defense. Look, here's Jamie Raskin at some book party. By the way, Lee Zeldin completely butchered the quote, saying that the president should be killed. Absolutely inaccurate. And by the way, when did what-about-ism, they do it, to become a defense?",

He -- the FBI says he absolutely wanted to assassinate Donald Trump and thank God he failed.This is what we know about him. He'd given money to Democrats. He had a Harris-Biden bumper sticker on his car. He thought Trump, according to his social media profile, he thought Trump was a threat to democracy. He felt strongly about supporting Ukraine. Maybe he was worried that Trump wasn't going to do that. I'm not saying that this is the responsibility of the Democratic Party, but he does seem motivated by capital D Democratic issues. And how does the Democratic Party deal with it? I'm not saying that, you know, that opposing Donald Trump on the issues of democracy or Ukraine, or even just the election is enough to justify an assassination attempt. Obviously, that's crazy. But -- what do you make of that?",

I sometimes think about this because I remember, you know, even going back to George W. Bush when our politics were a lot less heated, the Iraq war, of course, created a lot energy and the political system. And I remember the language that Democrats used again George W. Bush, let's take back our country. He's destroying our country.In retrospect, I understand why politicians use that language. Aggressive language gets people pumped up, you get a big round of applause. In retrospect and going forward, let's set that aside. Let's set that aside for boring language of I believe this policy is wrong. I believe this about policy is not in the best interests of the United States. But again, having fully rejected, I will continue to reject the what- about-ism defense. Lee Zeldin saying that the Democratic Party needs to do a little bit of self-reflection. Everyone does. I will acknowledge that. Him pointing of the Democratic Party and saying that's a problem, you know, I don't remember a whole hell of a lot of self reflection on the part of my colleagues on the Republican Party in the Congress when, you know, Donald Trump for four years and the presidency was using language that was explicitly violent. So we should all self-reflect. No question. We should all use more boring language. Jake, you know, this, you've been around here for a long time. Our policy differences compared to a lot of countries, they're between the 55 and the 45-yard line. Should the corporate tax rate be 28 or 21 percent? This is not the kind of dispute that we should be using violent rhetoric to characterize the other side on.",
