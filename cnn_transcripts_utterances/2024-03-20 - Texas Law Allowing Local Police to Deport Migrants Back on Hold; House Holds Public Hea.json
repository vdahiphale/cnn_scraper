      "sentences": "Right, and good luck to everyone trying to keep up with the quick changing developments in the story. But the oral arguments for -- have just ended in that appellate court and this is -- we are expecting perhaps at some point another decision on whether or not -- at least temporarily whether or not this Texas law would be allowed to go into effect while the legal case against it continues in the court system as well. So, we'll kind of spare you all of those details, but just know that right now, this law is not in effect, but it could change at any moment.And what law enforcement agencies across the state, Dana, are really grappling with right now as they closely watched these, the legal whiplash going on here, is trying to figure out exactly how they would implement this law and what kind of guidance they would give officers, sheriffs, deputies across the state to handle all of this. And we've spoken with a number of different organizations across the state and the prevailing theme we are hearing from them is that there doesn't seem to be a real appetite for officers, sheriffs, deputies to go out and just start asking people for immigration documentation and arresting solely on that. Many of the officers and the police chiefs and sheriffs that we've spoken with say, if in the course of investigating other crimes like burglary or assault or anything like that, if this immigration issue comes up, then that law will be enforced at that time. But many of these officers say, look, there just simply isn't the manpower, there isn't the jail space and on top of all of that, enforcing immigration documentation issues is they believe the sole purpose of the federal law enforcement agents on the ground here in Texas. So, many people here watching all of this closely as they are going to pay attention to what's happening in the courts and of course, all of this also happening at a time where we've really seen a dramatic de- escalation of the number of migrants crossing the U.S. southern border into the U.S. from Texas to California, almost a 50 percent drop since from December to January. And those numbers are appear to continue dropping here in the month of February, although we don't have those official numbers just yet, Dana.",

So, they still don't even have the evidence to back it up, even at today's hearing, which we should point out is only the second public hearing they've had on impeachment.So, the expectation right now is that they are not going to pursue impeachment articles. But as Manu was getting at, Republicans are in a dilemma right now, because if they end their impeachment inquiry without impeachment, they don't want to look like they're absolving President Biden of wrongdoing. And so, they're trying to find an off ramp, whether that's criminal referrals, a final report, some sort of legislation, or just dragging it out for the rest of the year.",

It is an attempt to really bully and shame American Jews into voting for him, and he's trying to stir fear and paranoia among American Jews. It's not going to work. American Jews historically vote very solidly Democratic and also really dislike intensely the former president. That's not going to change now. In fact, most American Jews don't share Trump or Bibi's vision for Israel, and certainly don't share Trump's vision for America.So, the greater concern right now is not that he's going to be successful in convincing American Jews not to vote Democratic. The greater concern that I have right now is that anti-Semitism is not only dangerous for Jews, but it's truly dangerous for democracy. And the reason why is because anti-Semitism really is a form of racism that functions differently from other racisms that we know well here in America. It's rooted in conspiracy theories about Jewish domination and about Jewish power. It has always been an excuse for why something other than the people who are in power are responsible for suffering in the world. And so, throughout history, anti-Semitism has been used as a kind of way wedge to break apart pro-democracy coalitions. I think that's what he is trying to do right now, to stir up anti-Semitism, especially in a moment of political instability to really break apart that civil rights coalition that has been so strong in this country for so many years.",

And at some point realized after 2017, that there had been a tipping point in the country that we needed to address the centrality of anti-Semitism, particularly the way it was manifesting in the right and the danger of state supported violence against Jews.Over the course of time, it has become clear to me that this is not a left versus right issue. Where is it more dangerous? But what we are seeing right now is that anti-Semitism is increasingly ubiquitous, that it's really appearing in both the right and the left. And I think this is a moment in which we have to stand together and say, we who care about democracy, we who care about building a just future will not allow anti-Semitism to be used as a wedge to break apart the democracy camp. It will only deliver a win to Trump and his authoritarian vision.",
