According to Hamas, he was killed hours ago in Tehran when the room where he was staying was hit by a rocket. Now, he had been attending events marking the inauguration of Iran's new President, and his death sparking fears of a growing regional conflict between Israel and its neighbors. Well, Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard is out with a warning for Israel over the killing, saying quote \"Undoubtedly, this crime of the Zionist regime will face a harsh and painful response from the powerful and great front of the Resistance, especially Islamic Iran.\"Well, Haniyeh's death comes hours after Israel confirmed it had carried out a strike in Beirut, in Lebanon, killing the most senior military commander of Hezbollah. Well, it's another Iran-backed militant group. This breaking news comes just hours after that claim of the assassination of Hezbollah's most senior military commander. According to Israeli Defense Forces, Fouad Shukr is -- was killed in a drone strike in the southern suburbs of Beirut. An IDF spokesman says the strike was in retaliation for last Saturday's rocket attack in the Israel-occupied Golan Heights. Israel blames Hezbollah for that incident, which killed 12 children. Hezbollah denies the claim. All right. CNN has reporters across the region covering the very latest on this breaking news. I want to start in Beirut with Ivan Watson. Israel confirming that it was behind that targeted attack on the Hezbollah senior leader, not commenting on whether it has anything to do with the assassination of the Hamas political leader in Tehran overnight. What's the perspective where you are, Ivan?",

I mean, the Foreign Minister of Iran very directly calling out the United States as being behind the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh because of its support for Israel. Israel, let's be quite clear, not either confirming or denying whether it was involved in this assassination, but many around the region and elsewhere believe Israel to have been behind Ismail Haniyeh's death. Where does this leave, Nic, the Blinken administration, its calls for de-escalation around the region, and its current strategy, not just on the Gaza conflict, on the ceasefire and hostage talks, the kind of wider Middle East strategy at this point?",

So, for Prime Minister Netanyahu, if Israel was responsible, as all indications are, absolutely he knew what he was doing by sanctioning the targeting of Haniyeh, taking out the more moderate, and these are relative terms, but the more moderate head of Hamas, not only nixing any chance of hostage negotiations, but removing the potential in the future for having a more moderate partner to deal with.Now, it's become very clear to many of the United States partners in the region that Israel, it appears, is taking a maximalist position and has been trying to sort of escalate tensions in the region and escalate towards potential all-out escalation. Now, the concern is, this has taken a significant step closer, despite what Secretary of State Antony Blinken says, that just is going to have a hard time being taken at face value in Tehran, and certainly among the Hezbollah leadership as well, and the Hamas leadership, of course, and why, in part, because just a few days ago, just last week, Prime Minister Netanyahu was in D.C., speaking in front of Congress, standing ovations for him. That went down very well. It was a success. There were, of course, many questions about what he didn't say. But, the perception in the Middle East is that he returns from Washington strengthened. And apparently, by acting in this way, these two significant assassinations, it creates the impression that he has it in premature, if you will, of the United States that he has to use a term, a carte rouge to do what he wants. That may not be the case, but that's the perception. And that's why the situation is so dangerous. That's why the tensions are so high. And that's why the United States is going to struggle because of the erosion of its standing, going to struggle to get it calls for calm and diplomacy heard and acted upon.",

I think that you'll see the balanced rhetoric, more pressure on the Gaza humanitarian situation.But, look, we just are moving today, ordered a big amphibious group, our naval assets closer to Lebanon. We're getting ready for escalation. Secretary Austin, Secretary Blinken, we will stand by Israel. That is going to be the policy. But, I think this does set up a long-term issue.

And so, if they had not been there, it would have killed Israelis.So, I think that, like this is very serious business. But, at the same time, Becky, I will say that the chance of escalation here, there are a few things that are kind of pushing that down, including the CNN report about the UN statement from the Iranians in New York saying that they will respond with special operations.

They are accusing Israel of doing the heinous, and the Israelis, of course, have not yet confirmed that. They have in the past carried out, obviously, strikes and assassinations inside Iran without claiming credit for these attacks. This has really put the region right now in very dangerous positions. You know very well, Becky. There is a lot of concern coming in. You're hearing this from the different governments but you are also hearing it from people. There is a real fear of what might come next.And we're not just talking about the assassination of Haniyeh here. We're looking at the events of the past 24 hours, the strike in southern Beirut suburbs, top Hezbollah commander killed, the assassination of Haniyeh, and you have the Lebanese caretaker Foreign Minister telling you a short time ago. You also had a U.S. strike south of Baghdad on one of the Iranian proxies there, Kataib Hezbollah. And there is a lot of concern about these various groups, the Iranians, of these different groups, coordinating some sort of a response because they are going to have to respond to this. This has certainly moved the region into even more dangerous territory right now. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) KARADSHEH (voice-over): These some of the last images of Ismail Haniyeh before he was assassinated in the Iranian capital. He appeared defiant here at the country's parliament, among those invited to attend the new president's inauguration, just hours before what appears to be Israel delivering on its promise to target Hamas leaders wherever they may be. The news of his assassination broke on Iranian state TV in the early hours Wednesday. Iran says he was assassinated at around 02:00 a.m. local time by a quote \"airborne guided projectile\" that hit a residence for veterans in northern Tehran where he was staying. Israel that's carried out assassinations and attacks inside Iran in the past has not claimed responsibility. Unlike Hamas' military leadership that has gone underground since October 7, the political leader of the group has been its public face, living in Doha, traveling relatively freely and central to ceasefire and hostage negotiations. His killing, at least for now, dampens hopes for a deal anytime soon. Qatar, that's facilitated these negotiations, condemned the killing. Its Prime Minister posting on X, quote \"How can mediation succeed when one party assassinates the negotiator on the other side?\" The timing, the target, and this happening in Tehran has pushed a region that has been teetering on the edge, even closer to all-out war. Haniyeh's assassination comes less than 24 hours after Israel says it killed top Hezbollah commander, Fouad Shukr, in a strike on Beirut's southern suburbs.",

And if they did provide any information to the United States, it would have been just before the strike.

And I think what the Israelis want to do, at least the Israeli political leadership, as it's currently constituted, what they want to do is they want to continue these conflicts up to a certain point. That does not necessarily mean that, what a huge conflagration, but what it does mean is that it basically keeps the political situation in kind of a limbo state, which is advantageous to Prime Minister Netanyahu.From a military standpoint, the United States is absolutely going to defend Israel, like it did a few months ago when Iran locked its missiles and rockets and UAVs against Israel, and of course, with the help of the US and other allies, including Arab nations. The Iranian attack was thwarted. That kind of support is definitely going to be there. Now, it sounds as if the Iranians are going to possibly mount a different kind of attack if they do seek revenge, and I think they will seek revenge at some point in time. But, that really remains to be seen how the U.S. can support Israel in those situations, but suffice to just say, the United States will definitely support Israel's right to exist, but they also want to see peace in Gaza and in the rest of the Middle East.",

Hamas, of course, has backing from Iran. Well, Haniyeh was 62. He was a well-known figure in the Hamas hierarchy. He was born in a Gaza refugee camp. He joined Hamas in the late 1980s, during the First Intifada and rose through the ranks of the organization, becoming its political chief in 2017. Soon after that, he was named a specially designated global terrorist by the U.S.Well, let's go live to Israel and to CNN's Jeremy Diamond in Haifa. Look, I think it's really important to point out that Iran has, to a degree, co-opted the Gaza conflict and the Palestinian issue to its gain, as it were, in its -- as it keeps Israel squarely in its own crosshairs. At the beginning of the conflict, we did talk about whether there had been some consternation by Tehran about whether Hamas had actually overstepped the mark on October 7th.

I don't always take too seriously everything that Donald Trump says on foreign policy. But, what we're witnessing here is a continuation of the proxy war, where Israel has been striking at radical leaders and Hezbollah and Hamas outside of Israel and in other countries in Lebanon, and in this case, Iran. This has been going on for some time, just as Iran has been using its proxies to attack Israel, and Hezbollah, and of course, Hamas. So, this is where we are. This is not a new phenomena, but obviously, this could escalate. But, it seems to me that Kamala Harris is trying to accommodate both Israel and Hamas in her remarks.

And there was a very strong bipartisan bill led by Senator Lankford, who Charlie and I served within the House, a good man, a good Christian, and a rock solid Republican, put the bill together and got Democrat and Republican support and then President Trump literally called Mitch McConnell and others and told them not to support that bill.And I think when the campaign is about the future versus the past, the toxic politics that we've been dealing with relations to the Vietnam era with Trump, it's that kind of politics that people will wholly reject.
