They said they've seen increasing movement of vehicles in Pyongyang and also around the missile production facilities. They say if it doesn't happen just after this summit or in this time, it could happen next week. That's when there's going to be a joint military drill between the U.S. and South Korea.

Right now, it's our understanding that Trump is likely to do his surrender toward the back half of the week. Here's what's going to happen when he goes to surrender. He is going to surrender to the Fulton County sheriff's office. And this process typically involves a mug shot and fingerprints. The mug shot is important, because, at the federal level, they did not take a mug shot of the former president because they said we use those. They don't release them but they use them for law enforcement if someone goes on the lam. Trump is one of the most recognizable people on the world. They don't really need a mug shot for that. And it's unclear if Fulton County is also going to make that kind of exception. Another big difference between the state and federal appearances here is that he's going to be processed next week. Then, a judge will schedule a court hearing. At the federal level, all of this happened on the same day. So the judge will have to schedule a hearing and the district attorney has asked for the initial appearances of all of these defendants to happen the week of September 5th. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

The state's Department of National Resources says at least 3,000 acres or 1,200 hectares have burned. At last report, two state-run medical facilities in the city are sheltering in place. The entire city was already under an evacuation order and the department says it's expanding the order to include the nearby town of Four Lakes. Firefighters and people who live on the Spanish island of Tenerife are working to keep wildfires from spreading any further. This is what they're up against. At this point the fire has slowed, thanks to efforts from fire crews and improved weather. Authorities even lifted some restrictions for residents on Friday. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) HARRAK (voice-over): They load their truck with whatever belongings will fit. This family in the Spanish canary island of Tenerife rushing to save their property and themselves as a raging wildfire moves closer to their home. Residents move quickly to cut down any vegetation that may fuel the flames. Thousands of people have evacuated from the area since Wednesday. The blaze has burned some 4,000 hectares so far, mostly on the northern part of the island. CELESTINO SUAREZ, TENERIFE RESIDENT (through translator): The ash has reached the town center. People here are really concerned. We are watching the big mountain and the blaze. We saw this firewall and we will see if they can control it. The situation seems pretty bad. HARRAK (voice-over): Firefighters scrambled Friday to contain the fires by dropping water over the area. The mountainous terrain has made it difficult for them to put the flames out from the ground. Officials said Thursday it deployed more than 370 personnel and 17 aircraft to help in the effort. Firefighters tried desperately to keep the fires from spreading to the village of Esperanza. Nearly 4,000 residents were ordered to shelter in place earlier this week, according to authorities. One woman says it's extremely stressful, having the fire come so close to her home. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (through translator): You see fires in other places. But, when you live it yourself, it's harder.
