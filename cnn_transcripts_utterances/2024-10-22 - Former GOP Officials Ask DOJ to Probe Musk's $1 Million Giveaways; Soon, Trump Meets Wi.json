Now, former Republican officials are weighing in.Good morning. You are live in the CNN Newsroom. I'm Jim Acosta in Washington. All right, let's get right to it with Republican Congressman Byron Donalds of Florida. He is a Trump surrogate. Congressman, thanks so much for being with us. We appreciate it. Let me ask you first about what Elon Musk is up to. Former Republican officials are calling on the attorney general, Merrick Garland, to investigate Musk's $1 million a day giveaway to swing state voters if they sign up with his political organization's petition. Obviously, Elon Musk is a very vocal Trump supporter. Do you think this is legal? REP. BYRON DONALDS (R-FL):  Frankly, I don't know. I think that's something that Elon and his legal team are going to get into. But let's be very clear, what Elon Musk is doing is not associated with the Trump campaign. It's its own political entity that's operating. We have a lot of political entities that actually operate all around the country. At least you know that Elon Musk is the person doing this with his resources. There are many billionaires on the Democratic left who funneled their money into a bunch of blind super PACs, we call it dark money, where the Democrats basically are spending two to one against Republicans all across the country, if not three to one, depending on some of these battleground states. So, there's a lot of dark money. At least Elon Musk is out in the open about what he's doing. A lot of these Democrat billionaires don't want anybody to know who they are, how much money they actually spend.",

Nobody really cared that Zuckerberg put in $400 million of his own money in 2020 behind Joe Biden. Nobody cared about that then, but they care about it now. But that's not what matters. What really matters, Jim, are the issues facing the American people. Who has a plan to fix our border? Who has a plan to actually have a strong economy where people can get ahead?

And there are American citizens who are in mixed status families whose parents are telling them maybe you shouldn't vote because then our names will be on the record, your name will be on a record, and then maybe I'll get deported if Donald Trump ends up becoming president.
