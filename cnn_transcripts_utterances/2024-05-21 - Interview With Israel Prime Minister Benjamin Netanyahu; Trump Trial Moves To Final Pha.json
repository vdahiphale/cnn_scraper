Right now in court, there's a meeting to determine what the judge will tell the jury next week before the jury begins deliberating what will no doubt be a monumental verdict, one way or the other in the very first ever criminal trial of a former president. Trump himself is at this court meeting. And we'll bring you all the updates coming up. But leading this hour, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu joins us live from Jerusalem a day after the historic decision by the International Criminal Court in The Hague to seek arrest warrants not only for the three top leaders of the terrorist group Hamas, but for Prime Minister Netanyahu and his defense minister, Yoav Gallant, over what the top ICC prosecutor calls war crimes in Gaza. According to the ICC, the charges against Netanyahu include -- quote -- \"causing extermination, causing starvation as a method of warfare, including the denial of humanitarian relief and supplies, and deliberately targeting civilians in conflict.\" And Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu joins us right now. Prime Minister Netanyahu, thank you so much for joining us. A central part of the ICC's charges against you and Gallant is -- quote -- \"starvation of civilians as a method of warfare.\" Now, I know that Israel repeatedly claims that enough aid is getting in and there is not a purposeful starvation, that those claiming otherwise are misinformed, are lying. Is Israel going to send a delegation to The Hague to present any evidence to defend itself?",

That's like saying that, well, I'm issuing the arrest warrants for FDR and Churchill, but also for Hitler, or I'm issuing arrest warrants for George Bush, George W. Bush, but also for bin Laden. That's absurd. Secondly, the charges are completely false. Let's take this charge of starvation. We have put in 500,000 tons of trucks, of food and medicine for this population. We have taken 20,000 trucks. We have paved roads to put those trucks in. We have opened border crossings that Hamas closed down. I have had airdrops that have facilitated, sea route supplies. I mean, the whole thing is absurd. You should know this. I mean, the prices of food in Gaza has dropped by 80 percent. The markets don't lie. They talk about 23, I think, or 30 cases of malnutrition in a population of two million. OK, the United States in 2022 had 20,000 deaths of malnutrition. That's three times more than in Gaza.

But many have left the -- thankfully, I can say that. Now, the ratio -- because of our actions, the ratio of civilians to combatants killed is the lowest in the history of urban warfare, and certainly dense urban warfare like this. It's about one to one. There are about 14,000 casualties -- or 14,000 to 15,000 terrorists killed and an equal amount of civilians that were unfortunately killed, because that's what happens. But, in other arenas, in Fallujah, with a handful of terrorists, 3,000, 4,000, compared to 35,000 in Gaza, the ratio was much bigger than that. The same thing in Mosul. So we have gone out of our way to stop it. And let me tell you, I think that the numbers are also inflated. The U.N. -- the U.N. organizations that are dominated by Hamas in Gaza is giving false information, as is Hamas itself. And people believe these numbers.

They say, well, we can release the rest of the hostages, maybe, but, in order to do that, you have to get out of Gaza, end the war, and allow us basically to regroup and reconquer Gaza. And they vow to commit the October 7 massacre, this horror of beheadings and raping of women, beheading women after they rape them, the burning of babies, the slaughter of the innocent, the taking of hostages, we will do that again and again and again. So that's something I won't agree to. And I hope Egypt understands that we can't agree to something like that. That's not something that we can countenance. And neither can the people of Israel.
