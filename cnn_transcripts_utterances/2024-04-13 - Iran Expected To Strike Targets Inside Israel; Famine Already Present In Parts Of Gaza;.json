And whether it comes from Iran directly or from Iran's proxies.One thing the U.S. has seen, according to two U.S. officials familiar with the intelligence, Iran moving around weapons and assets internally. And that's to include cruise missiles and drones, according to two sources familiar with the intelligence. According to one of those sources, Iran has readied at least 100 cruise missiles. Now the question, of course, is, what's the purpose of this? Is this part of Iran's response to that attack in Damascus? Or are they simply posturing and trying to send a message to Israel and the U.S.? That is a key question here, because Iran's actions and the actions of their proxies could be on quite a wide spectrum. The U.S. believes that Iran is trying to avoid a wider escalation in the region and trying to calibrate their response, to send a message without igniting a wider conflict here. As for the U.S., they have sent additional assets to the region, likely air defenses, because that's the threat here coming from the air, whether it's cruise missiles, rockets or drones. So that's what the U.S. is looking out for and bolstering its own force posture. Worth noting that the U.S. has been on high alert since basically the beginning of the Gaza war and especially since an attack in Jordan that killed three U.S. service members. The U.S. very much preparing here as well. Officials have also said that the U.S. will intercept any launches or attacks that it can directed at Israel. And we've seen that happen in the past. The U.S. Navy has intercepted missiles launched from the Houthis in Yemen toward Israel, those over the Red Sea. There are also U.S. forces in Iraq and Syria that could intercept launches from Iran, depending on where they're launched from and what route they take. Still a very big open question as to what this will look like. Of course, the U.S. and Israel watching very closely. General Erik Kurilla, the commander of U.S. Central Command, is in Israel right now, coordinating with his Israeli counterparts on a situational assessment and a look at the security situation in the region -- Oren Liebermann, CNN, in the Pentagon.

And Israel has, in turn, vowed also to respond to an Iranian attack. And the U.S. has very publicly committed to standing by Israel and to defending Israel's security interests. So all of the pieces are in place for this to go completely haywire. So Iran has made a very public commitment. It has a number of options at its disposal. It could seek to launch attacks directly from Iranian territory, using precision missile strikes, cruise missiles, ballistic missiles; also, drones, of which it has many. It has quite a sophisticated and diverse arsenal. It could choose to activate its militias in Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Yemen and elsewhere. It could go after softer Israeli targets, like diplomatic missions and besieging (ph) third countries and, of course, use cyber attacks and so on. So it has a number of options at its disposal and it will, I think, choose a combination of options that allow it to save face and retaliate and do good on its commitment without risking an all-out confrontation and war with Israel.",

A lower risk scenario for Iran would be to use its partner militias in third countries. So Iran has developed these partnerships with Hamas, with Hezbollah, with the Houthis or Ansar Allah in Yemen and a number of other militias in Iraq. It has advisors and troops that are forward deployed with these militias.

So I think that's consistent with Iran's conduct since the beginning of the war for sure. But of course, the risk for accidents, miscalculations. Iran could be too successful in a way that may not be totally intentional.

She said, the government simply should not have a say in determining what people should be able to do with their bodies. And she also said that the Arizona supreme court ruling was one of the biggest aftershocks after Roe was overturned. And then she asked the question of, who is to blame for this? And she said the answer to that was Donald Trump. And in fact, just minutes before she took the stage in Arizona, Donald Trump was down in Florida. And he boasted about how he was responsible for the fact that now states are having to largely determine what kinds of abortion rights people have in their respective states. This is the vice president talking in Arizona. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KAMALA HARRIS (D), VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Now in states across our country, extremists have proposed and passed laws that criminalize doctors and punish women. Laws that threaten doctors and nurses with prison time, even for life, simply for providing reproductive care. And then just this week, here in Arizona, they have turned back the clock to the 1800s to take away a woman's most fundamental right, the right to make decisions about her own body.

Wade was overturned, talking about women's health being at risk.Also talking about doctors and medical professionals fearing for just their jobs and their livelihoods as they are trying to do the work that they're supposed to do and provide the service that they are supposed to provide. And then just painting a picture, too, of the general uncertainty and chaos as different states are putting in place different regulations and different laws, again, in the aftermath of Roe being overturned. The message overall from the Biden campaign has really been this is what the country will look like if Donald Trump comes back to the White House and if Republicans have a say in determining what kinds of reproductive rights people have across the country. And the vice president was very clear. She said this is only the beginning. And of course, the Biden campaign is trying to use this as a political messaging tool, because they feel that they were very much validated in 2022, in 2023 and all of the various ballot measures that have come up on this issue. And they are making a big bet that they are also going to be validated come November -- MJ Lee, CNN, at the White House. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Well, it happened, as I say, at Westfield's Bondi Junction shopping mall. Witnesses say police (sic) were running through the mall and falling over each other. One described the situation as pandemonium. Police say one person was shot and multiple people were stabbed. They have not said if the incident is related to terrorism. We are monitoring the situation and we will let you know as soon as we get more information. Baseball superstar Shohei Ohtani is hoping to move on from the gambling scandal involving his former translator. He says he wants to focus on playing for the Los Angeles Dodgers.

Also surrendered his passport; no travel, et cetera, et cetera. Now 37-page complaint against the interpreter. The final line are texts between a bookmaker and the interpreter. The bookmaker asks, \"Obviously, you didn't steal from him.\" The reply from the interpreter, \"Technically, I did steal from him. It's all over for me.\" There are still a few unanswered questions. For example, we read in that complaint that Ippei Mizuhara made $140 million sports betting over a couple of years. He lost $180 million, $40 million shortfall. We're told he stole $16 million from Shohei Ohtani. So there's a gap there in the finances. Another condition of his release, he is not allowed to contact Shohei Ohtani and he'll be back in court himself May 9th. Meantime Shohei Ohtani continues to do what he does best, playing very, very well at baseball.
