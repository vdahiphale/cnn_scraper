The new CNN exclusive reporting into the brutal hammer attack on Paul Pelosi. What we are now learning about what else the suspect brought with him as he shouted \"where's Nancy?\" And in South Korea, at least two U.S. citizens are among the 154 people killed in a massive crowd surge in Seoul. We are live on the ground in the capital city in South Korea as investigators now try to piece together what exactly led to this horrific tragedy. But first, rescue crews are searching for survivors after a pedestrian bridge collapsed into a river in western India. At least 60 people, including some children, were killed and more than a dozen others were injured. The bridge fell into the river in the town of Morbi. These frightening videos that you're seeing here from the scene show people desperately clinging to the fallen structure. It's not clear exactly what caused the collapse, although the bridge was reportedly recently renovated. A top Indian official says the focus right now is on the search for survivors. That official pledging the government will find out how and why the bridge collapsed. Over in South Korea, South Korea is a nation stunned by a horrific tragedy. 154 people killed in a massive crowd surge in Seoul. Among the dead, at least two U.S. citizens. More than 130 other people were injured. This happened during a Halloween festival at a popular night life district. The South Korean president has declared a period of national mourning as investigators now work to figure out exactly what led to the surge. Witnesses say it became hard to breathe and impossible to move and the sheer number of people then made it difficult for emergency workers to reach the people who were trapped and needed help. CNN's Will Ripley is following all of this. Will, this sounds like a situation that just snowballed into just an absolute calamity. What more are you learning?",

A source telling CNN the suspect had duct tape and zip ties on him when he allegedly broke into the Pelosi home early Friday morning. The suspect at one point tried to tie up Paul Pelosi authorities say before attacking him with a hammer. The suspect also said he was -- he told arriving officers there that he was, quote, \"waiting for Nancy.\" Late yesterday, the House speaker released her first statement since the attack and CNN's Sunlen Serfaty joins us now.

And today CNN did see briefly Speaker Pelosi leaving her house in San Francisco, briefly leaving her garage there, and then getting into an SUV. Now, this statement, this comes as there certainly is heightened anxiety on Capitol Hill, with many lawmakers worried about their safety, the safety of their families, and lawmakers, they received an update from the U.S. sergeant-at-arms yesterday as well as the chief of the Capitol Hill police basically, Jim, telling them what recommendations they have to protect themselves and what protocols are already in place.

He was a little bit distracting back then, so we're truly going to get a head-to-head matchup of them just speaking with one another. I'm curious to see if Abrams sharpens her attack against Kemp. She has been behind Kemp in many recent polls. Does she sharpen her attack on a host of issues? But mainly abortion. The abortion ban. The six-week abortion ban that Kemp signed into law is unpopular with most Georgians. Take a listen to how both Kemp and Abrams have been making their closing argument on the campaign trail.

And events like the one you just described in New York have done little to tamp down any speculation about his 2024 plans. But there's one person in particular who is paying close attention to what Governor DeSantis is doing, and that is former President Donald Trump.Now the potential rivalry that these two men are having is now already spilling into the public view just ahead of the midterms. We have Ron DeSantis wading into a governor's race in Colorado, where the Republican there has been at odds with Trump, and then Trump giving -- sharing with his supporters a clip of Megyn Kelly suggesting that if Trump and DeSantis go head to head, Republicans are going to stick with the former president. And now we have Trump planning a rally in southern Florida just days before the election. Marco Rubio was invited but Ron DeSantis was not. And sources say that that was intentional. And not only that, but DeSantis' people say that he didn't want to be there. He wasn't interested in going. He hasn't even asked for the president's endorsement. But the arrival in south Florida has definitely raised eyebrows here. And let me tell you why. Miami-Dade where Trump is going to be speaking, this is a county that Democrats have won for 20 years and Republicans are hoping that they can actually flip it this cycle. And some people think Trump is coming to Miami to sort of take credit preemptively for that turnaround. Now what has Trump so angry at DeSantis? Well, sources tell us that it's mainly that he is upset that DeSantis hasn't ruled out running against him in a primary. In fact, last week, in a debate, DeSantis was asked point blank if he intends to stick around for four years if re-elected? He wouldn't answer. Take a look at this exchange with Democrat Charlie Crist.

Tell us what you found.KYUNG LAH, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (via Webex): You know, I think you can go to almost any local community today and see that same sort of anger. Driven by misinformation and heated political rhetoric, to where action might be taken. What we did is we wanted to talk to local officials, really the frontline of democracy. The people who take your ballot at your election office, the county official, the school board. And that same sort of anger from January Sixth is now being directed at them. They have, sometimes, their kids' names. The school that they attend posted online. Their home addresses. And so, we talked to them. But we also talked to the people who are perpetrating this, and say that it is necessary in today's politics because there is so much noise. That if you want to win, this is the route that you have to take. And, Jim, you mentioned Arizona. We are seeing this certainly already play out in the midterms.

All right, thanks, again. In the meantime, a five-year-old Canadian boy is winning the hearts of hockey fans with his Halloween costume. Easton Oetting has an extremely rare genetic condition which makes him unable to walk for the past few years. His dad has built him a special Halloween costume for his wheelchair. This year, Easton got an Edmonton Oilers-themed Zamboni costume. That is just so terrific. There, look at that. The family went to a local ice rink to shoot a video of Easton in his Zamboni. That's gone viral. The Edmonton Oilers, to their credit, shared the video on Instagram. And the NHL posted it on their Twitter account, declaring Easton Zamboni the costume of the year. And it's further evidence that not everything on social media is terrible. That is just so heartwarming and adorable. Good for him. Love the Zamboni, as always. In the meantime, a lucky lottery winner could land the ultimate treat this Halloween. A massive $1 billion jackpot. Nobody matched all the numbers in Saturday's Powerball drawing, causing the prize money for Monday's drawing to soar. It's only the second time in the Powerball history that the prize has hit $1 billion. The cash payout would be just over $497 million. And, after taxes, enough to buy all of those discounted Halloween candy that your heart desires and maybe a few costumes, as well. You can have the Spirit -- the costume store of your choice. In the meantime, across the pond, there's new royal money. Coins with King Charles' face have been made for the first time by the Royal Mint. The new 50 pence coins are expected to go into circulation by Christmas, along with a commemorative five-pound coin to honor the late Queen Elizabeth. The coin will feature King Charles facing left, the opposite of Queen Elizabeth. That's in line with the 300-year-old tradition of changing sides with the new monarch. It's a custom that historians have no idea how or why it started. And a quite programming note. A new morning show is coming to CNN. It's the day after Halloween. It's starting Tuesday. Join Don, Poppy, and Kaitlan for \"CNN THIS MORNING,\" every weekday at 6:00 a.m. You not -- you don't want to miss that. And, next week, the 2022 Top 10 CNN Heroes will be named in honor of that.
