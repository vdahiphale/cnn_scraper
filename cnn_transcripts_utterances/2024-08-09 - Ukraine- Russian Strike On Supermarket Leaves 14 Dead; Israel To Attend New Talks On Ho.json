      "sentences": "Tit for tat Russia responds to massive strikes from Ukraine. ONE WORLD starts right now.A rescue operation is underway. Supermarkets, homes, and a car wash were the targets of Russia's latest air strike. We have the very latest for you. Also ahead, it is official, after a lot of back and forth, Donald Trump and Kamala Harris, will debate head-to-head. And then later, imagine making it to the Olympics. Now imagine doing it seven months pregnant. Meet the women competing for two. Well, live from London, I'm Isa Soares. My colleagues, Zain and Bianna are off today. And you, of course, watching ONE WORLD. And we'll begin this hour with Ukraine's shock incursion into Russia. The governor of Lipetsk Region in the western Russian, says the area has been hit by a massive Ukrainian drone attack. The reported strike comes after Moscow accused Ukrainian troops of crossing the border into its Kursk Region, remember, that was on Wednesday. Russian civilians have been fleeing Kursk, as Ukraine's cross-border assault into Russia shows no sign of easing. And Russia's response, well, it's been swift. This dramatic video telling the story, several people have been killed and wounded in a Russian strike on a supermarket in Ukraine's Donetsk Region. Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky says people are still trapped in that rubble. Let's get the very latest. I want to go straight to the Pentagon, CNN's Natasha Bertrand joins me with more. So, Natasha, clearly is we've just outlined the incursion into Russian territory by Ukraine continues, what more can you tell us about this and reaction, if any, at this stage from the United States? NATASHA BERTRAND, CNN U.S. NATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT: Well, we really haven't gotten a clear explanation from the Ukrainians about just what the goals are of this very significant incursion into the Kursk Region. But U.S. officials, they say, that it is not actually a violation of their support, of course, for the Ukrainians, and that it does not violate any kind of policies or your restrictions that the U.S. has placed on the U.S. provided and Western provided weaponry that they have given to the Ukrainians. As of right now, the reaction is, look, the Ukrainians have to do what they have to do to try to basically divert Russian resources and take the battle, essentially, to the Russians in a way that allows the Ukrainians to then take back their own territory. And so the reaction that we're getting now is a little bit of confusion about what exactly this is trying to achieve, but not necessarily anger from the U.S. in a way you might expect, particularly given, you know, all of the warnings from the U.S. over the last two-plus years about the possibility that this war could expand, that it could escalate, and that the Russians might see this kind of incursion into their territory as the potential -- you know, as the U.S. potentially being involved in this and kind of pushing the Ukrainians to do that. You know, since the policy changed by the Biden administration to allow Ukraine to kind of hit back at Russia right over the border with Ukraine and Russia, it seems to be like the U.S. now is acknowledging that in order to fight this war effectively, the Ukrainians have to take these battles and these fights into Russian territory itself. And so, well, we haven't yet gotten a full explanation from the Ukrainians about what they're trying to do here. A couple possibilities have emerged, of course, including that they are trying to kind of scatter Russian troops along the border, try to divert resources. And, you know, more importantly, perhaps, is the psychological effect, that this might have on residents inside Russia itself. And the idea that now Ukraine is basically putting everyone on notice that they are going to be fighting inside Russian territory, something that the residents of Kursk Region have made very clear to Russian President Vladimir Putin in recent days, they find pretty terrifying. And they are writing letters and they are saying, look, you might say that the situation here is under control, but it actually is not.",

Well, with fears of the wider war growing by the day, Israel says it will attend talks next Thursday aimed at ending the fighting Gaza and freeing the remaining Israeli hostages.

      "sentences": "Well, I think it's pretty telling, Isa, that this is not so much as a call or an invitation toattend the ceasefire negotiation talks on August 15th, next Thursday. It's really more of a demand. And it's coming not just from emissaries, but from the actual leaders of Egypt, of the United States, and of Qatar. I think it was really born out of a frantic diplomatic effort to try to avert some kind of a retaliation, principally from Iran, but also potentially from Hezbollah. Now, the question is, will it be successful? Who will attend? As you mentioned, Israel has said it is attending. Hamas has yet to respond after the assassination of Haniyeh. Yahya Sinwar, one of the architects of the October 7th attacks, who is underground in Gaza, has been announced as the head of the political bureau. Now, he has also announced an emissary Khalil al-Hayya to act and attend talks or participate in them. But as I said before, they haven't said defense -- definitively, whether or not they will be attending. And when I talk to analysts and officials across the region, their consensus is that there is still a lot of daylight between the two sides. And it is going to be very difficult to try to pull off any ceasefire agreement. We've seen these three countries, the U.S., Qatar, and Egypt, trying to head that off by saying, look, let's come up with a bridging agreement to try to temporarily at least resolve some of these issues where there is still a huge difference of opinion on the matter. But I would say more broadly, there is not a huge amount of optimism. Many see this as kind of a stalling technique to keep the diplomacy going, to keep the urgency going, and in the process, hopefully to avert more escalation in the region, Isa.",

Because of course, as we've said to our viewers, both a promise retaliation. And I've seen that Israel is looking to build a tent city in the south. What more can you tell us about this?",
