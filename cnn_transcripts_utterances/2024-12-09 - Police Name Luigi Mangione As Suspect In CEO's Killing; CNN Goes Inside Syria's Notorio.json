A 26-year-old now in custody saying in a handwritten note, according to a source, quote, these parasites had it coming, apologizing and saying it had to be done. The items found that tied this person to murder and how an employee at McDonald's 280 miles away from the crime scene in Altoona, PA, made the biggest break in the case yet. Plus, CNN in Syria, with the Assad regime toppled, agreeing to hand over power after 50 years of a cruel dictatorship. But who's going to take over now? We'll take you inside a prison where families are scrambling to find loved ones who may still be trapped inside. And not guilty. Daniel Penny acquitted on all charges in the New York subway chokehold case. The family of Jordan Neely called the justice system rigged. Welcome to THE LEAD. I'm Jake Tapper. We do have breaking news in our national lead, 26-year-old Luigi Mangione, the man police say matches the description of the suspect who killed UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson last Wednesday is now under arrest on gun-related charges. Earlier this morning, police say Mangione was eating at a McDonald's in Altoona, Pennsylvania, about a five hour drive from New York City when a McDonald's employee recognized the suspect and called police. In Mangione's possession, they say, police found a ghost gun that may have been 3D printed, a suppressor, numerous fake IDs, a mask matching the suspect, and a handwritten document railing against the health insurance industry, suggesting violence is the answer. Two quotes in the document read according to our sources, quote, these parasites had it coming, and quote, I do apologize for any strife and trauma, but it had to be done. All this information according to law enforcement officials and sources to CNN, and it comes on the day of a private memorial service for Brian Thompson according to a source familiar with those memorial plans. Let's go straight to CNN's Danny Freeman, who is live outside that McDonald's in Altoona, PA, where Mangione was taken into police custody.

Now there's a question, Jake, about why does this document exist? You know people say, well, maybe he wanted to be caught he had the gun. He had the document. There is another point of view, which is as we all know from having followed this detail by detail, he went to an extraordinarily length not to be caught, only lowering the mask once in a single moment maintaining this discipline to have this disguise, carrying this out, making his escape, he just doesn't appear to somebody who was looking to get caught. But he may have been prepared to get caught which is different. If he was caught with a gun which might ballistically matched to the killing and with this manifesto he wanted an explanation. Of course, the other possibility is, and this is the darkest that he was planning to strike again, maybe at some other executive or target, and that the manifesto was either going to be left or sent to police, or sent to the media.

The point, Jake, is you have to have validation to get over the bridge to say, I'm going to murder somebody. Validation to say my cause is worthy. Everyone will understand my cause. There are others who believe in my cause. I can justify my cause. One way you justify that cause to get over that emotional bar of saying I'm going to murder somebody is to write two pages to say there's reason for this. There's hundreds of millions of people in America who might understand my reason, whether or not that's logical to us, that's logical to him.

But once they gain access to him, to his home, to his apartment, to his family, to his laptop, they can do things like not only research how he downloaded maybe a ghost gun, but how he researched in terms of Google terms, accessing a weapon. I would guess over the next 48 hours we're going to get a ton of information, not only about the technical issues, how he gained access to the weapon, but also about the psychological issues, what he was thinking of.

Somebody who is on this kind of trajectory towards targeted violence, where they -- they get this idea, this ideation that they're going to commit a violent act and then they plan and prepare for it, very oftentimes, we'll see individuals who do that type of type of harm -- they are not the what we think of as the typical person who they're not the guy who thinks about killing people all the time. And that's the other reason why there was not really a concern by and by NYPD that he was going to strike again right away.

But what we do know is that Jolani is doing and saying the right things immediately upon entering Aleppo City, they tried to prevent looting and protect government buildings, as Ibrahim mentioned. They also went around to reassure not just minorities, Christians and others, but also those who were living in regime controlled areas in the western part of the city for the entirety of the conflict, that no harm would come to them. And most recently, we've seen another statement from HTS, basically saying that no members should interfere with a woman's attire essentially. So we can see that there is a protection of minorities and hopefully protection of livelihoods as well. Now, I do know that there is a search for certain kinds of regime officials in parts of the coast in Latakia and in Damascus and we hope that that comes to sort of a peaceful accountability effort. But there is still the potential for a lot of tensions. And it's also not clear if HTS will be able to really control the rising emotions amongst the population that has suffered brutally under this regime for not just 13 years, but really over half a century. TAPPER:  And, Ibrahim, back to the search for all those missing Syrians and others in -- in that horrific prison. You've noted that the prison design and the absence of blueprints make the search more difficult. What are you hearing -- is there any hope that more people will be found there and they'll be alive? AL-ASSIL:  You know, that's a very difficult question for many of the families and the mothers around those prisons trying to, at least to find a closure. I think the next step will be looking for the mass graves around those prisons. But you know, when I look at what's happening in those prisons, when I look at them trying to find detainees through the cracks in the walls, and they dig in the floors, trying to bring them up for me, that's Syrians looking in the eyes of Assad Syria, trying to find any survivors, trying to look into those dark dungeons and when I saw the rebels that many of them, they wanted to reach those prisons before they wanted to reach the presidential palace itself in Damascus. That tells a lot about the core of this uprising, of why people picked up arms and they said, no matter what happens to me, I would kill or get killed. But I'm not going back to those prisons again. This is at the core of the Syrian uprising, and these detention centers that were designed to rule the Syrian society through fear are very symbolic to how Assad Syria was.

Number two, that the force used by the defendant in this case wasproportionate to the threat that was posed. And number three, that he acted reasonably. And so, that was a problem. And I'm sure jurors said based upon the testimony of witnesses and the fear that they expressed, that he acted in an appropriate, justified and reasonable way. The second issue, remember, there was a battle of the experts. There was a discussion with respect to what caused his death. That is Jordan Neely's death. Was it the fact that there was a chokehold? There was inconsistent testimony with regard to whether pressure was applied sufficiently to make it happen, or did he just have him in a lock to maintain a grasp? There was also the issue although the medical examiner for the state, the city, indicated that it was the choke you had the defense that said, no, it was not. It was his schizophrenia. It was a synthetic marijuana in his system. It was the nature of the event itself. And so those are the two issues. I think that the jury grappled with and ultimately decided there was not proof beyond a reasonable doubt to get to the first hung jury. As Gloria noted right on telling the judge twice what do we do, your honor? Not reaching a conclusion then finally, with respect to this criminally negligent charge, saying, you know what just not there in terms of the evidence, we're going to acquit.",

And Hegseth, as we know, has been accused of sexual assault, something that he has denied. But after they have met, she indicated that she would support him through the process.
