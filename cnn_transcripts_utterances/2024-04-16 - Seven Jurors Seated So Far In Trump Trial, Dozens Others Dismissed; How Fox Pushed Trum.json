But first tonight, Donald Trump is complaining. But does he really mean what he says? Here is what he told reporters as he strode out of that Manhattan courtroom today. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP (R), FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT, 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I should be right now in Pennsylvania, in Florida, in many other states, North Carolina, Georgia, campaigning. This is all coming from the Biden White House because the guy can't put two sentences together. He can't campaign. They're using this in order to try and win an election, and it's not working that way. It's working the opposite way. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Now, when Trump had the chance to campaign during the E. Jean Carroll trial, he also chose not to. He chose instead to appear in court regularly. Trump campaign officials tout their great airplane, but they don't really fuel it up and fly it out any more than Joe Biden uses Air Force One. Count the Trump campaign events since the calendar flipped over to 2024, and he's done at least 27 events like rallies or going to watch parties or, you know, live-filled speeches at the border. But what about his contention that Joe Biden doesn't really campaign, that he can't? Well, that's not really true either. Biden, on top of his White House schedule, has held 23 campaign events, including visits to union halls, campaign office openings, canvas launches, rallies. So, what's the truth here? Well, Donald Trump, as he often does, he has said the quiet part out loud. He does like the courtroom chaos, and he thinks it works better for him. Just listen to him say it. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And they're also in the data collection business, which is one of the function, investigative functions that they perform. And one of the first things they go to now in the modern world in order to explore, yes, you say you can be fair, but let's probe a little. Let's do a little background work.

And is there anything there that you can use? Here's the kicker.

He's also charged with trying to obstruct an official proceeding to stop Congress from doing its job and certifying the 2020 election. Now, that is the piece that the justices will ultimately decide whether or not the Justice Department can actually charge him with obstruction. They're doing it under a 2002 law that was meant to corral white collar criminals. It was originally designed to stop the smartest criminals in the room at Enron and other companies like it from destroying evidence. Now, of the nearly 1,400 people who were arrested for participating in the insurrection, 350 are facing obstruction charges, including Donald Trump. So, today, Fisher's attorney argued that the law is ridiculously limited. That unless you're talking about documents or records, unless you are tampering with evidence, it really doesn't apply. And so you can't charge obstruction, no matter what proceeding you may be impeding. Liberal Justice Sonia Sotomayor did the Supreme Court equivalent of laughing at that idea asking this.

And for the second time in two years, the party may be booting its own speaker.Now, after Mike Johnson decided to split up foreign aid bills, yet another Republican House member says Johnson must go or he'll join the effort to remove him. Johnson would need Democrats now to keep his job. But what's notable here is that just days after Donald Trump caught Johnson to kiss the ring at Mar-a-Lago, this is how the former president responded to all of this drama. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Tom Suozzi, the new congressman from New York has suggested that he will. I don't think Democrats see an advantage in the chair being vacated right now, especially because I think they think they're likely to get some sort of foreign aid deal or at least that they have a chance to get to that pretty soon. I know that Hakeem Jeffries was sort of suggesting today that they want some outlines from Mike Johnson about exactly what this nomination, excuse me, what this legislation is going to contain for Ukraine, et cetera. But the relationship seems significantly warmer than it did with regard to Kevin McCarthy some months ago. So, I think that you only had eight Republican votes to dethrone McCarthy last time around.

They have a number of things they need to do. This renewal of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. If the House acts on a foreign aid bill, the Senate will have to act on it, too, because the House probably won't pass exactly what the Senate already passed. And so, it's not just Democrats in the Senate who are eager to get onto other things. You have a few Republicans in the Senate who have been irritated about the impeachment itself and what a waste of time they see it as. But more broadly, you have a lot of Republicans in the Senate who have other priorities for their time. There is supposed to be a recess that starts on Thursday afternoon this week, and so, they probably can't make that in any case.
