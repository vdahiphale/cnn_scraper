      "sentences": "Hello and welcome to CNN NEWSROOM. I'm Max Foster in London.Just ahead, words of warning for Israel. International concerns mount over Israel's planned ground offensive in Rafah, where more than 1 million Palestinians are sheltering. Then the U.S. Senate passes a long awaited multibillion dollar foreign aid package, including money for Israel and Ukraine. And police in India fire tear gas on protesters as they march towards the capital, New Delhi. All eyes on Rafah as Israel prepares for a potential ground invasion into the southern Gaza City. More than 1 million Palestinians, about half of Gaza's entire population, are living in desperate conditions there, crammed into tiny slivers of land. The Israeli military has yet to present a plan for the evacuation of civilians, even as aid groups and international communities express their growing concern. U.S. vice -- U.S. President rather, Joe Biden says he discussed a potential hostage deal between Israel and Hamas with Jordan's King Abdullah the White House on Monday. U.S., Egyptian, Qatari and Israeli negotiators are expected to discuss a possible deal in Cairo on Tuesday. CNN's Jeremy Diamond has more on the latest developments. He joins us from Tel Aviv. What can you tell us Jeremy about this ground offensive which feels pretty imminent?",

      "sentences": "Well, the Israeli military and its political leadership is still vowing that an offensive in Rafah is militarily necessary, saying that it is Hamas's last bastion and that effectively allowing Hamas to remain there would be to forsake a major goal of this war, which is to destroy Hamas and to remove it from power in the Gaza Strip.The Israeli Prime Minister insisting that that cannot be achieved without going into Rafah. But there lies the question, what do you do with 1.4 million people crammed into a city of normally 300,000, when so much else of Gaza has been destroyed or partially damaged? And those questions so far are getting very few answers. Peter Lerner, a spokesman for the Israeli military, telling us earlier today that that plan that the Israeli prime minister has asked the military to draw up for the evacuation of the civilian population from Rafah has yet to be presented to the government. He did insist that the military has a confidence in its ability to evacuate that population and to distinguish between civilians and Hamas fighters. But already yesterday, we saw as the Israeli military carried out this operation to rescue two hostages from inside of that city of Rafah, they also carried out a series of strikes, heavy strikes on Rafah, killing more than 94 people. And it's very clear there that there were a number of civilian casualties among the dead and the injured. Women and children visible in the damage. Hospitals overwhelmed. Giving us really just a glimpse into what could potentially come, the absolute death and destruction that could come should the Israeli military move into Rafah without a sufficient plan to evacuate the civilian population. And where they would go, of course, is then another question. What kind of conditions would they find? How will humanitarian aid, which has struggled to reach the northern part of the Gaza Strip, reach them elsewhere beyond Rafah?",

Two sources tell CNN that CIA Director Bill Burns is traveling to Cairo for those discussions. One of those sources adds he'll meet with Qatar's prime minister and the director of Israel's Mossad. Nada Bashir joins us from Cairo with more details on that. I mean, there's been huge efforts behind this and people are getting more and more pessimistic, particularly when in the background, you have this potential military offensive, which presumably Israel wants to get on with whilst these negotiations are taking place.",

      "sentences": "Yes, absolutely. We've heard a huge amount of concern being expressed by Israel's international allies, as well as, of course, the United Nations around the potential for this possible ground encroachment in Rafah, not only to put civilian lives at risk, but also to scupper any ongoing negotiations on the diplomatic front forward prolonged truths and for the release of hostages.And of course, at this stage, we have seen intense diplomatic efforts behind the scenes focused primarily on a prolonged truth, not a ceasefire, but a sustained pause in fighting that would allow for hostages to be released, but also to allow for further talks and discussions between the lines of Hamas, Israel and also, of course, other international partners for a full ceasefire eventually. There have been questions around where exactly we stand when it comes to those discussions. We heard yesterday from U.S. President Joe Biden saying that the key elements for a prolonged truce looking at about at least six weeks long are on the table right now, but that there are some gaps which remain. And, of course, we saw last week the proposal, a counter proposal put forward by Hamas that was, of course, dismissed by Israel and the Israeli Prime Minister, who described it, in his words, as delusional. We heard from the U.S. Secretary of State, Antony Blinken, at the time, saying that there were some non-starters in that counter proposal. But since then, we have seen ongoing discussions. Last week, we saw a senior delegation of Hamas officials arriving in Cairo for two days of talks. Today, of course, as Jeremy mentioned, we are expecting to see the CIA's Director, Bill Burns, meeting with Egyptian intelligence officials, as well as, of course, officials from Qatar and Israel's intelligence agency, according to sources familiar with the matter. And we have seen a lot of focus on this regionally as well. We saw the Palestinian Authority, President Mahmoud Abbas at meeting with Qatar's Emir earlier this week. Last week, we saw regional foreign ministers meeting in Riyadh. There is a huge amount of pressure coming from the international community for some sort of sustained truce to be established. As we've seen, the civilian death toll is continuing to climb day by day. And, of course, it is. growing extremely difficult to get humanitarian aid across the border, particularly, of course, in Egypt. There is concern around the security situation on the border. Just in the last day, we have seen Egypt fortifying its military and security presence on its side of the Rafah border crossing as we continue to hear those warnings of a looming ground incursion by the Israeli military, raising fears not only over the civilian life there. Of course, we have to know that more than 1 million people are now concentrated in this small border city, but of course, the ramifications this could have more regionally. The fear is, of course, if we do see a ground operation launched by the Israeli military, this could jeopardize those negotiations as they currently stand. That has certainly been the warning message that we've heard from Hamas, who have said that they will not move forward with any negotiations if that ground operation is launched. Max?",

      "sentences": "Yes, I think you're absolutely right. And I think we can also see, Max, from all this how closely the Ukrainians are watching what's going on in the U.S. Congress right now. So fast that President Volodymyr Zelenskyy came out and thanked the leaders of the Senate because right now for them, this Ukraine aid is very much still alive.And you alluded to the fact that in the House of Representatives, it's going to be very difficult to even get this is to some sort of vote and Speaker Johnson has already said that this is essentially dead in the water. But that's what's been said for a very long time and as of right now, as far as the Ukrainians are concerned, it is still alive. But I did find it remarkable how quickly President Volodymyr Zelenskyy came out and praised the leaders of the Senate. I want to read you some of what he said in a tweet just minutes after it passed. He said, \"For us in Ukraine, continued U.S. assistance helps to save human lives from Russian terror,\" as he puts it. \"It means that life will continue in our cities and will triumph over war.\" And I think some of the things that he's alluding to are realities on the battlefield for the Ukrainians on the ground. Of course, if he talks, for instance, about Ukrainian cities, he means, for instance, surface to air missile systems that need new missiles that are replenished from the United States. Some of the very high end ones that work really well, like the NASM system or the Patriot systems, of course, vital for the Ukrainians. And then the other thing that he's talking about is, of course, ammunition, which has been a real crunch for the Ukrainians on the front line. I've seen some of that myself. We're in certain areas on the front lines. The Russians are able to fire 10 rounds for every round that the Ukrainians are able to fire because they simply have to ration ammunition. For the Ukrainians, then, this is an important signal that the Senate stands behind Ukraine. Of course, they do understand that it is still a very, very long way to go, and all of it is still very uncertain. And the other thing, Max, I think as well, is that the Europeans, no doubt, are watching this very closely. I was able to speak yesterday to the German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and to the Prime Minister of Denmark about the issues in U.S. Congress, also some of the remarks that President Trump made. And the tenor from them was that they believe that U.S. aid right now is more uncertain than it was before, but they still say it is indispensable. And they believe and they hope that in the end, this aid for Ukraine will come through, Max.",

The Minister of Justice tells CNN that Thaksin Shinawatra has been granted parole after serving half of his sentence. Last year, the 70-year-old was granted a royal pardon, reducing his eight-year sentence for corruption and abuse of power to just one. Thaksin was jailed last August after he returned to Thailand following more than 15 years in self-imposed exile. Prince Harry, wife Meghan, are making another public relaunch, this time with a website. Sussex.com will replace the others that they had up until now. It showcases their charity work and media projects. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex sit back, of course, as working members of the British royal family in 2020 have stayed very much in the public spotlight. Since then, the question is whether or not they'll be allowed to keep using those titles, which are arguably being used to commercialize, which is something that they obviously agreed not to do when they left the royal family, but that's their website and it's getting a lot of clicks today. Now, a powerful winter storm is blasting the northeast coast of the U.S. right now with some 30 million people in its path from Maryland to Massachusetts. The forecast is for heavy snow, powerful winds, also coastal flooding. You're looking at live pictures now from New York, which is bracing for its heaviest snowfall in years.

I mean, they're the biggest voting block farmers in India because as you know, their primary source of income, 58 percent of India's 1.4 million residents actually depend on agriculture. So that's a huge percentage we're talking about, Max. But this time there is a difference. There are issues within this community itself.Like I said, you haven't seen as big a response as you'd seen back in 2020 where they came out in tens of thousands against the Modi government. Now, look, this is an election year, and Narendra Modi would want to make sure that he does not alienate this huge voting bloc. But for now, they're ready to talk. They're saying, OK, come to the table. This may take longer than anticipated. But the farmers are saying, you know what? We've heard this before. And you have formed a committee, but you're really dragging the findings of that committee. You haven't submitted the report yet. So here we are. We will keep protesting. We will keep trying to make it a New Delhi and we will take our voice to the power capital of India, which is New Delhi for you to hear it. But for now, we know that they're going to try and get to Delhi, but all roads leading to Delhi from Haryana have been blocked for now. We talk about three border areas that get from Haryana to Delhi that have been sealed. And there are thousands of security forces and security personnel blocking those roads for now. So you've seen what's happened today. You've seen the clashes that have taken place. And there were drones used this time interestingly, to go ahead and stop these people from moving forward. And you saw the tear gas actually being fired from those drones. That's never happened before in these anti-farmer measures taken by security forces. So in the coming days, we're not sure how far these farmers will get. Will they get to the borders of Delhi? But yes, the Indian government is saying the channels for talks with the farmers is open. But the farmers for now, though divided a lot compared to 2020, are not happy with the solutions being put forth by the Indian government. Max?",
