      "sentences": "Well, Alisyn, basically, prosecutors tried to establish one primary thing, not just that Robert Bowers was the person who fired indiscriminately into the synagogue, killing 11 Jewish worshippers, but also that he did so specifically because they were Hewish and he did so in a truly horrific way.We did learn new details today just about how violent and seemingly intentional this shooting was. Prosecutors said that Robert Bowers went through the synagogue, methodically going room to room and, in their words, hunting Jewish worshippers. Now, after a while, law enforcement did come in. SWAT team members engaged in a shootout with Mr. Bowers. They were able to get him to surrender. But it was during that point when he was surrendering that a SWAT officer asked Robert Bowers, why are you doing this? Why did you do this? And the prosecution said today that Mr. Bowers's response was -- quote -- \"All Jews need to die and Jews are killing our kids.\" So, that is really what the prosecution is saying. Now, Alisyn, I should say, the defense in this particular case, they are not disputing that Robert Bowers killed these 11 people. The defense said that these actions were incomprehensible and inexcusable, and there is no question that it was a planned attack. But that main defense attorney, Judy Clarke, today, she really said that the jury's job in this case is to see if, in her words, Bowers's irrational motives and misguided intent, if those actually apply to the 63 federal charges that Mr. Bowers is facing. So, it was an intense day in court. We got both opening statements from the prosecution and the defense first thing this morning.",

I will get to that in just a second.But one of the things that we heard from three witnesses called today were 9-1-1 calls that we have not heard prior to this moment. We can't release those specific 9-1-1 calls to you or to the public right now because they're too graphic. That is a court order. But I want you to listen to some past 9-1-1 calls from the same incident that will give you a bit of an idea of the tone of the calls that we heard in court today. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNKNOWN (voice-over): I got one alive. UNKNOWN (voice-over): We're evacuating one right now. Still alive. We have at least four down in the atrium DOA at this time. UNKNOWN (voice-over): Was there earlier intel that he may be in the basement? UNKNOWN (voice-over): I had a report of at least one victim in the basement.

We actually have a chance to hear the 9-1-1 call that he made while the shooter was inside of the synagogue killing other members of his congregation.And it is really chilling, Alisyn, because you hear him incredibly composed on the phone, talking with a dispatcher, saying exactly what the address of the synagogue. He is saying exactly where he is, where other members to the best of his knowledge is. And you can hear the gunfire all the while, while he is on the phone, in the background. And then he goes silent for a good period of time. And the dispatcher says, are you there? You know, can you hear me? And he still stayed silent. And today in court, Rabbi Myers was asked, why did you go silent for those few moments? And he responded, because I was praying. And he said, I expected to die. At that point, he was deciding whether he should stay on the line with 9-1-1 or perhaps call his wife. And again, to your initial question, just a terribly emotional day today in court.

That is when everybody was getting online and sort of getting indoctrinated into these chat rooms. If you had a particular view or you had a particular hate, it sorts of grew. And that is where these reports are still kind of growing in exponential numbers. Some of these incidents that we are looking at, we look at New York, New York actually has about 15 -- 16, rather, percent of the total incidents across the country. Mainly sort of the epicenter of that is in Brooklyn where there is a large orthodox Jewish community, where there is very easy to target members of this community.

It was Halloween time. And people had carved into their pumpkin stronger than hate because they felt that despite the tragedy that had happened here, we need to take a stand against the evil, that is this person, that is the shooter, that the shooter has inflicted upon our community. And so, I just wonder, in cases like this, obviously, there is a legal proceeding going on and that is on one side of things, but how important is it in all of these communities, for them to come together and say, despite what happened, we have to move forward stronger together?",

But they said they needed to come together, they needed to stand up against this state, and they needed to quite frankly have this day in court.This is going to be an issue that we are going to continue to track because we do see so many incidents where it is sort of on the fringe of sort of antisemitic, right? We saw the former president dining with a holocaust denier. We have seen members of Congress making antisemitic remarks. That is only also going to get worse.

Hillary Clinton in 2016 was the only one. Remember, she barely won it. She barely won it. Of course, DeSantis wants to win in Iowa. He believes that's the place he can stop Donald Trump.

Again, I agree with Harry that it doesn't predict if you win an Iowa or you win in New Hampshire, it doesn't predict who is going to be the nominee, but I think at this point, it's a lot about the momentum, it's a lot about who are people talking about. I think for DeSantis, he has finally gotten into the race. This is his first big presidential campaign event. I mean, especially after the botched rollout of his campaign last week on Twitter. His campaign is very eager to put on a good show in Iowa. And I think that that is a good time -- I will say it is interesting, though, now that he's in the race.

More than 90% of Republicans tend to vote with McCarthy on every vote so far since he has been speaker. So, he keeps saying that he is confidence. And I should also just add that it is not just McCarthy's problem. Biden is also facing and Democrats are facing a tough problem with this bill as well. I mean, this bill is something that neither side is happy about. Republicans think it is extending the debt ceiling for too long into 2025. There's not enough spending cuts and it.
