We're staying on top of major new developments as tensions are rising across the Middle East where we are after a deadly Israeli attack on a school and mosque compound in Gaza. And a warning to our viewers, some of the images you're about to see are disturbing. Officials in Gaza say that Israeli airstrike killed more than 90 Palestinians.And according to the Gaza medical officials the victims, including children and elderly, were sheltering at that school and mosque when the strike hit overnight. The IDF claims without providing proof that the compound was being used by Hamas terrorists. Now there is growing international outrage. We have our teams around the world monitoring all of these very disturbing developments. First, I want to bring in our Clarissa Ward. She's here with me in Tel Aviv. Clarissa, what more are we learning about what happened in Gaza?",

      "sentences": "So this strike took place just after or during the Fajr prayer, that is the dawn prayer. According to Gaza Civil Defense, there were roughly 200 people who were gathered in the room. At least 93 had been killed. They're saying 11 of them were children, six of them were women. I can tell you, Wolf, we have been going through this footage for thebetter part of the day. It is extremely disturbing. Looks like a scene from a horror movie honestly. Fires were still going when rescue workers arrived on the scene. Just absolutely gruesome scenes. Now the IDF has said that there were Islamic jihad militants and also Hamas commanders who were present. They dispute Gaza Civil Defense's casualty figures. They say they believe that 20 to 25 militants were killed. I will say they haven't provided proof to show us that. CNN has obviously not able -- we're not able to work independently on the ground in Gaza and we're not able to verify the casualty rate or to ascertain whether there were combatants among the dead. What we did notice, though, when we were looking through the footage, is the munition or one of the munitions that was used. It's a U.S. made GBU-39 small diameter bomb. It's produced by Boeing. It's been used many times in Gaza. And this is significant because obviously this has been a point of real contention politically in the U.S. and around the world. And it was just yesterday, Wolf, that the U.S. finally acquiesce and said that they would release a further U.S. $3.5 billion in military aid to Israel. We are seeing a lot of international condemnation. It's coming in thick and fast, and really a sense that this is just underscoring the urgency to get that ceasefire agreement across the line, although I will say that to the people of Gaza those words are starting to feel increasingly hollow -- Wolf.",

That comes at the same time that Hezbollah so far has claimed nine separate strikes on Israeli positions. The latest one, the ninth one, appears -- Hezbollah says it was a swarm of attack drones that were aimed at military bases.Well within Israel, some of them very close to Lake Tiberius. And what we've seen recently is that Hezbollah drones have succeeded at evading Israeli anti-drone and anti-aircraft defenses and reach fairly well into Israel. Just the other day they were flying right over the city of Nahariya which is about 10 kilometers south of the border. So definitely tensions are rising. Of course, I was telling you in the last hour at 5:30 in the afternoon local time, Israeli jets flew over Beirut for the third time in five days breaking the sound barrier. Now, that's a normal occurrence in southern Lebanon, but really it's only been happening for the last five days. The first time they broke the sound barrier six times was just minutes before the leader of Hezbollah, Hassan Nasrallah, was making a speech. And these breaking of the sound barriers are being interpreted by people here as a message, not just for Hezbollah not to retaliate for the killing of a senior Hezbollah commander last week in southern Beirut, but also a warning to Lebanon as a whole that perhaps if Hezbollah responds, the consequences will be very serious -- Wolf.",

But in terms of sort of municipal bomb shelters along the lines of what you have in Israel they simply do not exist.They probably exist for Hezbollah, for instance.

And the other four sunbelt states you essentially have a margin of error race. So right now couldn't be any closer than we have it right now.And really a critical next week for the Harris-Walz ticket as they head into the Democratic convention. And she's of course facing some of these questions of why she hasn't done an interview yet or if she will do an interview. I think we understand why she maybe hasn't done one quite yet considering she just rolled out her vice presidential ticket, but that's going to be something that she's going to be facing some pressure to do. And then after former President Trump's press conference that he gave, which, you know, honestly, in years past, if this was anyone other than Donald Trump, considering the number of lies and misrepresentations that he put forward, over 130 or so by our count and not even done with that quite yet, more than two a minute that he gave, that would be something that a lot of Republicans in previous years would have said, you know, this might be a five-alarm fire to the level of where Democrats felt about Joe Biden's dismal debate performance on June 27th.",

She thought she'd seal third place, posting a score of 13.700.Chiles had posted a score of 13.666 and was in fifth place originally, but then successfully challenged she thought the difficulty score, which added 0.1 to her tally and the American was then moved up to third behind compatriot Simone Biles and Brazilian Rebeca Andrade who gold. Now Barbosu was dropped down to fourth. She was left absolutely distraught and in tears at missing out on a podium finish. But now we're just learning on this very eventful Saturday, Fred, we're learning that Chiles may, she may have to return the bronze medal after all this that she won in the women's floor exercise after the Court of Arbitration for Sport or CAST, if you prefer, rule the initial inquiry made by the United States was filed after the one- minute deadline. That's what's key here. The court adding that the International Gymnastics Federation will determine the ranking of the final. So nothing is absolutely determined at this point. What do we have in terms of reaction? Well, in a joint statement, USA Gymnastics and the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee saying they're, quote, \"devastated\" by the ruling and that the inquiry into Chiles' routine was, quote, \"filed in good faith,\" and we believed in accordance with FIG rules.

Following the attempted assassination of the former president and fueling the heightened security, CNN has obtained a new intelligence report that indicates U.S. security officials are on alert for possible retaliatory attacks against Democrats at the DNC in Chicago later on this month. That's where the party will officially nominate Kamala Harris for president. The threat assessment was prepared jointly by the FBI, Department of Homeland Security, and other agencies, including local police in Illinois. Joining me right now to talk more about all this is Shawn Turner. He is the former director of communications for U.S. National Intelligence. Shawn, great to see you.

What stands out to me, though, with this particular report is that it sort of reflects where we are in this country with regard to the broader security environment.You know, as Director Wray, FBI Director Wray said in a hearing recently throughout 2023, the United States has been at a heightened security, in a heightened security state and it continues today. So what this report tells me is that the intelligence community and law enforcement officials are listening to chat or they're monitoring social media. They're looking at all of those places that law enforcement looks to determine whether or not people are saying things and doing things that would indicate that there might be a heightened threat environment. And they're seeing more of that than they've seen in the past. So this is particularly concerning to me simply because of where we are in this country and everything that we've seen over the past couple of months suggests that this needs to be an extremely highly manicured security situation for this Democratic National Convention.",

You know, it's a great question, Fred, because what we've seen is an elevation in the sort of threat language around not only the Democratic National Convention, but we've seen it across the board. And what that does is it makes it very difficult for law enforcement to sort of parse out what's just rhetoric and what actually represents a threat.Now I will say that based on all of this and I've talked to some of my former colleagues in the intelligence community and law enforcement, I believe that the 2024 Democratic National Convention will be one of the most secure that we've ever had in this country because I know that law enforcement, the Secret Service and other agencies are doing a lot of things that we will see publicly to secure the convention. But they're also doing a lot of things that we won't see. Bring a number of different resources that will allow them to ensure that it's secure. But I think, Fred, the most important thing that they're doing, and this has started already, is that you've got Secret Service, you've got law enforcement who are going door to door in Chicago talking to people who are going to be inside that security perimeter to make absolutely sure that they understand what's going on, but it's not just to make sure those people understand what's going on. It's also to identify areas where there might be some things that are suspicious, that are within that security perimeter. So things that we don't typically do, we'll see law enforcement doing to make sure that this is a secure convention.",

You've got the convention itself is going to be a hardened environment. That is to say that every single person who walks inside that venue is going to be, you know, checked up and down to make sure that they do not bring a threat inside of the convention venue.But as you know, Fred, outside of that convention, you know, there are a lot of things that happened in the community that represents soft targets. These conventions bring a lot of economic prosperity to areas like this. And so people are going to gather. It will be very much a sort of concert type atmosphere. And what security is really worried about are those soft targets. You know, where people will sit down, they'll socialize, they'll gather, because in those areas, even inside the security perimeter, outside of the venue, it's much more difficult to determine what's a threat and what's not a threat. What people can take -- you know, can take some solace in is that there will be people who are in plain clothes who are there looking and monitoring to make sure that if there are any threats that it's brought to the attention of law enforcement.

Number one is they've got to begin with a diplomatic effort to ensure their cohorts, Iranian friends, Iranian partners like Russia and China, maybe even India, are on board with what they're trying to achieve.Number two is the military preparation. They learned, Iran learned a very valuable lesson when they tried to strike Israel about a month and a half, two months ago, they failed miserably. So past cannot be prologue in this particular case for the Iranian. So what does it look like? So they may be moving capabilities like drones cruise missiles, strike capacities closer to Israel. So the closure time will be less. They also are going to want to try to attack Israel from multiple directions. This would primarily be done by proxies. Iran does not want to get into a direct fight with Israel. They know that Israel has immense capacity to operate on multiple lines of effort and they don't want to be able -- they don't want to put themselves at risk. And then the third thing certainly is going to be what is the internal domestic narrative that Tehran wants to spin and provide its citizens. We responded, we weren't going to stand for this.

Let's double- check our readiness posture. We've got to kick the tires on everything. We don't want to embarrass so ourselves.So this is an opportunity to really kind of steal the narrative, you know, suck the oxygen out of this, and then go forward.
