That is certainly one of the open questions.

Listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KARINE JEAN-PIERRE, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: People have asked will the president give Speaker McCarthy an off-ramp, an exit strategy. But exit strategy is very clear, do your job. Congress must act. Prevent a default. That's what a success -- not for him. It's not about the president. It's about the American economy. It's about the American people. That's what the president views as success. That's the way that it should be done. Regular order. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

They expect that it'll be more than 10,000 after Title 42 expires on Thursday.But it indicates that migrants are already crossing and they're crossing in big numbers regardless of what U.S. policy is. To your point earlier, there are hundreds of thousands of people in the pipeline because there is unprecedented mass migration in the western hemisphere. The Biden administration is aware of this. They have been talking about it for weeks. And a source tells me that White House officials and administration officials are ramping up their calls this week to stakeholders, lawmakers, and cities to warn them about what's to come with this influx. So, those preparations are being set in motion, short term and long term.

If it's just a little more than 50 percent more likely than not that it happened. And they said if it is just by the tiniest amount that they will -- that they should find in favor of Carroll. Now, there are three different kinds of sex crimes that the jury can evaluate, and they just need to choose one if they're going to find for Carroll. That is rape, that's sexual abuse or forcible touching. On the defamation claim that relates to Trump's October 12 statement in where he said that he didn't know Carroll, he didn't rape her, and that she wasn't his type. That is a different standard of proof for most of the elements of defamation there that's by clear and convincing evidence.
