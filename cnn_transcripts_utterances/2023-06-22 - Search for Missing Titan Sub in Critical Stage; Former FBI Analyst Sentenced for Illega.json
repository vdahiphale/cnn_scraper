We are learning that there are several safety concerns, learning of several safety concerns of that diving vehicle were raised previous years around specifically the thickness of the submersible hull and the battery and the materials used to build it. A former subcontractor who worked with OceanGate says that the low- tech features were by design and claimed they used off the shelf items to cut costs. CEO and pilot Stockton Rush even admitted, \"I have broken some rules\" to build the submersible. Miguel Marquez is in Newfoundland with the latest on the search. What are you learning?",

It is this ROV, the remote operated vehicle, that is on sea floor now,searching for that sub. Another ROV is on the way down. It takes about eight hour and it will be there in four hours or so, so it can assist in searching for the sub. The ship behind me is meant to be taking salvage gear that is sitting in the airports here at St. John's. That can salvage almost anything from depths greater than what they are dealing with out there. Do keep in mind that all of this takes a lot of time. It is takes about 20-24 hours for the ships to get from here in St. John's to the site of the Titanic wreck. And the oxygen question and if they are alive, will that oxygen hold out? We have eclipsed the time that they believe they had down there but PH Nargeolet is a very experienced oceanographer and people who know him say that the first thing he would do is to conserve oxygen and calm people down, having them sleep to use as little oxygen as possible to extend the time to be down there and hope to be rescued in time.

It depends what it is equipped with. Crucially, it won't be alone for long. These are some of the vessels there at the search site, deploying these. The Horizon Arctic, the one that Miguel mentioned, I will go a little farther, the one on the left there, the \"l'Atalante,\" has launched another ROV. Another four hours and there could be two ROVs searching. You can see the one on the way now, the Victor 6000 will join the search. It has video and photo and can carry out the 3D reconstruction of the bottom, which is going to greatly improve the ability of the search teams. One of the greatest challenges, what is the best way the search down there And one of the last points Miguel made, how to salvage something. That would be the flyaway deep ocean salvage system, which the Navy is working with the vessels there to mount onto a ship, a tool to bring it up. But even that takes time. Officials said it is taking about 24 hours to weld it to a ship. So the timeline is the enormous question right now.",

They may have felt that their technology, you know, using a carbon fiber hull was so new that it would have been nearly impossible to get the certification in a timeframe that they were looking for. So you know, as long as there was good engineering and design behind it and they felt it was safe, I can see why they might have thought that it was not worth going after at this point.

Clearly, China is going to be coming up on the agenda, Sara, no question about it, because the Indians share many of our same concerns about the influenced activities that the PRC is exerting in the Indo Pacific and in the world.

Two very large democracies, two powerful countries with strong economies and shared values, goals and interests around the world.
