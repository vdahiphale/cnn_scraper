Josh, as we look at the way all of this is unfolding -- and for the folks that are just joining us, you're looking at these pictures from our affiliates there from just moments ago of Jack Teixeira. We believe this is the family home in Dighton, Massachusetts, which is in the southern part of the state, just a little bit south of Dighton, Mass. And one of the things that stood out, so we just heard in this Pentagon briefing, there are specific questions about whether certain platforms like Discord are being monitored. How long were these documents out there? And what we heard twice was that part of what DOD does, they're really monitoring more on an international level, not as much domestically, Josh. So when we look at what is or is not out there, what is your sense of who is monitoring potential activity on these sites that could include sensitive intelligence documents? Do we know?",

      "sentences": "I can tell you, after every major spy case that we've seen arrests in U.S. history, going back to Aldridge Ames in '94, Robert Hanssen, who was an FBI agent, in 2001, after Chelsea Manning, after Reality Winter, after all of these espionage cases, the government does an after-action and tries to determine what were the vulnerabilities. How was this information compromised?And although, you know, this arrest is going down right now, we believe that that is the suspect there on your screen, you know, the spy hunters are obviously celebrating that this person has now been taken into custody. They are preparing themselves for the accusations, the ridicule, the criticism that's to come. And that is, how could this information have been compromised because compromised? And it gets exactly what you were just saying there as far as the systems, what monitoring is being done, what trip wires are out there? And so again, you know, the good news for the spy hunters is that this person is now in custody. But they have a lot of work to do to determine what the best practices may have been violated, what new best practices may need to be implemented. As we look at this video, I do want to point out one thing. You know, those watching may be wondering, well, why this overwhelming show of force here, where you have FBI tactical agents who are now taking someone into custody who isn't accused of a violent act. This person accused of disclosing information improperly. FBI agents, as they prepare their arrest plan, they will work to determine, gather every piece of intelligence that they can as they assess, is this a dangerous person? We know from that stunning \"Washington Post\" report recently that the individual who led this group on this platform, who we believe to be this air guardsmen who has now been taken into custody, had talked about being a gun enthusiast, had been at gun ranges. He's obviously a member of the military. And so the FBI is factoring that into their determination about what type of force you bring to this residence in order to take this this person into custody. As we saw at the beginning of the video, this arrest obviously taking place outside. And this is very much textbook. The FBI operators there want to control the situation. They don't want to rush up to the house and rush up to the suspect. What you saw on that video is the FBI agents commanding that officer -- that suspect right there, calling him back to the vehicle. You can see the agents there safely tucked behind that up-armored Bear Cat. They're bringing the suspect to them. They have control of the situation. You see that his head -- his hands are on top of his head. That obviously so he doesn't try to reach for a weapon. They need to ensure that he's secured. And so we're seeing that very textbook. They have the indication that this person may own a gun, may be a gun enthusiast. They don't want to take any chances. And then we move to the next step. You know, that -- that home now is a crime scene. As we've seen in all of these major spy cases in previous history, the feds will be there for a long time. Because, of course, they need to determine, are there additional classified documents that are inside that residence? What we've seen in past cases, the feds will get their search warrants lined up ahead of time in order to go in and search that top to bottom, essentially anywhere that a document could be disclosed, any social media, you know, that this person may have been in, on any computer device, any type of phone. Anywhere where a digital file could be that could pose a risk to disclosing information from the federal government will be searched. And so we'll have to wait and see what happens next. Obviously, authorities will be looking to determine whether other co- conspirators, you know, other people who might have access as well. But at least the first step in bringing this to some type of resolution is now -- now appears to be happening. And that is the arrest of this person. But, of course, the investigation there's still so much left to be done.",

When he referred back to it a second time, he said, oh, it's not that they're breaking in. He mentioned that you lent the keys to this person.That's a little bit closer. It's not that this information was hacked from somebody on the outside, which in first analogy would lead you to believe. This is somebody that the United States government, with the proper background checks and all of the procedures that he kept referring to, allowed this person to have access to this information. And, of course, he's not the only one. It's been estimated that there is close to three million people with security clearances in the United States, with over a million of those having access to top- secret information. And the idea is you give people the keys to the rooms in the house where they need to access that information. There are going to be legitimate questions about, well, how many keys did this individual have? How many rooms was he allowed to go into to take things out of as part of his job? And did he really need that as part of his job? The analogy gets much more complicated. But those are the kinds of questions that investigators will be looking at.",

And, Kim, I find that interesting, too, in the context of what we heard from the president just a short time ago this afternoon, essentially downplaying this, saying it wasn't contemporaneous information, that he was concerned --not concerned about the leak, but is concerned that it happened. How damaging is all of this overall? How damaging have these past few days been?",

      "sentences": "Every single U.S. ally will right now be looking at, what did we share with the U.S., and might it be exposed by this leak?And one of the things that investigators will be looking at is which networks in the Pentagon system did this young military intelligence technician have access to? There are different places like the Joint Worldwide Intelligence Communications System. It's one of the ways to network that the Pentagon uses. Teixeira amongst itself. But also remember, after the attacks of 9/11, one of the things that the 9/11 Commission concluded was that a lack of intelligence sharing lead to not the right people knowing about this imminent attack. So the momentum went in the other way, put it on these worldwide networks that are shared amongst the State Department, the Pentagon, other intelligence services. So that say, you're chasing a terrorist suspect, you can almost Google this data and see what everybody else has on the same person. Now then the question becomes, when you have things like the Chelsea Manning leak and now this one, how much access do we allow? Which technician? At what level? It seems like this guy had too much. One of the reasons I think that they were really careful with the arrest is, as Josh was talking about, that they were very deliberate about this, is they didn't know how much this person had pulled down off of the systems, and perhaps were fearing that they do a massive dump because they knew that they were about to be jailed.",

If you are just joining us here on CNN, we're following the breaking news out of North Dighton, Massachusetts, where, as you can see in the pictures on your screen, just moments ago, an arrest was made.This is of the person who is suspected of leaking those documents, these highly sensitive intelligence documents online. Jack Teixeira is 21, an Air National Guardsman, someone who both \"The New York Times\" and \"The Washington Post\" had identified earlier as a leader of an online chat group where these leaked documents first appeared. We want to bring back in our panel. And if you're just joining us, too, in terms of what we know at this hour, we're waiting to hear from the attorney general. We did hear from the Pentagon in a briefing, not a lot of details, as you can imagine. The Pentagon saying that they are reducing access in terms of who has access to the classified materials. But being very clear that they consider this a deliberate criminal act. One thing that has come up is the age and people trying to put together I guess a better idea of who this person may be who had leaked the documents before we had names. We're getting some details from this reporting from \"The Washington Post\" overnight. And David Priess, I want to bring you back in here. Based on your time in the CIA, we look at what we know in terms of this reporting that this is a 21-year-old man, he's described as a gun enthusiast. Feels like, in some of these descriptions, somebody who's hungry for power, that he would get angry if the people in his chat group weren't paying enough attention to some of the information that he was posted. What type of a profile does that start to paint for you, David?",

He was clearly too young to have access to that kind of information. If so, then we have a real problem in national security because there are a whole lot more 21-year-olds in the U.S. military and the national security enterprise than there are people who are older than 50 or 60-years-old. Age does not correlate with criminal activity and willingness to sell out one's country by handing over classified information. The other one is a concern that, you know, we need to be watching.",

They were doing some of the background work. Before they can execute a search of the home there, they do a lot of work to try to make sure they understand what they're getting into. They try to try to figure out who? Maybe there. They want to make sure they get the -- obviously to get a judge's permission for all of this. So some of that was happening earlier. And then -- and you know, all of their plans really accelerated once the media made public the name of the suspect, and that happened just -- just a couple of hours ago, of course. We knew that the FBI had made a lot of progress just over the last few days. You know, we knew that there were thousands of people who had access to some of these documents that were being made public that we now seen publicly. But you know, they married -- managed to narrow it down pretty quickly over -- over the course of days. They spent the weekend doing interviews with people who are associated with this group that was online on Discord. And so they narrowed -- they homed in on Teixeira very, very quickly. And by today, they knew that he was the person that they were going to try to go for. It was just a matter of time. And so everything kind of accelerated in the last couple of hours because of his identity being -- being made public. What we expect now, Bianna and Erica, is we expect that he's going to be processed there in in Boston. If he wants to make any statements, obviously, they will take those. But most likely, you know, he has he'll have an attorney now representing him. And then they will try to -- they will start the procedure of removing him to bring him back to the Washington, D.C., area, where we expect that the charges are going to be filed. Probably in the Northern District of Virginia, which is where the department, the Pentagon is located, which is the jurisdiction, obviously, that owns the documents. So that's the reason why we're expecting him to eventually be facing those charges that the attorney general just briefly announced, which is the dissemination, the retention, illegal access and dissemination of national security information, classified national -- national security information. You know, to the point that you guys have been making, I think -- he's 21-years-old. And as I think the Pentagon briefer was saying, you know, you've got so many people of that age group who are trusted with a lot of, you know, million-dollar equipment in the in the U.S. military. They're trusted with everything. So this guy is not emblematic certainly of the average 21-year-old who is trusted with this kind of information. But one thing that has emerged in this investigation is that the Pentagon has a lot of work to do to button up, you know, who has access, and how it tracks these people who are trusted with this information. It's something that you're going to emerge -- it's going to emerge over the next few days.",

Josh, one final question to you. What type of sentence usually goes along with some of the charges he may be facing?",
