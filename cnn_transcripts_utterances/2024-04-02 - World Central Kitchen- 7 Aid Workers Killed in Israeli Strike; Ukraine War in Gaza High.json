This is \"Connect the World\".Also happening this hour, Israel says it unintentionally struck innocent people in Gaza and is investigating at the highest levels after one of its airstrikes killed at least seven aid workers Monday. Iran's leader is vowing to respond the day after a deadly attack on Iran's consulates in Syria. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken is meeting with top officials in Paris with Gaza and Ukraine higher the agenda. And investigations are underway in Finland following a deadly school shooting on Tuesday when 12 year old child died. Well I want to check in to see how the stock markets in New York is faring at this point, of course, DOW futures pointing to a negative start to the day around eight tenths of a percent lower. We've got oil prices at a five month high. A big worry about how that's going to feed into inflation. Of course, we saw the start of the second quarter and it's off to a very rocky road ahead. We'll check in to see how the markets open in about half an hour. In the meantime, the World Central Kitchen is pausing its Gaza operations after seven of its workers were killed in an airstrike leaving even fewer options for Palestinians on the brink of famine. They had just finished unloading 100 tons of food at a warehouse in central Gaza when the group says the cars were hit by an Israeli strike. Here's what the Israeli Prime Minister had to say.

There was an American-Canadian citizen, a British citizen, a Polish citizen and Australian citizen, a Palestinian as well. And you've heard outrage expressed from all of their home countries, including the White House, which has spoken of its sorrow and concern about what might have gone on. So the these countries are asking version questions, as are the U.N. agencies that have so desperately been trying to get aid in and raise alarm bells about what's going on inside the Gaza Strip. We've been hearing, Eleni, from the head of the U.N.'s agency that deals with relief in the occupied territories pointing out that this is far from an isolated incident. It is 196 aid workers he says that have been killed so far since the war began across the occupied territories. And that is a reminder of how very dangerous this work is, at a time when it is increasingly desperately needed. Of course, we've been hearing repeatedly from the IDF from the Israeli side, Eleni of their attempts to increase the amount of aid getting into work with the aid agencies as they tried to bring relief. But in terms of what's happening on the ground, we continue to hear from the U.N. agencies desperate pleas for more to get in. And in this particular case, what appears to be a failure on the IDF side to work with these humanitarian aid workers. So I believe that we will have to be getting answers fairly quickly from them given the amount of outrage that's been expressed. We've been hearing from also the head of the U.N.'s relief agency across the world speaking of these workers as heroes who were bringing aid to starving people. And I think the pressure on Israel is now ratcheted up another notch to try and give answers but also to try and get more aid in safely, Eleni.",

Well, while the U.S. tries to seek a resolution to Israel's war in Gaza, sourcestell CNN, the Biden Administration is close to approving a major fighter jet sale to Israel. The deal reportedly includes up to 50 F-15 jets and is expected to be worth more than $18 billion. It will be the largest military sale to Israel since the country went to war with Hamas after the October 7th attacks. CNN's Jennifer Hansler joining us now with more from Washington, Jennifer, this announcement will only be delivered in fact in around four years, so we're talking about longer term sale here.

At least 13 people were killed in the attack, including seven members of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. A U.S. official says the U.S. had no involvement or advanced knowledge of the attack. Iran's ambassador to Damascus said this is likely the first time Israel directly targeted an Iranian diplomatic building. We've got Fred Pleitgen joining us now he's been inside the Iranian embassy in Damascus. And he joins us for more insight. Fred, I've got a few questions for you. So just bear with me. I want to start off with the Vienna Conventions which are supposed to protect diplomatic compounds if those are struck essentially, you're striking that said country's actual, you know territory, you've been inside this embassy.

And you're right I have been in that building before. It's a very large embassy that the Iranians have they're very large compound. And if we go back and look at the footage that we were showing before, you can see that the actual embassy building seems to be almost untouched seems to still be standing. But the building next to that seems to be completely annihilated. And that certainly appears to indicate that the Israelis or whoever was behind all that the Israelis, of course, have not yet claimed responsibility for that attack that they conducted a pretty precise strike using a lot of munitions and doing that right in the center of Damascus is certainly pretty bold. Now you're absolutely right. The Iranians have come out and said that this contradicts pretty much every diplomatic convention that is out there. But the Israelis have come out and said, first of all, they're not acknowledging that they were behind this. They also ever say that they consider that building as not being a diplomatic compound. They say that they believe that this was a base, essentially, for the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, the IRGC, of course, the elite Iranian military unit, and that therefore, it was a building that could have been attacked. Of course, officially, this is very much part of the Iranian embassy compound inside Damascus. It's a very large embassy again, but certainly one that officially is part of an embassy compound and therefore -- territory of the Islamic Republic of Iran, Eleni.",

And I think one of the things that we need to understand is that Syria for the IRGC for the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, for the past, really, I'd say about 10 years has been an extremely important venue. They obviously fought very hard there against the opposition, against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. They also mustered a lot of forces out there a lot of militias back then, under General Qasem Soleimani. So the Iranians do tend to send very senior military officials, especially the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps to Syria to run their operations there. They're very important for them also, as they support Hezbollah, but also, of course, to try and pressure the Israelis as well. In fact, one of the things that the Israelis came out and said is that they said, look, the Iranians attacked an Israeli military base in the town of a lot near the Red Sea, on the very day that the Israeli or whoever conducted this military strike on the embassy compound. So these are very senior figures in the IRGC so, certainly a big blow. But one thing that has become clear also from the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps is that they do tend to be able to replenish their ranks very quickly, Eleni.",

And to an attacker has injured and killed one of his other students, all of whom are 12 years old, seemingly from the same grade at school. As you say police have now taken him into custody, but an interesting term because of his age, it means that he cannot be handed over to police, he will have to be processed through social services. We don't yet know exactly what the reason for this attack was and paraphrasing the Finnish Prime Minister, he said that, you know, he's deeply shocked by what has happened at the school. The authorities are yet to determine the story behind this event. But he also acknowledged that one attack is one attack to many. But Finland, you know, unlike other countries in the world, you know, particularly the United States where we see attacks in schools like this happening on a more regular basis. It is very rare in Finland. In the last attack that we saw this form happened in 2008, when 9 people including the attacker were killed including the attacker himself. So it's incredibly rare in Finland but details at the moment, Eleni are still very, very thin on the ground and I'm sure that Finnish authorities will be looking to try to establish exactly what happened here.",

However, a Florida again, traditionally really has voted for Republicans. And if history is in a prologue here, it is possible that Florida could conceivably pass any one of these two ballot amendment questions and still vote for a Republican at the top of the ticket. I think a really important part of the story is the supermajority that is needed for this ballot amendment to pass.

And of course, everyone is focused on that oil price. Welcome back to the show. I'm Eleni Giokos. You're watching \"Connect the World\". And I mentioned oil receding at five month highs. This of course, is a particular concern following the news of Monday's strike on that oil refinery in Russia and also the Iranian consulate in Damascus. As we reported earlier, this is where prices stand in real time for Brent crude and WTI crude has a five month high on Monday fueled by expectations of growing demand in China and the U.S. as well as supply cuts by OPEC Plus nations. As well as, you can see Brent crude up 1.5 percent, WTI crude 1.7 percent higher as well. It's clearly a lot of concern coming through and that is why we're seeing a rise in oil prices, concerns that we might see supply being pulled back.

Now it's one of the best known news networks in the world and now Israeli PrimeMinister Benjamin Netanyahu is vowing to stop it operating in the country. Al Jazeera is facing a ban in Israel after parliament approved a new law Monday, allowing the government to ban foreign networks which are deemed to be a threat to national security. Israel claims that Al Jazeera is a trumpet for Hamas. The network strongly disputes this claim. According to Al Jazeera, several of its reporters and their families have been killed by Israeli airstrikes in recent months. Meantime, Rights groups are concerned that the new law could also be applied to other news outlets impacting international coverage of the war in Gaza. We've got CNN's Scott McLean in Istanbul covering the story for us. Scott, Al Jazeera is under target right now under this law, but also, as we've said, foreign networks as well.

First off this law, which the Prime Minister says thathe will not hesitate to enact against Al Jazeera, gives the Prime Minister or the Communications Minister the power to shut down foreign media offices to block their websites, to block their signal to cease press cards and to seize equipment, some pretty sweeping powers here are all in the name of national security. And the Israelis have justified this at least in part by pointing to Western sanctions or bans in some cases against the Iranian outlet Press TV and Russia today, obviously, owned by Moscow. And in this case, Israel is also making some very serious allegations, which frankly, maybe aren't even worth repeating, because they have come with no evidence at all that Al Jazeera involvement in the October 7 attacks. Obviously, the Prime Minister has also long complained about anti-Israel bias that in Al Jazeera is reporting but the reality as you've rightly pointed out, Eleni is that Al Jazeera is a very well respected network. It does and has continued throughout the course of this war to do some very -- on the ground reporting. Just a few days ago broke news about Israeli troops shooting and killing Palestinians and then bulldozing their bodies in Gaza. That's just one example of the many examples of exceptional journalism that Al Jazeera has done, and its people have also been in -- way. The Gaza bureau chief, for instance, lost his whole family in an Israeli airstrike back in October. Al Jazeera has called these inflammatory slanders that put its employees at risk. It's also worth noting the timing here because Al Jazeera is part owned by Qatar and obviously Qatar is a big part of the negotiations between the Israelis and Hamas to try to reach a ceasefire.",
