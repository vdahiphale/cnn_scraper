We were driving from -- not far from Kiryat Shmona and we heard two big booms in the sky, looked out the window and saw the trails, the smoke trails of Iron Dome having intercepted at least two of those rockets. But the volume so great that some did get through, not just into Kiryat Shmona, but other areas of northern Israel, mostly unpopulated areas. Because listen, the northern part of this country has largely been evacuated of civilians. Many of those communities, including Kiryat Shmona, under mandatory evacuation as a result of that rocket threat. And this is a definite uptick in the number of rockets being fired in. The question of course, is, does this signal a more material, more aggressive involvement by Hezbollah and other Iran proxies in the north in this war against Israel? As you mentioned, a great deal of anticipation here on Nasrallah's public comments tomorrow. His first public speech since the start of this war on October 7th. Not clear if he will simply express further support for Hamas, its brother- in-arms, also backed by Iran, or signal or justify a greater involvement by Hezbollah. But there's great nervousness up here because Hezbollah has an enormous arsenal, not just of rockets, but of highly capable, long-range missiles with the range, capability, not just to hit here in the north, but all the way to Tel Aviv. They have fired them in Tel Aviv's direction before. And of course, the concern becomes, you've got missile defenses that can take down many of these missiles, most missiles and rockets, but not all of them. Particularly if they're fired in volume. That was Hamas' tactics from Gaza in advance to the October 7th attack, to fire so many that some get through. The concern is that Hezbollah would draw on its enormous arsenal, a stockpile of missiles, fired so many, not just at the north, but also at Tel Aviv, that some do get through, and then you have civilian casualties on the ground. So, lots of folks in this country are going to be watching that speech tomorrow very closely.",

There are, Isa, believed to be between 6 and 7,000 people on these lists now of those who are able to leave Gaza through Rafah. A couple of dozen Americans as you pointed out today, made it through the process. It was hoped that number would be as high as 400, sources tell me, there were certainly 400 on the list to be processed today. More than 100 Jordanians passed through, with a number now having reached the capital in Amman. Others from Hungary and Holland also making it. But it will take days to get everybody through. The talks behind the scenes to get this agreement on this evacuation has been painstaking and complicated for the negotiators. Competing demand from Hamas and Israel on who gets out and how, and from Egypt, which is very real security concerns about who makes it into Egypt and for how long. Families that CNN has spoken to in the States, at least, report that some members of families have made the list to get out, others have been left off from the same families, described by the attorney of one family in Michigan as either callousness or incompetence one hopes at this stage.

Obviously, my mom is not going to leave without my sister. She doesn't even speak enough Arabic to go across the crossing alone. Which is why she needs to be with my mom. And they waited for hours and hours and hours. I've called the embassy in Jerusalem, I called the embassy in Cairo, and I was unfortunately unable to get anywhere with them, and they were forced to turn around and go back home.

Of course, in hisconversations with Israel, he wants to get an update on their military  operation inside Gaza. He wants to reiterate to them the need for them to protect civilians and adhere to international humanitarian law. And importantly, he said earlier that they would be discussing concrete steps that Israel can actually take to better protect civilians in there that remain in those areas of where the military is operating there. Now, another aspect of this that he wants to discuss, interestingly, he really drove this home in his comments earlier, is not what's happening right now, but what's going to happen after Israel achieves its objectives in the Gaza Strip if and when it eliminates Hamas. How is Gaza going to be governed? He said that he wants to discuss a two- state solution with the Israelis.  Something that he says is the only way forward. The U.S. believes for a durable and sustainable peace. Now, another aspect of this that we expected him to discuss is, as you were just laying out here, that settlement violence in the West Bank. He and the State Department spokesman, they have strongly condemned this violence, and they have urged the Israelis to tamp down on it, because all it's doing is inflaming tensions even further in  the region. But when he speaks to the Jordanians, he is going to also emphasize to them that the U.S. does not support any kind of mass displacement of Palestinians to Jordan or to anywhere else in the region for that matter. And that really goes back to that conversation that he needs to have with the Israelis about that two-state solution, about what comes next. Because as we saw from that Israeli intelligence document that leaked earlier this week, the regional allies are very concerned that the Israelis want to see a kind of mass exodus of Palestinians into Jordan, into Egypt, not something that they want to do. So his job really is going to be to reassure the Jordanians that, that is not something the U.S. supports. That he is reiterating to the Israelis that they need to protect civilians and ultimately, what is the end goal here? What are Israel's military objectives, and are they achieving those objectives proportionate to the amount of civilians that are being killed in this war?

WEDEMAN (voice-over):  The nakba, Arabic for catastrophe, is when, in 1948, hundreds of thousands of Palestinians fled or were expelled from their homes in what is now Israel. As the fighting in Gaza intensifies and the civilian death toll soars, the prospect of regional war looms. And that could spell disaster for Lebanon, a country already in a state of economic collapse and political paralysis. MAHA YAHYA, MALCOLM H.

This week, the director of the FBI warned that anti-Semitism in the U.S. is reaching, quote, \"historic levels.\" According to the Anti-Defamation League, anti-Semitic incidents have increased nearly 400 percent. Let's get more on all of, this I want to bring in Stephen Collinson, who's reported on the rise of anti-Semitism across the United States. Stephen, let's start off with the incidents we have seen on some U.S. campuses, where we've seen a growing climate of fear and a rise in hate. What are the leaders doing on the campuses to put an end to this? What are they saying?",

What we have seen in some of these universities is a blurring of the lines between protests against the Israeli response to those attacks, a criticism of Israeli policy and that's crossing over in some cases to anti-Semitism and actions and intimidation that has made Jewish students feel unsafe. What I've heard a lot in recent days from American Jews is this idea that they believe that Israel and the United States were always safe places. The United States was not perhaps showing the anti-Semitic activity that has been around in modern politics in Europe. This, of course, is a country that's -- it's a committee that has great historic trauma. So incidents like this in the United States have suddenly made American Jews feel a lot less safe. I think that is one of the reasons why we've seen this reaction to what has been going on. It's not that there shouldn't be protests against Israeli behavior and pro Palestinian protests in universities; it's the way that it has permitted or lifted the lid on some blatant anti-Semitism that you don't normally see in the United States.",

They are trying to process complaints against discrimination a lot quicker. Obviously they are reacting to something that has been building over the last few weeks. And this is clearly a very politicized time in the United States. Especially Republican presidential candidates, who have already been complaining about what they see as \"woke\" climates, very left-wing sentiments on U.S. campuses, they are jumping on this and saying it's all a part of the radicalism of the progressive movement, which they see as un- American. So it's very political. And the administration, both in its attitude and its posture toward Israel -- and the domestic dissent building over this issue -- is walking quite a fine line.",

The other issue is that the plight of the Palestinians is very important to progressive voters on the left wing of the Democratic Party, who are less than enamored with President Biden. And, it's also an issue for younger voters, many of whom regard the president as far too old to be running for reelection in the first place. And they are not that enthusiastic about him. That is a group of voters that typically is quite difficult to get young people to show up to vote in the polls at the best of times. So any diminution of enthusiasm for the president next year could be a real problem. The 2020 election was decided in the whole of the country with more than 140 million votes by about 60,000 votes in a few key swing states. So you can see if some small patches of voters don't show up because of this issue, the president could be in quite a lot of trouble.",
