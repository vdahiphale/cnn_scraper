And at least you can see at least two tails, and then you can say -- OK, and now I'm being told that is actually a plane below after the strike of a balloon. And then the balloon then losing shape going down. Security Analyst Juliette Kayyem is back with us. Juliette, maybe your eyeballs more trained than mine to tell me what it is that we're seeing. But we can at least see with a -- perhaps, with a tighter view. It look like that balloon was disintegrating as we heard an eyewitness described earlier. Can you decipher what's going on here for me?

One is, of course, you've got debris and everything that you're worried about. But if there is some sort of rescue mission of the -- of what may have survived this hit because this is, as I said, important intelligence for us to know, you were not going to want airplanes surveillance over it.

So you can see from left to right there, that looks to me like a contrail of what is likely a fighter jet. And then you see it take a bit of a turn.

And you really have to go back more than 20 years, thinking of the collision mid-air between U.S. spy plane UP-3D, and a Chinese fighter jet over Hainan Island which led to a long diplomatic dispute because there were people involved that different, you know, pilots who were held -- the crew -- flight crew held by China there for a number of days. This thankfully does not have deaths involved because this was an unmanned surveillance balloon, but you had U.S. fighter jets, putting the eyewitnesses circling it and firing it and taking it down at a significant moment. And we haven't seen this kind of moment between these two powers in some time. And if you compared to 22 some odd years ago, China is a much greater military power now than it was then.

There were a number of high-level discussions, particular concern in the immediate timeframe was concerned about shooting it down over occupied territory in the U.S., those pieces fall to the ground, gravity works. And that would oppose the danger, according to those officials to people on the ground. And that's why they waited until it went over the ocean.

The Pentagon had pointed out of this had the ability to maneuver. It may have simply looked like a floating balloon, but the Pentagon said it had the ability to maneuver, it had the ability to loiter, and it had surveillance capabilities. So this is an opportunity to see what can be recovered and what can be learned about that.

You've been screaming to shoot it down for days, we have a plan, and we have some missions.So let's go chronologically. It crosses over the Aleutian Islands, it comes down through Canada, and enters Montana, and is looking straight at critical military spaces. Now that Chinese says, well, it drifted off course. OK. But then a number of things start to happen. First of all, the U.S. government starts to track it. DOD and the intelligence community are first going to say, all right, let's see how it behaves. What does it do? Where does it go? How has it controlled? Is it really drifting through the wind? Or does it have navigation capabilities to which the Pentagon says yes. The second thing you want to know is, what is it collecting and what is it doing with it? So they are looking at that payload on the bottom to see, well, what's it equipped with we can -- that we can see, what's it equipped with that we can't see, and how do we intercept that. Now, if it's highly encrypted, then they might not be able to intercept what it's sending back, assuming that it's transmitting. But they could be able to jam that signal and make sure that whatever it's sending back isn't getting back. So there are a number of opportunities and things that they had to do along the way. As we now know, the President gave that order on Wednesday, which is, when it's safe, and when it's proper, take it out of the sky. But that begins a whole set of new missions, which is they could blow it into a million pieces, you know, over the water. But what you want to do is you want to hit the balloon, not the payload. You want it to come down as intact as possible, and you want to pre-dispose of those assets, have them in place so that when it does come down, you can recover it quickly.

COL. CEDRIC LEIGHTON, CNN MILITARY ANALYST: Yes, exactly, Fredricka. As John was kind of alluding to, this is really a choreographed ballet. When you think about how all these different pieces and parts come together. You're looking at different air elements, you're looking at the naval elements, you're looking at the intelligence picture. All of that is being brought together. So when you look at this, the American people and really the people of the world get a chance to see how the United States conducts operations like this. There's a lot of planning that goes into this. When you look at the kinetic effects of an operation like this or the kinetic effects in an operation like, let's say, Desert Storm or Iraqi Freedom, you know, you just see the blowing up of something and then you think that's it. But the fact of the matter is there is so much that goes into this and there's so much thought that you put into something of this type. So, you know, when you look at the pictures that we're seeing here from, you know, from Myrtle Beach area, you're seeing a bunch of, you know, different elements that are coming together. The aircraft that was used, we don't know officially yet. It was, you know, probably my guess would be it was an F-22 that was doing this. These are top of the line fighters, you know, along with the F-35 in the American inventory. They probably -- the F-22 probably came out of Langley Air Force base. They could have shot it down either with an onboard cannon or with a missile like the Amram missiles. So that's the kind of thing -- that point of impact that comes together that way. But there is so much that goes into that before you actually take that first -- in this case, I believe only shot in this situation.",

And hearing all of that, I was listening and hearing your voice again where you said, you know, earlier, patience. Patience. It really is about patience and making sure that everything comes together. So now expand on that, if you will, on the thought you had earlier about, you know, you just can't be a knee-jerk about this. Everybody had an idea about just take it down, shoot it down.

They probably have known about it for some period of time. Wednesday, the president does what's essentially a standing order. He asserts what he wants the end game to be, which is this thing is getting out of the sky the second that it is safe to do so. His military comes back and says, not exactly safe here in the homeland, which was a correct calculation, which is right. Let's see what happens.And so they just essentially are seeing what happens. What they find out between Wednesday and Saturday is that the Chinese still have operational control of it and it appears as of last night when I was on, it appears that they're trying to get the thing towards water. So they know how this ends. And I cannot stress enough what an embarrassment this is for the Chinese. I know we have people, you know, saying, oh, we should have taken it down immediately. This is an utter embarrassment for the Chinese. Because it goes to the ocean, which they're commanding. Now our challenge is, where are we going to shoot it over the ocean? So the standing order is in place. Saturday, the military decides it's not in international waters. Some calls I got in between suggested or at least confirming that the debris is not in international waters. That means it's ours. There's going to be no -- there was never be any question about it.

And essentially, you know, this is now for us. So stage two was today, which is the shoot-down, the standing order has taken the place, and then stage three is now the debris and pickup for an ongoing mission. What I need to make clear is this is ongoing. So they are likely ableto have put radar or they had radar on the debris. I'm seeing it in open source right now. That debris will be picked up by the Navy or the Coast Guard. The Coast Guard is clearly going to have a role on this. If anything comes ashore, this will be a Coast Guard and state and local mission. So this will take a little while. As John was saying -- I'm sorry, as Cedric was saying, you want -- hopefully they got the balloon. It looks like they did. It is going to take a while. This thing is up in the air twice as high as a jetliner, now as the debris falls. As it falls, they are pinpointing it and then they have missions, then they have what's essentially just the maritime mission now. We have the aviation mission. The maritime mission now which is to pick up what they can to determine what did the Chinese now, what did they get, and we did this -- they did this with patience and without putting any civilian Americans at risk. It was so -- I have to say, you know, as we were talking patience, ends up being a strategy and it was used perfectly here. And then the bigger issues that Jim Sciutto was talking about, U.S.-China relations, which are going to have a lot of moments like this. This is a long-term challenge between the two countries.",

Now interestingly they added that the surveillance balloon is of valueto the United States. They said that, quote, \"I would also note that while we took all necessary steps to protect against the Chinese surveillance balloon's collection of sensitive information, the surveillance balloons overflight of U.S. territory was of intelligence value to us. I cannot go into detail but we were able to study and scrutinize the balloon and its equipment which has been valuable. So that's a really key statement -- that this balloon is of intelligence value to the United States. Now, that stands in direct contrast of course to what the Chinese government had been saying, which is that this was just a weather balloon and it had no surveillance or intelligence value. The senior Defense official went on to say that that explanation, quote, \"lacked any credibility,\" the U.S. simply did not believe that. And the U.S. was able to determine what was inside that payload in that balloon and they know that it is of significant intelligence value to the United States. So it will be interesting to see when they examine that what more they can learn about what the Chinese government was actually looking for when it launched this balloon, and of course what they were able to obtain while this balloon was over the U.S. territory over the last few days -- Fred.",

And, you know, help people understand what we're talking about with this accuracy, with this balloon 60,000 feet up, the speed in which the jet would be going and then with one strike be able to pierce it, not destroy it, but pierce it enough for it to descend and intelligence gathering, hopefully, you know, will be rich.",

This likely put some more creative store predictions that this was going to be a mission by the F-22 Raptor. There's a squadron of them based out of Fort Eustice Langley Joint Base in Virginia, Virginia.This is a fifth generation fighter used by the airports. It's the replacement of the F-15 and the F-16. You can see in the video the contrail, that's the hot exhaust meeting with the air, the moist air up at altitude there. You can see that bend there. That looks to me like it's the jet. The other trail, the thinner one, that looks to me like it's the air-to-air missile, likely an M-19 sideliner, going into that balloon. So you can also see in some of this video that we have been getting from sources online what in essence amounts to a waiting game. These fighter pilots were circling this balloon like sharks until they could get away from the populated areas along the coast of North Carolina and South Carolina. President Biden said he ordered the Department of Defense to order this shootdown on Wednesday, but the Department of Defense wanted to wait until much, much later when there would be no risk to folks on the ground. You could see there that looks to me like the envelope of the balloon, the top of the balloon deflated and falling down there. This was a pretty easy day, likely, for the aviators of this F-22. It is the perfect missile mount to do this in the military arsenal. 65,000 feet is as high as the F-22 can go. We know that this balloon was at 60,000 feet according to the Pentagon. It is a very fast jet. It can go 2.25 mach, that's twice the speed of sound, 1500 miles an hour. This balloon hardly going that, maybe 60 or 80 miles an hour with the winds aloft up there at 60,000 feet. So the speed difference was relatively big. They just needed to wait, these fighter pilots, until the right moment when it got away from land and over the water off the coast of North Carolina and South Carolina. Really interesting here that this is still over the territorial waters of the U.S. That ends about 12 nautical miles off the shore. So essentially what falls down is ours. We get to keep it now. But this is so interesting because these fighter pilots just simply had to wait and wait until this was in the right spot. And you can see in other videos circling online of these fighter jets just drawing contrails in the sky, these big racetracks, until they could get the right moment. President Biden commended these pilots. A pretty commendable job by them this afternoon in the shootdown of this Chinese spy balloon.",

That looks to me like the contrail of the missile, but then you can also see a little bit further to the right of the screen, kind of right in the center portion of the screen what looks to be the envelope of the balloon falling.And in some of these other videos that we were able to see, you can see what looks to be the contrail of a jet there on the right side of the screen, near that gutter and roof there. So what was so interesting to me also and some of the other videos we were able to see is the debris of what appeared to be the instrument apparatus below the balloon falling, shredded into pieces, and falling, glimmering in the light down to the surface. And so what will be really interesting -- that's the balloon still intact before it was shot down. That's the full envelope. That's the envelope as it was deflated, but the really important step -- we don't care so much about what is in the balloon. It is really so much about what is in the instrumentation that was dangling below it which we know was the size of a few buses, a few school bus sizes. So maybe 100 feet or so. And so --",

So from your point of view, how do you dissect, analyze what we just experienced and saw and heard from that new vantage point?

And you see that come together in a way where all of a sudden you hear the noise then, you know, it's a clear indication that there was impact and you see the payload at the bottom there coming down. And that payload is, you know, like Pete said, this is a very critical piece. What it reminds me of is what happened about 22 years ago when we lost an EP-3 to China. EP-3 is a Navy surveillance plane and the Chinese brought it down using some unsafe aerial maneuvers and hurt the crew for a bit, the U.S. Navy crew, and this is, of course, different because there are no personnel involved on the Chinese side but the intelligence collection aspect of this is what's similar. So, you know, with that Pentagon statement that this payload is of high intelligence value, I think that's true and I think that's going to be really the most significant aspect of this. But these flight crews did a tremendous job putting it together and as you can see there with the contrails there, that the missile going after that target, a very hard target for an aircraft to go after, that, you know, really gives you an idea of, you know, how complex this operation really was.",

They sent it back in boxes, you know, part by part. It was a diplomatic travail for us. And this will be the same.
