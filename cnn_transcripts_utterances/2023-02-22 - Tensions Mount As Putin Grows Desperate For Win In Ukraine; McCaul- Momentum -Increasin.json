Coffins full of Russian fighters as Putin turns to China now for help.Plus, Jared and Ivanka Trump handed a subpoena. The new reporting that they are the latest targets of the special counsel investigating Donald Trump and January 6th. And Ron DeSantis is cashing in, giving Donald Trump a run for his money, and the Florida governor hasn't even jumped into the race yet. Let's go OUTFRONT. Good evening, everyone. I'm Kate Bolduan, in for Erin Burnett. OUTFRONT tonight, a major warning from President Biden to Vladimir Putin, as new images show the true state of Putin's fighting forces. Take a look at this new video of Ukraine attacking Russian positions on the front lines of Bakhmut. Putin's troops are suffering heavy losses. And you can see that on stark display in this new video posted on social media and verified by CNN. Dozens of coffins containing the bodies of Russian fighters, they reportedly -- had reportedly been fighting with Putin's private force, the Wagner Group, which is fighting in Bakhmut. You can see death certificates with names and even the Russian region that they were from. And I also want to show you a photo posted today by the head of the Wagner Group, and I'll warn, this is graphic. According to the head of Wagner, quote, these are the guys who died yesterday due to the so- called shell starvation. Now, he's accused the Russian defense ministry of treason for their alleged failure to provide his troops with enough ammunition. Now there is no doubt that Russia is running low on ammunition and military supplies, and this fight within Putin's fighting forces certainly isn't helping his war. Perhaps that is one reason Putin is now talking about nukes, committing today to strengthening his nuclear triad one day after suspending Russia's participation in the new START nuclear treaty, a move that President Biden was asked about today.

Now, the casualties from the Ukrainian side, and we don't know any kind of accurate figure for either side, but I can tell you anecdotally speaking to commanders here, soldiers on the ground, I've been here on this rotation for about five weeks. A lot of it here close to the front lines -- they are very, very high, too. The Ukrainians are suffering, they are bleeding, and they are taking a serious pounding from the edge that the Russians have, if not now, with NATO in terms of sophistication and volume when it comes to artillery. Today, we were out with a medical group about two miles from the nearest Russian lines. There were howitzers firing, Ukrainian howitzers firing over our heads as a medical team stood by to take what was a steady flow of wounded from the battlefront as the Ukrainian wounded. We saw five body bags of Ukrainian soldiers who have been killed. And the casualties are mounting on both sides to be sure. But the Ukrainians are not getting away Scott free, Kate. And that is why they underline as we go into the one-year anniversary of the beginning of Putin's invasion of this country, why they are continuing to beg the international community for those weapons that they believe will give them a strategic edge. In particular, jets, in particular, surface to air missiles to protect the air space and long-range artillery -- Kate.",

He just said they were voluntarily suspending from it. So even when he tries to strike out in that fashion with that sort of propaganda weaponry, he's only got really half a hand to play. He knows that it's actually in Russia's best interest to have a treaty like that. So he's only suspended it. So this is more the war of words that we're used to from the Kremlin.",

He understands what the red lines are there. But the fact that he has taken it upon himself to have his own private army and to be able to criticize that directly at that level is really interesting.

If Vladimir Putin, an autocrat, is allowed to redraw the lines of a country by force, no country is safe from this kind of attack.

But I don't think that's likely. I think they're going to continue to complain about it, make misrepresentations about what's at stake here. I think it's very important for all of us Republicans and Democrats in both chambers to remind the American people of what is at stake. The Chinese are watching to see the resolve of the U.S. and our European allies. The rest of the world is watching. And it's critical that Ukraine win this fight that we beat back and assist them in beating back an attempt to take part of their country by force. [19:20:00] If that happens, no country in Europe is safe. No democracies around the world are safe. So, this is -- this is not just the fight for the Ukrainian people. It's a fight for all of us who care about democracy, the rule of law, territorial integrity of countries. And I think everyone understands that it's going to be a long fight, it's going to be an expensive fight. But the cost of not supporting them in their victory will be much higher.

And to be clear, she didn't say she didn't say the things that others reported she said. She simply said she didn't recall. For example, when she reported, testified very specifically about the conversation that she witnessed between her father and the vice president on the morning of January 6th, that was a phone conversation, but she was in the room, when her father was talking to the vice president.She said it was pretty heated. She didn't recall exact words. She went and told her Chief of Staff, according to her Chief of Staff that the president used the P word when describing the vice president and she, the Chief of Staff indicated that Ivanka was very upset, visibly shaken, I think it was her testimony. So, there are additional words, there's additional color and context that other witnesses provided that if Ms. Trump is to come forward would be potentially useful. Because again, Kate, the crucial inquiry is the president's state of mind about on the days before January 6th, his understanding of the election loss and the lies that he was putting forth about election fraud. And then what he did or didn't do over the course of the day on the 6th. BOLDUAN: Right. And so, given this move by Jack Smith, the special counsel, what does it suggest to you about where Jack Smith is in his investigation, and whether Donald Trump is more or less likely to be indicted at this point? What does this tell you?",

So yes, unless there's information inconsistent, which I don't expect, I think there will likely be indictments, both in Georgia and at the federal level. The Georgia case very specifically is about the president's effort to generate these fake electors, even after Georgia's election had been certified and the electors had been put forth, Biden electors because Biden won Georgia.There's evidence that the president was involved in trying to get these fake electors submitted to Washington. And there's that very famous, that infamous call with Brad Raffensperger, where he says we just need to find 11,400 votes or whatever it is, right direct pressure on a sitting official to take action without basis or fact.

Probably not. DeSantis, I think has room to grow.
