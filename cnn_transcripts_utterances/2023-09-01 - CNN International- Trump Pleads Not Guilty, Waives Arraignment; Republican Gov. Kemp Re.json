We won't see him on camera there as many had expected.And now it's a question of what happens next for Donald Trump's case? His attorney has moved to sever his case from other do-defendants, saying well, there are some who want to move ahead speedily with this trial and move ahead to trial in October of 2023. Donald Trump is not one of them. His attorney say there's no way he's going to be ready for trial by then. It's also possible we could see Donald Trump's team try to move this into federal court. They have not made that attempt yet, but others involved in this case have. Trump's team may be waiting to see how his other do-defendants fair in their arguments before they make their play to move Trump's case to federal court. Sara Murray, CNN Washington.
