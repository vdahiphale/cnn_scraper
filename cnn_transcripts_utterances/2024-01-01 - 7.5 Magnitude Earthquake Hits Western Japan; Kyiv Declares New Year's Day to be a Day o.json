I'm Max Foster.We're beginning with breaking news, a powerful 7.5 magnitude earthquake hitting Western Japan and a tsunami warning being issued. It struck around 4:00 P.M. Local time. A series of strong aftershocks have already been recorded as well, so not just one tremor. Japan's prime minister urging residents in tsunami areas to evacuate as soon as possible and get to higher ground. The U.S. Geological Survey and the Japan Meteorological Agency say the original quake had a depth of ten kilometers, or six miles, which has a huge impact on how powerful the aftershocks are. CNN's Hanako Montgomery joins us live from Tokyo. Thank you for joining us. First of all, I just want to ask you about the tsunamis because we're getting reports that they have actually hit the coastline.",

But a major tsunami warning has been issued and we could potentially see tsunamis measuring up to five meters in the city of Noto, in Ishikawa Prefecture. We also know that the entire Japan Sea Coast, which is the western coast of the country, has seen tsunami warnings issued.Just for context, the 2011 Japan earthquake and subsequent tsunami, natural disasters that killed 22,000 people saw tsunamis with 30-foot waves. For this earthquake that happened on New Year's Day, we're already seeing aftershocks, several aftershocks. So far, no nuclear abnormalities have happened at any of the nuclear plants in the quake area, but the Japan prime minister has urged the public to be careful of powerful earthquakes and flee as soon as possible from areas with tsunami warnings. They said they're working on helping evacuate people. And the Prime Minister Fumio Kishida said he has no concrete details on damages just yet.",

So, you expect the tsunami waves to be quite small, but they get larger and larger and just more and more dangerous. So, that's why you're seeing people being evacuated from the western coast of Japan, being told to flee to higher ground. They've been told that they can't return home until the warnings have been lifted, and we don't quite know when that will happen yet.Of course, this is a developing story. So, until we have more confirmation as to just how extensive this damage is, people won't be able to return home yet. And just culturally speaking, New Year's Day is a very important day for many families in Japan. Many people spend it at home with their loved ones, with their childhood friends, for instance. And just for the tsunami to happen on this day very specifically is quite alarming to many people in the country.",

Then there was obviously the Ukrainian -- Russia blaming Ukraine for the attack on the border region of Belgorod, attacks on Kharkiv region, which Russia says is in retaliation. And then we have more into the New Year, Ukraine's Air Force saying that pretty much all regions of the country went into New Year's Eve with air alerts. Essentially, they're saying that an unprecedented number of drones, 90 drones, were fired at the country, of which they managed to avert 87. So, that is something of a victory for Ukraine's air defenses.But this is really their worst nightmare because we know that the air defense missiles are dwindling. We know that they've just taken delivery or just been promised their last package of military aid from the U.S until more funding is approved, which is by no means certain at this point. So, the fact that these air assaults are stepping up both with drones and as we saw on Friday, a combination of drones and missiles is really the worst case scenario for Ukraine. Separately, pro-Russian officials are accusing Ukraine of shelling Donetsk, killing four people there, according to the Russian-backed governor of that region. So, violence stepping up on both sides as we head into the New Year, Max.",

President Putin's was just over three and a half minutes long, which is not only much shorter than President Zelenskyy's 20-minute speech, but less than half the length of his speech last year. So, he's pared it back.He didn't once mention the war in Ukraine overtly. He alluded to it. He thanked the servicemen. But it was a sort of, perhaps a way of bringing an element of normality as he heads into an election in March. An election, of course, in name only, it's pretty much already preordained that he's going to win. But President Zelenskyy, by contrast, was really a sort of blow by blow account of Ukraine's successes. He talked about the diplomatic achievements and in particular about the European Union.

The air assault is stepping up, and they're looking pretty vulnerable going into the New Year without any guarantee of further U.S. support.President Putin, by contrast, looking confident, but I think both leaders are trying to essentially exhort their populations, both of them, conflict-weary, to hang on for longer here.",
