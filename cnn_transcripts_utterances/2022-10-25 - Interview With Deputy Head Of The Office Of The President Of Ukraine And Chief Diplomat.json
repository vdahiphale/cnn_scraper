Russia tries, once again, to take a false flag allegation about Ukraine to the United Nations. Without a shred of evidence and despite denials by Kyiv and Washington, Moscow claims that Ukraine plans to use a dirty bomb on its own territory. That is a weapon that combines conventional explosives with radioactive material and could spread nuclear contamination over a large area. Ukraine's foreign minister calls a story a pure Russian lie and says no one should be fooled by it. While the NATO secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, tweets that Russia must not use it as a pretext for escalation. And the U.S. state department spokesman warns the following. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) NED PRICE, U.S. STATE DEPARTMENT SPOKESPERSON:  It would certainly be another example of President Putin's brutality, if he were to use a so- called dirty bomb. There would be consequences for Russia whether it uses a dirty bomb or a nuclear bomb. We've been very clear about that. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

We reached outto the Russian ministry of defense and the Mazyr City Hospital for comment, neither have replied. Next, two weeks before America's pivotal midterm elections, opinion polls are swinging toward Republicans. Democrats saw a surge of reports this summer after the Supreme Court overturned Roe versus Wade. Now, voters say, their key issues are the economy and inflation which seem to be favoring Republican candidates. Now, as former chair of the Democratic National Committee, Tom Perez as a veteran reader a volatile poll, and Scott Jennings is as well. He was adviser to Senate Leader Mitch McConnell. So, gentlemen, welcome to you both. Can I first start with Ukraine? Because both sides seem to be, you know, getting into what might happen in -- you know, after the midterms. So, the Republicans, Kevin McCarthy, himself, the house minority leader, has said that Americans may be sitting in a recession and may not, you know, think a blank check to Ukraine is in their national interests. And as you know, Tom Perez, the Democrats have come under some fire for a letter circulated, and now withdrawn by the progressive caucus that seemed to give 100 percent support to Ukraine but also a call for, you know, proper diplomacy to end the war. So, let me ask you first, Tom Perez, what you make of the Ukraine factor in these elections? TOM PEREZ, FORMER CHAIR, DEMOCRATIC NATIONAL COMMITTEE AND FORMER U.S. LABOR SECRETARY:  I think there is bipartisan support in the United States Congress to support the effort in Ukraine. And one of the things that President Biden, I think, has done remarkably is to bring together the NATO alliance. Look at where they are. They are so strong. And look at where we were at the end of the Trump administration. And so, we're going to continue that show of unity and we're going to continue to work tirelessly to make sure that the people of Ukraine are protected, the NATO alliance continues to be strengthened. And I -- that should be a bipartisan issue. I can't speak for Kevin McCarthy. But I can sure believe that this bipartisan support should continue and will continue.",

And now they're blaming the staff for releasing it and not vetting it. But they clearly want out of this. And so, you do have some people, I think, on the far left, and perhaps on the far, far right, who are questioning America's commitment to this.

And what I think voters are going to be looking for in these midterm elections is who is best situated to address a wide array of issues that are on peoples' minds? Yes, inflations on peoples' minds without a doubt. And that's why President Biden took such decisive action in so many ways. But I'll tell you, 49 years ago, the Supreme Court established a woman's rights to control what she does with her body. And now, the Supreme Court took that away. I've never seen a midterm cycle, Christiane, that is more fluid than this midterms cycle. Admittedly, in a normal cycle, you know, Democrats would be facing remarkable headwinds. And there are some headwinds, without a doubt. But you look at the polling in these races, and it's as fluid as it gets because so many women and so many people across the country, not just women, are aghast at what the Supreme Court did. So many people are aghast at these election deniers that are running. As Senator McConnell said a while back, you know, candidate quality matters. And a big reason why Democrats still have a shot in so many of these races is we're fielding really good candidates who are fighting for the issues that matter most to people.

But on economic anxieties, on inflation, on just idea that when you go to the grocery store, your shocked every time you walk on the door. You can clearly see it in the national polling. Republicans made their bet on inflation and crime. Democrats spent all their money and made their huge bet on abortion. And if you look at the numbers now, abortion is like sixth or seventh on the list of top issues. And inflation and crime and quality of life, that's one, two, and three. Republicans just made a better bet. And I think that's ultimately why, I think, the House is gone for Democrats.

Wade. You know, Kansas, if we had been having a conversation before the Kansas primary there, and I told you what was going to happen in Kansas, you would have wondered if I was living on the same planet. And so, there are a number of issues on voters' minds. And the thing that we have to continue to communicate is Democrats have been fighting for these pocketbook issues. You look at the Childcare Tax Credit, that was brought to us by Democrats. We no longer have it because Republicans opposed it. We were the ones who had been investing in infrastructure. And I'm always mind-boggled when I see Republicans show up at groundbreaking sprint for infrastructure progress or programs that they voted against. And so, yes, we have to make sure we communicate to everyone that we are fighting for those pocketbook issues. That we have been fighting to make sure you are safe. And that we are fighting to protect a woman's right to choose. And look at what's happening in Georgia. When you talk about turnout, record turnout in early voting in Georgia. Black voters are coming out. We're going to exceed the 2020 early vote turnout there if it continues on its pace. So, Democrats are pretty darn motivated to get out there and vote. And that is why we have so many jump ball races. We shouldn't have all these jump all races that we do. But we do because I think Democrats have the upper hand on so many issues. And Donald Trump continues to inject himself into the midterm elections. He wants it to be a referendum on him and that's why so many independent voters and Republican-leaning voters who voted against Donald Trump, he keeps reminding them that he still wants to hang around. And that's why Democrats, I think, have a real shot in the Senate races. We feel better candidates, we're talking about those issues, and I think we can keep the Senate.

And in our owntime, of course, we have a great deal of skepticism, much of it justified about the motives of the American past. How progressive were the progressives actually. And I wanted to try to figure out what was it about anti-slavery politics? For Lincoln, it was consistently anti-slavery. He was not an abolitionist, in the sense that we would want him to be. But he was for limiting the spread of slavery to create, as you know, what they used to call the scorpion state. You know, they wanted -- there'd be a cordon of fire where slavery would be trapped and then ultimately die. That was a radical position in that time. And it wasn't particularly politically potent one actually. Lincoln lost two Senate races in the 1850s. He only got 39 percent when of the popular vote when he ran for president. And -- so, what was it about this principle that he maintained to his own detriment throughout his career? My sense is that it goes back to a theological ethos that his parents were part of. In the turn of the 18th and 19th centuries, they were part of what was called emancipation churches. They were -- it was a Baptist denomination in Kentucky. And so, I think Lincoln, when he said, as he did in 1864, I am naturally anti-slavery. I cannot remember when I did not so think and so feel. I think he was telling the truth. And at some point, when we look at the past, we shouldn't just take that you have done this forever. You can't just take what people said and believe that it's totally representative of their beliefs. But at a certain point, if they say the same thing year after year and they act on it, then you have to take it seriously. And Lincoln believed that slavery was wrong, that liberty was right, that democracy was in peril, and that democracy could not, as he put, it long- endure if we refuse to embrace the principles of the Declaration of Independence.",

He was not someone who confessed conventional Christian creeds. He did not follow a conventional Christian view. What he did have was this ambient sense that there was a right and a truth. And that right and that truth were manifested to the extent to which human beings could actually make the golden rule operative. And that may sound a little co-melodic (ph) or a little ceremony, but it's not. It's what he did. And he connected the two. He connected this idea of love of neighbor, not just to theology but to politics. He said, my ancient faith teaches me that all man are created equal. He said, as I would not be a slave, so I would not be a master. That expresses my idea of democracy. And so, if I respect you and your equality and your dignity, I am therefore more likely to have you respect mine. And if I extend a hand to you when you need it in the morning, you are more likely to extend one to me in the afternoon when I need it. And that is the motive moral force of democracy.",

And he was inconsistent because he did not see that there was a practical way, practical way to create the kind of egalitarian democracy that you and I are blessed to be able to kind of take for granted as an actionable idea. He did not see the integrated 13th and 14th and 15th amendment country all his career. He got there through the crisis of war. He got there, understanding that the verdict of the war meant that slavery had to die, that it couldn't be gradual emancipation, that it couldn't be compensated from the slave owner's emancipation. They had to be immediate, unconditional. It came through the -- what he called the fiery trial. And in doing that, he had to put aside his own views that we would see as racist. And that was a very common -- tragically, are very common dichotomy of views. There were many abolitionists in the United States of America in the 19th century who wear terrible racists. They believed in the political equality of black Americans but not the social or civil equality. And so, to me, one of the reasons to tackle Lincoln was to try to figure out if someone could be so wrong about the social and civil equality of black Americans. So, wrong about that. And saying horrible things that were in fight fact white supremacists. If you could be that person and yet be the person who decided to wager everything on a civil war, who fought for, ran for election on the 13th amendment, what manner of man is it who can be so wrong about something so big and yet also get big things right. And the biographical answer, the historical answer is, what manner of man is that is he's a man. Fallen, frail, and fallible.",

The one controlling anti-slaveryprinciple in the American experience which was that the Congress had the power. This is very important. It's dorky but important. The Congress had the power to regulate the institutions of territories that would become states. They did not have the power, as they saw it under the constitution to do anything directly about slavery in the existing states. And because of the 13th amendment and the drama of that, we sort of put that to the side in our -- in the popular imagination. But Lincoln did not believe that he had the constitutional authority in 1860 and '61 to abolish slavery where it existed. What he firmly believed was that he had the power -- the federal government had the power, to prevent its spread. I believe, this is just me talking. I think it's unclear to me that slavery would have been abolished in the 19th century. Because it would have meant that the federal government had basically said, well, it's not that bad. We will let it go that far. And this question suffused and defined our politics in a way that's -- it's almost hard to recover now. The Douglas-Lincoln debates in the 1850s and the Senate races were about the spread of slavery because that's what the federal government had authority over. And if the federal government, under Lincoln had declared themselves pro-slavery, then it's very hard for me to see how abolition would have unfolded.",

The chairman of the Republican National Committee who was the editor of \"The New York Times\" -- that tells you how long ago this was, comes down to Washington. And Lincoln had just met with Frederick Douglass a couple days before. Henry Raymond was this name. He comes in and he says, if you keep emancipation as a precondition for any settlement of the war -- this is before the fall of Atlanta, this is before Sherman's March to the Sea, you will lose re-election. And Lincoln worked this out. He left some documents where he tried to talk himself into it. How would he present it if he were to compromise on this. But fundamentally, he decided, no. One practical reason was that black men under arms who were a vital part of the war effort at that hour. And he said man do not fight, say for incentive. How could you ask a black man to fight for a union that would not emancipate them. So, that was a very practical thing. But it was this moral sensibility that in the trial of the war, slavery had been defeated. And he was not going to then compromise. And this is what a compromise would have looked like in the same way we were just talking about what 1860, '61 would have looked like, and this is all in the record. If Lincoln had said, all right, we will do peace talks with Richmond. And we'll -- I will lift or limit the force of the emancipation proclamation. And then the new union, the reconstituted union can settle all the issues in a convention of the states. God only knows what they would have done. And I think it's pretty safe to say that it would not have been immediate uncompensated emancipation.",

He was getting alot of reports of attempted assassination, death threats, rumors of war, of people might try to kill him at the inauguration. And he wrote early on that, I think our point of greatest danger is the electoral college vote. Because he's a lawyer, right? So, he knew that that was a critical step in the legal certification. And the votes were held in wooden boxes in the Capital. John Breckenridge who had run against Lincoln and who would become a confederate general and confederate official decided that he had sworn an oath to a constitution. He might not follow that constitution and the fullness of time but his oath at the moment was to that. It's very much like Mike Pence. And Breckenridge -- Henry Dawes of Massachusetts said, he did it like a Roman of old. He did his duty in that moment. They packed the -- the police were in the capital from Baltimore, Philadelphia, and New York. Winfield Scott came down from New York, the commanding general of the army. He said, if anyone tries to interfere with the count, I will blow them through the windows. We were on tenterhooks. And you look -- one of the remarkable things that -- there are sort of two political -- remarkable political things in that era. One is, as we are falling apart, South Carolina seceded, I think on December 20th of 1860. So, in the -- people are following them out, different states. The fact that the transition happened. The fact that the inauguration happened on March 4, 1861. And then the fact that we had an election -- well, three elections, really. We had an 1862 midterm, some auricular (ph) elections in 1863, and then the 1864 election. Even amid the civil war, people were not claiming that elections had been stolen or that there was a big lie that was defining American politics. And that, I think, for our own time, should show us that this is -- our concerns about the future of democracy are not hyperbolic. They're not a notional. Even in the civil war, we had fairly orderly elections. And I think it was an innate obedience to the rule of law that John Breckenridge had, Mike Pence had. And I think that it -- we're all being called on it at this point to accept results if they're full, free and fair even if we don't like them.",
