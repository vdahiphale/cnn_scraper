We're going to get straight to our breaking news this hour. All eyes on Wall Street this morning, the Dow opening more than 1,000 points lower, and the NASDAQ Composite, plunging by more than 6 percent. But U.S. stocks not the only ones that did a nosedive. We can pull this up for you. Japanese stocks suffering their biggest daily point loss. Nikkei Index closing more than 12 percent lower, the tumbling coming as global markets fear, the U.S. could enter an economic slowdown i.e., a recession. And our team is tracking the global markets from all angles. We have Clare Duffy standing by for us. But first let's go to Julia Chatterley who's also live in New York. Julia, Monday morning, news session, same old concerns, talk to us about what seems to be spooking Investors.",

      "sentences": "This is an ugly trading day, wherever you look. And it's not just about the United States. As you pointed out, this is a global story. And there's a number of things going on. And it's not just as it appears to be about the U.S. economy. We've already seen a number of days of a shakedown in some of the biggest supports to financial markets, which is the tech stocks.That's playing into sentiment here. Then, as you mentioned, we had that monster sell-off in the Japanese stock markets overnight, you don't see a sell-off like that, without seeing some carryover into U.S. markets as well. It's summertime, there's a lot of people that simply aren't trading. So, that makes things choppy. And then, of course, come Friday, and we got that weaker jobs or payrolls number, and that really then did raise all those questions about a stronger slowdown in the U.S. economy than people feared. So, this is not just one story. This is a whole load of them all combining. And that's what I think is fueling the fear that we're seeing across all assets in the financial markets today. So now we take a step back. The big question is, where do we go from here? Some part of that on the economics front, as you well know, will depend on more data that we get. And, of course, that then will determine what the Federal Reserve do. The silver lining is, the conversation is gone from the Federal Reserve, whether or not they'll cut interest rates in September to simply how much. Now, if these were just about the data point that we got on Friday? Well, I'd say this was an overreaction in financial markets. The problem that we're facing here is that there's a whole load of other things going on at the same time. But what we did here is, from Austan Goolsbee speaking this morning, and he said, look, if we see problem further, problem in inflation, if we see further deterioration in the economy, if we see financial market instability, and by the way, this isn't that at this stage, then, the Fed will step in to fix it. We can finger point over whether they should have cut rates by a quarter of a percentage point last week, that wouldn't have prevented this. And that's an important point as well. But, we'll certainly be watching to see what they say. And we'll also be watching the data and just continuing to see how the markets move. It's not a pretty day. That's clear.",

And I think it was a very important conversation. I think at this stage, remember, we're still up around 9 percent on the S&amp;P 500 for all the pressure that we've seen in tech stocks, we're still up around 9 percent in the NASDAQ.If the Federal Reserve came in, at this stage, given the data where it is, and I'm not just talking about that jobs number, I'm talking about the manufacturing sector, the services sector, the consumer that we know is spending less, they would create panic by cutting rates before that September meeting. Now, if something changed in terms of financial market volatility, we saw a more significant drop in financial markets. Fine, but there's other things they can do to stabilize, they don't need to cut rates. So, certainly my advice would be, don't do that. I'm sure, we'll hear more from them in the coming days if we see more volatility, but that would create panic. We looked at that September meeting.",

They've been using that to justify tens of billions of dollars of spending in AI investment over the past couple of months.And so, heading into tech earnings season, which happened over the past two weeks, Investors had really high expectations. They were hoping to see some revenue returns from those big AI investments. But that's not what happened. Instead, what we saw was pretty mixed results across the board, in some cases, lower margins, because of those AI investments, in some cases, weak guidance for the current quarter. And it was kind of a record scratch moment for Investors where they went, wait a minute, what are we doing here? When are we going to start making money from this technology? And the answer really is that it's going to take longer than many people thought. Microsoft CFO, for example, saying that they're expecting to see monetization of their AI technology over the next 15 years and beyond. We also saw Meta saying that they're expecting to monetize their AI investments over a longer period of time. And for Investors, that time horizon is uncomfortable. One analyst, Gil Lauria told me last week that a 10 to 15-year return on investment is more like a venture investment than a public company investment. So, I won't be surprised if we start to see these big tech names pull back a bit on that AI spending as they try to reassure investors, especially, amid this broader economic uncertainty, Rahel.",

I think most of these big tech companies are still saying that AI is going to make them money at some point. I think it's just a longer time horizon than many people thought. Andit's going to take still more investments, still more tens of billions of dollars to get the data centers put in the ground, put in place, so that this technology can start to generate real returns, but it's going to take longer than people thought.",

With Nvidia, specifically, as you start to hear these big tech companies, the Meta, the Google, the Microsoft, potentially saying that they're going to pull back on AI spending, about half of what they're spending right now is going largely to Nvidia. It's for those chips that power this artificial intelligence technology. So, if we start to see these big names pull back on that AI spending, that is going to directly impact videos bottom line, Rahel.

I think the first is whether we do start to hear them say they're going to pull back a bit on that AI spending, rain in their spending, while they focus on their core businesses, because when you think of these big tech names, often if we see economic uncertainty, that hurts their core business, the core cloud business, the core advertising businesses that really drive most of these companies' profits.And so, if we start to see economic uncertainty, their customers pulling back on cloud spending, or advertising spending, those big tech names are then going to definitely have to pull back on the AI infrastructure spending while we wait for things to normalize a bit. And so, I think that's the two things I'll be watching, how is -- you know, how is the core business performing? And then, do we start to hear them say they're going to pull back on spending, try to get their margins back in a better place before potentially beginning to spend on AI again, Rahel.",

So, I would be very surprised, you know, given what we know so far. I mean, obviously, things could go in an untoward direction here over the next few days, couple of weeks, they may have to changed course here, but I'd be very surprised if they cut rates before September. SOLOMON: Mark, you've told me once, you've told me twice, but markets go up, markets go down.

And I think, you know, what today's market action, we're not quite there yet. And then, you see lots of these corrections all the time, you know, it happens once every year, two, three.So -- and particularly after a period of very rapid stock price growth, and when valuation, so called valuations, get very high when stocks look really expensive and pricey. And you certainly could make the case that stocks, before all this, looks kind of expensive and pricey, some froth was building in the market. So, you know, I don't know that I'd be at all surprised by this. And for the typical American investor, you and I, as individuals, you know, we're in the market for a long time, five, 10, 15, 20 years.

And all the trend lines here look pretty good.Now, even if the Fed started cutting rates as aggressively I would expect mortgage rates to come in and kind of travel closer to 6 percent over the course of the next few weeks, couple of months. And 6 percent seems to be like a real threshold, and I think appropriately so in people's thinking about mortgage rates. That's a -- that's a rate that's more consistent with some -- with how's it -- reasonably good housing affordability people can afford and start buying homes, and we start to see home sales start to pick up. And I would expect to see that, so you're right. If there is a silver lining in this -- this bit of stock market chaos, it's bringing interest rates down with regard to mortgage rates, in particular, and that's a very positive development.",

We had a little bit of a calm period when that eye, the center of it, came over us. We had those winds relax a little bit until we came to the other side of the storm.This backside of the storm has been non-stop. We have been in incredible gusts, as you can see, and the wind gusts are just pushing the water. This is the Steinhatchee river behind me and it is incredibly aggravated. It's been incredibly rough. Some of it in some parts of the river around here around this marina are coming in limb. All of the docks are empty. They had to get these boats out yesterday before the storm came in. And some locals are telling us that the docks here are new, because they were destroyed last year in Idalia that made landfall just nine miles away from here. So, they were really worried that the progress that they made since last year with Idalia would be ruined just with one storm here, Debby, because we've been watching that storm surge. Storm surge has peaked on the Big Bend around six feet in Cedar Key. Again, with the tide coming up and down, we've been seeing the onslaught of the water here kind of rushing in linen really rocking around some of these docks. And the parts of the metal framing of the top of some of these sheds and stuff, they've been kind of peeling a little bit here, because the winds have been relentless. We've also seen some power lines that are kind of clipped in half. And, you know, again, if you ever see that anywhere, don't touch them, because you don't know if there's liv electricity that's coming out of them. So, it has been intense here today. And we're not done. Debby will continue to move inland, and then, get to a slow crawl and just stop. We're talking a forward speed of three to four miles per hour, you could walk faster than that. And we're looking at prolific historic amounts of rain that will cause catastrophic flooding for parts of the low country of South Georgia and South Carolina. So, we're incredibly worried about that as we go through the week. Even going into the weekend, things might not wrap up until Saturday, maybe even Sunday. So, something to watch very closely. I also want to mention that just before landfall this morning, Debby was able to rapidly intensify again. And that's because we had ocean temperatures here in the Gulf that are in the upper 80s and low 90s that we see this sign and symptom time and time again, the warm ocean is just fueling this intensification. And we're adding that heat to the oceans with climate change. So, that's a trend that we just keep seeing with each of these storms. Beryl did it. And then, Debby was able to do it here this morning. But again, the water here is relentless, the winds are relentless, and people are just needing to hunker down.",

But that is not the retaliation that we are waiting for. What we are waiting for is likely going to be something far more significant with a very likely a direct Iranian attack against Israel and the possibility of it also bringing its proxies in the region into that retaliatory action as well. And that obviously would include Hezbollah, which is just 30 kilometers north of where we are along the Israel-Lebanon border. Now, as all of this is happening, there is certainly a lot of rhetoric coming from Israeli officials, including the Israeli Prime Minister, as you just heard, they're warning that Iran will pay a very heavy price for any action that it takes against Israel. And part of that, obviously, is also intended to try and get Iran to second guess itself to recalculate as it prepares to telegraph a response here and deter, as Iran looks to determine how heavily it will attack Israel, and what the potential consequences of that could be for the region. There is certainly a flurry of diplomatic activity aimed at trying to prevent Iran from carrying out a large-scale attack on Israel to try and de-escalate those tensions. Amid that, the U.S.'s top Middle East General, General Kurilla is in the region, trying to also form up that international coalition that helped Israel carry out that very successful orchestrated air defense suffered back in April, when Iran attacked. And there's no question that there is an effort to put that coalition back together again. Here is the National Security Council Spokesman, Admiral John Kirby, just recently. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And we don't really know -- we haven't gotten any confirmation as to where that -- where she's gone. Now, what's happening itself in Bangladesh right now is that there are scenes of jubilation, there's a lot of celebration, there were these protests that had been ongoing for almost a month now. And even before that, before they became deadly that, over the past month -- for over the past weekend, there had been an Internet shutdown. They had been deadly clashes on Sunday.

Now, there was -- there were accusations of bias that was then dismissed, that quota system was dismissed by the top court of Bangladesh.However, that has -- that had then snowballed into something much larger.

People came out in huge numbers, despite clashes, despite many people dying, many protesters dying, many Police being injured in these protests. Now, what we're going to have to wait and see is, the army chief has said that there will be an integrator -- interim government formed after meeting with the President, as well with -- as well as with all of the stakeholders. However, the army itself has had a questionable past in Bangladesh. It has been in power over many years in Bangladesh's short history since 1971. It was actually in power even back in 2008, after which there were elections, which led to Sheikh Hasina becoming the Prime Minister of Pakistan -- sorry, of Bangladesh. This is a very young country. This has been a movement led by very young people, by young students, and it's going to -- we're going to have to wait and see how this unfolds in Bangladesh at the moment. Rahel?",

They were killed, eight other children seriously injured, a couple of adults in hospital as well. And there was misinformation surrounding that, particularly on X, formerly known as Twitter, suggesting that the suspect was a Muslim and a recent migrant as well. In fact, he's a second generation a Brit, who was born in Wales. Parents originally came to this country from Rwanda. And indeed, it was quite unusual that they lifted the reporting restrictions on that suspect because he was under 18. He is actually due to turn 18 this week. So, there are concerns of further violence there, Rahel. And certainly, the government is saying that they are ready, and they hope that the arrest so far will dissuade people from taking part in more violence.",

That decision must come by Tuesday. But a source tells CNN that, as of this morning, she has not made a decision. When she does, her campaign says that she will make the announce -- the announcement to supporters via an online message.The Vice President spent the weekend interviewing the finalists. And she's expected to choose one of these three men, either the Minnesota Governor Tim Walz; Pennsylvania Governor, Josh Shapiro; or Arizona Senator Mark Kelly. Let's bring in CNN's Edward-Isaac Dovere, who joins me from Washington. So, as we said, by Tuesday, but maybe before then, I mean, when can we get an announcement? And what's the thinking behind each of these candidates? Isaac? EDWARD-ISAAC DOVERE, CNN SENIOR REPORTER: Well, look, we can say that as of right now -- and right now could be different from 10 minutes from now. But as of right now, we are told that Harris has still not made a decision about which candidate to go with. Those three appear to be the ones in most contention. But of course, there's always the possibility to beat somebody else. Of those three, we've got Governor Josh Shapiro from Pennsylvania, who's got a lot of strengths, winning over both Republicans and Democrats in the state, very popular in his key battleground state. He has come under some fire from some people on the left for his criticism of campus protests around Israel, and those who tried to ascribe more responsibility to him than he actually has for the situation to the policy toward Israel. Then there's Tim Walz, the Governor of Minnesota, who has one very popular in his swing state, done a lot of things that have been very popular with Democrats in the last two years. And then, there's Mark Kelly, Senator from Arizona, one, two tough races there, another state that Harris would like to win. He's obviously also an astronaut formerly, and married to Gabby Giffords, the Congresswoman who was shot in 2011.",

One, someone who can maybe help you geographically win the election. That isn't typically play out --doesn't typically play out. But could Josh Shapiro get her a couple of points in Pennsylvania? Could Tim Walz get her a couple of points in Minnesota? And Kelly in Arizona? That's one thing. And all three of them could be helpful there.The other is to double down on a message, right -- to double down that -- of sort of the overall theme of the campaign.

Why -- you know, what benefits there are just picking a certain BB candidate versus another. But I think, for Republicans, it would be hard, especially for the Trump world, for any of these choices that appear to be more moderate. I would say, Mark Kelly is going to be tough for them, because he would pull, I believe, a lot of moderate Republicans, potentially over to that ticket. And I think that Trump has not thus far nor dance has really made much of an effort to reach those moderate voters, especially in the Republican Party. Most recently, posted on Truth Social to purge the party of those who don't support him. That's not the big-tent party that I was described to you. That's not a big-tent party that I belong to. And that's not how you bring voters over. You know, if you're going to focus on policy issues, Republicans are far and away, you know, in a good position there.

He just reverted back to, unfortunately, the 2016 version of Trump where he was very much speaking to only MAGA world, and not talking policy and not talking about ways that Republicans should be capitalizing. I mean, across the board, we know that polls show that Republicans are viewed to be better and stronger on the economy and on safety and security when it comes to the border.
