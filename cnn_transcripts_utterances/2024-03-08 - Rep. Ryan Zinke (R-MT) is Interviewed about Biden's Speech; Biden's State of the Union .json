As a matter of fact, pretty much everything, as far as I recalled that the president mentioned, is something probably 60, 70 percent of Americans or more would support.Now, it's true that he certainly pressed congressional Republicans on, for example, their deeply unpopular proposal to cut taxes for the wealthy and corporations. But while that might be an issue that has strong partisan lines in Congress, out in the country, most Americans, Democrats, independents, and Republicans disagree with congressional Republicans' agenda to cut taxes for the wealthy and agree with the president that it is wrong for billionaires and our biggest corporations to be paying a lower tax rate than firefighter and teachers.",

But I think more broadly what he did when it came to immigration and the border was reminded Congress and Americans that even if there isn't total agreement, even a lot of people who might not agree with our administration's approach, there was bipartisan consensus that most Americans would support and that conservative and Democratic members of Congress supported that is currently being blocked in Congress that would make a difference. Maybe it wouldn't fix everything, but would improve things at the border.And he laid out that if that got to his desk, he would sign something that includes tough compromises that neither side's based might love, but that would make a concrete difference at the southern border. And I think it's the difference between having a problem that you mentioned or invoke or use and having a problem that you actually seek to solve, which is President Biden's approach to the border issue.
