When Democrats are so reticent to underestimate anything that Republicans are doing on the other side, this is one area, the paid voter contact that Elon Musk is working on, where there is serious skepticism. It is really, really expensive. It is not scalable. They do not think that that can replace legitimate voter contact and ground game basically that Democrats feel pretty good about.
