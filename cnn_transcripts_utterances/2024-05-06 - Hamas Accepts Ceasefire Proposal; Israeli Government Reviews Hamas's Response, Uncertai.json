In just a few minutes, we'll hear what the National Security Council spokesperson has to say on this apparent agreement by Hamas, announced by Hamas, that they've accepted this ceasefire proposal. We'll share those remarks with you live as soon as they begin over at the White House. CNN's Jeremy Diamond is joining us live from Jerusalem right now. Jeremy, we know Israel helped craft this potential deal, and a source tells us it was readying an operation in Rafah, a military operation in Rafah, in order in part to pressure Hamas into accepting a deal. Is there any reason to believe Israel will not agree to this proposal that Hamas says it has accepted?",

Today, there have been subsequent meetings between the negotiators in Doha, Qatar, including with the CIA director, the Qatari prime minister. And as we understand it, Hamas's political head, Ismail Haniyeh, then made a phone call to the Qatari prime minister, to the head of Egyptian intelligence, and he informed them of his agreement to this latest proposal. We don't have any word yet on an Israeli delegation heading to Qatar or to Egypt to pursue these negotiations. As we understand it right now, they remain in Israel. They are currently studying this latest response from Hamas, and we are waiting. Any kind of official government reaction here.",

And despite the fact that they don't have those formal diplomatic relations, there have been open lines of communication between the Israeli government officials, namely David Barnea and his Qatari counterparts. The Qatari prime minister, who also serves as the foreign minister, has been the main interlocutor here, as has the CIA director, Bill Burns, and the Egyptian head of intelligence, Kamel Abbas. Those are all of the key players, and certainly they have been traveling to each other over the course of the last several months desperately trying to broker a deal, which hundreds of thousands of people in Gaza have been waiting for, for seven months now as they have faced this war.We have seen images of them celebrating in the streets tonight, although, again, we do not yet have a final agreement between the parties. And then, of course, Wolf, of course, there are the families of the Israeli hostages. We could see 20 to 33 Israeli hostages released in a first phase of this agreement if that framework that we were talking about last week still stands. So, again, enormous promise here for innocent people on both sides of this conflict, but also a lack of certainty at this stage about whether or not this will actually lead to a final agreement.",

      "sentences": "That's right, Wolf. And actually, we've heard from the State Department that the U.S. received Hamas's response within the last hour or so. So what's happening now is that U.S. officials are going through the details of this framework and the response from Hamas before actually responding in any kind of detail. But you're right that the White House press briefing is also set to begin in the next few minutes or so. And that is when we expect to get the first and most fulsome White House reaction to this potentially significant news. You know, U.S. officials, of course, have been pushing really hard for a number of months now for all of the parties to get to some sort of agreement on a temporary ceasefire and a hostages release deal.We saw over the weekend CIA Director Bill Burns was in the region, and he actually ended up staying in Doha longer than initially was expected to try to push on this deal. And as Jeremy mentioned, according to a diplomatic source telling our Becky Anderson, both Bill Burns and the Qatari prime minister played significant roles along with other mediators in really putting the pressure on Hamas to accept this framework. But I do think until we have gotten that official response from the Israelis, noting really a sense of caution here is really important, just given that in the months of reporting on these ongoing negotiations, we have had other moments like this of real optimism, where we appear to be on the brink of a potential deal. And then for whatever reason, that deal has fallen apart. [14:10:09] And in fact, coming out of this weekend, it did appear that we were actually quite far from anything materializing out of the ongoing talks that we saw over the weekend. I just think all of that gives you a sense of how up and down these ongoing negotiations have been. I should also remind our viewers that, of course, President Biden and Prime Minister Netanyahu spoke earlier today. And of course, these ongoing talks was one of the topics that the two leaders discussed, as has been the case for all of their recent phone calls. So again, we'll see what the White House's official response is to this news that Hamas has accepted this latest framework and whether they believe that the Israelis would accept this deal as well, Wolf.",

And as I said, you know, this ongoing negotiation to try to get to a temporary ceasefire and hostages deal, that was one of the issues that was discussed. It also said that the president made clear his views on a Rafah operation. That, of course, is a reference to how much U.S. officials have cautioned their Israeli counterparts in recent weeks that it would be simply unacceptable to this White House and this administration for the Israelis to go ahead with a major incursion when they do not think that the many civilians that are in southern Gaza can be properly protected. They also discussed a number of other topics, including the issue of humanitarian aid. So a number of important topics were discussed. But we know, again, that this framework, this agreement that Hamas appears to have agreed to, this was one of the overarching topics that the two leaders did discuss earlier today, Wolf.",

And it has raised questions about whether Israel is prepared to go ahead with that. Certainly, Hamas has an interest in at least trying to delay that, if not stop that. And that is very much, you know, the possibility. We've seen that discussed, asked about at the State Department briefing, at least. We'll see it as well at the White House briefing.

But in terms of who ran the corporate side of it, it's really just a dozen or so people. Now, there was an important moment that Jeffrey McConaughey testified about this morning. He sent an email at one point to the witness who's taking the stand now, Ms. Tarasoff, where he wrote to her, quote, please pay from the trust post to legal expenses. I'll say that again, post to legal expenses. And that's really the heart of the alleged crime here, that this was actually reimbursement for the Stormy Daniels hush money. But Donald Trump, they argue, artificially said, we're going to call this legal expenses. I think the testimony this morning was effective in providing a building block. Here's how the accounting worked. What's still missing, though, is that direct link to Donald J. Trump.",

What prosecutors appear to have done is lay out their theory with respect to the 2016 election, and noting that the Trump organization and individuals inside were aware of the hysteria about 2016 and how Donald Trump might have behaved in response to it. Today's testimony has set up, number one, that money was moved. Number two, that these were not legal expenses. And that number three, and I think what I think they hope to get to, is that some of these things were directed by the former president. And so this is important testimony. I think it may come across as boring in the sense that it's going to deal with financial records and how money was moved.
