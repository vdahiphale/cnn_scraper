These infiltrations, these would be very, very new. This would really change the situation on the ground for the Israelis, because, typically, when these rockets happen, you know, Israelis try to go about their daily lives, and then when they hear a siren, they run into their bomb shelters. But, if these infiltrations are happening and happening just -- and even happening beyond the sort of area around Gaza, that will change the daily life for the Israelis as well, who are more likely to, you know, stay within their homes at all times. There's already been a directive by the Israeli Home Front Command for people in central and southern Israel to stay close to their shelters, but clearly this is a very tense and very potentially dangerous situation here because the intensity of this I have not seen in my time here.",

Turning to Ukraine, and a village there trying to come to grips with a Russian strike that wiped out about a sixth of its pre-war population. On Friday, a makeshift memorial appearing in the village of Hroza for 52 of its residents killed the day before. Their families, friends and neighbors have begun the somber task of laying them to rest. U.N. Human Rights investigators have now arrived at the scene of the strike, which flattened the building where the victims were gathered. You can see there, the site is being cleaned up, the rubble off to the side, but you can see the building was utterly destroyed. The investigative team came after the organization's coordinator in Ukraine called the attack a war crime. The U.N. Human Rights Office had this to say on Friday. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ELIZABETH THROSSELL, SPOKESPERSON, U.N. OFFICE OF HIGH COMMISSIONER FOR HUMAN RIGHTS: Now, what is clear is that the strike is one of the deadliest since the 24th of February 2022. But, of course, it is far from being the only one. U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, Volker Turk, who saw for himself the horrific impact of such strikes, is profoundly shocked and condemns these killings. The appalling scenes from the village of Hroza in the Kharkiv region of Ukraine underscore once again the terrible price civilians are paying 20 months after Russia's invasion. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

More than 60 pellets have already been extracted, his sister told CNN. Dozens more will have to be removed surgically.Last week, thousands of students like Utham (ph) descended on the streets of Manipur's capital, Imphal, calling for justice after the state government confirmed the deaths of two students who had gone missing in July. Soon, peaceful protests don't violent. Students say security forces use tear gas, rubber bullets and pellet firing shotguns to disperse the crowds. After the violence escalated, we ran towards a house and hid there. Rapid action force personnel came looking for us with flashlights. Defied indiscriminately at us from close proximity, says Utham (ph). Police claim students hurled metal rods and stones at them, and that they simply fought back with tear gas, injuring only a few. But it was more than just a few. Doctors say over a 100 students were hospitalized, sparking further outrage. But the wounds inflicted by these pellets on Manipur's young students are something Dr. Devendra, a general surgeon in Imphal, has never seen before. A senior officer in India's Central Reserve Police Force, who doesn't want to be named, told CNN that forces use tear gas shells and munitions to disperse violent crowds only if the situation calls for it. He refused to confirm the use of pellet firing shotguns on students in Manipur. The use of these shotguns as a means of crowd control has been widely criticized. MEENAKSH GANGULY, ASIA DEPUTY DIRECTOR, HUMAN RIGHTS WATCH.: The U.N. has already said to the Indian authorities that the use of pellet guns is -- causes tremendous harm because of the very nature of this weapon, which is indiscriminate and targets a very white serpent, including bystanders. SUD (voice-over): Loitongbam Kishan Singh (ph) can no longer move his body without assistance. His family says the 17-year-old was shot at point blank with a pellet firing shotgun as he took part in the demonstration. Left with a gaping wound and a shattered shoulder, he so far had 60 of the hundred pellets pulled out. The state's chief minister has been quick to reassure residents in Manipur. NONGTHOMBAM BIREN SINGH, CHIEF MINISTER, MANIPUR (through translator): If the security forces are found using live rounds that can harm students with excessive action, then the government will not tolerate it. SUD (voice-over): But despite the attempts by political authorities to reduce tensions, the wounds inflicted by security forces have only stoked more anger. Vedika Sud, CNN, New Delhi.

This is a place that is, of course, so sensitive to both Jews and Muslims.But what's interesting is that, unlike in previous conflicts where we've seen rockets fired from Gaza, there were no major clashes at Al- Aqsa. There were no major police raids into the compound or into the mosque itself. There have been visits by Jews there during the normal visiting hours, but this is something unprecedented and new. Hamas saying in their statement they fired at least 5,000 rockets towards Israel, and we have also now confirmed something that's been really never seen before, and that is these infiltrations of militants into Israel at the same time as these rockets are being fired. We are seeing reports from communities in southern Israel of militants on the back of pickup trucks firing into towns. We're hearing reports from Israeli media that residents in southern Israel are still reporting as we speak in the last few minutes. Militants firing on the streets of these towns. And Michael, just in the last few minutes, actually, we ourselves, we had to go and seek shelter because sirens went off in Jerusalem. Sirens have not gone off in Jerusalem since 2021 since that major 11- day war between Hamas and militants and Israel, that of course, that was such a major moment in this region. We have not heard sirens like that in Jerusalem for some time, and usually Jerusalem is sort of kept out of these sorts of situations. We heard -- we're getting reports of at least five explosions here. This might have been interceptions in the Jerusalem area. But that -- so we've got sirens under -- we've got rockets towards Jerusalem. We've got rockets across all of Israel. We've got infiltrations on the ground. This is a completely unprecedented situation. We do expect a very major Israeli military response to what this will be.

In a lot of cases worldwide, the decision is made not to launch the rescue assets because of the risk to the rescuer.LU STOUT (voice-over): This is an early prototype for the Guardian, a remotely operated, unmanned rescue vessel with a swift conveyor attached.",

That coupled with the cameras around the vessel and the option for mics allow it to be a two-way scenario. To allow you to talk to those who are being rescued but also get that full environmental sense of the situation.This reduces the need for crew to be put at risk to be launched. It allows the captains to go, you know what, I'm going to launch the Guardian anyway, although I won't put more of my crews' lives at risk to rescue that life. Mayall's Edinburgh based company, Zelim, is working with the U.S. Coast Guard and a number of offshore energy companies to crack the code of saving lives with more speed and less risk.",
