So, at any moment now, there could be a possible indictment involving hush money payments to porn star Stormy Daniels. That, of course, is the case that we're watching in Manhattan because the grand jury will reconvene today. We're told that Trump is preparing himself for that to happen today, but not clear whether he's prepared for this. Sources now say a federal judge overseeing the classified documents probe, this is a different case, the documents found at Mar-a-Lago, has seen compelling evidence now that Donald Trump used his attorney to help further a crime. So, the big question, could that attorney now have to testify.",

We are learning that emails between Stormy Daniels and one of Trump's attorneys and his firm had been turned over to the Manhattan district attorney.

She went back and forth in a number of emails with Tacopina and with his firm essentially answering questions, giving a level of detail that he thought should go under review.So, he turned over these communications to the prosecutors, and now it is in the judge's hand to decide if this is going to amount to any sort of conflict of interest. And if it does, does it require some kind of disqualification for talk or does it require some kind of limitation. Because you have to keep in mind this. Could that information be used in this case and specifically, could it be used potentially against Daniels, if this goes to trial, and there's a cross-examination, could the information that she gave Tacopina and his firm be used against her in some capacity. Now, I will note that Tacopina denies that there is any conflict of interest. He says he never spoke to her, met Stormy Daniels, but I do want to point to one thing. This is on our own air back in 2018. This is an interview with Don Lemon, where Tacopina mentions Stormy Daniels. This is what he said.

That was a lie. There were way more classified documents. And so the question is who in this chain of client, Donald Trump, and then attorneys, including Evan Corcoran, who was the liar? DOJ went to this federal judge and said, we think Trump is the liar and they proved it by what's called a prima facie case, which is Latin for, on its face.

You don't have to have a formal contract, I hereby represent you in order to form that relationship.So the second question is, is it a conflict that we can deal with? And what the court will probably do is say to Donald Trump, Mr. Trump, if he's the defendant, let's assume, your lawyer, Joe Tacopina, used to represent somebody who can now be a witness against you. Are you okay with that? Usually, the defendant will say, yes, he's my lawyer. I want him as my lawyer. I waive it. It's fine. And then what the judge will often do is say, okay, but, Tacopina, you are sealed off. You cannot cross-examine Stormy Daniels, who you had an attorney client relationship with, and you cannot use or disclose any information that she gave you.

      "sentences": "Well, John and Erica, you know, the Fed is walking a dangerous tightrope right. Now, raising interest rates in the middle of the banking crisis risk making the banking crisis worse. But doing nothing here means they could be letting inflation heat back up. I mean, this really is one of the most challenging decisions in Jerome Powell's career and it could really go a long way towards shaping his legacy.Now, Goldman Sachs thinks that the Fed is going to do nothing here, keep interest rates steady, try to survey the damage in the banking industry, and that's what Sheila Bair thinks should happen to. But look at this. Over on Wall Street, investors are actually coalescing around the idea that the Fed is going to raise interest rates. At last check, about 85 percent chance that the Fed raises rates by a quarter of a basis point, just 15 percent chance right now of no rate hike. And given those odds, there is a danger here that if the Fed doesn't act today, if it doesn't raise rates, they could end up kind of spooking Wall Street. A lot of investors would worry that the Fed looks scared and that the Fed maybe knows something that they don't. So, if the Fed raises rates today, that means that rates will be the highest level since 2007 on that chart. You can see that rates are going up rapidly. We haven't seen rates go up this fast and this short amount of time really since the early 1980 under Paul Volcker. So, what does all this mean for everyday Americans? Well, higher borrowing costs. We've already seen mortgage rates go up to nearly the highest level in 20 years. The Fed moves today. They could go higher. Credit cards, it's never been more expense to have a balance on your credit card, auto loans, student loans, all of them getting more expensive. And Powell is also going to face questions today on this banking crisis, how much does he think that the stress in the banking industry is slowing the economy and also how did regulators, including the Fed, missed the red flags before these banks imploded. So, a lot of tough questions today for Fed Chair Jerome Powell.",

Dominion has also asked to be declared the winner. Either scenario is not super likely, but it's possible the judge could rule in some minor things. But what's been really interesting to watch, Erica, is how the judge has greeted some of Fox's arguments in court. And he's been quite skeptical at times. At one point, he called Fox's arguments intellectually dishonest. And another point, he asked Fox, he said, how can you be fair if you are knowingly providing false information?

That's the day that police say James Craig had arsenic delivered to his home. Two days later, his wife, Angela Craig, went into the hospital. She had symptoms like dizziness. She had headaches. She had difficulty focusing her eyes. Those, according to police, are all symptoms of arsenic poisoning.Then you fast forward to later in the month between basically March 9th and March 14th when police say James Craig ordered potassium cyanide, a highly lethal chemical, to his dental practice. Around that same time, Angela Craig was hospitalized for a second time. A few days after she was let out of the hospital, she returned to the hospital again last week. That was the third time she was hospitalized. She was complaining of the same symptoms, you guys. She was complaining of dizziness, headaches. Her body felt sluggish. It was not responding. She had difficulty focusing her eyes. Police say, again, these were all symptoms of poisoning from substances like arsenic. And so the last time that she was admitted to the hospital, that was the third time, she rapidly declined. She went into the hospital. She was put on a ventilator. And soon after that, she was basically declared medically brain dead. That was just last week. And in a matter of days, James Craig was arrested. He is now facing charges for first degree murder, and police were able to bring this case so quickly, they say, basically in this affidavit, because they found volumes of evidence. The search is on his computer. Again, some of these you mentioned, but we'll go through them again, things like undetectable poisons, how many grams of pure arsenic will kill a human, how to make poison, top five undetectable poisons that show no signs of foul play. This overwhelming evidence convinced police to get James Craig off the street. He is now behind bars. He's on no bond. As you mentioned, he's going to be formally charged tomorrow. This is a really shocking case. It's rocked their community, and then further, it's the personal details that make this case just so gut-wrenching. James and Angela Craig were parents to six children. And what is perhaps one of the most piercing details in this affidavit comes basically the very end, John and Erica. Police say that as Angela Craig lay dying in the hospital, James Craig flew another woman to Denver, a woman that he appeared to have an intimate relationship with and he, according to police, had apparently planned to start a new life with her.
