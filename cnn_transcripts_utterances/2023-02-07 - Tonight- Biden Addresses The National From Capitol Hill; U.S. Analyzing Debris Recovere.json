That was just one of more than 125 other aftershocks, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. At least 6,000 buildings in southern Turkey and Northern Syria have completely collapsed.

But seconds later, another lifeless body is found. Monday's devastating quake has left an ever-growing death toll in its thousands, leaving families across Turkey and Syria without homes, and without loved ones.
