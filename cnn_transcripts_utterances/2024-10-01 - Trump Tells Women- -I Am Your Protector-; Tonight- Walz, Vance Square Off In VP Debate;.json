They're in a polarized turbulent time. And I wanted them to see the guys that I lived with, whether that's Lincoln or Teddy Roosevelt, Franklin Roosevelt, LBJ, developing these qualities when they were boys. They don't suddenly become presidents. They're not suddenly on Mount Rushmore. And if they -- I need history -- I want history more in courses. I love history. I think it's so important. It gives us perspective. It gives up hope and solace. So if they can identify when the -- when these guys were young and they didn't know what they were doing and they made mistakes and they acknowledged them, then maybe they can learn how to be leader not just simply on Mount Rushmore but in their classes, in their -- in their athletic endeavors, in their schools so that -- Leadership is such an important thing and what we want is compassion and kindness, and decency.

Now, Dikembe Mutombo, meanwhile, passed away from brain cancer yesterday. And Mutombo one of the best defensive players to ever play the game. He was known for his iconic finger wag after blocking a shot and for his big smile. Now, off the court, Mutombo -- he was just larger than life. He was the NBA's first global ambassador and as NBA Commissioner Adam Silver put it, \"Dikembe poured his heart and soul into helping others.\" Dikembe Mutombo was 58 years old. All right.
