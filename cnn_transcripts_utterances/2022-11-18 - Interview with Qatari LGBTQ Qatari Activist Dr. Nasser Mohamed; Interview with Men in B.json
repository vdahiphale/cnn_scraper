The championship, the first to be held in an Arab country, is clouded by controversy even before the games ever began. First, there have long been allegations of corruption around to the awarding of the World Cup to Qatar by FIFA, football's governing body, with an FBI probe of leaders implicated in a bribery scandal. Then, reports of exploitation of Qatar's migrant workers. Amnesty International links thousands of deaths to extreme heat and unsafe conditions there. And also, protests against other human rights abuses particularly of Qatar's LGBTQ population. Homosexuality is still illegal there. Now, just days before the first game, FIFA announces no alcohol will be sold at the matches, a last-minute U-turn that caught organizers and sponsors off-guard. Here to talk about the contest and the controversies, Dr. Nasser Mohamed. He is a prominent Qatari LGBTQ activist. Welcome to the program, sir. DR. NASSER MOHAMED, QATARI LGBTQ ACTIVIST: Hi.

I came out to my best friend when I was still in Qatar. When I moved to Connecticut to do my residency in 2011, I've been an out person and living in the United States. And I haven't been out as an LGBTQ Qatari till this May when I came out in BBC News because we did not have any public voice. A lot of us live in the shadows. And those of us that leave Qatar where -- that nobody will ever find us. So, this year, it was really important to share our truth and to share all of the abuse that happens to us in the shadows because I felt like the path I had to get out and seek asylum in the United States was being challenged by the false marketing and PR around the World Cup.",

What do you make of the response from FIFA? DR. MOHAMED: You know, I've been trying to get hold of them as, literally, the only publicly out voice -- LGBT voice from Qatar, and they know of me. They're choosing not to engage. And what I want to tell them is that I am not an ideological battle. I'm human, that's different. And I had my challenges where I grew up and I had a lot of economic, social, religious, and political challenges and -- to navigate to be where I am today.

MOHAMED: You know, what I think that's even more awkward is that they have to take that tweet down. Because it just highlights that if you're doing any deals with Qatar, you can come out and criticize Qatar the same time. And it feels, to me, like it's a power move in some ways, right? But at -- it could be power move but at the same time what Qatar is doing right now is that they have this PR filter to the outside world to the extreme conservative views that they have internally.

Hey, everybody's haw dropped, to be honest. It was meant to come to the United States of America. I did a series, a podcast series called \"World Corrupt\" where we interviewed the spokesperson for the Department of Justice, Matthew Miller, who was also there on that day. And he said, what he saw in the 48 hours that he was in Switzerland, he said, was the most corrupt thing I've ever seen in my life. And then, he added, and I came through in New Jersey politics. So, while Tony Soprano will be rolling in his grave to hear that, he is not alone in believing that. Sepp Blatter, who was then the FIFA president, came out last week. And he said, this whole thing was a mistake. And he talked about how the French vote, which ultimately was the swing vote in all of this, was switched after a meeting with Sarkozy, and know, Emir of Qatar, in which the French vote was changed for $15.4 billion worth of French jet plane purchases by Qatar. So, you have the corruption. Qatar not fit for purpose. More than in Connecticut (ph). It's like picking up March Madness and dumping it into Saudi Arabia, it is really the fire festival of World Cups. Lay it out in the human rights abuses of which you've just discussed and the fact that six and a half thousand people, six and a half thousand people were reported by \"The Guardian\" to have lost their lives in getting Qatar World Cup ready and what we have is a World Cup that is truly soaked in blood.",

And they told me that the way they saw it, they were constantly seeing the same image of the same iceberg calving into the ocean, or the same polar bear floating on a piece of ice. And they did not trust that imagery and they also didn't fully understand the way that the science was being communicated. So, I think that it's really a communication problem. And it is hard to understand, I think, for anybody what a degree of temperate change or a foot of sea level rise even means for someone's everyday life or even an inch of sea level change. And so, what I was really trying to do in this work is put a human face, just humanize the issue and so, that we can have stories, because humans are storytelling creatures, right? Stories that are sticky, they'd be able to understand how climate change is impacting people's everyday lives.

      "sentences": "Yes. There are a couple of examples I can give you. So, the U.S. News quite brightly recognizes that debt load really matters for studentswith low-income. So, they are absolutely right about that. And it is admirable that they've tried to helped by measuring it. Unfortunately, the metrics they use are so crude that they end up sending students the wrong signal. So, let me give you couple examples. So, first, loan forgiveness programs are one of the best things the law schools do. They both support public interest and they really help low-income students. So, for example, we have a loan forgiveness program. If a student works at an organization that doesn't pay lot of money, we'll just forgive their loans, zero them out over 10 years. But in calculating debt load, that's not included in the debt load calculation. Just give you another example. If you have a choice in your law school that's worried about your rankings, and you are choosing between a low- income student and somebody who isn't, you'd think, well, if I bring that low-income student in, they are going to have higher needs, higher that needs. And so, it is a risk if I bring that student in because it is going to increase my debt load ranking. Now, you could solve that problem by just talking about how much financial aid do you give to students, but that receives much less weight in the ranking. And then, the last piece of it, I'll just say, is that U.S. News really emphasizes LSATs and GPAs. And LSATs and GPAs are obviously important in evaluating a candidate, but they are not the full measure of a person and, again, particularly for a low-income student who cannot afford to spend thousands of dollars on courses and prep. And so, when you have a student that you know has enormous promise, you want to admit that student and you want to support them. What happens instead with the ranking that U.S. News has created is that, one, people are nervous about taking those students because it might lower their LSAT score. But, two, and far more importantly, and this one is just a killer, all the -- many, many of our peers are using financial aid to bring students with high scores to campus. They are called merit scholarships. And the reason deans are doing them is to keep their rankings up. So, what does that mean? Millions and millions of dollars, millions of millions of dollars are going into the hands of students who may be able to pull -- pay full freight. They may plenty of money to pay tuition but they are getting tuition discounts and merit scholarships. Meanwhile, that is pulling money away from financial aid for the students who need it the most. Now, we have done just the opposite. We have never given out scholarship based on scores. We are entirely needs based. And more importantly, we were the first law school in the country, just last year, to create full tuition scholarships for the many students at our school who come from families below the poverty line. That is something that law schools should feel free to do but the U.S. News rankings make it much harder to do it.",

They are undermining the incentives for the law schools to help exactly those students. And let me just give you the really crucial example it is these scholarships that are designed to pull in high scoring students rather than put money in the hands of the students who need it most. You know, law school deans have every reason, if they want to create those scholarships on their own, they are, of course, welcome to do it and they should. But they are not all doing it for that reason, they are doing it because they feel the pressure of U.S. News rankings. They are afraid to slip. And so, they are taking millions of dollars and putting it in the hands of students who may have the capacity to pay. Whereas the students who really needs that money, the students who come from low-income backgrounds, that is 10 percent, roughly, of our class. 10 percent of our students come from below the poverty line, that is where our financial aid is going.",

There is a connection between what's going on in the rest of the world and what we are suffering through what we are seeing in the backsliding of rights here in this country. These same challenges are facing girls here in the U.S. We've lost tens of thousands of girls in cities because of COVID, and among those numbers are girls who are suffering through God knows what because they are outside of the systems, the-limited systems of support that were already there for them. They don't have access. No one knows where they are in the United States of America. We have lost children. Children are illiterate. Children are living in poverty. Children are being subjected to violence in the United States of America. This is our issue. This is not just a global issue. This is not just a women's issue.
