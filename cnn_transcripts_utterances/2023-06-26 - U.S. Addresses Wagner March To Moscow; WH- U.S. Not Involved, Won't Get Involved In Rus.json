Let's listen in.KARINE JEAN-PIERRE, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY:  Consequential in affirming the basic truth that   every American should have the right to marry the person they love. Ten years ago today, the court's ruling in United States v. Windsor, v. Hollingsworth v. Perry, made significant strides laying the groundwork for marriage equality in our country. They were followed two years later by the Supreme Court's ruling of Obergefell v. Hodges, finally recognizing that LGBTQ-plus Americans have a constitutional right to marry who they love. These monumental cases moved our country forward, and they were made possible because of the core ages, couples, and unrelenting advocates in the LGBTQ-plus community, who fought for these hard-won rights. Last year, President Biden was proud to build on their legacy by signing into law the Respect for Marriage Act, guaranteeing the rights and protections of LGBTQ-plus and inter-racial couples. And he continues to call on Congress to pass the Equality Act to ensure equal rights under the law for all Americans. Our work is not over, but today, we celebrate the progress that has been made, and we recommit ourselves to the work ahead. As you well know this week, the entire Biden-Harris administration is highlighting the work we've done to grow the economy from the middle out and bottom up, not the top-down. The president's economic strategy has powered the strongest recovery of any major economy in the world.",

On Saturday morning, the president convened a call with his top national security aides to discuss the developments and any impacts that instability in Russia could have as we -- as we prepared for a range of scenarios. And the president also convened calls with many of our allies and partners throughout the weekend, and those calls continue. National Security adviser Sullivan, Secretary Blinken, Secretary of Defense Austin also spoke with a number of their counterparts as well. Now as the president noted, it was important that both internally, here inside the administration, and externally, with our allies and partners, including with Ukraine, that we all shared our perspectives on what was going on and we all stayed on the same page. We also make clear to all our allies and partners that the United States was not involved, and would not get involved in these events, and that we view them as internal Russian matters. We delivered that same message to the Russians themselves through appropriate diplomatic channels. I'll emphasize as the president did just a little bit ago, that it's too early to speculate on the impact these events might have, or to reach any definitive conclusions, except one, of course. And that is that, no matter what happens next, we're going to stay closely- coordinated with those allies and partners, and we're going to continue to stand with Ukraine. As we're speaking here right now, Ukrainian forces are still fighting for their country. They're still trying to claw back captured territory. They're still taking and they're still inflicting casualties. So whatever occurred in Russia this past weekend, did not change those facts. It didn't change the facts, for us, it didn't change those facts for Ukraine. And they absolutely are not going to change our continued support. So with that, I have to take a few questions.",

We have heard already tonight from John Kirby, you saw that the White House, but also earlier from the U.S. State Department, and that was from Matthew Miller. Let me just bring you up-to-date what we heard from John Kirby. He said that, \"What we've seen in the past 36 hours in Russia, it was an internal matter.\" And he said, \"The U.S. has -- was not involved and will not get involved.\" This message, he said, has been delivered to Moscow through diplomatic channels. He also went on to say the whatever occurred in Russia did not change what is unfolding in Ukraine. Ukraine very much still fighting, of course, for its own sovereignty. And the importance here is to continue that support, the ally support and the U.S. support. \"We are focused,\" he said, \"on helping Ukraine succeed. We shouldn't get distracted, and we should continue supporting Ukraine.\" He also was peppered with letters. You could hear there were questions about Prigozhin, what does this mean for the Wagner Group as well as Prigozhin in terms of the entity. He wouldn't -- he said it was too soon to see how it played out. He couldn't tell us where exactly Prigozhin was. Similar questions that we've heard also from the U.S. State Department, calling this significant step by Prigozhin, but earned a new thing, they said, to see Mr. Putin's leadership directly challenged. So lots of questions. We've got a panel just to try to get to the bottom of these questions. Our Ben Wedeman's following this story tonight from eastern Ukraine. We're also joined by CNN's Senior Global Affairs Analyst, Bianna Golodryga in New York, and CNN National Security Reporter, Natasha Bertrand. And we heard, really, in those two press conferences, questions over what this means for Ukraine, Ben, what this means, Bianna, for Putin, and really his power, and also questions on intelligence and what this means for the allies. So, first to you, Ben, I mean, many questions about Prigozhin's whereabouts, what this means for the Wagner forces. We have heard from Prigozhin this 11-minute audio file.

So, it's very hard to tell exactly what was going on, what his motivations were. He said that, on July 1st, the Russian Defense Ministry was essentially going to liquidate the Wagner group and that was probably part of his, at least as far as we know, his motivation for engaging in this mutiny of sorts. But the question is, there's so many questions now, where is he? What is his fate going to be? Now on Saturday evening, we heard Dmitry Peskov, the Kremlin spokesman, saying that all charges were dropped against him. And now we're hearing that, no, in fact, he's still under investigation for this mutiny, so his whereabouts, and indeed his very fate, is very much up in the air now. Just coming out of that briefing by Admiral Kirby in the White House, what struck me is what he said. He said that despite what happened over the weekend in Russia, the facts don't change. And here in Ukraine, certainly, the facts haven't changed. The fight goes on. It's extremely difficult. And the Ukrainians are trying as hard as they can to make progress.

As far as the others go, we simply don't know. The Russians are being very, very opaque about the fate of it. And clearly, these are experienced fighters we saw in Bakhmut where they led the fight for 10 months, that these guys, even speaking with Ukrainian troops, that the Wagner mercenaries, many of them are experienced professional soldiers and managed after 10 very long months to take the town of Bakhmut, something the ordinary Russian army could not do, Isa.",

Itwould appear that Russia and the Kremlin, at least, was hoping to make this appear like there was nothing to see here over the weekend and that things were back to normal and that they no longer viewed Yevgeny Prigozhin or his accolades as traitors. Now things' completely taken a 180 once again, and it's clear that more needs to be heard from Vladimir Putin, whether or not this will be a taped announcement, or something that he will be delivering live. I believe it is well past 9:30 in Russia in Moscow time. He is known to be delivering these speeches late in the past. He is a bit of a night owl. But whether he comments on the state of the Wagner Group and whether they continue to hold on to that missive, that as of July 2nd, it will fall under the auspices and control of the Ministry of Defense, that is something that we'll be waiting to hear the whereabouts of Yevgeny Prigozhin. I'm not sure Vladimir Putin will address that. I don't believe that he even mentioned him by name over the weekend. But I also am curious to hear if any announcements are made in terms of leadership changes of the war itself, whether Valery Gerasimov will remain in his position, whether defense minister Shoigu will remain in his position as well. This is a bit of a conundrum that Vladimir Putin finds himself in. I think it's pretty safe to call it an objective view that they have not been conducting this war effectively. That having been said, Vladimir Putin has been known to value loyalty as opposed to any sort of execution of orders. So, we'll see. And if that does change, it will look like perhaps another sign of weakness that Vladimir Putin may be acquiescing to some of Yevgeny Prigozhin's demands.",

He needs to assert a confidence sense of leadership once again. Moscow is in a state of panic on Saturday, and the authorities there imposing desperate Measures that appear to anticipate the successful arrival of the Wagner convoy and the prospects of real serious violence in Russia's capital.

Putin was almost nowhere in that, apart from that short and very unconvincing address that he gave on Saturday, he was absent from the scene, he now needs to try to restore a degree of authority to convey a sense that he once -- he's, once again, in charge. Because all of the chatter now, all of the rumors and the worry and discussions on social media and beyond, are wondering what this means for Russia.
