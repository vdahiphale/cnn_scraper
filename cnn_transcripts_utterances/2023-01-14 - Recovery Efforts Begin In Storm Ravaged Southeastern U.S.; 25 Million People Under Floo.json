The heaviest rain is pushing into portions of Northern California, southwestern Oregon and Central California. You've got some pretty heavy rainfall right just to the northwest of Sacramento. And remember, folks, these people have not had much of a break from the previous system earlier in the week. So, because that ground is fully saturated, now you're adding more rain on top of it. That's why you've got these flood watches in effect, and it includes over 25 million people. So that just kind of goes to show you the scope of how large this next atmospheric river event is.You'll notice throughout the day that it begins to spread from Northern and Central California down into Southern California, which has had at least a couple of days worth of a break from the rain. Now you're going to start to see that moisture surging back into that area. And again, very brief, a very, very brief before the very next event comes in late Sunday and continues into the day Monday. And that one likely to have even more moisture with it than the event that's taking place today. In addition to rain and snow, you also have winds, a lot of wind advisories out here across California, Nevada, as well as Oregon. Those wind gusts up around 50 miles per hour, once you start getting up into the higher elevations, now you're talking 60 to 70 miles per hour winds. So, power outages are still going to be a concern. Same thing with trees coming down. Overall, in terms of rain, most of these areas, especially along the coast, about two to four inches, but some areas could pick up even more. In terms of the Sierra, you're talking feet of snow, likely one to three feet. The thing is, when you factor in that secondary system and you go through the day Monday in total, likely three to six feet of snow. And again, it's not just for the Sierras. You've got winter weather advisories and winter storm warnings spread out over the Intermountain west because that's where that system is going to eventually go in the coming days. So, it's going to take that moisture with it. You're going to notice a lot more of that snow in a few more places. The good news is there is light at the end of the tunnel, Boris and Amara, once we get to the end of the upcoming week, and especially the following week, we finally start to see conditions dry back out in California.",

Moss is a national security lawyer. He's currently a partner at the law office of Mark S. Zaid. Thank you so much for joining us this morning, Bradley. We appreciate your time. You wrote a piece for cnn.com this week. You say, quote, there are millions of clearance holders in the federal bureaucracy, and the default desire to overclassify documents out of excessive abundances of caution means that there's simply too much classified paperwork floating around to properly manage. I guess a counterargument could be that an abundance of caution is necessary with national security secrets, no? BRADLEY P. MOSS, NATIONAL SECURITY LAWYER: Sure. It's always that double edged sword that you have here in the national security arena. You never want to be the person who declassified or reduced the classification level on something that allowed it to leak out, that caused damage to national security. Makes total sense. The problem is, because there are so many individuals who hold clearances, because there is so much that is default classified, it becomes a monstrosity of paperwork to manage. It doesn't mean that there shouldn't be classified information. Of course, there should be. It doesn't mean that properly classified information shouldn't be properly stored and managed. Of course, it should be. But this fact, the fact that not only that the Trump team had their issues and we know how chaotic that West Wing was, but that even the Obama team and President Biden's team apparently had this issue and that there were errant documents stored in places where they should not be stored under any circumstance, speaks to a larger problem about how we manage classified information, how we document and store it and how much, to what extent we are over classifying things. And that speaks, as far as I'm concerned, it doesn't change whether or not things were done wrong here. I don't think President Biden should have ever had those documents where he did. But it speaks to a larger question we need to address of do we need to find a way to reduce this mountain of paperwork that we're trying to oversee? SANCHEZ: You also point out in the piece the millions of people involved in this system. I'm wondering if you think there's a way to perhaps thin that or get a better understanding of who's overseeing where these papers wind up.",

But they need to have a real discussion about whether they need to be legislative reforms, bureaucratic incentives, to truly conclude a truly thin out who requires those clearances, what it wire, you know, how are these criteria being established and implemented in terms of deciding who needs access to classified information in order to do their work, and how improvements can be made, how we can decide if people are maintaining clearances for no other reason, then they always had one.And so, it was decided they should continue to require it as part of their work.
