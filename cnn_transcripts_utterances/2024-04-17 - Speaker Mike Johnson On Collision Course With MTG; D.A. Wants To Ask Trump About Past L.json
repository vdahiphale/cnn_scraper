This is a law actually from 1864 that bans nearly all abortions. And you know, we've been talking about this lot lately because back to 1864 and because it threatens to jail doctors who even dare defy the law, if the law does not get repealed, it could go into effect very soon, as early as summer.OUTFRONT now, the Democratic governor of Arizona, Katie Hobbs. And, Governor, I very much appreciate your time tonight. I mean, this is incredible what's happening in your state, the Republicans who control the state house are blocking efforts to move forward with a vote to repeal the law. So what's the bottom line for you tonight? Do you hope that the law can be repealed (AUDIO GAP) they're not? GOV. KATIE HOBBS (D), ARIZONA: Well, there is absolutely no excuse for their failure on this. In 2022, many of these Republicans voted for Arizona's law that created a 15-week ban, that explicit said this does not repeal the 1864 law. They knew that if Dobbs, the Dobbs decision went the way it did (AUDIO GAP) the law. And they've had years to figure out the consequences of this and figure out a plan of action and now, they're just failing to act. This law is so terrible for women in our state. It will have devastating consequences, which is why I called for them immediately to repeal this. They went to the floor last week. The Democrats were ready to do it. The Republicans blocked it last week, and they blocked it again today. They're only showing up to work once a week right now. So, you know, I guess well see what happens next week when they come back.",

This bitcoin -- the movement of it is simply based on the projections of people, and are they willing to buy, sell, or whatever? So if you are going to put money in bitcoin, I still say this is money that you can afford to lose, because nothing is backing it. Remember, it was at $64,000, at $70,000, or $67,000 a few years ago when all the way down to $17,000, all the way back up. So it goes up and down. So why are you investing in it?

And that is attack is just part of the anxiety out there economic fears. Now, you've got fears of war and all of this contributing to some pretty scary things. I mean, the average 30 year fixed rate mortgage today went to 7.71 percent. I mean, I can remember what was it two or three years ago when it was in the 2s.
