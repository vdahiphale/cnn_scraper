And when you see Israel now, again, fighting against Hamas in areas that they claim to have previously cleared in central Gaza, in northern Gaza, do you agree with that assessment?",

But the emphasis was on holding and building.Israel has a strategy of clearing and then leaving. And that just means that Hamas can reoccupy their positions and Israel -- Israeli troops have to go in and clear them again, which is what exactly what's happening in the northern part of the Strip. So until Israel changes its strategy, no matter how much military force it uses in Gaza, it will not win this conflict.",

The Justice Department notified the company by filing a letter to the judge that's overseeing this 2021 deferred prosecution agreement. And in this, they tell the judge this. They say that this is what they've notified Boeing of. They said, \"For failing to fulfill completely the terms of and obligations under the deferred prosecution agreement, Boeing is subject to prosecution by the United States for any federal criminal violation of which the United States has knowledge.\" So that means that the Justice Department has the option, guys, to go back to all of the previous issues that Boeing has had, and for which they had settled. That, we can put up just a list of some of those issues going back to 2018, that Lion Air crash, 2019, crash over Ethiopian Airlines 737 Max aircraft. The 2021, they had this deferred prosecution agreement. Of course, earlier this year, you had that Alaska Airlines incident with that now infamous video of people sitting there where this door- plug got pulled out. Now the terms of that deal were that Boeing paid $2.5 billion in penalties and they agreed to all of these new restrictions to make sure that their safety programs were up to par. What the Justice Department is saying now is that, clearly, that did not work. Boeing, for its part, by the way, says that they believe they have lived up to that agreement. And so now, we have about 30 days before we see what Boeing has to say in court. And the Justice Department doesn't say exactly what they're going to do. But clearly, this means that they could prosecute the company fully.",

KATE WILLIAMS, CNN ROYAL HISTORIAN: Well, Charles himself seemed rather surprised when we saw him unveiling it this morning at Buckingham Palace. He seemed to stand back in shock. And apparently, he did think it was rather vibrant. But I -- what I think we have here is possibly another royal P.R. disaster on our hands. Because we've seen some royal P.R. disasters this year. And this portrait, it's modern. He's captured Charles' face very well. That's very well done. But the redness, I think, it's caused a lot of criticism. And some other words I've seen from critics and journalists and people online, \"disturbing, sinister, poster for a horror film.\" I mean, it is problematic, I think. And a key question here is that a lot of what I've been seeing a lot of commentary about is, we are in the zone now inn which we're questioning the history of the monarchy, the British Empire, slavery, the monarchy's involvement in slavery. And for some of those whose ancestors suffered in the empire, suffered in slavery -- and I've seen them say, well, it's very apt. We see king surrounded by this red, which really evokes this terrible history of oppression, which we see in the British Empire in slavery. So I do not think this is a success. This is not the modern monarchy that Charles wants to show. I think a different color, blue, green, because we know that Charles likes ecological concerns. Blue, green, it would have been fine. It's just the red. It does -- as that person said, it's a bit like a poster for a horror film.",
