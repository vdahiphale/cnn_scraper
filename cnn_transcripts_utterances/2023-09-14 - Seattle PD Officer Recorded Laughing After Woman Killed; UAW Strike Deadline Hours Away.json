Kate is on assignment today.I'm Sara Sidner with John Berman. This is CNN News Central. All right, midnight tonight, that is the deadline for the Big Three Detroit automakers and the United Auto Workers union to hammer out a new contract deal and avert a strike that could cost the U.S. economy billions of dollars. If they cannot reach agreement, this would be the first ever simultaneous strike of the Big Three legacy automakers, Ford, GM, and Stellantis. The UAW president says the strike will be limited and targeted at first, but then would expand over time. Negotiations will continue until the deadline, but so far they have not gone very well. Pay hikes, job security, pensions and retiree healthcare coverage are all on the table. Dozens of business groups like the Chamber of Commerce are urging the White House to help avoid a walkout. CNN's Vanessa Yurkevich is following all of this from Detroit Motor City. Vanessa, what is at stake? We know it could impact the economy, but it could also have a huge impact on thousands of workers. VANESSA YURKEVICH, CNN BUSINESS &amp; POLITICS CORRESPONDENT: Certainly, this would be historic if the union decides to strike all three automakers at the same time. And UAW President Shawn Fain already laying out his strike plans, a unique strike plan, a targeted strike which would allow for the national union to call on select unions to strike at certain times, certain days, and certain places. The goal on their behalf is to confuse the company and to try to make it harder for them to know where these strikes are happening. It's also important to note that there will be workers still remaining at these plants while some will be on strike. The union also likely knows that just two plant shutdowns at every automaker is essentially like a total shutdown because you're taking one plant out of the supply chain link. Also, they likely know that supply amongst the three automakers is much lower than it was in 2019. I want you to listen to first Shawn Fain, who talks about the state of negotiations. And then Jim Farley, the CEO of Ford, who last night expressed disappointment and frustration with where they're at. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

But it was when he was off camera at a private fundraiser last night, a venue that he typically tends to be a bit more candid on, that he offered his first thoughts on this impeachment.The President decided to draw this link between the Republicans' efforts and a government shutdown at the end of the month, something that McCarthy has been grappling with within his conference as there are deep divisions over how to handle. The President said in that fundraiser, quote, \"Well, I'll tell you what. I don't know quite why, but they just knew they wanted to impeach me. And now, the best I can tell, they want to impeach me because they want to shut down the government\". He added, \"I get up every day, not a joke, not focus on impeachment. I've got a job to do\". Part of that job, President Biden a bit later today, will be delivering a speech as he's trying to draw further contrast with Republicans on economic issues. But it comes as behind the scenes and publicly, his advisers here at the White House have really been crafting this aggressive strategy to push back against the impeachment inquiry. Much of what they're trying to do is avoid having anything sink into the public psyche about the President, as Republicans continue to insist that there was some type of connection or wrongdoing in the President's son's business dealing -- or in the President's son business dealings. But what the White House has repeatedly stressed is that there is no evidence that these House committees have been able to turn up that there was any wrongdoing. And that is part of the messaging strategy that they will be employing going forward. They've been crafting a plan for this, really focusing on a possible impeachment inquiry since July, when McCarthy first floated the idea that this is the route they might be going down. They've assembled about two dozen lawyers, communication aides, legislative staff to craft their response. There's also the campaign who started to fundraise off of this yesterday, but it's been made clear by Republicans this is something they hope that will extend into the 2024 election. But the White House is planning this aggressive pushback as Republicans make these moves.",

Job loss and bias and even some catastrophic type things. And yet Mike and I, along with Senator Heinrich, a Democrat, Senator Young, a Republican, came together. Over 70 senators, Democrats and Republicans came and listened to the experts, both those who had put forward AI platforms and some who didn't like some of the things in those AI platforms.

But the looming and critical question over this hearing today is whether or not they will be joined by the remaining 17 co-defendants.And it was earlier this week that the district attorney, Fani Willis, laid out in writing why she wants to hold all of these 19 together in a massive trial. She said not only if we break up this case will it be an enormous strain on the judicial system here in Fulton County, four months at minimum of a trial. They say that's without jury selection, they would call up to 150 witnesses, some of them they say are victims of intimidation. And separating these cases would, they say, retraumatize some of these victims who would repeatedly have to testify. Last week. we were in court when Judge Scott McAfee, who's presiding over this case, doused some healthy skepticism over whether or not these 19 could go to trial together, saying it would be unlikely that they would all go to trial on this October date. And really adding to this daunting challenge for Fani Willis is that these co-defendants are going in a variety of legal directions here. You have some who are trying to waive their speedy trial. As of this morning, nine have waived their right to a speedy trial. You have some that are trying to move their case from state court to federal court in hopes of getting their charges dismissed. And you have some, like the former president who are trying to get their case quashed altogether. So today, on the surface, it's a pretrial motions hearing to see whether or not Chesebro and Powell will be able to talk to grand jurors, get transcripts from the special purpose grand jury, and whether or not they will be able to get the names of these unindicted co-conspirators listed in the indictment. But what will be decided here today and the potential rulings today could have ramifications for this RICO case as a whole. John?",

And I remember from, you know, my days as a law clerk and frankly, as a prosecutor, the judge can have opinions written on these motions already before he sits down in court.He can then hear the arguments of the attorneys. And if they track with what he'd already written down, he can just issue his ruling right there. And he can do that along the way for every single one of these motions. And, you know, it's as the process plays out, you begin to get a sense of the judge's thinking, you know, how he views evidence, how he views timing and scheduling and all those things, and that'll all just become more clear.",
