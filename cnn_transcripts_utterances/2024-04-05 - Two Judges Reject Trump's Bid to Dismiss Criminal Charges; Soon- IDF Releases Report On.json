Attempts by the former prime president to have two criminal cases thrown out both rejected by the judges. Israel approving measures to increase aid entering Gaza after President Biden's warning to Prime Minister Netanyahu. And counting down to the solar eclipse. What you need to do to get the very best view. (MUSIC)",

First, we are following a developing story out of Israel. The IDF is expected to release the findings of its initial investigation into the Israeli strike on a World Central Kitchen convoy. That strike killed seven aid workers and prompted international outrage, including a stark warning from President Biden to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu about Israel's tactics in Gaza. We'll bring you the latest on that report as soon as it is released. In the meantime, two big legal setbacks for Donald Trump. A judge in Georgia rejecting Trumps claim that his role in attempting to overturn the 2020 election was protected under free speech, writing, quote, the defense has not presented nor is the court able to find any authority that the speech and conduct alleged is protected political speech. The defendants motions based on First Amendment grounds are denied. And in Florida, a Trump-appointed Judge Aileen Cannon ruling against the former president's request to dismiss the classified documents case. She writes the motions denied because, quote, the Presidential Records Act does not provide a pretrial basis to dismiss, end quote. Trump also facing charges in a criminal hush money case in New York that begins later on this month. Joining me now \"Axios\" national politics reporter, Sophia Cai. Sophia, good morning to you. Thanks so much for being here on this Friday. Let's sort of dig in to these two motions here setting a Trump on a course to be facing trial for sure in the New York case. It is much less clear in the Florida case how this is going to go, but there has been increasing pressure on the judge there, Aileen Cannon from special counsel Jack Smith to keep this moving when she hasn't.",

      "sentences": "Yeah. So I mean, the Trump lawyers have this tactic. It's a delay tactic. They have a lot of unusual motions to dismiss. And yesterday was assigned that the judges in both cases have started to move through them. In Georgia, we have the judge saying the motion to dismiss was denied because First Amendment defense doesn't work when it is about speech that is in furtherance of a crime.And in the second case, you have the judge saying, look, this argument about the Presidential Records Act that could be something that it can be brought up by Trump at trial, but not pretrial. And so, you know, you have two losses for Trump on one day and to your point, there could still be a trial in motion before and we don't know if it will be before, but before or after.",

      "sentences": "And I should've been more clear that the cases where we have changes here are the Georgia case and the Florida case, the New York case just happens to be the one that's most likely to go to trial before the election. This is how Donald Trump somewhat predictably has been reacting to this on his platform, Truth Social.He writes: Deranged special counsel Jack Smith, since he has a long record of failure as a prosecutor, including a unanimous decision against him in the Supreme Court. If we could show this, yeah, that will be great. He says, of course, he ties this to Biden by the end. He also notes that Judge Aileen Cannon, he calls her highly respected. He, of course, let's be clear, appointed Aileen Cannon. Meanwhile, he calls Smith a lowlife who is nasty, rude, and condescending. So, this, of course, is pretty par for the course for Trump. Now we should note he is attacking Jack Smith, who there's no current gag order that would prevent anything along those lines. What do you see here in this statement for Trump, obviously politicizing the judge in each of these instances?",

We have this morning about possibly learning more from the Israelis about what happened with the World Central Kitchen attack and the death of those seven aid workers.We have -- we've been talking about yesterday about how the president was personally outrage. We hadn't seen policy changes from the U.S. government. It does seem like he at least convinced Netanyahu to open crossings to allow more humanitarian aid into Gaza. How significant is that?",

Otherwise, there will be consequences.Now, remember yesterday, Biden didn't say what those consequences would be. He just made clear that us policy would be determined on if we saw any kind of immediate action. And that's why you saw a couple hours later at the Israelis that they would be opening that port for humanitarian aid. And that was followed up by another statement by the Biden NSC saying, look, we will see if what will happen with the poor and other immediate actions securing the safety of humanitarian workers. And again reiterating that U.S. policy on the U.S., that Israel Gaza war would be based on whether or not there would be immediate actions.",

On the other hand, you have people like John Kirby and Jake Sullivan basically saying, you know, and others in the national security establishment putting out anonymously like look, our policy hasn't changed.",

I think the opinion of Joe Biden and other family members is something that's very important to him. So that weighs heavily, but even politically domestically, you have a lot of people close to him, people who are concerned about his political feature telling him that there are Americans who were very concerned that what's happening in Palestine.And so, but ultimately, right -- I mean, he likes to say the buck stops with him. People can be telling him all of these other things, but it really is up to him how he handles it and it really begs the question, what would have happened if Biden had been more forceful as he was yesterday and did it have to take U.S. aid workers dying for Biden get to that position.",

I just want to show you, just remind everyone how Jose Andres has been talking about this in an international media. Here's what we heard from him this week. Watch. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And he's very frank and he's been through an utter tragedy.So, certainly, his interviews of really resonated. I think one of the other elements has come out of this is Israeli allies supplying weapons and whether or not they are complicit in a lot of this, because here in the U.K., for example, three former Supreme Court justices and 600 other legal experts have written to the prime minister saying Britain needs to stop supplying arms to Israel because there's a suggestion that this could be seen as genocide under international law. Then, we also had this call being made between Biden and Netanyahu yesterday, where you get the sense that Biden was suggesting that support for the war could be reduced and less Israel changes its strategy. And, of course, the primary former support away from the diplomatic that the U.S. offers Israel is the weaponry. So I think lots of being questioned, the questions being asked and pressure on capitals now about how they are supplying weapons to Israel when instance like this can happen.",

Couple of snow showers in Boston Toronto, even Cleveland there as well. Most of the winter storm warnings have been allowed to expire because they're not going to get that much more snow. But there's already a lot of snow on the ground and we were looking at feet of snow that's already on the ground from yesterday and parts of Maine, New Hampshire, and Vermont, some of these totals have been 24 inches up in some communities in Vermont, 20 inches New Hampshire, Massachusetts eight inches. So it's been pretty snowy start to April up there. You could see the gusty winds could still work their way through New England as we go through the day today, though they should be less than yesterday. All of this is swirling in some colder air behind it. So we're actually also waking up to some fries alerts from Missouri over into Kentucky.",
