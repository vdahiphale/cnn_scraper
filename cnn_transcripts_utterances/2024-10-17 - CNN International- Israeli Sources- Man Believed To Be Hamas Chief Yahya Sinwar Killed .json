I want to get straight to our breaking news this hour. The Israeli military conducting DNA tests right now to determine whether Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar has been killed in Gaza. Israeli sources tell CNN that IDF forces encountered three militants during a routine operation and engaged them. Sources say that after the battle, troops found a body resembling Sinwar. So, if his death is confirmed, it could be a massive blow to Hamas. Israel considers Sinwar the mastermind of the October 7th attacks, and U.S. officials have long considered Sinwar's death as one of the best chances of the Israel-Hamas war coming to an end. We have team coverage for you all hour long. Let's bring in Nada Bashir in London, and Oren Liebermann at the Pentagon. Nada, let me start with you. We got this news a few short hours ago, around 08:30 Eastern Time. It's been a few hours now. What's the very latest that you can share with us?",

      "sentences": "Well, Rahel, we are still waiting for yet more updates from the Israeli military. It could be a matter of hours until they are able to confirm whether this individual killed by the Israeli military, in what is described to have been a routine military operation is, in fact, Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar. We still don't have that confirmed.But as you mentioned, this was not a large scale intelligence operation or intelligence-led operation, but rather Israeli troops taking part in a routine military operation, and after killing what is said to have been three militants, discovering that one of those militants appeared to resemble Yahya Sinwar. They notified Israeli military officials about this, and those tests and clarifications are ongoing as we speak, as we understand it, according to sources in Israel. But, of course, this, as you mentioned, would be a significant blow to Hamas, if indeed it is confirmed to have been Yahya Sinwar, the Hamas leader. But, there are also questions around what this will mean for the course of the war in Gaza, whether perhaps this could be a potential off-ramp, whether this will be an opportunity for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to frame and to paint the killing of Yahya Sinwar as a sort of victory for the Israeli military, perhaps an opportunity to move forward with diplomatic processes, with some sort of negotiated deal to bring an end to the war, to release the hostages, and of course, secure a ceasefire in Gaza. It remains to be seen whether that will be an opportunity that is taken by the Israeli government. We know, of course, that Prime Minister Netanyahu and the Israeli government have continuously reiterated that they intend to cede the war through until their expressed goals are achieved, namely the eradication of Hamas in its entirety. But, we have seen some movement of that, of course. Israeli officials saying that they are open to the idea that, of course, Hamas may live on as an idea where there may still be support for the organization. Of course, controlling the military capabilities is key. And as we understand it, according to U.S. assessments, Hamas' military capabilities have, of sometime now, been downgraded to a point where they are unable to carry out an attack, a massacre, such as you saw on October 7th. And of course, there has been stalling negotiations. Yahya Sinwar been seen as a key sticking point, a hardline figure in comparison to Hamas' former political chief Ismail Haniyeh, who was, of course, assassinated in July. Again, however, regional leaders have accused Israel of putting roadblocks in the progress of these ceasefire negotiations. There are many questions as to how this could impact the course of the war, how this could impact civilians, in particular, who are desperate to see a ceasefire, of course, in Gaza. But, again, no confirmation just yet from officials as to whether this individual identified, who has been killed by the Israeli military is indeed Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar.",

      "sentences": "Look, absolutely, there is a potential here for diplomatic off-ramp, and this is something that diplomats throughout the region and internationally have been looking for. But, it's going to be how much pressure can the United States bring to bear on Prime Minister Netanyahu with whatever it is President Biden wants to achieve here, which is get the hostages home, peace in Gaza, and enter the war in Hezbollah -- with Hezbollah in Lebanon. These are the things that we understand, not to escalate tensions in the region, particularly with the expected strike back of Israel on Iran for Iran's strike two and a half weeks ago. So, all of that.But, I think the question is too, how much pressure is President Biden willing and able to bring to bear? He is putting his sort of last big diplomatic throws, it seems, into Ukraine and Russia right now. If this is the actual death of Sinwar, then the question really becomes for Prime Minister Netanyahu, do you take this as a victory or -- and I think this is where we're at, at the moment. The realistic assessment probably within the cabinet around Prime Minister Netanyahu is that they have had better success against Hezbollah than they might have anticipated, that they have killed a lot of the leadership, that they are demolishing some of Hezbollah's places along the border, places it says are used to fire into Israel. I think, overall, the success in Lebanon at the moment is still on the upside, the positive political upside for Netanyahu, certainly the belief in his cabinet is there is more advantage to be taken of Hezbollah's disarray, that there is no need to let off the pressure on Hamas at the moment, and it's unclear what Israel's real objective is in the north of Gaza. They say they're not going for an idea they debated a couple of weeks ago, which is essentially evacuate all the citizens of north of -- in the north of Gaza, and don't let them back. The humanitarian situation there is dire. So, the indications are to bring it together, that Israel feels that it has the advantage, that it can continue to press, that actually it's not in a hurry to get the hostages back over and above the overarching aims of Netanyahu's very right wing, very nationalist cabinet, and therefore they may not take this as an off-ramp. They may just take it as an opportunity to double down pressure on remaining Hamas leaders, perhaps try and force them more strongly than we've been aware of in negotiations that they absolutely -- we already know the Israeli government says Hamas can be no part of the future, the Palestinian political future, or any future inside of Gaza. So, therefore, what option does Israel leadership have, in its own views, therefore, but to expel all of Hamas leadership, and they would perhaps take the death of Sinwar, if that's what's happened, as an advantage, to double down on that. I think -- look, I think we have to wait for the dust to settle a little bit, but it really does -- I think, at the moment, a lot of the cards are in the hands of the Israeli Prime Minister and potentially of President Biden.",

Nada Bashir, thank you. We will leave it here. I will see you soon. I want to now get some perspective from a retired colonel in the IDF, Miri Eisin. She is a Senior Fellow with the International Institute for Counter-Terrorism. Wonderful to have you today. Thank you so much. I want to start first with the big picture, and actually, I'll get to that. I actually really want to start with what you make of the idea the IDF saying that this was actually a part of a routine sort of patrol or routine operation, and that this may not have been an intelligence sort of led operation. As someone who has served in the Israeli intelligence community, what do you make of that? What's your reaction to that? Just how this went down. MIRI EISIN, ISRAEL DEFENSE FORCES (RET.), &amp; SENIOR FELLOW, INTERNATIONAL INSTITUTE FOR COUNTER-TERRORISM: So, Rahel, first of all, I mean, I'm going to talk about the hostages in a moment, because that's the top issue right now. The IDF has been acting inside the area of the Gaza Strip from October of last year, that's almost a year, the Hamas attack that was masterminded by Yahya Sinwar and his brother Mohammed that you mentioned before, that attack itself that came out of the Gaza Strip, they relied, they, the Hamas, Yahya Sinwar, and all of that terror army on the enormous infrastructure that they built there that allowed mobility. And what the IDF has been doing in the ground forces throughout this time period is that they're trying to sever, to destroy that underground subterranean mobility that was given to them by the tunnels. And in this case, that's something you do systematically, quietly with the regular forces. And that seems to be what happened here, and that's supposed to happen in any place. And I'm not surprised by that. I think that Yahya Sinwar was a man who lived in the shadows, tried very much not to show his face, certainly not in the last year. But, if you allow me for a moment, Rahel, I just want to highlight the 101 hostages. You're talking about grand strategy with Oren. You're talking about it with Nic. All of you are talking, and I'm talking about 101 people who were taken from their homes, from their -- from a party, from the military bases at -- in the morning of October 7th, and we don't know who is there, and Yahya Sinwar masterminded that plan. And so, it's not just an opportunity. It's an opportunity to know what is going on with the hostages. Maybe somebody else will, yes, be able to bring us some answers about them after a year or week.",

No. Listen, it's a fair point, and it bears repeating that at the heart of this that remain in Gaza are those 101 people, and let's turn our attention there, since you bring it up. What does this mean for them, if this was, in fact, the death of Yahya Sinwar, we should say? Netanyahu has said that at this point there were, quote, \"no signs of harm to the hostages in the encounter in question.\" But, what happens to the hostages?",

I'm sure you would agree with that assessment.But, Miri, let me ask, I mean, do you believe, because the question that you're hearing sort of wrestled with and grappled with the last few hours is, strategically, does this give Netanyahu a sort of symbolic victory? Does this create perhaps a bit of an off-ramp to sort of wind down operations there?

I think that it gives not just the Prime Minister himself, because in this case, we have a government which is made up out of different political parties, and we're in this war that we never asked for. We don't want. We don't want to be in it. And I know that everybody wonders in that sense, if the Prime Minister wants the war. I don't think that even this Prime Minister wants the war.And what this allows here is that from the beginning, it was also about Yahya Sinwar, and his death, assuming that he is dead, does give that opportunity, and I call it an opportunity, again, to focus on the 101 hostages, because that's what brings about the end, everything else, in that sense, with what we always say, destroying Hamas. It's about their terror military capabilities. They're not being able to do another October 7th. And for that matter, Hezbollah not being able to do on October 7th, which is what Hezbollah was planning to do up north. So, it allows and opens up that door. But, what I'd like to hear perhaps a bit more is everybody talking about what Hamas and the leadership planned, executed, wanted, that aspect of it, because everybody is talking about pressuring Israel, and nobody is talking about pressuring Hamas, and there is a disconnect there that I find very hard as an Israeli. So, it's an opportunity, but let's talk about pressuring Hamas as well.",

What the hostage families are calling for right now is that the Israeli government used this opportunity to seal a deal and sort of take the win, stop the continuing operations inside Gaza.

They're still out there. They could still step into those shoes.But, from the sort of pride point of view on the Israeli side, Yahya Sinwar was actually released after 20 years in prison by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, in a previous term as Prime Minister, in exchange for the release of an Israeli soldier. So, for Netanyahu, having Sinwar off the battlefield would mean he personally could let some of this go. But, he still is surrounded by a very right-wing cabinet that doesn't want any sort of deal with Hamas.

So, that is why he was in jail for so long. While he was in jail for those two decades plus, he learned fluent Hebrew so well that he could watch all the news outlets. He learned the culture.So, he really understood when he planned the attacks of October 7th, which have been attributed to him exactly when and how to hit the Israelis to inflame their anger, the atrocities that made sure that Israel would do a horrible crackdown on Gaza, which has served Hamas by galvanizing not just the population in the Palestinian world, but across the Arab and Muslim world. Many have forgotten the Palestinian issue because of the wars of Iraq and Afghanistan, and now you've got a group of young people growing up, this new generation of activists, and some counter-terrorism officials I've spoken to have said a new generation who may be plotting future attacks on Israel and the U.S. because they're so angry and heartbroken over what they're seeing happen in Gaza right now.",

Of course, they are still working to confirm whether one of the three militants killed in this apparent Israeli military operation was, in fact, Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar. We don't have that confirmation just yet. We are hearing more details, according to Israeli army. Really, they believe Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar was killed after Israeli tank fire on a house in the early hours of Thursday morning. Again, we don't have those details directly from the Israeli military officials. They are still waiting to confirm whether this was, in fact, Yahya Sinwar.But, there are a lot of questions around what impact this will have, of course, over the course of the war in Gaza, what this will mean for the situation inside the Gaza Strip, and of course, for hostages who are still held captive, whether, potentially, this is an off-ramp for the Israeli government, whether this will be painted or framed as an opportunity for the Israeli government to paint this as a victory perhaps. They have said repeatedly from the outset of the war that they are focused on eradicating Hamas, targeting its officials and leaders wherever they are, whether that's in Gaza or elsewhere, and that is certainly what we have seen over the last year, key Hamas officials assassinated across the board, from Gaza to Lebanon and of course, in Iran. But also, there is questions as to whether they may take this as an opportunity to double down on their military efforts. We have seen the intensification of Israel's military operations in northern Gaza. We've seen Israel carrying out airstrikes and a ground incursion now in Lebanon, with some success, significant blows to Hezbollah, one of Hamas' key allies, of course, and still questions as to whether we will indeed see Israel attacking Iran in response to Iran's missile attacks on October 1st. So, lots of questions as to what this latest development, the potential killing of Yahya Sinwar, if confirmed, will have on the broader situation in the region, and also, closely, of course, on the situation in Gaza. Many, of course, hopeful that potentially this could lead to some sort of movement on the negotiation front. Whether this is the case, it remains to be seen. But, ,certainly that will be something that international leaders will be pressuring for, of course, pushing for, to see some movement on the negotiations for a ceasefire and for hostages to finally be released. Again, we are still getting more details on this. This is a developing story, and of course, it could take hours at least for the Israeli officials to confirm and these DNA tests to confirm whether or not this is, in fact, Yahya Sinwar.",

And for many, they will be hopeful that potentially this could lead to some sort of forward movement on the negotiation front, of course, in terms of Yahya Sinwar and the reaction there. He is a more hardline figure. There are certainly those in Gaza and even outside of Gaza who view Yahya Sinwar as a representative, a symbolic figure representing resistance against Israeli aggression in Gaza and occupation elsewhere. For others, of course, we have been hearing directly from civilians on the ground who have expressed anger and frustration towards Sinwar and Hamas overall, many of whom feel that they have dragged civilians into a war that they had no part in, that they did not want to see.And of course, important to underscore where we are, just over a year since the beginning of the war, more than 42,000 people in Gaza killed. We are seeing a deteriorating humanitarian situation. Still hostages held captive inside the Gaza Strip. So, on the civilian front, there is certainly a huge amount of frustration with Hamas from some. Of course, a huge amount of anger and frustration as well directed towards Israel and the Israeli military, and the Israeli military who has been carrying out this military operation, strikes and ground invasion across the Gaza Strip, as well as, of course, the blockade that has been in force for some time now by the Israeli military, preventing aid from getting in. So, across the border, there are certainly different layers with regard to the reaction that we may see from Palestinians on the ground. But, I think what the overwhelming shared feeling is a desire to see an end to this war, to see a negotiated solution, a political resolution that will ensure peace for civilians in Gaza, who, of course, have to live through this war for over a year now.",

And most recently, the President and the Prime Minister spoke for the first time in more than two months to discuss those potential plans for retaliation against Iran. But, there still is some frustration that is playing out in public between the two sides. Just yesterday, the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of State issued a warning to Israel, saying that if the situation in Gaza did not improve in the next 30 days, there could be new conditions placed on military aid that the U.S. would be providing to Israel. That would be the first time that the U.S. had withheld or at least threatened to withhold any type of weaponry since the U.S. decided to withhold heavy bombs, those 2000-pound bombs, earlier this spring.So, certainly, trying to show Israel that the U.S.'s assistance does not come at all costs, especially if their advice continues to fall on deaf ears.",

      "sentences": "Welcome back. And let's get back to our breaking news.Israeli sources tell CNN that a man believed to be the Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar has been killed in Gaza. Israeli military conducting DNA tests and checking fingerprints right now. The sources say that IDF forces encountered three militants during a routine operation and engaged them, and Israeli Army Radio reports that a tank fired at a house in Gaza early Thursday, and that a drone scanned the area and soldiers recognized Sinwar's face amid the rubble. Now, if his death is confirmed, it would be a massive blow to Hamas. Israel considers Sinwar the mastermind of the October 7th attacks. Right now, U.S. officials are not making any immediate statements about what his death, if confirmed, might mean for the future of the Israel-Hamas war. Let's bring in Nic Robertson, our Diplomatic International Editor. Nic, I think it would be helpful to just sort of take a step back, because this is not happening necessarily in a vacuum. You think about Ismail Haniyeh. You think about Hassan Nasrallah. Just sort of put this in perspective and context for us, if you might.",

      "sentences": "Yeah. When you talk about those two figures, the leader of Hamas that was executed, or rather assassinated in Tehran a few months ago, Hassan Nasrallah who was killed in a massive Israeli bomb strike in Beirut just under a month ago, these were operations that very clearly seemed to have a high degree of intelligence. They knew where Ismail Haniyeh was. They knew the building he was staying in. They knew when he would be there. They knew Hassan Nasrallah was going into the building where he was. They knew when he would be there, and they were able to target it with a massive amount of munition. So, they also knew that he was going to be a long way down underground, and what would have been thought to be a protected space.So, the apparent death of Yahya Sinwar in what's being described as a routine operation that the IDF soldiers came across, these three engaged them and killed them, it sounds in stark difference to the killing of the other two leaders, and raises questions. Look, if Israel did have an intelligence tip off where Yahya Sinwar was, they certainly wouldn't be broadcasting it, because they want to use whoever gave them that intelligence, or how they got the intelligence, they wouldn't want that to leak. They would want to be able to use that to get other Hamas operatives that they're trying to target. So, I think we have to wait until we get a lot more information to be able to piece it all together logically. We have fragments of information, the tank fire that you talked about, the three men being killed. And it doesn't seem particularly common in combat that the IDF is actually getting in close enough to see precisely and taking the time to see who they are killing, if it's in a sort of an average engagement, if you will. There must have been something about this. You would expect that that led the IDF to believe that this was something more important, to put those assets in, to go back and check with a drone to see who it was, who was killed. So, I think there is a lot more to learn about this.",
