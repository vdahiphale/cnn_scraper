Tonight, Israel's Benjamin Netanyahu threatensthat no force in the world will stop his troops entering Rafah, where over a million civilians are sheltering. We'll speak to UNICEF's chief spokesperson who's just returned from the area. Then Arizona Supreme Court reinstates a century-old law banning almost all abortions in the state. What this means for Arizona's women just ahead on the show. And then later this hour, a landmark ruling finds that Switzerland has broken the law for failing to adequately tackle the climate crisis. We'll speak to one of the 2,000 women who brought the case. But first this evening, Gaza is not Gaza anymore. The words of one woman who returned home with neighbors to take the ruin to the ruins of Khan Yunis to discover really apocalyptic scenes. We are now seeing the extent as you can see there, of the destruction after months of fierce fighting as residents trickle back into the city. Entire blocks as you can see, just a wasteland. Israeli forces withdrew on Sunday from what they called Hamas stronghold. And we are seeing similar scenes around Al-Shifa Hospital. That's in Gaza city. Gaza civil defense says nearly 400 bodies have been recovered so far after a two-week siege. Experts from the World Health Organization are on-site trying to help identify the decomposing remains. The IDF says its troops are now regrouping for other missions, including in Rafah, where more than a million Palestinian civilians are sheltering. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says a date has been set to enter Rafah, but won't disclose it, insisting, quote, \"no force in the world\", he says, \"will stop his troops from finishing the job against Hamas.\" The U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken says Israel isn't sharing specifics.

So, no, there's no provisions in these. And why is there no provisions? Because civilians and children have throughout this conflict been second- class citizens at best. If there was a genuine attempt only to target militants and not to have a situation where 1 percent of Gaza's child population has been killed in a historic new low. If there was a real intent to protect children from the militants, then there would of course be tents and showers and bathrooms and hospitals. The first hospital that we will see go in Rafah is the largest standing hospital, and that's directly in the line of fire. Is there a provision being made for other healthcare at a time where children need healthcare more than ever?

We're told there will now be a cross into -- a crossing opened in the north. We were told that on the 21st of February, that hasn't  happened. We're told areas will open in the north, Isa. My great fear, UNICEF, the U.N.'s great fear is that, that crossing will open because an offensive in Rafah will absolutely devastate any opportunity to get aid through there. So, we are at a game of counting trucks. The reality is people in the north are at a level of imminent famine. We've seen children fall into catastrophic hunger at a number that we haven't seen anywhere before. And again, it speaks to intent. We don't have intentionally good effort to get as much aid as we can to those in need. We have the -- we have smoke and mirrors in numbers, and then on the ground, every possible obstruction, speaking to whether UNRWA as the largest U.N. agency in supplying 50 percent of food to the north, hasn't got supplies in to the north since January, or UNICEF supporting only children every time we load a convoy with life-saving medicines or nutritional food, we have to unload that and reload it four times before it gets to those children we serve.",

You mightthink of Colombia for Caribbean sunshine there, leaving a good life on the beach. Well, Bogota is none of that. Normally, in the five years that I've been living here, you would think that Bogota is more akin on an event to November day in Glasgow than to the Caribbean. Well, that is not true today, because you can see that the sun is shining on Bogota, even though, between March and April is the high of the rainy season. And that is exactly like you said, in part due to the El Nino effect. That's why they have both the government and the mayor of Bogota have announced that a coordinated plan that calls for a state of emergency when it comes to water, water will be rational -- rationed across the different municipalities that make up the Colombian capital. In my house, for example, here we're going to be without water, running water for 24 hours, starting the day after tomorrow on Thursday at 8:00 a.m. until Friday at 8:00 a.m. So, a considerable amount of time without water running through the building. And they hope, the authorities hoping that these measure will be -- will make sure that both the reservoir will start to -- growing a little bit in their levels ahead of new rains hopefully coming at the end of April. But right now, El Nino is hitting hard, and it's interesting that the government has even come up with a hashtag on social media, calling it El Nino is not a game. Just to say -- to warn citizens not to underestimate these effect. One last thing that is really crucial for the supply of the Colombian capital where about 11 million people live every day, is that the majority of power here, electricity comes from hydroelectric power dam up in the mountains just behind my back. So, the fact that the reservoir are at a historic low means that further down in the year, it could be that we are also getting some rationing when it comes to power, because of low electricity level in the network. The authorities have so far warned that, that is not coming in the upcoming days, but that may be in the -- in the -- coming in the future. And once again, it's a tail that they don't divide its own tail in a way, Isa, because, well, if you don't have enough power coming from the hydroelectric dams, you're going to burn more fossil fuels in power plants to keep --",

These arethe parents of those four high school students gunned down by Ethan Crumbley, the son of James and Jennifer. But the judge must take them into consideration, and she definitely did. They were all different. You saw Nicole Beausoleil right there, who is the mother of Madisyn Baldwin. She was doing a timeline that, while I was doing this, you were doing that. You were trying to find a gun. I was trying to find my daughter. Other parents had a more broadened message that, your children, take care of them. They are your priority. They are your focus. They are what you need to look at and be concerned about directly to the parents of James and Jennifer. You know, very rarely have I ever seen -- actually first time, a parent talking to a parent. And it's up to the judge in these victim impact statements and begging for mercy before the court, as the defendants did, if they can talk directly to the parents. But they were able to address the parents. So, you had parent to parent right there talking. James Crumbley turned his body around to say, I have never been able to speak before to you, but I am so sorry what you have gone through. Now that was met on deaf ears by many, but it was his first time to really express something to those parents. But the 10 to 15 years is the maximum. This is all the judge could give them, but it is substantial. And the judge said that the advisory guideline of four to seven just was not appropriate in these circumstances. It dictated much, much more.",

They were convicted of homicide, four counts. Saying, you parents, you caused the death of those four students at Oxford High School because you should have known that your child was having mental issues. You purchased a gun for them four days before the shooting, and then he, somehow, got it in his hands, and took it to school and committed the shooting. Now, the sentencing has taken place. Once again, a precedent setting, sentencing for this country. Because now parents have been sentenced as convicted of homicide themselves in a school shooting. 10 to 15 years.",
