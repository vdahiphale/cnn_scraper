      "sentences": "OUTFRONT next, another trial day for Trump. Fulton County's D.A. requesting Trump go on trial March 4th for trying to overturn the 2020 Georgia election, a day that not only clashes with the primary calendar but the rest of Trump's court schedule.Plus, Russia's vicious Wagner Group now claiming it's an educational organization, formerly registering as such. CNN takes you to the outskirts of the Ukrainian village that was just liberated with the possible use of those U.S. cluster munitions. It's an exclusive story that you will see first OUTFRONT tonight. And the suspected Gilgo Beach killer has had a visitor. Who was it? The sheriff in the case is my guest. Let's go OUTFRONT. And good evening. I'm Erin Burnett. OUTFRONT tonight, turning himself in. According to sources, Trump is planning to make his way to the Fulton County jail next week. Just think about the sentence for a moment, a former president showing up at the jail to answer charges. This is where we are. The Fulton County sheriff tells me that Trump will be treated like every other defendant. That would mean a mugshot and fingerprints. We'll see how that plays out. It comes, though, as the Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis now wants Trump arraigned in three weeks which would make it Trump's fourth to remain in the past few months. And if Fani Willis gets her way, Trump will stand trial starting March 4th. And as you can see, that is just one day before the crucial Super Tuesday, one day before Super Tuesday. And as the clock ticks to Trump surrendering early next week, as we're hearing possibly, it is worth pointing out that that the whole situation at the Fulton County jail could be a circus. There are 18 other co-defendants, including Trump's attorney Rudy Giuliani. They all have to surrender by August 25th at noon. And according to the sheriff's office, so far, no one has voluntarily turned themselves in. While Trump's team negotiates the former president's surrender, the question now is whether there will be a fifth indictment. We know Arizona's top prosecutor is ramping up their investigation into Trump and his allies' efforts to overturn that state's 2020 election. And here's what's likely to be a key piece of evidence in that. This picture, this is the Arizona Republican chair Kelli Ward and two other state lawmakers purportedly signing false electoral college documents, declaring Trump the winner of the state's 2020 election. So, we're waiting here the possibility of the fifth indictment. It all comes as we learn new details about the crushing weight of Rudy Giuliani's legal bills, bills that add up to hundreds of thousands of dollars. And today, Giuliani's attorney told a New York court that there's, quote, a lot of bills he's not paying. I think this is very humbling for Mr. Giuliani. Earlier this week, the former mayor said that he is out of cash, forced to sell his New York City apartment in order to make ends meet. In a moment, we're going to speak to someone who worked with former the New York City mayor for a long time and knows him incredibly well. First, though, I want to start with Paula Reid. She's OUTFRONT live in Washington tonight. And, Paula, you have new reporting about what's actually about to happen in Georgia. What do you know?",

Second is, I think the way that we should be thinking about this is the word severance, which I think will be starting to be used a lot in conversations about Georgia. I don't think there will ever be a trial in which they're 19 -- yeah, they will sever, and the judge will use their discretion to break it up into different parts.So then the question is, one of those parts go for that date on March? Maybe it depends on who it is and how small a group is and maybe the facilitators first. And so that's what we might see. It's really thinking about which parts of this could go at a certain point.",

Seventy- five percent opposed to another Biden bid and 69 percent against Trump. This includes 37 percent of Republicans who don't want another Trump campaign. So, who then at this point?Eva McKend is OUTFRONT tonight in Iowa. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) GOV. KIM REYNOLDS (R), IOWA: How many of you love Senator Scott? (CHEERS) EVA MCKEND, CNN NATIONAL POLITICAL REPORTER (voice-over): Everybody is the answer Senator Tim Scott and his campaign are looking for this week in Iowa. Campaigning hand to hand, flip to French fry. But the main political attraction during Scott's visit to the famed state fair on Tuesday was news of front runner Donald Trump's fourth criminal indictment. SEN. TIM SCOTT (R-SC), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Continue to say as I see it, which is that we see the legal system being weaponized against political opponents. That is an American and unacceptable.",

So, in that sense, that benefits Putin because he understands that there is still political concern about some sort of greater war with Russia. So if these guys are on the border with NATO countries, maybe bad accidents can happen. That plays into Putin's hands.
