      "sentences": "Absolutely, Victor. Benefitting here includes adults who have mild to moderate hearing loss. That's the group that will be eligible to receive these over- the-counter hearing aids at scores and online.When you look at the statistics, about 28.8 million adults in the country could benefit from wearing a hearing aid, but not all of them have access or have had the means to afford them. When you look at older adults, 70 and older, fewer than 30 percent who could benefit from wearing hearing aids have ever used them. Adults aged 20 to 69, about 16 percent who could benefit from wearing hearing aides have ever used them. So the goal with these over-the-counter devices is to make them more accessible, more affordable. They'll go from costing thousands of dollars with a prescription to costing more in the hundreds of dollars. And the stores that say they'll have some of these over-the-counter devices include Walgreens, CVS, Walmart, Best Buy, Hy-Vee. So again, this starts today. And like you said, Victor, this is really life-changing for many people. Hearing loss has been associated with poor physical health and even poor mental health. Some people tend to isolate themselves if they do experience hearing loss. Having access to a hearing aid can be beneficial for both physical and mental health.",

      "sentences": "Yes, Erica and Victor, so much for online impulse shopping, right? We have seen H&amp;M, Zara, and a bunch of other retailers start to charge fees for these shipping back of returns.And this is one of those weird consequences of inflation. Because the cost for retailers to accept returns has gone up. Most of this stuff has to go back on trucks. But the cost of fuel has gone up. Carriers, like UPS and FedEx, they're charging more for shipping rates. And the cost of labor, those workers that go through and sort through the returns to make sure they're good quality, that has also gone up. And retailers are also being hit by high inflation, their profits are getting squeezed. This is, of course, going to be a disappointment to people who like to, as Victor said, buy multiple colors, multiple sizes, you return what you don't like. But that does add up. Retailers accepted $100 billion of online returns in 2020. That went up to $218 billion last year. It could be even higher this year. The question is whether or not these shipping return fees annoy customers enough that they end up taking their business elsewhere.",

We're loyal Americans, which is why we prioritize the future of our democracy. This has nothing to do with Israel. Second, Jewish voters don't support Trump because he's threatened our community and our democracy. He's aligned with white supremacists and extremists, which has threatened our security. And, third, American Jews overwhelmingly reject Trump and the Republican Party that he leads because we're loyal to our values. The party under Trump has pursued an agenda that is antithetical to our values, whether on democracy or reproductive rights. And this is why Jews are overwhelming Democrats.

So clearly whether he's an anti-Semite or not, anti-Semites believe he is their ally. We have heard them repeat the same negative stereotypes that he has used about Jews. He's a danger to our community. And the Republican Party that he leads is a danger because he's used extremism to further his political agenda. That has nothing to do with his family.
