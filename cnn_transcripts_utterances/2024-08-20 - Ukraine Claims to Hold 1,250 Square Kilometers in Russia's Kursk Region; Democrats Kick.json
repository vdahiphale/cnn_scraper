Authorities have begun what they call a forced evacuation of children and their parents. They say it's necessary with the city in range of Russia's heavy weapons.Residents are being warned they have two weeks at most to leave the city before Russian troops arrive, with more than 53,000 civilians remaining in Pokrovsk, which Ukraine uses as a military hub. Meanwhile, Ukrainian forces now control more than 1,200 square kilometers in Russia's Kursk region, according to Ukraine's president. Russian officials say they have resettled more than 121,000 residents since the start of the incursion two weeks ago. CNN's Clare Sebastian has been following this. Clare, just talk to us first about how strategically important this city of Pokrovsk actually is.",

      "sentences": "Yes, I mean, it's a small town. It's sort of similar size to Bakhmut, which, of course, the Russians took over last year. But it has been in Russia's sights really since they took Avdiivka back in February. It's about 60 or so kilometers west of that. And it is on a road intersection. It's been used by Ukraine as a military hub, essentially to sort of house forces and equipment.And if the Russians were able to take it, then it would open up the road up to Kramatorsk and Sloviansk, other major military hubs in the east. So it would put the Donetsk region, which Russia still does not fully occupy, at serious risk. It's been a real target for Russia, really, as I said, ever since Avdiivka and even before that. And I think this is where you find the risk of the incursion into Kursk. On the one hand, the Ukrainians have been clear that they intend to try to distract Russian forces by bringing them from other areas, try to ease the pressure on the front lines, but they are also risking doing that to themselves, right? There were concerns around the eastern front when Russia opened a new front in the Kharkiv region back in May. Would this mean that the Ukrainians were still able to defend Pokrovsk and other towns effectively? I think the same questions are being asked now, as the Russians are clearly making progress.",

So, last Thursday, they said 1,150 square kilometers. Now, some five days later, it's just 100 square kilometers more than that.So, obviously, the first few days and the first week when they had that element of surprise were the most effective. I think what we see now, as well as attempts to advance our consolidation, they've been pretty vocal. They want to create a buffer zone, they want to try to prevent the cross-border attacks back into Ukraine, and we continue to see those, right. There was an overnight assault involving missiles and drones, the Air Force saying some of those actually originating in Kursk. So, that is a key aim. But we have heard from Zelenskyy on another really interesting part of this, sort of the public relations side of this incursion, and talking about why this is also about sending a message, in a sense, to the West. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT (through translator): We are now witnessing a significant ideological shift. Namely, the whole naive, illusory concept of so-called red lines regarding Russia, which dominated the assessment of the war by some partners, has crumbled these days somewhere near Sudzha. If partners removed all existing restrictions on the use of weapons on Russian territory, we would not need physical entry, particularly into the Kursk region, to protect our Ukrainian citizens in the border area and destroy Russia's potential for aggression.

He's saying, essentially, that if the U.S. and other Western allies had provided more long-range missiles and had lifted restrictions on using them inside Russia, they wouldn't have needed to go into Kursk with ground troops in the first place. He's also sort of arguing that the fact that they've now invaded Russia and we don't see anything out of the ordinary course of the hostilities and violence of this war in response, that it sort of makes a mockery of Western fears of escalation. Having said that, though, we don't see from the West, and in particular the U.S., U.K. and France, which have provided those long- range missiles, that they are yet ready to lift any kind of restrictions on using them inside Russia.",

Here are some of today's top stories.It's day two of the Democratic National Convention, and tonight we're here from both Michelle and Barack Obama. The former president has made his national debut at the Convention of Boston 20 years ago. At the time, Obama was a state lawmaker from Illinois. Former President Donald Trump tells Reuters he would consider appointing Elon Musk to a cabinet or advisory role if re-elected. Trump also said he'd be open to ending a tax credit for electric vehicle purchases, a move that might anger the Tesla CEO. And a super blue moon lit up the skies around the world on Monday. It's a rare combination of a super moon and a blue moon, and it takes place when the moon is closest to the Earth. Now, despite its name, blue moons don't actually appear blue. This one is making a three- night appearance, so try to catch a glimpse of it if you can. Now as Democrats kicked off their national convention with a message of unity, hope and a new way forward with Kamala Harris at the top of the ticket.

But it was clear that the first night, the beginning of this convention, really was about trying to pay tribute to President Biden. And again, it was very clear that he was moved by those emotions and the signs of support that he could see all around this room, the gratitude that he could feel from those chants of we love Joe and thank you, Joe, that really initially didn't end for a number of minutes. This was clearly a moment that he didn't anticipate even as of a number of weeks ago but culminated in the president dropping out and now delivering a completely different speech than what he would have some weeks ago.

I think we just have to tell the truth to the American people. I mean, our message is really simple, that Donald Trump delivered peace and prosperity. There was peace all over the world. He delivered rising take-home pay for American workers. And Kamala Harris's administration, which is now 1,300 days and running, has delivered higher prices, unaffordable housing and a chaotic situation all over the globe. We just really have to contrast those two visions and those two records of accomplishment. I think if we do that, the American people are going to give Donald Trump another chance. We just have to carry that message for, I guess, about the next 80 days. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Joining me now from Tel Aviv. Alon, thanks so much for joining us.

I don't know if we can show this. Yes, the identities of the individuals during this military raid and military operation overnight.

Alan, we heard from Blinken last night that Israel had agreed to this so-called bridging proposal, although we don't really know many of the details of that proposal yet.

This time it cannot because the conceivable or likely escalation could very well involve the U.S., which means that the U.S. needs to now look deep into their toolkit and find some levers of pressure. Now one of those, going back to your question, your remark, one of those is to stand up and just call everyone's bluff and say, look, this is Israel's fault, this is Hamas' fault, it was Israel's fault here, it was Hamas' fault there, because I honestly don't see where mediation, where more mediation could be helpful, it exhausted its usefulness.",
