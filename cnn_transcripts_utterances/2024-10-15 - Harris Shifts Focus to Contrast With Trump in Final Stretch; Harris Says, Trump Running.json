(END VIDEOTAPE) PHILLIP (on camera):  Good evening. I'm Abby Phillip in New York. Let's get right to what America is talking about. Not like us. Tonight, Kamala Harris sat for a lengthy interview with Charlamagne tha God, and if you want to condense her message to black voters, those three words from Kendrick Lamar pretty much crystallize how she sees the choice that America is facing in just three weeks. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KAMALA HARRIS, U.S. VICE PRESIDENT, DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: His plan includes making it more difficult for working people to get by and to destroy our democracy. You know what he says he'll do? Terminate the Constitution of the United States. The man has told you all these things about his disregard and disrespect for your freedoms and liberty, including the right of a woman to make decisions about her own body. January 6th, Donald Trump incited a violent mob to try and undo the will of the people and undo the results of a free and fair election. And he has said, since then, that there will be a bloodbath after this election. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

But the message, the bigger message was to, I believe, and I'm not a black man, I'll pass that to Bakari at this moment, but she wanted to establish some sort of loyalty, perhaps trust, some connect with black men who feel like she doesn't connect. I also heard -- and, by the way, there's nothing wrong with this. This was the beauty of it. When they started to question the black men, start to ask her questions, they were skeptical.

But he certainly has spoken of black voters a number of times. And his support with black voters is at a -- the largest of any Republican since Richard Nixon in 1960. I think that it's not so much Trump's campaign. This time has not been so much racialized where he speaks only to black voters and only to Hispanic voters or whatever. He's speaking to the youth demographic a lot. Bakari said he only does Fox, but he's on every podcast known to man at this point, every bro podcast, every comedy podcast. He was on with Schultz a couple of days ago. It was a huge, huge audience. So, he does speak to young men, period. It's not so racialized. But I think it's very, very important because younger black voters, if you look at polls, are not as connected to the black church.

It used to be that he would come out, you know, I'm a business guy, I know how these guys work, I'm going to do, you know, good stuff. And now, it's just like, I'm going to do terrorists. Immigration's bad. I'm Donald Trump and I'm going to take out the bad guys. That's his pitch and that was the pitch there. Normally, you'd expect that the presidential candidate sit down with someone, you know, with the gravitas of \"Bloomberg\" and, you know, the interviewer there in that setting and have real policy positions and articulate exactly what he's going to do. But Donald Trump recognizes or at least believes that he doesn't need to do that, that he can just do the same pitch.

That is more than double the previous record set during the pandemic in 2020. That's pretty extraordinary. They're just votes. We don't know anything about them. We don't know where they're from.

Michael McDonald from the University of Florida, who tracks early voting very closely. He has a note of caution that in 2020, it's not exactly apples to apples because in 2020 things weren't exactly working right in Georgia. So, we should take that with a grain of salt.You know, the thing that I think is interesting is this question of enthusiasm and the metric that I looked at earlier this week that I thought really spoke to that well was that in YouGov's polling for CBS News, they actually found that while three in 10 Trump voters say they're voting for Trump because they want to oppose Kamala Harris, only four in 10 Harris voters said they were doing that because they wanted to oppose Trump. And that's different. We had seen previously that it was most Biden voters, for example, both in 2020 and 2024, were doing it because they didn't like Trump. This is actually enthusiasm for Harris, which I think is an interesting indicator for her campaign.",

I mean we were in the middle of a pandemic so people were stuck in their house and so obviously, voting in person was a higher risk. But even still, these numbers are something to watch because just three months ago when Joe Biden was still in the race, Georgia wasn't even a state that people were talking about that was in play.And the question you have to ask is that for so long, people did not want this matchup of Biden and Trump and the enthusiasm level was down. So, is this playing in Harris' favor because the numbers are going up? Is that bump because she's now in the race?",

I mean, you were looking at the numbers today out of places like Richmond County, which is Augusta, Georgia. It's a place where, you know, Joe Biden won by 20 points plus and you had nearly double the number of voters come out and vote early.And so, you can't tell who's voting for what, when, where, how, but you can get a good feel for it. And when you look at places like Georgia, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, Democrats have to feel good about that. When you look in places, and Nevada somewhat, but when you look in places like Arizona and North Carolina, you say Democrats have work to do. But I do have to give a shout out, particularly in Georgia, to somebody like Stacey Abrams, because this didn't happen overnight. Georgia was a deep red state for a long period of time. It was a deep red southern state for a long period of time. Stacey Abrams did the work and now, it's uphill for Republicans because you've had Raphael Warnock. You've had John Ossoff. You've had Raphael Warnock. You've had Raphael Warnock. It feels like he's run every other month. You've had Raphael Warnock and then you had Joe Biden win, as well. And so that bode, listen.
