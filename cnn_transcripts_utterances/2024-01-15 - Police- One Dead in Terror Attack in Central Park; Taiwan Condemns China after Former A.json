      "sentences": "Today, we begin with a significant and chilling milestone. 100 days of a brutal and bloody warbetween Israel and Hamas. It has taken an emotional toll on people near and far from the Israelis, whose family members have been taken hostage by Hamas to the civilians of Gaza who have endured relentless Israeli airstrikes to those impacted by the conflict beyond the borders of Gaza and Israel. Now we've seen rockets being exchanged between Israel and militant group Hezbollah in Lebanon. Since the start of the war, tens of thousands have been displaced on that border with dozens killed including militants, but also civilians, aid workers as well as journalists. And the U.S. and U.K. launching strikes on Houthi fighters in Yemen in an effort to force them to hold them months' long attacks in the Red Sea. That the group says is in response to Israel's offensive in Gaza. The stakes in the Middle East could not be higher and of course the residents of Gaza who have suffered from extreme hardships each passing day causing a conflict that shows no signs of ending any time soon. Now, here is one stark example. Ayman Jamal and his family fled from the north of Gaza to Deir al Balah in the center. This is the inside of the makeshift rickety tent with no ground sheets and gaps on top. Jamal's family is enduring bitter cold as well as rain and he tells CNN, the rain does seem to follow us wherever we went. Children are huddled around small fires struggling to keep warm. One of them says all of us are sick and no one cares. And this is the cool reality facing the vast majority of Gaza's 2 million residents. Israelis also marking the 100th day milestone with rallies to free the hostages more than 130 people taken from Israel on October 7th are still unaccounted for. Hamas has released video of these three hostages while in captivity. CNN can't verify when or where the video was taken and we are not showing it because it is not clear if it was made while they were under duress. Meantime, we are hearing of a pair of deadly attacks in Central Israel. Police say one person was killed and 12 wounded in two car-ramming. Authorities are calling them suspected terror attacks and say two people from the West Bank are in custody and we'll have more on the story as it develops. CNN's Jeremy Diamond is in Tel Aviv, joining us now. Jeremy, great to have you with us, few stories that we follow in here firstly, the deadly attack that we've seen in Israel, take us through what we know right now.",

A 70 year old woman was taken to hospital with injuries and she later died of her injuries. What is also significant about this attack beyond the number of casualties is the fact that this appears to have been carried out by two suspects using two different vehicles ramming into pedestrians in the City of Ra'anana which is just north of where we are here in Tel Aviv. These two suspects according to police officials are from Hebron in the occupied West Bank. They entered Israel illegally according to police and they are both now in police custody. Oftentimes when you see these types of attacks of the suspects are often shot and killed by police. But in this case both of them appear to have been apprehended according to police officials. One of those suspects the police said was apprehended quite quickly. And the second suspect was apprehended a few minutes later so again just a very significant attack that has now taken place in Israel with two suspects now in police custody, 17 people injured one person who was injured taken to hospital later died of her injuries.",

Well, what's really remarkable here and unique about that hostage video is the fact that Hamas for the first time now appears to bekind of teasing out a next step in this video by showing the videos of three of these hostages, including significantly Noa Argamani who's kidnapping by Hamas on October 7th, or kidnapping on October 7th was captured on video is one of the kind of defining images as she was kind of reaching towards her boyfriend who was also being taken captive. She was also believed to perhaps have been taken hostage not by Hamas militants but perhaps by civilians from Gaza who came into Israel on that same day. And so to see her alive in this video, although we don't know when it was filmed is certainly having a significant psychological impact on the Israeli public. But then you add to that the fact that Hamas at the end of this video says you will learn of their fate tomorrow and then they released another video today showing different options for how -- what may have potentially happened to them really makes it seem like some kind of a sick reality show that Hamas is playing here with the Israeli public a continuation of the kind of psychological warfare that we have seen Hamas engage in. And so now the country, the public and most significantly perhaps the relatives of these three hostages are waiting on pins and needles to see what exactly Hamas will announce later today.",

And there does not seem to be an end in sight as of now to the suffering that we are seeing on both sides.When you look at the Israeli Prime Minister's comments over the weekend as we approach that 100 day mark he made very clear that nothing will stop us he said from continuing to prosecute this war in Gaza even as international pressure is mounting even as the death toll is ticking closer to 24,000 people killed inside of Gaza about 70 percent of whom are believed to be women and children according to the Hamas controlled Palestinian Ministry of Health. The Israeli Prime Minister saying that he believes that this war will take many more months and at the same time, of course, efforts underway to try and secure the release of these hostages more than 100 of whom are believed to still be held captive by Hamas. You know this week there will be another milestone as Kfir Bibas the youngest hostage in Hamas custody is set to turn one year old. It will be his first birthday this week. Hamas has claimed that he was killed in an Israeli airstrike. The Israeli military has yet to confirm or deny that. But certainly another very sad milestone about to come up as the families of so many of these hostages including that Bibas family continue to hold on to hope that their loved ones are alive and well and that perhaps one day, they will see freedom, Eleni.",

      "sentences": "Well, we certainly don't expect the Red Sea to calm down, at least not right now. Both the Pentagonand the White House have made clear that they expect a larger and wider Houthi retaliation against a series of strikes that were carried out late Thursday night and then one more of the following day essentially on Friday night. And we have seen some response here you point out that the USS Laboon, a U.S. warship operating in the Red Sea, shut down a missile fire by the Houthis. There was another anti-ship ballistic missile that was launched late last week into the Gulf of Aden, so south of Yemen. But the expectation is that this isn't the end of it. And certainly this isn't the end of the Houthis capability to keep on attacking commercial vessels in the Red Sea in the Gulf of Aden through a waterway that's absolutely critical to international shipping. So the U.S. and other countries that participated with the U.S. not only in the strike but that work with the U.S. as part of operation prosperity guardian are very much expecting there will be some sort of further larger retaliation coming from the Houthis. And then at that point we have to see how this plays out. The whole purpose of this was to try to make sure that shipping companies felt comfortable once again going through the Red Sea and felt safe and secure. If so we haven't seen an indication of any of the world's largest shipping companies announcing that they will once again start using the Red Sea. But that would obviously be the key indication that the U.S. and this effort are moving in that direction. For now it's a question of how this plays out between the U.S. military and the Houthis. The U.K. has indicated and they took part in the original strike that they don't have any plans for additional strikes at this point. At the same time, the Houthis have said any U.S. and U.K. assets are legitimate targets. So if the goal was to calm down the area, we certainly haven't gotten there yet as we wait to see what the Houthis next move is? The U.S. has clearly indicated and signaled that it's preparing for a further Houthi attack.",

And that clearly an offensive action that was the U.S. and the U.K. doing the actual striking, backed up by Australia, Bahrain, the Netherlands, as well as Canada. So you see a much smaller group there. The question is how to get quicker to a state that first enables a more calm Middle East and second allows shipping to go through the Red Sea? So you see that disagreement playing out here. The U.S. however signaling look, we're not done here if the Houthis keep firing on international shipping lanes which so far they have certainly seemed willing to do. I'll also point out that the last intercepted missile on Sunday. So just yesterday was fired at the USS Laboon, a U.S. warship operating in the Red Sea so the Houthis following up on their promise to target American ships.",

And here we are just a matter of days after the Democratic Progressive Party that the Chinese Communist Party openly loads won a historic third consecutive presidential term. President Elect Lai Ching-te, Vice President Elect, Tsai Ing-wen both vilified by the Communist Party in Beijing hated by them certainly no immediate dialogue possible between these two new Taiwanese Leaders and the old guard over in the mainland that definitely didn't want to see them win. Well, now you have an example Taiwan says of that diplomatic isolation playing out in real time because the small Pacific island nation of Nauru announced that it is switching diplomatic ties from Taipei to Beijing. Now, during the last eight years of President Tsai Ing-wen's administration a total of 10 of these small countries have switched their diplomatic alliances. Now, Taiwan only has a dozen remaining formal diplomatic allies left mostly in the Pacific Ocean and Latin America. The reason that these countries switch ties often has a lot to do with economics. Taipei says China can make a bigger offer financially and these countries decided it's in their best interest to switch formal recognition. But what that does is that it leaves Taiwan with fewer and fewer formal diplomatic allies in places like the United Nations, even as they continue to invest in very warm and fruitful friendships with like-minded democracies around the world, including the United States which sent a delegation here to Taipei to congratulate the Democratic Progressive Party leadership. That delegation included the Former National Security Adviser and the Former Deputy Secretary of State here in an unofficial capacity but nonetheless sending a very strong signal to Taiwan, that even though it doesn't have a whole lot of formal diplomatic allies left at the behest of China around the world, they certainly do have a lot of friends.

It has to balance rhetoric with reality.Right now it is dealing with a long list of problems, a long list of issues in addition to this Taiwan question. Right now Beijing is dealing with high youth unemployment, some economic troubles. It's dealing with a leadership shake up, if you will, are among the advisors around President Xi Jinping. It's also enjoying a high moment with the United States as we saw after the APEC Summit these two nations began dialogue once again after a very frosty few months. So China has to be careful not to damage that relationship and also deal with the problems it has at home. So perhaps something big and bold may not necessarily be in the near agenda. But Beijing does have an extensive toolbox as Will was talking about. It has the ability to woo supporters from Taiwan as we saw today with Nauru to China's side. It has a whole military fleet that we have seen conduct drills over the waters near Taiwan. And then there are economic tools that it could use to disrupt some of the economic, the trade relationships that we have seen. So Beijing has to play it careful. So for the future strong statements strong condemnation that may be its method of choice. A key metric or a key point of time that a lot of analysts have told us to look out for Eleni is in the spring this is when the President Elect will be inaugurated. It will be a new administration, a new calendar almost and if China wants to do something perhaps that's the time or perhaps let things settle in before it takes a much larger step. So these are some of the issues that China is currently balancing, Eleni.",
