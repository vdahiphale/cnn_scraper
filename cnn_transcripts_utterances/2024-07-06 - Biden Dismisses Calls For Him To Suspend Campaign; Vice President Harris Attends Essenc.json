So, Arlette, the campaign really wanted this ABC interview to kind of help turn the page, right, to get the focus back on Donald Trump, not on Joe Biden, but even after this interview, you had another House Democrat calling on Joe Biden to step aside. How is the campaign responding to all of this today? ARLETTE SAENZ, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Well, Pamela, the Biden campaign really expressed optimism after this interview as they viewed this as a key step in trying to reassure voters that President Biden is up for a second term in office. But it does not appear that it fully quelled some of the serious doubts within the Democratic Party about President Biden moving forward with this 2024 race. Now, President Biden was defiant in his answers insisting that he is not backing down from the campaign, even as there are questions from some within his own party about whether he should continue. And the president also pushed back on the idea that top Democrats want to see him leave this race. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

She wrote in a statement that it was the president's performance, but also what she viewed as a lack of a forceful response in the days after that led her to this decision. She believes that the president cannot effectively campaign and beat Trump in November.Now, prior to this interview, CNN had learned that Senator Mark Warner was trying to assemble a group of Democratic senators to try to get on the same page relating to the president's candidacy with one source familiar with the situation telling CNN that Warner was close to reaching a point where he believed President Biden also needed to step aside. So we will see whether any of that comes to fruition within the Democratic caucus in the Senate. But there have been these increasing calls from officials within the president's own party for him to step aside, even as he's trying to take these various steps to try to reassure voters.

Look, this is just the latest evidence of how poorly the Biden campaign has handled this thing since the debate.Pamela, I always need to say this at the beginning. The only thing that matters is Donald Trump needs to lose because Donald Trump is a threat to our democracy. Joe Biden has always had one thing and one thing only to prove. He's not too old and he's up to the job. At that debate last week, he didn't -- not only did he not prove that he demonstrated that he is too old. But to your point, Pamela, their behavior in the eight or nine days since the debate, I think has been a bigger fail than the debate. Biden should have gotten out there Friday and Saturday and Sunday and Monday and Tuesday and Wednesday, and to add a two-hour press conference every day. A two-hour unscripted town hall every day. He should have gotten out there this past nine days. And this would have I think quelled this inevitable rush that he's just not capable.",

One of the things that of course we were looking at was the voter turnout and normally, it is the case that if the turnout is fairly low, that the conservatives do quite well, but in this case, the turnout was 50 percent, which is still pretty low, but the moderates managed to take the election and Masoud Pezeshkian, the president-elect, he actually won by quite a significant amount of votes against Saeed Jalili, the conservative contender. Now, Masoud Pezeshkian, during his election campaign and even before that has said that he wants better relations with countries in the region. Of course, right now, the Middle East is in a lot of turmoil, but also better relations with countries in the West. Now in order to achieve that, he of course, has to not only negotiate with the countries of that region and with the West, but also of course, internally as well. As far as foreign policy is concerned, everything that happens needs to be signed off by Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, but also the military in Iran, especially the IRGC, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, is very influential as well. So that could certainly be an uphill battle for Masoud Pezeshkian. Nevertheless, as far as voters are concerned, many had said that they believed the economic situation needs to be improved, and of course, one of the main ways to do that is with better relations with countries around the world and for Iran to try and get some of those crippling sanctions lifted -- Pamela.",

Zelenskyy is never going to accept that. And then a day or two later, he goes to Moscow.This gets attention and you have to say, look at the history of Orban and Ukraine. Orban has tried to make Ukraine make concessions. He stopped any attempt to have any weapons coming through Hungary aid to Ukraine and he has interfered really in Ukraine trying to join the EU. So he is no friend of Ukraine and bringing that up as a peace program or a peace mission, it is not going to go anywhere, but it gives him attention and it curries favor with Vladimir Putin, who is, you'd have to say an ally of Orban.",
