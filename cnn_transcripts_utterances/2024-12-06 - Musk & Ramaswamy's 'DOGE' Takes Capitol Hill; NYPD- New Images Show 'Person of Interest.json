You can't just go in and start firing government employees that aren't political appointees. So, you've got to figure out what means you have for shrinking the size of government. And also, these questions about are you talking about entitlements or defense spending, which are also things that people really care about. But I'll be the first person to agree. Of course, government could work more efficiently. But the fact is, you can't just start cutting government like a business. The law gets in your way. And I think, to pick up on Annie's point, this telework and remote work is an important issue, not just for the government.

We also have a lot of digital trace from the video forensics that NYPD is putting together. This mosaic of video images to track the individual's movement. Yes, it's been 48 hours, but think about what has been done in 48 hours by investigators from the NYPD in actually tracking this individual. We now know that he entered into New York City via a bus almost ten days prior to the attack. So, it's taking a little bit of time. The advantage here from law enforcement is that they know that there's a pathway to violence. And typically, that that pathway starts with a grievance and then goes through violent ideations and attack planning and research before even launching the attack. That is key right now, because we're going to see that mistakes that were made along that pathway of violence actually will lead to additional investigative clues.
