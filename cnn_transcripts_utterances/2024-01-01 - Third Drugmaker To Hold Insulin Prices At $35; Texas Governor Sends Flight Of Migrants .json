      "sentences": "Yes. You know, insulin can cost more than a thousand dollars out of pocket if you don't have insurance coverage or other help.And so the fact that this is getting capped now at $35 from all three major manufacturers should be a big help to everybody who relies on insulin. And now there could be sort of complex ways of getting access to this. You may have to go to the drugmaker's website and get a coupon, but this should become available now starting January 1st. Of course, more than eight million people in the United States rely on insulin to live and about a quarter of those folks, according to the American Diabetes Association, have had to ration their insulin at one point because of its high price. Now insulin is almost the poster child for drug price increases over time. If you think about the list price of the drug, that's the price before insurance coverage or any rebates paid back into the system. If you look at this graph, we've got it shows the price increases on the list prices of two of the major insulins over the past few decades. And actually, something else going into effect today is a reduction of 70 percent or more on those list prices as well, which Brianna and some complexities of the drug pricing system in the United States is actually going to end up saving the drugmaker's money.",

      "sentences": "Yes, exactly. So it all goes into the way Medicaid gets rebates because of drug companies raising the price of drugs over time.And so because insulin prices have gone up so much due to a Biden administration change that goes into effect today, those drug companies would actually have to pay Medicaid for insulins. And so by reducing the list price by 70 percent or even more of these insulins, they're actually estimated to be saving hundreds of millions of dollars per year and avoiding those Medicaid rebates. And so while it's good that these price increases are stopping and in fact the list prices are coming down and there's that $35 cap, there's so much more going on beyond the surface.",

Can you tell us the conditions that these migrants are facing as they arrive in your communities? BYRON SIGCHO-LOPEZ, CHICAGO ALDERMAN: Well, thank you very much for the opportunity. And it's really dire in communities like ours. We had the recent death of a 5-year-old boy, Giancarlo Martinez (PH) because of the many, many conditions and really poor conditions that are set for the new neighbors in our communities. We have -- we have to really congregate as many as in one of our shelters 2,500 people in a matter of weeks, because of the lack of support at the federal level and because of these tactics of human trafficking that are putting a risk to the lives of new neighbors and also the safety of Chicagoans across the city. We've seen these inhumane practices also have caused the life of a 3- year-old girl only months ago in transfers from Texas to Chicago. We've seen the conditions worsening. Because of the tactics that continue to be worsening, now we see Governor Abbott even sending people by plane, which is putting really our community is not only at risk, but it is really putting our whole communities at the brink of collapse. So this is really an urgent call for government to take leadership on the matter as we see it. I really desperately attempt to destabilize and harm our communities, immigrant communities that have suffered so much.",

SIGCHO-LOPEZ: Unfortunately, we have even seen less and less willingness to collaborate, even cutting all lines of communication, even letting us not even notifications when people were arriving. Now, there's sending people in planes. And I think it's hard to have communication with a governor that does not see the immigrant community as human beings. We cannot negotiate for humanity.That is really at stake here. We have, unfortunately, governors like Abbott who do not see us as human beings. On the other hand, we have mayors like Mayor Johnson that has not only stopped, stand up what was right, but even protect our centrist status so that we protect human rights and collaborating safety measures and collaborating with anybody across the country that is willing to put solution for the day.",

I think it's critical that we differentiate policies from the Trump-like era. It is essential and critical that we do that by investing in people, fighting municipalities, all democratic municipalities, capacity of $5 billion. We're also asking for the expansion of the work permits. We just pass a unanimous -- almost unanimous resolution to expand the work permits. We're asking to make sure that we have the same policies that resettle 29,000 Ukrainians in the Chicago land area while many people from the Global South are treated differently. So we are asking also to look at the root causes of a foreign policy that, quite frankly, it is not in line of the needs of our communities on the ground on either side of the border. I welcome also the conversation between the president of Mexico and I hope that this conversation with President Biden happens ASAP. We need collaboration at the border. We need to make sure that we respect international law, that we respect the human rights. And I think that that's what we now have seen. We need investment. We need collaboration. And unfortunately, we don't have a coordinated effort. The coordinated, our local, state and federal government, unfortunately, this point is not existent because of the lack of willingness from governors like Abbott.",

And the top ones include, maybe not surprising, improving health, exercising, spending more time with loved ones, and dieting or eating better. Making a resolution is the easy part, though. How about keeping that resolution? Let's talk about this with Wendy Walsh. She's a psychology professor at Cal State University Channel Islands. All right, Professor. What are your tips for making an achievable resolution that you can keep?",

      "sentences": "Well, the first thing is you need to dump any idea that willpower will succeed. We have an ancient brain that's designed as a reward system for survival. Eating feels good, tastes good. It was good for our survival. Being a couch potato conserved energy.But this survival instinct can also lead to compulsions, bad habits, and addictions. So first of all, dump the willpower thing. Number one, change only one behavior at once. It's too much to say, I'm going to lose weight and stop vaping and save money. But here's the good news. Research says that when you achieve one new goal, it makes it easier to achieve the next one. Secondly, I would say, build in a reward system. Well, first of all, figure out the triggers. What comes before that makes you do that bad habit? You know, a common thing that people who teach people how to quit smoking is they say, well, if you come home and you sit in your favorite chair and you automatically light up, how about rearranging all the furniture in your living room? So you have to stop and be mindful and go, what am I doing? Where am I sitting? And then putting some sneakers by the front door and going for a walk instead might be a good idea. So identify the triggers. Also, make sure you do put in a reward system. You know, quitting vaping is a great example, very difficult. Let's say you're able to go three days, treat yourself to a stress reducing massage. Some people put a little money in their savings account every day that they don't smoke because research shows that the average quitter saves between 2,000 and $4,000 a year. Right?",
