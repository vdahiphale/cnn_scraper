And later, a school shooter's mother on trial, charged with involuntary manslaughter. Why she and her husband are being held responsible for the murder of four students by their troubled son. Good evening. Thanks for joining us. We begin tonight with Donald Trump's brief testimony in the penalty phase of his second trial for defaming E. Jean Carroll. It came after the judge, Lewis Kaplan reiterated in graphic detail what the former president had already been found liable for, namely sexually abusing Miss Carroll. Also with several interjections from the defendant, the judge established tight parameters on what Trump attorney, Alina Habba could and could not ask. It made for quite a scene today and CNN political analyst and \"New York Times\" senior political correspondent, and Trump biographer, Maggie Haberman was in court to see it, so was CNN's Kara Scannell. Also joining us, CNN legal analyst, Elie Hoenig and Karen Friedman Agnifilo. Kara, what did he say on the stand?",

They spent about 10 minutes going back and forth to try to really contain the questions that would be asked and what Trump's answers would be, to stick to those confines, and then his testimony was over in less than three minutes.So it was just three straight questions from his attorney, Alina Habba. Earlier in the day, Carroll's team actually played video clips of Trump's deposition in this case where he mistakes Carroll for Maples in a photograph and also just repeat some of his statements that he doesn't know her, calling her mentally ill. So Habba asked Trump, \"Do you stand by your testimony in the deposition?\" Trump says \"100%, yes.\" She then asked him, \"Did you deny the allegation because Miss Carroll made an accusation?\" Trump said, \"That's exactly right. Yes, I did. She said something that I considered a false accusation. Totally false.\" The judge cut him off and said, \"Everything after 'yes I did' is stricken from the record.\" That was really the only time we saw Trump veer away from what was very strictly adhered to, and the last question Habba asked him was, \"Did you ever instruct anyone to hurt Miss Carroll in your statements?\" Trump said, \"No, I just wanted to defend myself, my family and frankly, the presidency.\" The judge also told the jury disregard everything after \"No.\" So it was such a contrast from when Trump was on the stand in the civil fraud trial where he used that as a platform to make political speeches, to attack the judge, to attack the New York attorney general. You know, really kind of taking the campaign into the courtroom. That was not the case today. It was very controlled and his statements were really just specific to the questions and ones that had already been worked out.",

He just answered three fairly straightforward questions in very straightforward fashion. Now, it remains to be seen, A., will the jury believe what he said, credit what he said, and B., even if so, how much is that going to reduce the damages award?",

That happens. The allegation is that the DA has a personal romantic relationship with one of the three lawyers, a man named Nathan Wade. The allegations, first of all, he is underqualified to do this. He's never tried a felony case at all. Now, he is trying the biggest felony case in the history of the state of Georgia. The allegations is that he was paid, and the documents back this up, $650,000.00 for his work when the other two were both paid under $100,000.00, and finally, the allegation is that some of that money paid to Mr. Wade was used for personal vacations that he took and personal recreation with the DA, Fani Willis. So we'll see how that comes out. There's a hearing on that on February 15th. Allegation two is that, we remember a couple of weeks ago, the DA went in front of a church and made a public speech, where she said essentially, isn't it interesting that of the three lawyers I brought in, they are picking on the Black man, and she essentially suggested or maybe more, that the motivation behind these defendant's motions was racist, and so the allegation is that those statements are potentially prejudicial to the jury pool that will eventually decide this case.",

And then separately, the comments I think, in front of a church, I mean, why do we have these gag orders on Donald Trump? One of the big reasons is we collectively, we, the justice system, are afraid that his public comments might taint the jury pool.
