The Russian president visited the Dagestan region on Wednesday where video shows him being greeted by a crowd of enthusiastic supporters. Putin says he never doubted the support of the Russian citizens during the rebellion.Meanwhile, we are learning new details about what Wagner boss Yevgeny Prigozhin had in store for Russian military leaders. The Wall Street Journal cites Western officials who say he planned to capture defense minister Sergei Shoigu and Army General Valery Gerasimov. But promotion had to change his plans at the last minute when Russia's security service learned of the plot.

There will now be a lot of speculation and rumors surrounding these events, the Kremlin spokesman says. I believe this is just another example of it. Well, Surovikin was quick to call on precaution to stop the insurrection. GEN. SERGEI SUROVIKIN, RUSSIAN AIR FORCE (through translator): He must do this before it is too late. Obey the will and command of the elected President of the Russian Federation. PLEITGEN (voiceover): There is no doubt Surovikin and Prigozhin are close. While Prigozhin continuously ripped into Russia's defense minister for alleged ammo shortages during the battle for Bakhmut. For Surovikin, nothing but praise. YEVGENY PRIGOZHIN, CHIEF, WAGNER MERCENARY GROUP (through translator): This is the only man with the star of an army general, knows how to fight. PLEITGEN (voiceover): Surovikin led Russia's war in Ukraine for three months last year, just as Wagner's battle for Bakhmut was escalating. He was also Putin's top general in Syria and 2017 leading a brutal campaign to crush the opposition to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. And they are too working side by side with Prigozhin's Wagner mercenaries. So far, there's no indication the Russians implicated Surovikin in the uprising but Putin has made clear he views those who took part as traitors.",

It's also just going to create economic dead areas in some of these countries where there cannot be business.ROMO (voiceover): An analysis by Gro Intelligence published in 2021 concluded that Mexico's corn crop is threatened by the country's most widespread and intense droughts in nearly a decade. And tight corn markets are likely to transmit the shockwaves worldwide. Back in Panama, the government agency that manages the canal imposed draft restrictions. Meaning, cargo ships with a very low whole can't transit, which may slow the delivery of goods worldwide. Rafael Romo, CNN, Atlanta. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Depleted waterways. Preventing suppliers from getting delivered.What are the most pressing problems of extreme heat? The new worry could take a significant human toll. [02:35:06] ] DAHL: Extreme heat affects people in a number of different ways. I think primarily, a concern amongst climate scientists and public health officials is the effect of extreme heat on our health. So, you may have experienced a hot day. And that made you feel dizzy or irritable, or exhausted. And those are just minor consequences of heat. But as the accumulation of heat in your body increases, as the amount of time you spend with the heat increases, you can actually develop heatstroke, which can be fatal. Heat can affect cardiovascular issues. It can affect respiratory issues like asthma. It can even bring on preterm labor in pregnant people. So, there are a number of different health effects that we see. But heat can also affect things like our infrastructure. Rails for railroads, for example, can deform or buckle when it's extremely hot. Planes can't take off when it's extremely hot. And outdoor workers who kind of keep our societies running with construction projects and maintenance can be particularly affected by the heat. So, it's a number of different things that we worry about when we see heat waves like we're experiencing right now in the Southern U.S.",

We've seen animals like pigs dying because it is so hot.So, we do need to be thinking about where we are getting our food, how we are getting our food, and also who's producing our food. Who are the workers who are out there working outdoors in the heat to make sure that we have food on our plates? So, we need to be thinking about how nations and states protect their workers and also building food security for the future.",

And we do that by weaning ourselves off of fossil fuels like coal, oil, and gas.By doing that, we can limit how much more extreme heat we experience in the future. If we fail to reduce those emissions though, we're going to see dramatic increases in both the frequency and the intensity of extreme heat in the decades ahead. In addition to doing those all two critical emissions reductions, we need to be making our communities more resilient to extreme heat. We need to make sure that people have access to cooling. Whether that's at home through air conditioning, or at a cooling center that's accessible and easy to get to in their communities. And we need to make sure that places like schools, correctional facilities, and administrative buildings also are cooled so that people who are working indoors in those locations are not suffering. It's critical though, that we tie those things together. Because if we increase our air conditioning use, which global projections say that we are likely to see a major increase in global air conditioning use in the coming decades, we need to make sure that what's powering that air conditioning is clean renewable energy. Otherwise, if we're powering that air conditioning by burning fossil fuels, we're contributing to the further worsening of extreme heat.",

Countries around the world have pledged to reduce their carbon emissions over and over. And yet we're not seeing countries live into those pledges.Even with those pledges, we need to see them getting stronger. So, there needs to be incredible global concerted action to reduce our emissions. Then, we also need wealthier nations like the United States to really step up and provide more finance for developing nations so that they can develop clean energy systems so that they become more climate resilient. It's really the historical responsibility of the world's greatest emitters like the United States to help those who have emitted less but are being far more impacted by the problem. [02:40:09",
