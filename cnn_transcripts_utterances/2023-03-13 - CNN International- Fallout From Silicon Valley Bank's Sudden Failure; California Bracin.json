But if you look at what this bank also did, this bank ran massive payrolls for many companies. So companies would put their money in the bank, you know, and then during the course of the week or the course of the month, that money would be paid out to hard-working Americans as payroll money. If the bank goes under and that money is not there, those companies don't have money for payroll. I don't think that's the situation that we want to put hard-working Americans in. If they can't get their payroll because their company put the money into a bank that that just happened to have a run on it in that window while their payroll dollars were sitting there.So, I do think we as a country have some obligation to make sure our banking system is safe. Remember, we do regulate banks at a federal level and these banks do come under massive scrutiny. So to run away from these financial institutions when they go through a difficult time is not the right answer. The last time we really went through a situation like this was 2008. In 2008, the regulators did not have nearly as a robust toolbox as they have today. Today the regulators have enormous tools at their disposal. They have enormous discretion to go through and really do whatever they want in this situation. So, I'm cautiously optimistic that they will use their tools, they will use their discretion, and we will hear something later in the day, what they have done with the Silicon Valley Bank.

JOHN HARDER (D-CA): There absolutely needs to be accountability for the bank managers that got us into this situation. They paid themselves millions of dollars in bonuses the day before this bank collapse. Many of them sold stock just a few days before Silicon Valley Bank went under. I think we should look at potentially clawing some of that money back especially if depositors are not in a position to be made whole tomorrow. And we need a look at the regulators who should have been better able to stress-test this bank and anticipate crisis moments like this well before. We're going to need some banking reform. But our number one and number two goals going in to tonight and tomorrow, have to be protecting workers who did absolutely nothing wrong and need to be in a position to get paid. And second, stopping this contagion from spreading. REP. ADAM SCHIFF (D-CA): I think we in Congress need to ask the question, were they considering the impact on banks like this one in the Silicon Valley by such rapid rate increases. You know, clearly, they were doing this to try to tamp down inflation, but did they consider the possibility that some institutions might not be able to handle such a rapid increase in rates. Now I think a large part of that responsibility goes to the management of that bank but nonetheless, was the Fed on top of this, did they see the risks? And going forward there are other institutions that will be in jeopardy if they continue such rapid increases in interest rates. They're going to have to study that and we're going to have to find out in Congress exactly how to prevent this kind of thing from happening again. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Keep in mind, this is 200 feet above the historic low that was set back in 2021. Much needed rain. Of course, it comes with its problems, too, right. We've seen localized flash flooding, some scary scenes coming out of this but for the most part here, we need this water. Look what it's doing to the snowpack as well. Into the southern Sierras, 244 percent of average across the state where over 200 percent where we should be for this time of year. We've all seen the scenes coming out of Mammoth Mountain, other areas as well. Homes completely buried by the impressive snowfall totals and guess what, we have yet another atmospheric river event that will take shape over the next 48 hours. So Monday into Tuesday, this is when we're anticipating that fire hose of water to oscillate from north to south, once again. We'll start measuring snowfall in feet across the mountains with several inches of rain for the coast and the central valley. 17 million Americans under flood watches including Sacramento, San Francisco and just outside of L.A.
