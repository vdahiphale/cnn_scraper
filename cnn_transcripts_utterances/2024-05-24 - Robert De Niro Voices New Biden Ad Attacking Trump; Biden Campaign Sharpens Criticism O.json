      "sentences": "Today on Inside Politics, unhinged and power hungry. That's how the Biden campaign is describing Donald Trump in a new campaign ad. Their strategy is clear, but it's a message that doesn't seem to be translating in the polls. Alaska top Biden campaign aide, why they think this will work.Plus, big promises in the big apple. Donald Trump hit the campaign trail in the Bronx, one of the most diverse places in the country. His goal making inroads with black and Latino voters who are crucial to Joe Biden's coalition. And more fallout from the Dobbs' decision. Abortion drugs could soon be classified as dangerous, controlled substances in Louisiana, which means people with those pills who don't have a prescription could face prison time. I'm Dana Bash. Let's go behind the headlines at Inside Politics. First up, the man known for taxi driver, goodfellas, casino and many other classics has a new role. Robert De Niro is the narrator of a new Biden campaign ad at attacking Donald Trump. The campaign says, it's part of its summer strategy to remind voters of both what he did in the White House and what he would do if he wins it back. (PLAYING VIDEO)",

      "sentences": "Well, Dana, that ad really captures where the next phase of the campaign is headed, which is trying to reinforce among voters. What the Donald Trump years looks like. Trying to remind them of that. You saw on that ad, the mention of the Coronavirus pandemic by saying -- trying to remind voters of what the president said about drinking bleach as well as trying to capture that chaos and confusion under the Republicans administration. And also casting Donald Trump's presidential bid as revenge.So that captures where they're headed, but also in a memo. They laid out where they plan to ramp up their attacks, especially before that June presidential debate. And that includes on abortion, on democracy and also on the economy areas where they see weaknesses in the President Biden's -- his Republican rivals' issues. Now of course in met -- in this memo Jen O'Malley Dillon said the following quote, the Biden-Harris campaign will zero in on Trump's dangerous campaign promises and unhinged rhetoric. We will make sure that the voters who will decide this election are reminded of the chaos and harm Trump caused as president and why they booted him out four years ago. And Dana, I want to point out what they say here about unhinged rhetoric. We've heard President Biden sort to say that more often in his fundraiser. Saying that, former President Donald Trump's staffed after the 2020 presidential election and that he's unhinged. So expect more -- more build up on that line over the course of the next few weeks. There is also two dates of the campaign plans to organize around that as the overturning of Roe v. Wade, as well as the anniversary of the Pulse nightclub shooting. Of course, they're trying to hit on the issues of abortion and gun violence. All of this of course, again in the lead up to the June presidential debate where they hope to bring that choice between the two right to people's living rooms.",

And I would just want to read a part of a piece from Russell Berman from the Atlantic. And that is, that younger voters don't remember some of the things -- a lot of the things that the Biden campaigns specifically in that ad are talking about. The youngest voters know Trump more as ribald commentator than as political leader. Santiago Mayer, the 22-year-old founder of the Gen Z group voters for tomorrow -- excuse me, voters of tomorrow, which is endorsed Biden, told me that his 18-year-old brother and his friends see Trump as more funny than threatening.",

      "sentences": "Yes, that's a problem for younger voters. It's a problem across the electorate. If you look at polling, which is only referring to. Gallup had polling this week that asked people a number of questions, characteristics of Trump and Biden. One of them was, who is better at managing the government. Biden had a lead on that last time. Trump has a small lead on it.Now the Biden number on that fell 13 points. And that was -- that's at the heart of all of this. The premise of this ad is, you might like some things about Donald Trump, you might think he's funny, but he can't manage things are going to tumble into chaos. And a lot of people don't believe that. That's part of the nostalgia that the Biden campaign is fighting, especially with people under 30, under 25. What do you remember about the Trump years? Trump has been very successful in making it a three-year two-month presidency where things were cheaper and that's about it. Things were cheaper. There wasn't a war in Israel. That's about it. And so, the craziness that they'll talk about with Trump does not connect because a lot of people have internalized. Well, things seem pretty crazy. The tweets were pretty crazy. But, but, but I feel -- I feel better in these five or six areas that are important to me. And that really hits with younger voters. Now even if they're not voting for Trump, they find it funny that they're going to sit it out and vote for Kennedy, they'll vote for Cornel West or whatever. LEIGH ANN CALDWELL, EARLY 202 CO-AUTHOR, THE WASHINGTON PORT: Yeah. I think that's absolutely right. You look at the polls and where Biden is cratering is his base --",

They were really never focused on getting Nikki Haley herself. They know that she probably wants a future in the Republican Party. She would kill that future. Had she come out and endorsed Joe Biden?They were really focused on getting her voters, which is why you're seeing all this quiet outrage. Starting now, they did do -- you know, the President Biden after Nikki Haley dropped out, you know, made it clear that -- you know, these voters have a room in my coalition and you're starting to see these conversations happen. And I was reading some of the comments from other people in the loop, participate in the meeting. And they said, we want more of this. This is kind of -- we just want to hear from the Biden campaign. We want to make sure that we're heard. And especially, I was just -- all the -- it's May and she's still getting double-digit support in a lot of these states -- in these primaries.

If your issue was (inaudible), all right, it's done. The worst thing that happened to what you're saying about Christie is, without which it doesn't work is maybe a media report about how it didn't go very well.And that's already happening. The White House has been doing this with Muslim voters, Arab voters and getting immediate readouts of how this is not very convincing. That hasn't happened when it's talked to Haley voters. And the Trump campaign is -- has no problem doing this. They did the same thing with Muslim voters, got some backlash. They do not mind having a meeting that doesn't necessarily go well.

It was the opposite we're showing that on our screen.You don't have to believe in every single poll.

I was running the largest Senate campaign in 2022. And polls had us down. National poll saying that we were going to lose and then we won. There was no red wave.

When Donald Trump is saying that he wants to cut social security and Medicare. When Donald Trump is saying that he wants to terminate the ACA. In order for us to make sure that people believe us when we're telling them, he is serious about these things. This is not a joke. I know it sounds amorphous high in the sky to say that democracy is at stake, but it really is. And these proof points of Donald Trump's first presidency of how he governed in the things that he did, staging a photo-op, tear gassing American citizens and then taking a photo. As the president of the United States, standing by while there was an insurrection happening and doing absolutely nothing in the White House. Our proof points of why voters should believe Donald Trump when he's saying that he's going to do all the things that our campaign is highlighting. He is not playing around. And we are running out of time to make sure that we communicate that to voters. And that's exactly what we're going to spend every single day from now until election day doing and drawing the contrast. And there's also the element of continuing to highlight how President Biden and Vice President Harris have gotten into the Oval Office and kept the promises that they made to Americans. Leading them through a deadly pandemic, getting shots in arms, saving lives. Another thing that Donald Trump failed to do. And ultimately, impacted disproportionately a lot of voters of color, and he simply did not care.
