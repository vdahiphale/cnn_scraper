      "sentences": "And tonight, straight from THE SOURCE.Donald Trump's former National Security Advisor is here, with dire new warnings, about what could happen, if he returns to the White House, predicting that Trump might not leave voluntarily, this time. Also tonight, President Biden says he's decided on a response, to the deadly U.S. attack -- the deadly attack that killed U.S. troops. The world is waiting to see what he decided, with the President saying that he holds Iran responsible. Also, we are seeing dramatic new images, of an undercover raid, in a hospital, in the West Bank, with Israeli commandos, disguised as nurses, killing suspected terrorists in hiding. I'm Kaitlan Collins. And this is THE SOURCE. Tonight, with Donald Trump well-positioned, to close in, we believe, on a third Republican presidential nomination, one of his former top aides is stepping up his warnings, about what a second Trump term could look like. And when I say former top aide, of course there are many, who have issued similar warnings, about what could happen, including Trump's own Vice President, Mike Pence. But this is one, who had an office, just steps away from the Oval. John Bolton will join us live in just a moment. You'll recall his book, about his time working, in the Trump White House, titled \"The Room Where It Happened.\" It's out in paperback today, with a new foreword, \"The Room Where It Will Happen Again.\" Bolton is arguing that if Trump gets back into the White House, it will be \"The Retribution Presidency.\" He writes that \"Trump really\" only cares \"about retribution for himself, and it will consume much of a second term.\" It's an echo of what we have heard repeatedly, throughout Trump's campaign.

Quote, \"He will not depart voluntarily this time,\" Bolton warns. On the foreign policy front, Bolton's message is also dire, saying that Trump's short attention span renders, quote, coherent foreign policy, almost unattainable, and that his most harmful national security failure is the quote, \"Isolationist virus\" now coursing through the Republican Party. Bolton writes that it is a close contest, between Putin and Xi Jinping, who would be the happiest, to see Trump back in office. Putin will relish a second term, he writes. Trump will want to enhance his personal relationship with Xi. He adds quote, \"Imagine Trump's euphoria at resuming contact with North Korea's Kim Jong-Un.\" All three autocratic leaders, I should note, that Trump has repeatedly brought up, on the 2024 campaign trail.

This is because, as I think we saw, beyond question, in the first term, and I tried to document in my book, he just doesn't know limits. What he cares about is the greater glory of Donald Trump. The concept of the national interest or American national security, are things he doesn't comprehend.

There are a lot of decisions that have to be made. I don't think Trump is capable of making the decisions, grounded in national security. His attention span is short. He doesn't know much about world history or world affairs. He actually doesn't think they matter very much. He thinks his personal relationships, with foreign leaders, especially the authoritarian ones, are all that matter. And while personal relations, in international affairs, are important? When you get in a situation, like we see in the Middle East, now, they're not significant. So, faced with these decisions, Trump could go one way, in the morning, a different way, in the afternoon. He doesn't have the ability to stay consistent, for long periods of time, except on one thing, which is how he looks in the press, and in public attention. And that is very worrying.

But in listening to him, talk about his views, about why that was important, it was clear to me that it wasn't simply to eliminate this major figure, who was the leader of Iranian terrorist actions.

But on the impeachment articles that we are expecting could happen, at 2 o'clock in the morning, is what we're hearing, right now? I mean, you already know that the last time this happened. 1876 was the last time that a cabinet secretary was impeached. That was a Secretary of War, who was found to have pocketed more than $20,000 in a kickback scheme. I should say that is not what is happening here, with Mayorkas.

Now, we can -- we can debate about whether, using impeachment, against a cabinet member here fits the normal reasons, why we would impeach someone. And we can also wonder about the slippery slope of the weaponization of impeachment, when the next Republicans get in, and if Democrats control Congress.

But punishing a Cabinet Secretary, for that disagreement? That's performative. That's about politics. And that is, frankly, about Donald Trump, trying to undermine this country, and trying to literally undermine the ability of members of Congress, to try to reach a deal. I mean, ironically, think about it, instead of sitting there trying to take out Mayorkas, they could have those Republicans and Democrats, frankly, could have walked across, to the other side of the building, the Capitol building, and said, let's talk, let's try to come up with a deal. So, I think that's what needs -- what stands out here. And I hope that Democrats will continue to call that out. Because this is not about solving the problem at the border.
