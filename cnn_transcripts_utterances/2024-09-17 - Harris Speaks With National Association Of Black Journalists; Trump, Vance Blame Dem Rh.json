I've been a big advocate of that for years, which includes what we need to do around putting resources into community based intervention that is not just requiring on the good people in the community to volunteer to do the intervention, but actually paying people to do it because it's a full- time job. It's about understanding what we need to do to again understand that -- to your point, we have to have a holistic response to this issue, and prioritize it, instead of reacting to the tragedy that sadly, they are too predictable.

Wade. They did as he intended.And in state after state, laws have been passed, criminalizing health care providers. I don't know if anyone here has heard most recently the stories out of Georgia, tragic story about a young woman who died because it appears the people who should have given her health care were afraid they'd be criminalized after the Dobbs decision came down. Laws that make no exception even for rape or incest, which means that you tell in a survivor of a crime of a violation to their body that they have no right to make a decision about what happens to their body next, which is immoral. The -- an approach that doesn't take into account that most people I think agree you don't have to abandon their faith or deeply held beliefs to agree, the government should not be telling her what to do with her body as she chooses, she will talk with her pastor, her priest, her rabbi, her imam, but it should not be the government or Donald Trump telling her what to do about her own body and her life.

Harris also appealing to auto workers and she has that powerful UAW endorsement.How do these voters look at their choices this year? Does that endorsement necessarily move UAW members? EMILY LAWLER, STATE GOVERNMENT &amp; POLITICS EDITOR, DETROIT FREE PRESS: Yeah. Certainly, auto workers are huge chunk of the Michigan electorate you know, even beyond the people who are directly in the UAW, there's a ton of like support jobs or maybe white collar jobs that are affiliated with the auto manufacturers, and then on top of that, all the retirees. If you think about the propensity for older voters to head to the polls, we have a lot of people living especially in southeast Michigan, who have retired from one of the Big Three. So I do think that that's a pretty significant bloc. And, of course, they're going to be union members on both sides of the aisle. I don't think it's a secret that Donald Trump is made some real big inroads there, especially in areas like Macomb County, which has a pretty big manufacturing base, but really helped him to victory in 2016.

That Donald Trump did win Michigan. Hillary Clinton lost because of turnout.
