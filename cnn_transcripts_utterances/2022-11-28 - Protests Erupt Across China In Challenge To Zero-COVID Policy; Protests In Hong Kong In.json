      "sentences": "Hello and welcome to Inside Politics. I'm John King in Washington. Thank you for sharing your day with us.Protests erupt across China. Thousands fed up with the government stringent COVID restrictions take to the streets in a remarkable and a rare show of defiance. Plus, Donald Trump and the hateful company he keeps. The former President dines with Kanye West and Holocaust denier and white nationalist Nick Fuentes. A few Republicans do condemn Trump, but most GOP leaders and potential 2024 rivals again, choose silence over decency. And a busy weekend of early voting in Georgia's round two. The Senate runoff election is officially December 6, that's a week from tomorrow. But as Raphael Warnock and Herschel Walker campaign, getting early votes in the bank is a big priority. Up first for us though, the dramatic and rare public displays of defiance across China. Large crowds gathering in at least 16 locations over the weekend, protesting the government zero-COVID policy restrictions nearly three years now into the pandemic. Some are so angry, they're calling for the removal of the Chinese leader Xi Jinping, which of course, can be a very dangerous thing to say publicly in China. The police response has in some cases been quite tough, even brutal. Video showing chaotic scenes of protesters being pushed, dragged and beaten. The protests come as China hit another record high in daily COVID cases on Monday, the biggest numbers seen since the start of the pandemic. Overnight, Chinese state media reiterating the country's COVID measures are, quote, scientific and effective. Now China bristles at anything it considers outside meddling in its affairs. So we will watch for reaction to this. A morning statement from the Biden White House saying Chinese citizens should have the right to peacefully protest. Let's get to CNN's Ivan Watson. He's live in Hong Kong for us where dozens have gathered in protest in solidarity, Ivan, with those in the mainland as well.",

This was probably the biggest, nationwide display of discontent that we've seen in China in a generation. You had these demonstrators out in the streets, in some cases, pushing back at police, and pushing back at the Chinese government's zero-COVID policy, which has put immense pressure psychologically and emotionally on Chinese people, not to mention financially.Because how can you plan for a future if you never know whether or not you're going to be locked in your apartment for months at a time, whether or not you're going to be able to buy and sell across provincial borders, whether or not schools will be opened or closed for months at a time. And what we saw just tonight, here in Hong Kong, was small demonstrations in this city as well, where the authorities have also completely cracked down on any protests at all for the past couple of years. So it was just remarkable to see dozens scores of people out in the street showing solidarity with people in Mainland China. I went to one of these demonstrations, which they described as a vigil for the victims of China's zero-COVID policy. And I talked to one man from Shanghai from, the Mainland, he described himself as a victim. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Because my understanding before the election, is that he didn't fight back against Donald Trump -- when Trump actually, not only seemed to put out a hit on him, but also said racist things about his own wife, the former Transportation Secretary, Elaine Chao. He didn't do it because he wanted to stay focus on the issues and he didn't want to distract before the election. The only excuse or reasoning that he could give right now is because there is still one more election in Georgia, and he doesn't want to anger the Trump base before they go to the polls.
