Simply put, they say time is running out for old solutions and that we need bold action, and we need now. Well, some of that action came from host country UAE earlier on, which pledged to finance a new climate solutions fund to the tune of $30 billion, and of course on a day when the truce between Israel and Hamas has crumbled, global politics not too far away, either with a rare meeting between the Emir of Qatar, which of course have been negotiating between the two sides, and Israel's President Isaac Herzog, who was also in town.

The Hamas-controlled Gaza Health Ministry says at least 32 people have been killed. Israel is dropping leaflets in the southern city of Khan Younis, calling it a fighting zone, and telling people to evacuate immediately. Before the truce ended, Hamas released eight more hostages on Thursday.

Blinken said Israel needs to have a concrete plan to avoid civilian casualties as it launches the second phase of its war. At the time as it prepares to launch the second phase of its war, we have seen these leaflets dropped in Israel, trying to put a map up of Gaza broken up into different parcels. So, perhaps trying to say you can evacuate this part or should evacuate this area. This is where we're going to carry out operations. But, of course, that requires internet connectivity. It'll be interesting to see and crucial to see, frankly, if that meets the U.S. requirement for enough done to avoid civilian casualties, because it was clear that the U.S. is seriously concerned not only about bottom line the number of Palestinians who have been killed in Israeli operations in Gaza, including women and children, but also the result of that on pressure, both in the U.S. and on Israel.

And now the key here, say those who are following this closely, including scientists, is that it needs to be used in a way that accelerates the energy transition. And climate justice goes hand in hand with climate finance, as you allude to, Becky.And there's been a lot of discussion today to make sure that the financing of climate initiatives, of the energy transition goes to those countries that need it most. As you earlier mentioned, the president of Kenya, several African leaders have called, for their continent to be part of the solution and to receive that funding. Because there are significant oil reserves and national gas -- national -- excuse me, natural gas reserves in Africa and off the coast of Africa that countries want to exploit. If they are to not exploit those reserves, they feel they need the financing to move towards energy transition. This is something, in fact, South Africa is trying to do with funding from the U.K., U.S. and others, to wean themselves off coal and onto a more cleaner future. Becky?",

      "sentences": "Yes, the negotiations are still ongoing, but if you ask the Qataris who have been mediating these talks, certainly the quickness that Israel restarted its bombing campaign in the early hours since the truce expired complicates things to get things back on track. If you ask the Israelis, this military pressure that they are applying to Hamas and the Gaza Strip will ultimately help them, they say, in their negotiations and to try to lower the price of the hostages who are still outstanding, some 137 of them is what the Israeli Prime Minister's office believes are actually there.In terms of the fighting on the ground, Max, there have been widespread airstrikes in Gaza. As you said, dozens of people killed. The Hamas led Ministry of Health says, that the majority of those victims are women and children. This is not helping Israel's cause when it comes to cutting down civilian casualties. And this is a message that U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken brought yesterday when he visited Israeli leaders. He said that his expectation and the United States expectation which, by the way, he says that Israel had agreed to was that before any hostilities continue, before the fighting continues, there needs to be a plan to minimize civilian casualties. So, as you pointed out, they have been doing things like dropping leaflets. They have also set up a website to try to make it easier for people inside Gaza to actually track where Israel is telling people to evacuate or where it's telling them to go at any given moment. Though, surely there will be plenty of criticism to that approach, given the connectivity issues in Gaza, given the lack of electricity, the lack of people with phones often it is not easy to get word out to people there. Blinken also made clear that the U.S. does not want to see a repeat of the widespread bombing campaign that happened in Northern Gaza and also southern and central Gaza as well, but particularly in the north where you have 40 to 50 percent of the buildings that are damaged in some way. So, the message that Blinken brought was clear. The implementation of it and the effectiveness of it, I think, is less clear at this stage of the game, Max.",

Dozens of trucks that had undergone inspection at the Nizania -- Nitzana Crossing in Israel was seen waiting at the Rafah Crossing gate. Under the truce agreement, up to 200 trucks carrying desperately needed aid were allowed to enter Gaza each day. But Israel's campaign against Hamas in Gaza has already left much of the landscape as a wasteland. Homes, businesses and infrastructure in ruins. Many people have become internally displaced. Refugees struggling to survive every day. CNN Senior International Correspondent Ben Wedeman takes a closer look at the already dire humanitarian situation there. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BEN WEDEMAN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voiceover): There isn't much left to retrieve from the moonscape that was Zahra City in central Gaza. Just some scraps of wood pulled from the ruins. The odds and ends that were once people's lives. We've come to get what we can, says Amjad Ashanti (ph). The kids' things, our clothing, whatever we can get from under the rubble. Here, I found this, my daughter's toy. No one can live here anymore, the destruction total. Life in Gaza has been reduced to the basics, a pre-industrial existence where people have become hewers of wood, where they can find it. And drawers of water, even if that water is barely potable. Bassem al Attar (ph) goes out early every day to collect the firewood his wife uses to prepare meals. The United Nations estimates around 80 percent of Gaza's population has been displaced, more than a million jammed into schools converted into shelters. People here are living on top of one another, says Bassem (ph). The place is full of filth. All these kids are going to get sick. The World Health Organization reports that without adequate hygiene, health care and food, disease is spreading. Bassem's wife, Khitam (ph), tears up the daily bread, old and stale, to be made into a thin soup with lentils. We used to feed this to the sheep. Now, we give it to the children, she says. There's no more room at this school in Maghazi, Central Gaza. Um Shadi (ph) and her extended family of more than 20 sleep in the back of a truck, protected from the elements by a plastic tarp. She fled from Northern Gaza with only what she could carry, desperate now to find enough food to feed her children. When my son tells me, I'm hungry. What can I say, she asks? We try, but we can't find anything. Our life is hard. Hard, perhaps, is an understatement. Welcome to the apocalypse now. Ben Wedeman, CNN, Jerusalem. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

The wife of Ukraine's top military intelligence officer is recovering in hospital after apparently being poisoned. She's the latest in a list of Russian enemies also likely poisoned. CNN's Fred Pleitgen reports.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voiceover): Ukraine's military intelligence wages war in the shadows, but it is hitting the Russians hard. Orchestrating cruise missile attacks on Vladimir Putin's Black Sea fleet, ousting Moscow's forces from oil and gas drilling platforms off the coast of occupied Crimea in a daring amphibious assault, and attacking the Russian capital with long distance combat drones while maintaining deniability. The man leading the intelligence service GUR is Kyrylo Budanov, one of Russia's most feared enemies. I appeal to Russian soldiers, to those who got lucky enough to survive in destroyed trenches, he recently said. It will be even worse. You have a choice. Die or save your life. But now, Ukraine believes the Russians may have struck back. Kyiv saying, Budanov's wife, Mariana Budanova, has been poisoned by what they say is, \"A heavy metal.\" A Ukrainian source telling CNN, Budanova tested positive for both arsenic and mercury poisoning. Ukrainian officials believe the Kremlin could be behind it, like the foreign minister in an interview with CNN's Aaron Burnett.",
