And tonight, Donald Trump is now under fire for similar language about immigrants. Good evening. I'm Abby Phillip. And here is what the former president and current Republican frontrunner just said about immigrants. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT:  We know they're terrorists. Nobody has ever seen anything like we're witnessing right now. It is a very sad thing for our country. It's poisoning the blood of our country. It's so bad. And people are coming in with disease, people are coming in with every possible thing that you could have. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

President Biden has not cut the debt. It has increased by more than $5 trillion since he took office. So, what actually declined? Well, that is the annual budget deficit. Not the debt, did decline by $1.7 trillion. People might say, well, okay, debt deficit, he mixed it up. He has done this over and over and over again to the point the White House has started correcting, Abby, the official transcript, crossing out debt and putting in deficit. That's number one. Number two, he credited for this decline in the deficit in 2021 and 2022. He credited a new corporate 15 percent minimum tax on certain large profitable corporations. That did not take effect until 2023. So, that could not possibly have been responsible for the deficit declining. Why did the deficit decline? Well, experts say it's overwhelmingly not because of anything President Biden did but because of scheduled expiration of emergency pandemic spending from 2020. So, that's two. And the third I'll generously misleading is this claim that we ended up with a surplus. President Biden has not run a budget surplus. We've not had a budget surplus since the year 2001. A White House official told me what he's talking about the law, the Inflation Reduction Act that contains this new corporate minimum tax, is supposed to contribute by about $200 billion to reducing deficits over the next decades, but that's not really how people use the word surplus.",

And we can't deny that that element does exist in the Republican conference. They're the ones that brought us to brink of near default on the debt, almost brought to us to the brink of shutdown. They're the ones that drove Kevin McCarthy out of office. And they're the ones that, up until two days ago before Donald Trump endorsed Jim Jordan, were calling for Donald Trump to be the speaker.

With that being said, I will always promote the greatness of America and its military equipment. The alternative would be for allies and others to buy from Russia, China, or elsewhere.\"And joining me now is retired Navy Rear Admiral Ken Perry. He served as the Captain of a nuclear missile submarine and Commander of the Navy's largest submarine group. Admiral, just first off, I mean, sharing with an Australian billionaire who joins his social club and gets promoted when the President is in office about -- allegedly the number of warheads on these submarines, details about where they're positioned, what was your reaction to that? KEN PERRY, RETIRED REAR ADMIRAL, U.S. NAVY:  Well, my reaction was U.S. submarine force is a strategic advantage for the country. We've got submarines that are deployed and on patrol tonight around the world. It's a strategic advantage for the country. We rely on the supremely well-built ships, the fantastic crews to get where they need to go, to operate and do what they need to do, and do that with the confidence that they're going to have the best equipment, the best ships, the best trained crews. And they need to do that by relying on the stealth, the mobility, the power and firepower of the subs. Anything that compromises that kind of puts those submarines at risk. So, I don't have any comments about any particular conversations that were had. I just want to say that we rely on the submarine force.",

We're told that he never seriously considered himself for the speakership and that what he really wanted was a loyalist in that spot.It comes ahead of next week's election as top candidates Jordan and Steve Scalise make the rounds with their colleagues, but today they decided to cancel a Fox News forum that was scheduled for Monday after widespread Republican outcry. I want to bring in former South Carolina Republican, Congressman Mark Sanford. He's also a former governor of the state of South Carolina. Governor Sanford, look, Trump wanting a loyalist in the role is probably not a surprise to you. But given that he's had, I think, a historically pretty good relationship with Steve Scalise, does it surprise you that he chose Jim Jordan over Scalise in this case? MARK SANFORD (R), FORMER SOUTH CAROLINA GOVERNOR:  Not really, because you know with Trump, it's all about loyalty and there are different forms of loyalty. You can have, you know, pleasant affiliation, which I think is what he had with Scalise. But you know, Jim Jordan was his firebrand. I mean, Jim Jordan was head of the Freedom Caucus and was on direct phone line when Trump was president wherein, I mean, I was there on a speaker phone. They would begin to, you know, talk about, oh, we just had a conversation with President Trump and he and Mark Meadows would be absolutely giddy about that. So, I think that you know, Jordan is viewed as a supreme loyalist and believe me if there's anything that Trump wants, he wants supreme loyalty.",

But you know, at the end of the day, you're a cohesive family. And when you walk out of the house together, you're the Jones family and there's no backing down. So, I just think that the nature of the Speaker's race is an entirely internal event. It is about the Republican caucus, about the Republican family, as it relates to members of Congress. And it's best to be ironing out those differences inside as opposed to, you know, talking about, well, I had to trade off these votes in to Ukraine. I had to trade off these votes about killing off, you know, this particular measure or dealing with funding or no shutdown later on this fall.
