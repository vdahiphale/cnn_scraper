The Israeli government's also summoning the ambassadors of those three countries to the Israeli Foreign Ministry for a formal reprimand wondering which the Israeli Foreign Minister said he would make these ambassadors watch videos of the taking of hostages on October 7. The Israeli prime minister for his part has slammed this decision saying that it is tantamount to a reward for terror by recognizing a Palestinian state and he is also making clear that he firmly opposes the establishment of a Palestinian state saying that this will be a quote, terror state, which he believes will attempt to recreate the October 7 massacre over and over again, that is obviously a notion that these three countries have firmly reject, as does the Palestinian Authority, which is encouraging more countries to follow suit here. Now, the Israeli Foreign Minister has said that there will be serious consequences for these three countries and potentially as well for the Palestinian Authority for this decision to recognize a Palestinian state. And so far, we haven't gotten a flavor from him of what those consequences will look like. But we have heard from the Israeli finance minister Bezalel Smotrich, a far right member of Netanyahu who's governing coalition who has said that he will seek the approval of tens of thousands of housing units in Israeli settlements, he will also seek the approval of new Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank. In addition to that, he's also saying that he plans to withhold Palestinian tax revenue collected by the Israeli government meant for the Palestinian Authority, which is already severely cash strapped, and that could certainly have some serious consequences on the ground in the West Bank.

The question of the divisive vote on Brexit, where you have, you know, Scotland and Ireland voting to stay and Wales in the UK voted to leave.So a lot of sort of divisions and so on that have not been resolved.

And so, remarkably, although the Conservative Party had its, you know, a historic performance, certainly the best in 30 plus years at the 2019 election, the Labour Party had its worst performance in over 80 years. So it's a real uphill struggle I think for them to reclaim there's a lot to lose.
