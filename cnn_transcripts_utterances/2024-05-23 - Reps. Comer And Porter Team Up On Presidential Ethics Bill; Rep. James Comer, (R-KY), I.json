How this time off could impact the outcome. I'm going to ask a juror from another prominent case. And leading this hour, a bipartisan border bill rejected on Capitol Hill for the second time this year, this one blocked by Republicans and Democrats in the Senate. Our coverage starts with CNN's Manu Raju on Capitol Hill. And Manu, the bipartisan border bill just failed for a second time in the Senate today. What gives?",

Also needed 60 votes to advance today, they failed 43 to 50 losing additional Democratic and Republican support. Those members who are now voting no believe they're doing it out of protest because they believe this is being done for political reasons to try to force a vote that the Democratic leaders and the White House knew would fail.Including the people who are voted against it today, Senator James Lankford and Senator Kyrsten Sinema, two of the co-authorss of this bipartisan deal, but they criticize this process. Now this initially failed back in February, in large part because it was Donald Trump who came out and said that Republicans should reject this bill out of hand, even before this bill was released. And that was the point that Democrats wanted to make by forcing this vote. They tried to lay the blame on what's happening at the border against Donald Trump. Republicans said this is all a political move to try to protect some vulnerable Democrats over this issue of immigration. That's a question I put directly to Senator Jon Tester who is facing a difficult reelection in Montana. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

The state is also of course grappling with a number of key issues top of mind for voters immigration also crime. I'm joined now by New York Democratic Governor Kathy Hochul.Governor Hochul, thanks so much for joining us. So, Donald Trump, former President Trump he's holding an event shortly in the Bronx in an effort to attract voters of color Latinos and African Americans, historically a loyal voting bloc for Democrats, especially African Americans. But the truth is, this is a sport. This is a, you know, politics of margins. What more do Democrats need to do to solidify and mobilize their base? GOV. KATHY HOCHUL, (D-NY): Well, I'll tell you won't make a difference at all, Jake, and that is for Donald Trump to be the ringleader of an invite all his clowns to a place like the Bronx, New York will never ever support Donald Trump for president. We know him better than anyone. And that means we understand what he's all about is just for himself. So, this state will go solidly behind Joe Biden for president as it has in the past. So he wants to spend his time doing these made up fake rallies and retaining their supporter be my guest, because while you're doing that, Donald Trump, Joe Biden's out there on the other side, making sure he's delivering for all Americans. And so, go ahead, spend all your time if you want in New York, because we'll be with Joe Biden, and Joe Biden's out there winning over the rest of the battleground states.",

So while in the state of New York, we're getting more guns off the streets, Donald Trump says he wants everybody to have guns. And so you can say you're serious about fighting crime if you're not serious about getting illegal guns off the streets, something that I and other Democrats have been focused on.That's why the crime rate has been going down. That's why our subway numbers were at 19 percent, lower than we were before the pandemic. So we're making progress. Now, yes, there are still crimes. And there's a sense of anxiety out there that is very real. And Democrats acknowledge this. But we're the ones out there in the trenches doing something about it. I put the National Guard in the New York State subway system working with Mayor Eric Adams and our police force to stabilize our subway system, which is the lifeline of this part of our state. It's made a real difference. So you -- Republicans say all they want on crime. Yes, crime exists in cities, but we are driving the numbers down in a way that New Yorkers are starting to realize.",

So that's more than 600,000 times this regimen was used for medication abortion. As you pointed out, abortion is already illegal in Louisiana, has a near total ban.

Importantly, these drugs are also used for other uses. Mifepristone and misoprostol together are used for miscarriage management for example. Misoprostol alone is also used for hemorrhaging and gynecological applications, and for other uses as well also for treating GI ulcers. And so there was a letter from more than 200 healthcare providers in Louisiana to the state lawmaker who sponsored this bill and they said, quote, mischaracterizing misoprostol, a drug routinely and safely used on labor units throughout the state, as a dangerous drug of abuse creates confusion and misinformation and harms women seeking high quality maternal care. They are worried that this is going to really threaten their autonomy as health care providers in Louisiana. And Jake they point out that Louisiana already has a pretty bad maternal mortality rate.
