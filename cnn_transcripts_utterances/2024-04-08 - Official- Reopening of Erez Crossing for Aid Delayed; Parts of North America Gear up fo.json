It's 8 am in Kerrville in Texas, on that path of totality and its 5 pm here in Abu Dhabi. I'm Becky Anderson. This is \"Connect the World\" wherever you are watching. You are more than welcome happening this hour. CIA Director Bill Burns has left Cairo following the latest round of ceasefire and hostage talks between Israel and Hamas. Just hours ago the Vatican reaffirmed its opposition to sex change surgery, and three teams are locked in a tight race for the English Premier League title.

We start on a grim milestone as the war in Gaza officially takes part past the six month mark. The Gaza Ministry of Health says more than 33,000 people have been killed and just under 76,000 people wounded. Its six months that Israeli hostages have been held captive in Gaza, kidnapped then kept from their families in unimaginable conditions. Well now Egyptian state media reports a senior Egyptian source says there's been quote significant progress in those hostage ceasefire talks Hamas says it wants an agreement that would see a quote complete cessation of aggression but the IDF says it is not finished in Gaza. Israel's Defense Minister says troops are leaving Khan Yunis to prepare for quote follow up missions. CNN's Nic Robertson is live from Jerusalem.

In fact, theysay it's ending ground operations in Gaza in the current form, although there is a significant military force the 162nd division remains in the north of Gaza, the net serene corridor, there is a military presence of brigade on that which separates the north and the south from Gaza. But this withdrawal, the IDF is indicating can go one of two ways. Essentially, either the talks in Cairo come to some sort of agreement with Hamas. And if they don't then Rafah which is that border town are right along the edge of Gaza southern border with Egypt that is home at the moment to more than where approximately one and a half million Palestinians have escaped the fighting and other parts of Gaza. That could become the next focus of the IDF activities to go after Hamas. They say there another five brigades of Hamas hiding out there but at the moment, we've seen the tanks pulled out parked up in a field repairs going on to some of the tanks and armored vehicles. That's what the IDF says is happening those preparations for future operations. What happens around the negotiating table as a result of this, I think is where the attention is focused. But for those people going back to their homes in Khan Yunis today discovering massive amounts of destruction, people telling us CNN that they know they're going back to destroyed homes, but this they will stay there. They're resilient. They're not going to leave. This is a victory for no one at the moment. The death and destruction has happened over the last four months.

I think for the past six months, it's fair to say that there has been real concern about the conflict in Gaza spreading across the region. But at the same time, we have been told repeatedly by U.S. administration and intelligence officials, that Iran was not looking for a direct conflict, that they weren't looking to get involved directly. They were more than happy for their proxies that Hezbollah, the Houthis groups in Iraq and Syria to target U.S. and Israeli sites in interest. But that they themselves didn't want to get involved. Now, that may be changing. And the fear is that Iran may cross that line. And what we're hearing from U.S. officials is that Iranian retaliation for that Israeli strike in Damascus may be imminent and inevitable that something could happen in the coming days that Israeli and or American targets could be struck by Iran or by its proxies. Now, the U.S. is making clear that it was not involved in that Israeli strike, saying that it was Israel that the U.S. had no advanced knowledge and no participation in that attack in Damascus, the U.S. also warning Iran, that it should not use that as a pretext to go after U.S. targets or to expand the conflict.

Embassies are an obvious one, both Israeli and U.S. embassies all across the region. You have American ships, for example, naval vessels in the Mediterranean Sea, as well as in the Red Sea. So there are all kinds of things. Becky, I should also note there is significant U.S. concern that Israel is preparing an incursion into Lebanon that has been a major worry for quite some time.

Here's why, so there was an eclipse here about six months ago in October. And there is another Eclipse today. And what you're looking at are the two paths of totality. And at the center, it's Kerrville. That's why so many people feel that there's going to be extreme energy in this particular place.

And then another target point, that's likely going to be some of the best viewing that extends from Vermont, all the way up through Maine where you're talking plenty of sunshine and clear skies there to be able to view this thing at its fullest as it was meant to. But there's also going to be some less than ideal locations, places like Niagara Falls New York up to Rochester likely going to have a lot of cloud cover there and also yes, the potential areas of portions of Texas and Arkansas. Well, the reason for this is we have the potential for strong to severe thunderstorms. Now the good news here is that those thunderstorms are mainly going to happen after the eclipse is over. But we know a lot of times those clouds build ahead of time. So the real question is how much of an increase of cloud covered do we see before those thunderstorms arrive? And do they arrive during totality time, the main concern is also going to be all of these people when they leave because once the eclipse is over, many of them are staying in nearby locations and will have to drive there or travel to those locations, you may end up having some of those strong and severe thunderstorms that can kind of interfere with that especially as we go later into the evening and farther east of the totality line. A lot of those areas going to be dealing with some thunderstorms, but again, some good spots there Indianapolis, Indiana, for example, some clouds this morning, but we should gradually start to see those decrease as we go through the rest of the day making for more view ability especially in terms of the sunshine and also Burlington, Vermont, a few clouds, Becky, but not enough to really deter people from being able to see the eclipse this afternoon.",

Those are down, today, it been on the up, down as you can see some 0.5 percent on BRENT, down to just above 90 bucks on the barrel still a relatively robust number there. But even if they are down today, higher oil prices do pose the most serious threat to the U.S. economy. That assessment from Moody's Chief Economist Mark Zandi tells CNN that resulting increases in gasoline prices would worsen inflation readings and could impact the presidential elections.

But as you mentioned, oil prices, they are a growing threat because if they go high enough, they could unwind really all of those positives. We saw U.S. crude top $87 a barrel briefly on Friday for the first time since October. You can see on that chart, there's Brent crude, above $90 a barrel. Mark Zandi, he told me listen, the economy can live with $85, $90 oil in the U.S. But once it gets to 95, 100 or even more, that's the danger zone because that's going to hurt consumer spending. It's going to particularly hurt low income families. And so Zandi said, yeah, this is the biggest risk to the U.S. economy right now. It is a danger that we need to pay very close attention too. Remember the higher oil prices go the more consumers are paying at the gas pump, the national average here in the U.S. up to 360 a gallon now that's up by six cents in a week 20 cents in a month. And getting closer to the $4 level and Moody's found in an election model that they've run that gas prices are a major variable for the November election. So major that as you mentioned, if gas prices spike above four, and they stay there, then you could have a situation where that alone would actually be enough to tip the election in Donald Trump's favor. Now we should talk a little bit about why we're seeing this tick up in prices in the energy landscape and part of it is normal, part of it is seasonal as the weather warms up in the Northern Hemisphere, we do see demand go higher. Part of it is also intentional. OPEC+ the producer group led by Saudi Arabia and Russia, they're holding back supply. They want prices to go up and that strategy is working, then you have the war factor with drone attacks on oil refineries in Russia. And now the big focus is on the Middle East and how Iran is going to respond to that massive and significant airstrike a week ago. There are concerns, Becky, that response from Iran could actually threaten or even derail oil supplies from this critical region. So we do need to pay very close attention to what happens next on the oil front because it's going to have a big impact for the economy, for markets and maybe even for the political situation.",
