That's all been put on hold, no classes today. It really came to a point where they were under so much pressure that they have to do this. So, right, listen, they'll get criticized whatever happens. They didn't have enough security here last night. So, these protesters were really attacked by counter protesters. They have a lot of security here tonight.

His administration has condemned the forceful takeover of campus buildings and instances of anti-Semitism while remaining mindful of student's rights to protest.

When he delivers a keynote address next week at the U.S. cola -- Holocaust Memorial Museum's annual remembrance ceremony. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KARINE JEAN-PIERRE, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: The president is being kept regularly updated on what's happening as you just stated across the country. He is monitoring the situation closely, so is his team. And I would just add that no president -- no president has spoken more forcefully about combating anti-Semitism than this president.

He met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Jerusalem and reiterated his message to Hamas, take the hostage and ceasefire deal currently on the table.

So, that's sort of a disincentive for Hamas. Secondly, I don't know and I don't know that anyone knows what exactly is the command and control and communication streamline in Hamas. I don't know how decisions are made these days. It takes it a long time, the Egyptians, the Qataris attested to that effect that it takes too long.

And then Israel will resume military activities three, four weeks later. They are not happy with the assurances they're getting from the Qatar, from Egypt, and indirectly from the Americans. I think this is part of what Secretary Blinken tried to relate to them that the assurances are real. But there's another issue here, Rosemary, I don't know that Mr. Netanyahu wants that deal. Because if the deal, as was reported, includes a lengthy and almost indefinite ceasefire, then the war ends with almost zero tangible achievements.

And this was a way to allay their fears or mitigate what seems to be, you know, arrest warrants in the making, if that is -- if that is accurate.The second is that Israel was just indifferent and oblivious to this and only relented under the fear American pressure. The third explanation is more concrete.

Now, this is seen very, very seriously in Israel, because, you know, you have conspiracy theories that this is a result of a democratic and progressive politics in the U.S., on the one hand.

The school says attendance has gone up since implementing a makeshift pool. But other areas are drying up. Low water levels in the Vietnam Song May Reservoir had killed hundreds of thousands of fish. And the heatwave threatening crops and the livelihoods of those who farmed them. PILING PAYUYAO, FARMER (through translator): When the heat is very extreme, we cannot produce good quality fruits and vegetables. That is the effect of the heat. Farmers have to suffer a loss from low prices because of the poor quality. MYERS (voice over): On the opposite end of the delivery chain, food delivery drivers do what they can to avoid succumbing to the sweltering temperatures. In Thailand, the extreme heat means fewer pedestrians and more traffic jams, leaving bike riders to face the heatwave with minimal stops for water or A.C. SURIYAN WONGWAN, FOOD DELIVERY RIDER (through translator): Riders have to work harder as our delivery rate has decreased. But the more rides we take, the longer we stay under the heat, and it affects us. MYERS (voice over): Experts say, these heat waves are becoming hotter and more frequent with climate change. A University of Cambridge study said heat waves in India could cross the survivability limit for a healthy person in the shade by 2050.

While the U.S. and Israel claim to have shot down nearly all of Iran's missiles and drones, the General says Tehran showed the power of its aerospace forces. BELALI (through translator): Today, our drones and missiles have become an important factor of strength and the execution of power in the world, he says.

The Iranians continue to deny those accusations. The General tells me that Shaheds attack in swarms, often fired off secretly from unmarked trucks like this one. BELALI (through translator): Everything is preprogrammed, he says. The flight route is chosen according to the enemy's capabilities and blind spots of radars, and all the elements that can help us reach the target. PLEITGEN (voice-over): While tensions between Iran and Israel have somewhat eased after they traded direct military blows for the first time, the General warns Iran has even more modern weapons at its disposal. BELALI (through translator): The only path for them is to have logical and wise negotiations with us, he says. In our defense capabilities, we don't depend on anyone. We've had good progress in this field and we will progress more. There are achievements that have not yet been talked about. PLEITGEN (voice-over): Fred Pleigen, CNN, Tehran (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And while there are thousands of people out this morning, you won't see the usual hundreds of thousands of people that you see streaming into Havana's Revolution Square. The Cuban government says that, at least this year, they don't have the gasoline or the resources to pull off that kind of massive style event. So, there are encouraging people to celebrate May Day in their neighborhoods.Here where were expecting the Cuban leadership, you have thousands of people. That's actually the U.S. embassy there behind me, the location they have chosen for the May Day festivities. So you'll certainly hear Cuban officials criticizing U.S. sanctions on this island, but U.S. sanctions are only one of the absolute hurricane of economic calamity impacting Cuba at this moment, including runaway inflation, the largest immigration event, more Cubans leaving than have for the last several decades, and as well just the sense of things are continuously getting worse here as economic reforms have all but stalled out. So, while this is a moment for Benny (ph) here to celebrate their revolution, to celebrate communism. For many other Cubans, who are just barely getting by, the question is how relevant is a revolution now to their lives and what can the Cuban government do, if anything, to help them get by.
