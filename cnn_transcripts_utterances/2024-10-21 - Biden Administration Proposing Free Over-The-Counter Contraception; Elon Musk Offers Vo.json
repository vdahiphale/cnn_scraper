      "sentences": "This morning a new move by the Biden administration that could greatly increase access to over-the-counter contraception. The administration is now proposing a new rule making over-the-counter birth control and condoms free for the first time for women of reproductive age with private health insurance.CNN's Arlette Saenz is at the White House with much more detail for us. So, Arlette, what is the White House pushing for here?",

      "sentences": "Well, Kate, President Biden says that he and Vice President Harris are taking this step to try to expand access to affordable contraception at a time when they say that the right to contraception is under attack in this country.Now, the Affordable Care Act currently requires that private insurers cover most contraception at no cost. But what this would -- new rule would do is it would require private insurance companies to cover any birth control contraception that is trying to be acquired without a prescription at no cost. It would require that these insurance companies provide coverage for any FDA-approved drug relating to contraception as long as there is not a therapeutic equivalent that is covered. The White House estimates that this could impact and expand access for about 52 million women of reproductive age in this country. Now, this rule would still need to be finalized over the course of several months and it likely would go into effect in 2025 once it is finalized. But it comes at a time when reproductive health has remained a top issue in this presidential campaign. Democrats have warned that the Supreme Court's ruling overturning Roe v. Wade also puts at risk fertility treatments and access to contraception. Vice President Kamala Harris out on the campaign trail has warned that Donald Trump, who has bragged about appointing those Supreme Court justices who overturned Roe v. Wade -- that he would gut access to reproductive health in this country if he returns to the White House. And in a statement this morning touting this new rule, Vice President Kamala Harris said, \"While we fight to protect and expand health care, extremist so-called leaders are attacking reproductive freedom at every turn. Republicans in Congress have repeatedly blocked legislation to protect the right to contraception across the country.\" Now, meanwhile, Trump has said in the past that he would not restrict access to birth control. He made that comment shortly after he had said that he was looking at contraceptives when he was specifically asked whether he would limit access to contraception in this country. But it's clear that Democrats continue to believe that this issue of reproductive health will be a potent political issue in this campaign. And the Biden administration is trying to put some meat on the bones, saying that they are taking more steps to make affordable contraception coverage available to Americans across the country.",

The experts we spoke to said federal law makes it a crime to paypeople to register to vote. You can't give the money or a chance to win money through a lottery. Here is what the law specifically says. \"Whoever knowingly or willfully pays or offers to pay or accepts payment, either for registration to vote or to vote, can face up to five years in prison.\" That's the law.

You know, Barack Obama said this the other day. If your grandpa was doing this, you'd be worried, right? You do cry help. The other day he gave a talk where he talked about his own supporters -- and I'm using his words. He called them fat pigs. He said get that fat pig off the sofa. Just slap him around.

So Stewart hitting both free throws and sending the game to overtime. And the Liberty just took over from there. Leonie Fiebich came out and hit a huge three. Nyara Sabally broke away with a layup to put the Liberty up by five marking the largest lead of the game. And series MVP Jonquel Jones finishing with a team-high 17 points.

And 2.5 million Black households are considered severely cost-burdened because they've spent more than half of their income on housing costs.And so that's why the Harris campaign has come out with a number of proposals here, right? They're trying to add more supply by incentivizing builders with a combination of tax credits and cutting red tape. They're also vowing to take on what they're calling \"abusive corporate landlords.\" And they're calling on Congress to pass a law to remove tax benefits for investors who acquire 50 or more single-family homes.

That's a landlord that owns at least 1,000 properties. Nationally, this is just three percent, but that map shows that this is actually increasingly common in some of those Sun Belt cities. At least 10 percent or higher of the single-family units are owned by mega investors in Las Vegas, Indianapolis, Orlando, Phoenix. And then 20 percent or more in Charlotte, Jacksonville, and Atlanta. Now, a CNN analysis has found that rent increases in cities that have these major investors as single-family owners -- they have outpaced wages, right? So rent is going up faster than paychecks. But we also know that investors -- they're more likely to plow their money into markets where rent is already going up. So it's hard to say how much the investors are the cause of the problem or if they're just a reflection of the fact that these are hot housing markets. We talked to Laurie Goodman at the Urban Institute, and she said, \"Just because you say that institutional landlords are in areas with higher increases in rents, it doesn't mean they caused that.\" But look, Kate, we know that this is a massive issue for voters.

And this includes new testimony from local officers who provided a firsthand account of moments from the time the shooter was first identified by law enforcement up until shots were fired. And that includes that moment when officers helped one of their fellow officers up onto that roof and they saw Thomas Crooks there and identified the fact that he had a gun for the first time.This transcript reads, \"I tried to get him up to the roof\" -- talking about the officer. \"He's kind of on the side. However, he's up there. He comes back down screaming, 'There's an A-R! An A-R! A guy with an A-R!'\" Now, what's important about this John is to date, the task force has not received any evidence that message ever got to Donald Trump's Secret Service detail before shots were ultimately fired. And obviously, that speaks to the communication breakdowns that are also laid out in this assessment as well. The joint -- the bipartisan task force really coming to the same conclusion that a lot of other independent investigations around these assassination attempts have is that this was preventable, and this should not have happened. And it could put more pressure on Secret Service leadership. We know an independent panel convened by the Department of Homeland Security said that there needs to be a complete overhaul of the leadership at the Secret Service. But with the election so close it remains to be seen when that could take place.",

CNN has obtained video of the dock leading to the gangway that shows how the whole structure collapsed. You see the ferry in the background -- the same one guests were trying to get to when the tragic collapse happened. We later see people by the shore trying to rescue those who had fallen into the water. What we know is that the gangway collapsed shortly before 4:00 in the afternoon on Saturday as crowds gathered on Sapelo Island for a celebration of the Gullah-Geechee community of Black slave descendants. According to Walter Rabon, the commissioner of the Georgia Department of Natural Resources, the gangway that led from the dock to the ferry collapsed when about 40 people were on it. Commissioner Rabon said there was a significant increase in the number of people visiting on Saturday although he doesn't yet know if that was a factor in the gangway's collapse. Let's take a listen.
