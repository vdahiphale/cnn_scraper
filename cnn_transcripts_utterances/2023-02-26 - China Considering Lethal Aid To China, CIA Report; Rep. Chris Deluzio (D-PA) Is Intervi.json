The agency does not believe a final decision has been made. And today, the White House is urging caution.(BEGN VIDEO CLIP) JAKE SULLIVAN, U.S. NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER: You know, Beijing will have to make its own decisions about how it proceeds. Whether it provides military assistance. But if it goes down that road, it will come at real cost to China. And I think China's leaders are weighing that as they make their decisions.

Russian forces primarily from the Wagner Mercenary groups of convicts and contractors appear to be making gains. They have claimed that they have taken several villages to the north of the city in an attempt to encircle it.Ukrainian forces say that they are standing their ground in the face of what they call intense Russian assault. Now, the fight for Bakhmut has evolved over the past few weeks and months from a longer-range fight, using tanks and artillery and mortars to something that is much closer quarters, urban warfare. The fight going from street to street, building to building. Ukrainian officials for now are not talking about leaving the city, surrendering it to the Russians. But President Zelenskyy's stance on that has softened over time. He has said that they will not defend it at any cost if it means losing all of their troops. Meanwhile, Biden administration officials now openly warning China against sending lethal aids. So, weapons to Russia for use in Ukraine. The Biden administration had already warned China about nonlethal aid that was being sent to Russia. But now, top officials say that China is actively discussing sending weapons to Russia. They cautioned that no decision has been made yet. But the U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations said that this would be a red line, because it would be a significant boost to Russia in this fight. Here's a little bit of what the CIA director Bill Burns told CBS News this weekend. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And that is whether or not China is inching closer to his red line as it's been described, as it's apparently considering giving lethal military aid to Ukraine -- or excuse me, to Russia in Ukraine. I had a chance to talk with Colonel Alexander Vindman in the last hour. He said that this would be a game-changer. It would be a very worrisome development. Your thoughts on that? What do you think? CLARKSo, in a way, their strategy might mirror that of the United States. Give them enough to keep them in war. Hope the west will weaken and fall away. What we've heard so far is drones and ammunition. But one thing is for sure, China has plenty of military equipment and it can get it there on a train probably a lot faster than we can reinforce Ukraine. And, Jim, what has worried me and so many others -- of us on the outside of the administration is that we seem to be so deliberate, so incremental in providing the assistance to Ukraine. There's a window of opportunity now to have a strategy to get to negotiations that could lead to a successful end of the conflict, if we give Ukraine sufficient equipment now. But that equipment is not coming. I'm talking about the M1A1 tanks. They're 18 months away. F-16 fighter -- ATACMS missile, drones, the SB 600 Switchblades, that things that the Ukrainians have really sought, as well as the artillery that they need and the ammunition. So, what we've done is we sort of moved forward. It's like we're bleeding out both sides and we just hope they'll finally just say, oh, this is too much trouble. I can't keep my 16-ounce gloves up anymore, I surrender. But that's not what's likely to happen. This war is dragging on. It's going to bring more and more parties into it. It's going to become more and more destructive. And there is a window of opportunity now with the Ukrainian ability to mount a counteroffensive if they have sufficient equipment to threaten what Putin values most, which is Crimea. And that would bring the Russians to the negotiating table. Whether we would get out of it what we want, don't know. But Putin does not want to lose Crimea. So, this is the path forward. It's to have a strategy, a diplomatic strategy, and link the military outcome to it. And provide the resources to get that military outcome. And that tight strategy doesn't seem to have emerged yet from the west.",

But at just 17-years-old, the war is keeping her from being with her family in a place she calls home is a war zone. CNN's Polo Sandoval has her story.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) POLO SANDOVAL, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): This New Jersey dance studio is where Yeva Hrytsak finds refuge from a war raging half a world away. As the Ukrainian ballerina will tell you, keeping her focus on dancing is the only distraction from the fact that her family remains back in her home of Dnipro, Ukraine. Just over a year into the war, and that region continues to come under Russian artillery fire. Like so many Ukrainians waiting out the war in the U.S., Yeva says she feels tormented not knowing when she will see her family again. But rather than give in, she gives hope by lacing up her point shoes and doing what she says her family would want her to do, just dance.

Two of his crew didn't make it.He parachuted out and he was captured, and he was a prisoner of war for 18 months. He was in the same prison camp as the Great Escape. I'm sure some of you have seen the movie with Steve McQueen from many decades ago. And my grandfather said that that movie was actually pretty close to what it was really like. And he just had this harrowing -- these harrowing experiences. You know, he got the Purple Heart, the Air Medal, the POW Medal, and I used to listen to these stories when I was a little girl. It wasn't until I was in my 20s that I really realized what he went through. And before my grandfather died in 2007, he decided to write a book for the family. And he spent almost 10 years writing \"Luck of the Draw.\" And my mother and I, we teamed up and we decided that we want everyone to be able to get this book.
