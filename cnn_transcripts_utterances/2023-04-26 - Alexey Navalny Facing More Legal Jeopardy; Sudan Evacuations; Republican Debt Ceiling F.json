And that, more than anything else, drove a months-long process behind the scenes on a bilateral basis to hammer out the details of this agreement. And its an agreement that is significant, in the sense that it will lead to new assets flowing in to the region, including a nuclear submarine that would dock at a South Korea port, something that hasn't happened in four decades, but also additional training capabilities and exercises. And this is also critical and something South Korea has been very keen on, the ability for South Korea and its government officials to have a seat at the table when it comes to nuclear planning and consultations. They will not get a say anything, but that seat at the table has been important. In exchange, the South Koreans are committing that they will remain at a posture of not pursuing any nuclear weapons, something U.S. officials really wanted to see. So that's the basis of the agreement, I think a central component of what Biden administration officials wanted out of this bilateral.",

Overnight, House Speaker Kevin McCarthy cut a deal with fellow Republicans. They initially scoffed at his first effort to temporarily raise the $31.4 trillion debt limit. They wanted a slew of budget cuts. Now, after some overnight changes, McCarthy claims he has the votes to pass this bill in the House in just a matter of hours. But we should note the chance of this bill getting through the Democratically controlled Senate is virtually zero percent. And the president has already vowed to veto the thing. Meantime, experts warned the U.S. could default on its debt as early as June. Remember, this is money the United States already spent. This is like arguing if we should or shouldn't pay our bills. A default could spark a recession, a credit downgrade, market mayhem, more interest rate hikes, along with job losses and cuts to benefits for federal workers. Let's take you now live to Capitol Hill and CNN chief congressional correspondent Manu Raju. Manu, the speaker told you that you would be the first call he made once he knew he had the votes.

The White House Senate Democrats say, no negotiations, raise the debt limit, that's it, no cuts attached to it. That's a position Republicans strenuously oppose. And, of course, we're staring at the prospects of the first ever default by June if no deal is reached. Can they get there, a major question that still dominates these halls -- Boris.",

Let's take a closer look.What the Republican proposal has is adding and strengthening work requirements for two forms of aid, food stamps for people at the bottom end of the income graph here who need help feeding themselves and their families, also Medicaid, again, intended for the poorest Americans for them to get basic medical care. So, Medicaid, we should note, has never had a work requirement. If McCarthy somehow gets his way, certain Medicare recipients would have to work, do some community service, or earn a certain minimum monthly income in order to receive those benefits. We should note there are some exceptions, exceptions if you're pregnant, physically or mentally unfit, or if you're enrolled in a substance abuse program. What impact would this have? The CBO, the Congressional Budget Office, which, we should note, a bipartisan group, has estimated that, if these restrictions were to come into effect, 2.2 million Americans, 2.2 would lose their Medicaid coverage, 2.2 million Americans. The administration paints an even more dire picture. The Department of Health and Human Services says that this would jeopardize or put at risk health coverage and access to care for 21 million Americans. So, remember, Brianna, as we look at these numbers, it's not just about counting votes on Capitol Hill. It is about counting benefits requirements, and then how many people, as a result of those requirements, would lose those benefits. We're talking about millions of Americans.",

That is a pretty mass evacuation challenge. They're talking about trying to run at least eight flights from Cyprus into Khartoum. I understand they have -- they have done about six so far. But they have troops on the ground. They have got Royal Marines that have secured a bridgehead there at an airport just outside Omdurman and are escorting people to that location, or at least encouraging the situation to be possible to do that. For the Americans, they have got 16,000 potential evacuees, if all of them want to leave. Those are often people with the Sudanese background as well. But the fact of the matter is that, as far as the Americans have assessed it, they do not believe that there is a permissive enough environment to conduct particularly not an airborne evacuation. This is what John Kirby said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOHN KIRBY, NSC COORDINATOR FOR STRATEGIC COMMUNICATIONS:  I'm not going to go so far as to say there's no violence. Of course, we have seen reports of sporadic firing and shelling in and around Khartoum. But, largely, the violence is way down from what it was. And so we want to take advantage of that cease-fire to make sure that Americans know, if they want to make the move -- and that's a decision they have to make. And it's not that it's risk-free.",

There's no military escort necessarily that they can trust. Even if they can, they have to cross front lines. But some people have been -- a significant numbers have made it out all the way to Port Sudan. That's an 800-kilometer, 500-mile, drive. But doing so requires access to a vehicle, food and fuel and water. And people sheltering in place in Khartoum very unlikely to be able to, unless they're extremely wealthy, because the banks are all closed, Boris -- it's very, very difficult to raise the money, even if you have got the cash in the bank, to even make these sorts of trips.

And, as you know, measles and cholera are actually endemic anyway in Sudan. But a polio release would set back a pretty successful campaign to eradicate that disease across Sudan. I think cholera would also be a massive trigger, if it did get out of that lab. It would be endemic anyway in Khartoum. It is the sort of disease that preys on vulnerable people who don't have access to clean water. And that would really define pretty much everybody in Khartoum. And the other really important point to understand in this context is that only 16 percent of the hospitals there or clinics are even working.

It was interesting, because the hearing today in that court was actually about the extremism trial. And what they decided there is that Alexey Navalny would only have a very limited time, 10 days, to go through hundreds of documents about that trial to familiarize himself with what he is actually up against. And, of course, the court there ruled in favor of the prosecution, saying that Alexey Navalny would only have until May 5. And, apparently, on the sidelines of that hearing, he found out that there was also, in preparation, a terrorism trial against him as well in front of a military court, and that that trial was set to take place in secret. Now, there's very limited information, obviously, available about this. Kira Yarmysh, the spokeswoman for the Navalny organization, for the Anti-Corruption Foundation, she was saying that she believed it might be because Leonid Volkov, who is the chief of staff for Alexey Navalny, may have said something critical of Vladimir Putin on a YouTube channel. But it really is unclear whether it's only that or whether other things are in play as well, so, certainly, by all accounts, a devastating day for Alexey Navalny. On the one hand, you have that extremism trial that continues, where he faces up to 30 years, and then possibly up to 35 years, according to his organization, for the terrorism charges. And you did have his daughter on yesterday. And, of course, we all -- we all watched that interview, Jim, which was remarkable. And you could see how concerned she is about his health. He did, however, today joke even in the courtroom. Want to listen in to some of what he had to say.
