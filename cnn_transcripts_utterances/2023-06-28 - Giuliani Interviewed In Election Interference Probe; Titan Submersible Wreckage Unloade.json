And CNN has exclusively learned that investigators recently interviewed Rudy Giuliani. He was of course one of Trump's key operatives in the aftermath of his defeat and one of the most vocal proponents of baseless election conspiracy theories. CNN's Katelyn Polantz is here for us. Katelyn, obviously, Giuliani was a very big player. One of the biggest players. What do they want to know from him?",

He was trying to reach out to state legislatures. And so, this is a really intriguing development in the special counsel's investigation into January 6th, Donald Trump and the top people around him.They've interviewed many, many people. They've brought lots of people into the grand jury. They had subpoenaed Giuliani actually several months ago, for at the very least, documents. And then it seemed to be put on hold. The special counsel's office came in. Now he's coming in, sitting for this voluntary interview. The circumstances of that are really atypical. What is the reason that they want to talk to him and that he would be willing to at this stage of the game? What would he even have to say that he hasn't said publicly on television or in press conferences before. So, a really interesting development. And how it fits into this, it could be quite a notable thing for the special counsel investigation.",

So, Brad Raffensperger is a just anybody, he's the Secretary of State whom Donald Trump called and was recorded saying, I want you to find those votes in Georgia for me to win the state, which was impossible. That was not something that could be done. He didn't win the state. And then afterwards, Raffensperger wrote about this in his book. He said I felt then and still believe today that this was a threat coming from Donald Trump.The very sort of thing he might want to be telling the special counsel's office sitting down with him and all of this comes at the same time where we know there's quite a focus on what was happening in individual states. The battleground states Trump wanted to declare that he won, even when he hadn't. And there's been a lot of investigation, not just around the fake electors, but other parts of what was happening in those states. So how this all comes together, there could be some sort of developments soon.",

Will she actually compete? The 26-year-old newlywed is listed as an entrant for the U.S. classic. That takes place this August. But her registration is not a guarantee that she will end up participating. Biles of course famously withdrew from some events during the Tokyo Olympics because she was suffering from a mental block where she lost track of her position midair. Also, SAG-AFTRA, the Hollywood actors' union was just put on notice by some A-list stars who warn they're prepared to go on strike if they don't get the contract, they say they deserve. More than 300 actors, including Oscar winner Meryl Streep and Golden Globe winner Quinta Brunson signed a letter to the Screen Actor's Guild leadership urging them not to settle with studio executives. Members have already voted to authorize a strike if a new deal is not reached before their current one expires just two days from now. And Costco says, if you do not have a membership card, don't use someone else's. Get your own or shop somewhere else. The retailer will now ask for a photo ID at checkout to make sure customers are not sharing membership cards. The company said it noticed that non-members have been sneaking in to use cards that don't belong to them and then paying in at self-checkout lanes. Boris, a page from Netflix maybe? SANCHEZ: Please send me that password when you get a chance. So a multinational investigation is currently underway to find out what exactly led to that catastrophic implosion of the Titan submersible. Today, we got a new look at images showing the debris recovered from the bottom of the North Atlantic ocean. Workers actually unloaded pieces of tarped panels off the Horizon Atlantic, which is the craft that was on that mission. CNN's Bianna Golodryga is in for Jake Tapper on \"THE LEAD\" today. And Bianna, you're going to be speaking to one of the engineers that was warning about potential problems on the Titan submersible.",

And these are some of the same people that did warn OceanGate back in 2018 that this could very well result from the expedition that these submersibles were going on had they not stuck to proper protocols and regulations. Which they said they were skirting.In fact, let me read to you what Bart Kepner, who was the forensic engineer I'll be interviewing said at the time. And he said that they were avoiding U.S. regulations by deploying the vessel in international waters and thus by circumventing Coast Guard rules where these regulations would have been enforced. Here's what he said to the \"New York Times,\" at the time. He said this letter that dozens of experts had signed was basically asking them to please do what the other submarines do, especially the passenger ones. And that's what really stands out. That there's always risks that go with these types of expeditions but the fact there were passengers, that there were civilians that were going along with these expeditions is why so many experts in the field were concerned. And voiced their alarm with the heads of the company that they should actually be doing more to stick to the regulations that their competitors were doing.",

The White House revealing this after reporters asked about strap marks that they saw on both sides of his face today. And if you use a CPAP, you know someone who does, you know exactly what we're talking about here. A spokesperson says, quote, since 2008 the president has disclosed his history with sleep apnea in thorough medical reports. He used a CPAP machine last night which is common for people with that history. CNN's Elizabeth Cohen is joining us live on this story. This is something that a lot of people struggle with and this is something that certainly could improve the health of people with this condition.",

If you have sleep apnea, which we've known about for many years now, a CPAP machine -- continuous positive airway pressure -- is a great way to treat it. What it does is it pushes air in to keep those airways open. Brianna, it's really not great that 30 million Americans have sleep apnea is estimated. But only about 6 million have been diagnosed with the condition. So is a good thing to treat it. Sleep apnea could sometimes be really a silent problem. People don't realize that they have it and it could cause big, big problems -- Brianna.",

It could be really terrible. People need to be evaluated. They need to see if they need a CPAP machine or need to see if they need some other treatment. But it really does need to be treated.

So not only are you not getting enough sleep -- and that could cause terrible problems for your heart, that could cause, you know, increased incidents of all sorts of heart issues or potentially stroke. It's just not getting enough sleep is bad for your mental health. It is just bad for pretty much every system in your body.But in addition, they're not taking in enough air. So it's, you know, there is quite obvious, if you're not getting in enough oxygen, that is bad. When you're awake you might be able to do something about it, but when you're asleep, instead you will just wake up. So it puts people at a higher risk for all sorts of heart issues. It puts them at a higher risk for all sorts of other issues, for breathing issues, for respiratory issues. So sleep apnea, if indeed you have it, it needs to be treated.",
