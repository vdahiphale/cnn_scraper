Well, the first time since the start of nationwide campus protests over the war in Gaza, U.S. President Joe Bidenis responding in-depth, trying to balance free speech alongside law and order. His comments come hours after intense scenes, as you can see right there on UCLA's campus, as police cleared a pro-Palestinian encampment and arrested more than 100 protesters. Mr. Biden told reporters demonstrations must be conducted within the rule of law. Have a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

It's against the law. Vandalism, trespassing, breaking windows, shutting down campus is forcing the cancellation of classes and graduations. None of this is a peaceful protest. Threatening people, intimidating people, instilling fear in people is not peaceful protest. It's against the law. Dissent is essential to democracy. But dissent must never lead to disorder or to denying the rights of others so students can finish the semester and their college education. Look, it's basically a matter of fairness. It's a matter of what's right. There's the right to protest, but not the right to cause chaos. People have the right to get an education, the right to get a degree. The right to walk across the campus safely without fear of being attacked. But let's be clear about this as well. There should be no place on any campus, no place in America for anti- Semitism or threats of violence against Jewish students. There is no place for hate speech or violence of any kind, whether its anti-Semitism, Islamophobia or discrimination against Arab-Americans or Palestinian- Americans, it's simply wrong. There's no place for racism in America. It's all wrong, it's un-American. I understand people have strong feelings and deep convictions. In America, we respect the right and protect the right for them to express that. But it doesn't mean anything goes. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Obviously, a university is a place where demonstrations are typically welcome, people voicing their opinion. The concern here for the university was that the longer this went, and people refused to leave, that then impacted, you know, public safety. There were some students who said that they didn't feel safe just because of some of the chance that they were being heard. But it's certainly a big challenge for law enforcement. Police here at UCLA certainly faced criticism after counter-protesters came, pro-Israel counter protesters actually attacked this camp at one night. And so, law enforcement was certainly on its back foot, getting a lot of criticism about where were you? What took so long? We're told that now, we see these agencies fusing together multiple agencies from across southern California here are now on site. And so, at least, we know that the information-sharing among those agencies is a lot better than it was before, but everyone is certainly waiting to see what happens next, and if they see a repeat of something that we saw here.",

There were a number of Dartmouth undergraduate students circled around the encampment, protecting them and around 100 or hundreds of people of community members and students there on campus.

The defense said they had probably a little less than an hour left to go. And it's questioning today of Keith Davidson. Earlier today, he testified that payments to the two women were not hush money or payouts, they were what he considered a quote, \"consideration, any civil settlement\". Now, before the testimony today, the judge also held another hearing on whether Donald Trump had again violated the gag order in this case.

The point that Jessica just brought up about not making this direct connection between Donald Trump and these negotiations.

NORM EISEN, FORMER WHITE HOUSE ETHICS &amp; SPECIAL COUNSEL:  It is the most valuable thing that Keith Davidson has to offer to the defense. And so, by definition, it's a negative for the prosecution. He didn't have direct contact with Donald Trump. However, he testified that he assumed the money for the payment to Stormy Daniels that the prosecution claims illegal campaign contribution, that, that was coming from Donald Trump. Davidson is a bookend witness because now, between the first witness, \"AMI\" publisher David Pecker who led us all the way up to the Stormy Daniels transaction, and Davidson, who does the Karen McDougal transaction and Stormy Daniels and all the way through to the end when it was exposed, you get almost complete corroboration of Michael Cohen story, the additional thing that Cohen will bring is his direct contacts with the former president.",

And we've since spent the last two weeks investigating that strike. Our stringer in Gaza, Mohammed Al-Sawel(ph), he went back to the scene of the strike, documenting visual evidence from the strike marks from shrapnel, a crater in the middle of the road, and pieces of shrapnel recovered at the scene. Three ammunitions experts who reviewed this visual evidence say that it was caused by a precision-guided munition deployed by the Israeli military. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) DIAMOND (voice-over):  This grainy home video is the closest Mona Al- Detellah(ph) will ever get to seeing her ten-year-old daughter. A stack of school certificates, a wardrobe of her favorite clothes, the perfume she used to wear, all that remains of the daughter Mona(ph) poured everything into. \"There is no Shahed(ph) now, every time she came in, she said mom, I would say my soul, my soul, my soul is gone.\" Shahed(ph) was one of ten children killed when an Israeli airstrike hit the crowded street in the Al-Maghazi Refugee Camp where she was playing with her friends. Her pink pants impossible to miss among the small bodies splayed around a foosball table in the chaotic aftermath. Two weeks later, the Israeli military still won't take responsibility for the strike that killed her. CNN provided the IDF with the coordinates and time of the attack based on meta-data from two different phones in the immediate aftermath. The IDF said they did not have a record of that strike. They said they carried out a strike at a different time than described, and that the collateral damage as described in the query is not known to the IDF. The IDF makes great efforts to mitigate harm to the civilian population from areas where strikes are being carried out. Evidence recovered and documented by CNN at the scene of the strike paints a very different picture of Israeli military responsibility. This circuit board and bits of shrapnel on walls and shop steps distinctively pockmarked and a small crater, barely a foot wide, all pointing three munitions experts to the same conclusion. Carnage was likely caused by a precision- guided munitions deployed by the Israeli military. CHRIS COBB-SMITH, WEAPONS EXPERT:  I've seen these strikes so many times. There's a relatively small crater in the road. There's no large shrapnel holes or fragmentation holes which would have been -- which would have been caused by say a mortar round or an artillery round. The fragmentation is consistent. DIAMOND (on camera):  So, in your view, this strike was caused by a precision-guided drone fired missile? COBB-SMITH:  Absolutely. This is an Israeli -- the local militias, the local forces do not have anything with this amount of sophistication. DIAMOND (voice-over):  Before carrying out the strike, Israeli drones would have surveilled the Al-Maghazi Refugee Camp from above. Seconds later, the missile hits the street below, landing in the middle of the road, just a few feet away from the foosball table where Shahed(ph) and her friends were playing that day, delivering certain death. Against all odds, these children have returned to play at the very same foosball table, including some of Shahed's(ph) friends. \"I miss her a lot\", Sama says, wearing a necklace Shahed(ph) made her. \"She says she was nearly killed with her friends, going home moments before the strike to drink water.\" Others were not as lucky. Eight-year-old Ahmed(ph) is fighting for his life, bleeding from his brain, his skull fractured, his chances of surviving are slim, his doctor explains. He is fighting not to become the 11th child killed in that same strike. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

The young people, college age people, are generally in Biden's camp. They were strong supporters of his in 2020. The support has dropped a bit already, maybe a bit -- more than a bit. But they're still strongly with Biden and probably will be in November. So, he's going to be held accountable for some of what happens on all the college campuses.",

And suppose this war has not reached the ceasefire stage. Suppose it is still going on hot and heavy. That means, inevitably, that when the colleges come back into session in August and September, you're going to see a lot more of this leading in a crescendo right up until election day.

We've been around longenough to watch Republicans do this over and over again, just as I was coming of age in Vietnam. This was a central premise of the Republican attacks on first President Johnson, and then supporting President Nixon and opposing the Democrats who were running against Nixon. So, this is a standard part of their repertoire and you can guarantee that it will continue as long as these protests are continuing and Trump knows how to capitalize on something like this. He's not so good as an incumbent trying to defend what's happening in his administration if you go back to 2020. But when he's the challenger, every single thing that goes wrong is the fault of the incumbent President Biden. And if he were only in office, there would be no problem at all, right?",

First, he gave an interview with the \"Milwaukee Journal\", I think \"Sentinel\" on Wednesday. Saying if the election was not honest, then you have to fight for the right of the country. And then, I think, days prior to that he gave this bombastic and rather chilling interview to \"Time Magazine\". And he said, among many things, I think we've got a little list for those who haven't had the chance to say it. In terms of deportation camps, calling for deportation camps for migrants, allowing red states to monitor women's pregnancies, firing U.S. attorneys who don't carry out orders to prosecute someone, pardon for all January 6th attack -- attackers, of course. The list goes on. Even saying many, you know, that he wouldn't withhold -- they would withhold support for U.S. allies attacked in Europe or Asia, which is obviously being a concern on this side of the pond.

And he can point to these interviews and the statements he made in the last couple of days in rallies as proof positive that he told Americans exactly what he was going to do and therefore he's entitled to do it.

Earlier in the day, the prosecution asked Davidson to explain that whole process of negotiating the payment made by Trump's personal attorney at the time, Michael Cohen. Judge Juan Merchan also held a gag order hearing first thing this morning to consider four new allegations from prosecutors where they say Donald Trump has violated, once again, that gag order. Asking again for a thousand dollar fine for those alleged violations, a thousand dollars each. The judge has not yet ruled on that issue. Joining us now, defense attorney and former federal prosecutor, Shan Wu. Shan, always good to see you. I mean, you know, picking up on that gag order, what was interesting was as everybody came back in after the lunch break, a little after 2:00 p.m. local time here. One of the attorneys on Donald Trump's legal team was essentially asking the judge to OK Donald Trump's posts on \"Truth Social.\" And the judge saying, if in doubt, steer clear. Adding that he didn't think there was any ambiguity in the order. The fact that they would ask the judge to basically proactively declare whether these posts would or would not violate the gag order, I imagine that doesn't often happen, Shan.",

You can imagine how much time it would take for the judge to constantly review ahead of time and pre-clear all of Trump's desired postings. So, that is exactly why the judge is saying, look, you know, I'm not into micromanaging. I'm not your communications specialist. I think the order is clear. So, you know, post at your own peril. That is an unusual situation. I can imagine a very discreet question to ask the judge about an area posting, but this idea of like, you know, here's all the stuff we want to say.

Sometimes they want to make Davidson look like he's very sleazy, questioning his ethics, which really pisses him off. Other times, they want him to say that Cohen is sleazy. That's all kind of this meandering jumble of attacks. Maybe they're doing it because they think Trump likes it when they're very aggressive and attack people. But there's no real theme to it. I mean, if you want to say that Davidson has poor memory, or he's actually lying about what the deals were, that's got to be the theme of the attack. If you want to say that the whole thing is Cohen's idea, then you just emphasize that Davidson had no direct contact with Trump and has no knowledge of what Trump's approving. But this sort of meandering, kind of, occasionally nasty attack on different areas, I just don't think is going to come across very well to the jury. It just makes the defense lawyer look kind of mean spirited. And they're not really getting any solid substance from it.",
