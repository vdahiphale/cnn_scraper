Then breaking news out of Pakistan, as all eight people trapped in a cable car have now been rescued. We'll have the latest. Plus, the leaders of Brazil, India, China and South Africa meet in person for the BRICS Summit, but Russia's president is sidelined with just a virtual appearance, we're live in Johannesburg. Well, we begin with some breaking news out of Pakistan. Pakistan's prime minister and a senator say all eight people have now been rescued from a cable car that was dangling over a ravine for hours, that includes six children and two adults. Rescuers had paused helicopter operations due to nightfall. But local zipliners continue to try and get them safely out. The children were heading to school when one of the cables snapped. Sophia Saifi joins me now live from Islamabad. And Sophia, this is such a relief, such good news, it's happened just in the last few minutes. What can you tell us?",

Those children between the ages of 10 and 15 had been suspended 900 feet above the ground for hours. It was part of the school run, this commute by a cable car in between the valleys. They were going from one point to the other when it -- one of the cables snapped, and that cage-like, homemade almost cable car that's made locally, there has been calls for better supervision after this incident. That had been suspended for many hours. We've been told that the children had been vomiting, they've been nauseous. They're very concerned parents who are on the ground, a lot of locals were there trying to make sure that they're rescued. This has been a joint effort by the military, by the rescue services, as well as by the locals who know that area best. It is the best outcome. It's been a very long day for these children as well as the two adults who were with them. And I think everyone is incredibly relieved that they can now go home, and I think they're going to have a day off from school tomorrow considering the ordeal that they've gone through today.

We know by one of the young children who were on -- in the cable car who spoke to local media from their phone when it still had battery, that two of the children were slipping in and out of consciousness.

These are cable cars made by the parts of old vehicles. There's not much oversight. But these kind of incidents are actually not very uncommon in this part of Pakistan. There are no roads in that area. There's a lot of criticism of the fact that there's not enough infrastructure for children to actually be able to go to school. People do want to send their kids to school, and this is the best way that they've come up with. So, there is a lot of need for oversight.

And now, we turn to northern Greece where hundreds of firefighters are battling more than 60 wildfires being driven by gale force winds. In Evros, the current epicenter, the bodies of 18 people were discovered on Tuesday. Greek authorities say they believe there may have been migrants who were caught in fast-moving fires. The flames forcing many to flee, 200 patients have been evacuated from regional hospitals, many were taken to this ferry, which has been converted into a makeshift medical center. Now, those left behind are using any tools including branches as you can see here to try and hoax the blazes. And it's not just Greece battling these extreme conditions. Other parts of the Mediterranean including Spain and Italy are also attacking wildfires exacerbated by the region's record hot and dry weather. France too is sweltering on Monday, it hit its hottest ever temperature at this time of year. Let's bring in CNN's Melissa Bell who is in the French capital monitoring all of this.

Two hundred hospital patients in northern Greece escaping wildfires that are now in their 4th day.

That means they're essentially cut off and on their own for the moment. The president of Chile, Gabriel Boric has been traveling through some of these affected areas and calling on people to heed evacuation orders.

So, even if the storm remains a tropical storm, even if it veers a little bit more towards the Dominican Republic. For Haiti where you have so much of that country that has been deforested, where you have hillsides that don't have many trees on the left because they've been taken down and to be used as fuel. That can lead just to devastating mudslides, we've seen that in the past even with a tropical storm, not even a hurricane. You know, you have these dangerous mudslides and frankly, Haiti's government is non-functioning on the best of days because of the security situation there, because of gang violence being out of control. And so, when a storm comes in and adds to the misery that people are already experiencing there, you know, certainly, Haiti doesn't need any more catastrophes. But here in the Caribbean, you know, we're experiencing a record ocean temperatures. And that is a fuel that hurricanes use to become stronger and for the hurricane season to last even longer or so. It's very concerning when you see so many storms beginning to develop, and when you hear weather experts say, the weather conditions that we are experiencing the Summer could lead to more storms and initially predicted for places like Cuba, like where I am, like Haiti, that is just news they don't need, they don't need any more catastrophes.",

So, we are entering that active period of the Atlantic hurricane season. So, this one is Tropical Storm Harold, it's got winds of 75 kilometers per hour. This one made landfall earlier today around 10:00 a.m. local time, South Padre Island, which is in south Texas. And it's pushing to the west, so it is still carrying some pretty heavy rain and some pretty gusty winds, up to 65 miles per hour. We do have flash flood warnings across Corpus Christi and areas to the west because of the intense rainfall rates. And as this storm continues to push westward, the rain should start to die down in the next couple of hours. The good news about this storm is it's fast-moving. And so, we're not going to have the rainfall totals that we could have if this were a slower-moving storm. So, the rains will get on out early this afternoon and push into portions of Mexico, that's where we actually could see the highest rainfall totals, and then we'll see rain spread into west Texas as well throughout the overnight hours. So, additional rainfall we're expected to see about 50 to 75 millimeters of rain could pick up as much as 100 across portions of northern Mexico. This is a very dry area, 88 percent of Texas is in a drought. The most extreme areas across central Texas and then southeast Texas, the storm basically missed those areas that needed the rain most, but we are in dry conditions, moderate to severe drought in the areas that is getting rain from Harold. So that is good news. It's actually beneficial rain. And it's also giving south Texas a brief break from the heat. We have excessive heat warnings, heat advisories, heat warnings in place, not only across the south, but up into the upper Midwest, northern areas of the United States, and even south Texas that's not under those advisories because of Harold getting that break just for about a day or so, and that the heat will be back. Dallas, Texas, 42 degrees on Friday, temperatures staying in the 40s, Oklahoma City in the upper 30s. So, intense heat spreading all the way as far north as Chicago, 44 degrees, the heat index, 41 is what it will feel like in Minneapolis. We could seek more than 400 potential records broken, maximum high temperatures as well as high minimum temperatures throughout the week. So that intense heat that the U.S. has been feeling for much of the Summer continues to march on. Christina?",

He says China shares similar views, a total of 69 countries have been invited to the summit, including all African states.

He said a lot of what you would expect, that he railed against sanctions against his country, he blamed others for the food shortages that are related to the war in Ukraine, and he said that they would help African countries get access to grain. None of that is especially new. I do think though that his presence even virtually, is important as one of the members, the founding members of the BRICS grouping.

The bond could be revoked. His bond is currently $200,000. He has to assure the court he would pay them so that he will say, I will be showing up for trial. On top of that, the conditions he has to meet include making sure he is not intimidating or retaliating against anyone associated in this case essentially. Any defendants or possible witnesses. There are potentially many people from the campaign, people from his own administration, his vice president, Mike Pence, who he's running against now for the Republican nomination for president. Donald Trump, with those conditions, one of the things different here in Georgia than in the three other cases that he is facing as a criminal defendant is that he didn't have as strict terms in those other cases. He was essentially released with the general conditions given to any defendant here. He's getting that $200,000 bond plus a very explicit warning that he must not intimidate using social media, where he likes to post about people, including Pence. But we are at the courthouse because there's a long process going on this week of getting all of these 19 defendants, Trump included, arrested. What they're doing before they go to the jail to be arrested -- and we've seen two of them already at the jail earlier today. They were arrested and then released there on bond. John Eastman and another defendant in this case. But what is happening here first is lawyers are negotiating with the district attorney's office to make sure that none of these defendants are going to be arrested, swarmed by police to be hauled into court so that they would be bringing themselves into the jail. Then they would be processed and released fairly quickly so they don't have to sit in jail for too long. Then we are on to more of the proceedings in this court case, which could take quite a bit of time and become very complex.

Let's bring in CNN political analyst Ron Brownstein, who recently wrote about just this. Ron, before we get to this debate tomorrow night, I want to talk about Trump's continuing popularity. We know, when he is on the stage tomorrow -- or when he is not on stage tomorrow -- he will still be the elephant in the room essentially. Can you first address how it is that Donald Trump, despite the many indictments against him, has remained the front-runner in the GOP by quite some margin? What tactics has he been deploying? RON BROWNSTEIN, CNN SR. POLITICAL ANALYST: The short answer is he's convinced most Republican voters to view the indictments the way he wants them to see it, which is a plot by the deep state to silence them, in effect, by sidelining him. He is tapping into what has become one of the most powerful fuels in the modern Republican coalition, the belief among conservative white Christians or the dominant bloc in the Republican coalition that they are the real victims of discrimination in a changing America. And Trump has called the prosecutors, the Black prosecutors involved in these cases, racist for going after him. He has said explicitly they're going after me but they are really trying to silence you. In all these ways, he's essentially extended the argument he has made from the beginning, since he came down the escalator, to encompass this case, which is that there are all these institutions in American life that are now trying to marginalize you and displace you and efface and erase the America that you understand it to be.

And as long as it does, the skepticism and suspicion of institutions that we are seeing reflected in the Republican rejection of these charges will also continue. The views that we are talking about are overwhelming in the Republican coalition. Over 80 percent of Republican voters say discrimination against whites is now as big a problem as bias against minorities in the U.S.. Over three quarters of Republican say Christianity in the U.S. is under assault. Roughly 70 percent, Christina, said society now punishes men just for acting like men. And though you don't hear the other candidates take these arguments into the political arena in quite a belligerent fashion as Trump, certainly they are there. Whether you're listening to Ron DeSantis and all his attacks on the wokeocracy or even Tim Scott in the way he talks about liberal institutions in U.S. life. This is what drives the Republican Party. Plus there's a self reinforcing element to all of this, which is that Trump is transforming the Republican electorate. He's been driving out the generally more culturally moderate, economically focused, college educated, suburban voters and replacing them with even greater strength among the more culturally populist and even reactionary blue-collar voters. So the electorate in 2024 for the Republican primaries is likely to be even Trumpier in effect than it was in 2016 because it will have more of the kinds of voters who are most receptive to his messaging and fewer of the voters who could be the basis for a coalition to oppose him in the primaries.",

I think most political consultants will say Trump is making the correct, hard political call to not get on stage withcandidates who are trailing him by 40 and 50 points in national polling, a deficit we rarely see in primarily polling and not give them the option. That's a rational decision for him. Now the ball is in the court of the other candidates. They have to make him regret and reconsider that decision by using his absence to make a case against him that he is not there to deflect. I don't often make predictions in politics but I will say that if the candidates spend the debate tearing each other apart, they have very little chance of convincing Trump to get on the stage with them in the next debate in September. I mean, the only way to get him to reconsider his posture is if they use this time effectively and he is not there to rebut the arguments they are making.",

DeSantis has a lot of institutional support. A lot of the Republicans who don't want Trump as a nominee, who don't think he can win, those power brokers, bet on DeSantis  early. But he is not connecting with voters. I can tell you just coming back from Iowa there was not a huge amount of interest in him among the voters that I spoke with. But he does have a lot of institutional support and if he can begin to make a better case for himself and, more importantly, a case for why voters should bypass the former president, he has something to build on. And Scott is I think the one who is best positioned to fill the vacuum that the disappointment in DeSantis has left. There is interest in polling in Ramaswamy. But we have seen this before in public races, like Herman Cain, Ben Carson, Michelle Bachmann. Candidates on the fringe have a moment when it's still warm out or even when the leaves are falling. But when we get to the winter in Iowa and New Hampshire, most of them wither along with the temperature. So I will say DeSantis and Scott have the most to gain. But if they can use it and not only make a strong case for themselves but get over the threshold, which is 55 percent to 60 percent of Republican voters, who say they want Donald Trump. If you don't change, it doesn't matter how much you improve perceptions of your own candidacy.",

Ukraine's president is shoring up support across Europe as his forces struggle to break through Russian lines. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy met with his Serbian (ph) counterparts on Tuesday in Athens. Both leaders were there for a summit with Balkan and European Union leaders and are publicly supporting each other's efforts to join the E.U. As to recent developments on the ground, Russia says they destroyed more Ukrainian drones near Moscow. Officials in Ukraine say the Zaporizhzhya region has been hit 96 times by shells and missiles in just the last 24 hours. I want to turn to CNN's Nick Paton Walsh who's standing by. Nick, given you are in Zaporizhzhya, what is this barrage of missiles been like? What toll has it taken on the region in the last 24 hours?",

Ukrainians saying a very high level within the Ukrainiangovernment they have got troops in the north of there. Even saying they've taken 20 civilians, who somehow managed to live inside there during this intense fighting. They've taken them to safety. At the same time as you mentioned, Christina, that Volodymyr Zelenskyy is now on his way back from a tour of Europe. It's fair to say been quite successful. We seen these periodically -- Denmark, the Netherlands, Greece; him essentially meeting allies and trying to get more weaponry from NATO there. And despite the fact literally four days ago, Ukraine was saying they're not going to get the F-16s they needed at all this year. That's still the case. But that tour has resulted in a much more concrete timetable; 19 from Denmark, possibly as many as 42 from the Netherlands. Zelenskyy's saying Greece would help with training as well. So a concretization of that desperate need from Ukraine to see F-16s in their skies to try and dampen Russian air superiority. At the same time, we are hearing repeated reporting from Western officials, suggesting they don't think the Ukrainian counteroffensive is going as fast as it could be doing. A remarkable thing frankly for Ukraine's key ally to be doing publicly, criticizing their counteroffensive turn as it is at its most intense throes but, at the same time, NATO responding to sustained pressure from Ukraine and giving that vital F-16 support. So Zelenskyy possibly happy with what he's achieved in his brief tour of some European countries but probably returning now to an exceptionally complex front line. They are seeing some success but nothing like the pace that somehow Western officials felt they would be able to achieve in August alone, Christina.",
