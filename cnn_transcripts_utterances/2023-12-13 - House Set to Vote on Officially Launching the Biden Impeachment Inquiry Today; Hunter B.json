Let's bring in our political panel, Astead Herndon of \"The New York Times\" and Leigh Ann Caldwell of \"The Washington Post.\" Leigh Ann, I'll start with you. That's kind of rich coming from Jim Jordan, who again did not comply with a subpoena from his own colleagues about the attack the Capitol on January 6th. When is your sense of how far this is going to go? Once it starts, it's kind of hard to stop an impeachment inquiry, right?LEIGH ANN CALDWELL, EARLY 202 CO-AUTHOR, THE WASHINGTON POST: Yeah, absolutely. Not only did Jim Jordan defy a subpoena, the entire -- the Trump Administration set a new precedent during his years in complying with Congress. They refused to repeatedly, over and over again, and it mostly went to the court system. But, yes, it's extremely hard if an impeachment inquiry is opened for them not to impeach because you know what's going to happen then, Dana, is that then there will be headlines saying if they don't move to impeachment saying Biden exonerated. And that's probably not something that Republicans want in the middle of a presidential election. But, I will say that this is politically tricky for Republicans. And that's why it took them several months to actually hold this formal vote on the House floor. There's a lot of vulnerable Republicans, he didn't want to do it. Now, sources tell me that as long as these Republicans focus on gathering more information that this is just an inquiry, they just need to find the truth, then it becomes more politically manageable, Dana.",

And I think that qualifier, the word \"financially\" is important because, once again, it shows another change, another change in the story. First, it was no involvement. Then I never talked to anyone. And then we find out about the dinners, the meetings, the phone calls and everything else. Now, it's -- he wasn't involved in the business financially.

      "sentences": "Yeah. I mean, I think this is the argument that Republicans have been trying to put together for the better part of the last couple of years. The idea that Hunter was trading on his father's influence and also that there could be a specter of involvement from the president. I think it's important to say that they have not produced any real evidence on this front. And this impeachment inquiry is another attempt for them to try to use the levers of government to gather that evidence rather than what we typically see, which is the opposite, and that evidence actually informing how the lawmakers act.And so, I think what we hear from Jim Jordan here is a continuance of kind of banging that drum. But the evidence kind of politically is that this has only really been a motivating factor for the Republican base. The Republicans have tried to make this kind of a flattened corruption argument between Democrats and Republicans, or make Biden the same as Trump. And voters haven't really bought that. What is true though is that there's a Republican majority among their own electorate that is driving the new speaker and is really pushing them to get aligned on this inquiry vote.",

And Jim Jordan has indicated that he's going to hold Hunter Biden in contempt because he did not show up for that closed- door deposition today. But one last thing is that some Republicans are warning that this really could backfire politically. They note that during the first impeachment of Donald Trump, in the middle of that, Donald Trump saw his highest approval ratings of his presidency because the public did not like that he was getting impeached. They didn't want an impeachment. They didn't want the chaos. And so, that's something the Republicans are concerned about. But, they are acting very aggressively right now, Dana.",

He was abducted on Kibbutz Nir Oz on October 7th. We met today with President Biden and other people from the Administration. It was a terrific, terrific meeting and conversation. I think we all came away feeling that as families of hostages of American-Israeli hostages, which are eight out of total of 138 hostages, we felt that -- we felt before and we were only reinforced in seeing and believing that we could have no better friend in Washington or in the White House than President Biden himself and his Administration.",

And what I can tell you is that Abigail is a miracle. She's a light in this very dark time. And metaphorically, a lot of our families that are here today, we are all one big family looking to get all of these people's sons and fathers and mothers out, that we are here because the president and his team have been bringing out light in this dark time.And Abigail, who is a four-year-old, is a symbol of that light. As we come to the Christmas holiday, I hope that the Pope continues to speak and others around the world not only pray, but pray for us, pray for our families, pray for our leaders, pray for the president and that the Pope and all that he can do is to push. We love a Christmas miracle. We would love all our loved ones to come back and be with us for Christmas. So when you talk about the Pope, our hope is that he and others like himself will influence these people in the Middle East that are all actors in this part of getting these hostages out. And that is all of our hope for a Christmas miracle.",
