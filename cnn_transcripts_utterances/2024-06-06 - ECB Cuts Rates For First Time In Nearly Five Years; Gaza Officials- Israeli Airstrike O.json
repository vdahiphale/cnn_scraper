Officials in Gaza say an Israeli strike killed at least 45 people who were sheltered in a school. And 80 years after D-Day, President Biden warns democracy is at risk once again. Live from New York, it is Thursday, June 6th. I'm Julia Chatterley in for Richard Quest, and this is QUEST MEANS BUSINESS. A warm welcome to the show once again, and tonight, the European Central Bank charting a new course against inflation as it cuts interest rates for the first time in nearly five years. The ECB lowering its benchmark rate by a quarter of a percentage point to 3.75 percent. The ECB said price pressures have eased and the inflation outlook has improved, still it warned the fight is not yet over. And ECB president, Christine Lagarde said the bank is prepared to change direction if required. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

What is more interesting to me, as important as it is and happiness for consumers of course to see interest rate start to come down across Europe, it is less about the cut itself and more about what they said about inflation and growth.

Analysts are not expecting the bank to cut rates at its meeting in July. The ECB raising forecast for inflation, as you said two-and-a-half percent from the 2.3 percent it predicted in March. Of course, the silver lining to some of this is that one of the reasons why inflation has ticked up is because economic growth is starting to recover in Europe. We are seeing strong wage growth, signs of life returning to the Euro area economy, which was only narrowly avoided a recession just last year. And the ECB upgrading its growth forecast, as you pointed out for this year, to 0.9 percent from 0.6 percent it predicted in March.

Some analysts don't think we will see a cut from the Fed until next year. Inflation has been more stable in the US, coming down more slowly. Economic growth in the US, much more robust than in Europe generally, although we are starting to see those economic fortunes converge. But no rate cut is expected from the Fed, and that also complicates the picture because the ECB and other central banks will be hesitant to move too far ahead of the Fed at the risk of importing inflation if their currencies weaken against the dollar as a result.

Russian forces saw an opportunity and that seemed to be part of their calculation to carry out this larger offensive in the northeast. But with each new weapon system and each new change in restrictions like this one allowing Ukrainians to hit inside Russian territory, a long lead time and then some limitations placed. The motivation for that is because President Biden and others, they want to reduce the risk of escalation with Russia. But that man, you're seeing there, Zelenskyy says that those delays and limitations are making it harder, not just for them to defend themselves, right, but to have any sort of hope of winning this war. I did see today that the French announced they are going to be sending mirage fighter jets to Ukraine. So you're seeing some of the allies more forward leaning than others in terms of weapons systems, et cetera.

It's always good to remember how important the combination of activities that happened on D-Day that really made the world what it is today. And frankly, we talk a lot about how important it is to have an experience globally with people of different cultures, religions, languages, practices, and how much a rich environment that makes for career enjoyment.

But also surely it's an opportunity too to look at products that involve sort of some protection clothing, breathable wear.

But we also have a very large menu of products that we've internally invented, which help keep you cool and keep you, you know, very much more comfortable in hot weather. And we haven't done frankly as good a job promoting those. We hope that the next launch of the intuitive machines, lunar launcher, which we've signed up for, which will be about this -- the end of this year, we're going to have not only our Omni-Heat reflective, but we're going to have a product we call sun deflector, which will be also present on the lunar lander, which will be used to deflect the sun rays and heat away from the components. So, we're going to have a bunch of our best stuff on the moon.
