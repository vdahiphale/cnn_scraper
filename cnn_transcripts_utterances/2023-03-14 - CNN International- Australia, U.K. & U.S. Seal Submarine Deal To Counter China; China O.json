But China, you know, does not have the underwater capabilities of the United States. They just don't have the submarine technology, even though they're making, you know, vast inroads in outer space, and in their own, you know, missile development, hypersonic weapons, but submarines, they're still way behind, aircraft carriers as well. And so just now to have the United States, basically, transforming Australia's was obviously very key strategically. You know, their underwater capability will be completely transformed within 25 years. They're helping, you know, expand the U.S. military presence in the Philippines. They're welcoming Japan's growing its own military and expanding its purpose. Of course, they're selling billions of dollars in weapons here to Taiwan. And all of this is because President Biden -- and the Trump administration before him, Max believed that China is the leading long term threat to global peace and stability. And they're doing what they can to try to prevent some sort of huge potential blow up here, especially given the series of international incidents, just of late were from the spy balloon to the, you know, thought that China might be arming Russia and Ukraine, there's that possibility. And with President Xi, consolidating his power, he basically now has the ability to do whatever is on his list. So, of course, the U.S. is hoping that this sort of partnership, this AUKUS partnership, will help possibly maybe prevent China's potential eyes on this island in Taiwan, Max.",

And I have to say that the former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers, the current president of the United States, and a lot of experts, Sheila Bair used to run the FDIC have been telling us again, and again, the U.S. banking system is safe, and it's the strongest it's been at any point since the financial crisis of 2008.But you still will have these flash points of weakness, because the Fed has raised interest rates so much. Let me show you some of these regional banks from yesterday, just unbelievable declines for names like First Republic and First Horizon, PacWest Bancorp, Western Alliance Bank, and others. This morning, I am watching some of those bounce off the lows, so we'll be carefully watching to see if they attract interest. We also know that a senior Treasury Department official telling CNN yesterday that the outflow of deposits that they had feared is starting to slow. And you're starting to see people look around for higher yields on their banking deposits. So that's probably a good thing for people's personal finances to make sure that if you have money in a bank account, that you're getting as much return as you can on that. But indeed, a period of turmoil here and you saw that the bond market yesterday, you saw the biggest one day rally in U.S. government bonds since 1987. And that was just a sign of sort of the fear and the changing expectations of interest rates, Max, going forward. A week ago, it was sort of baked into the Fed could raise interest rates and other half point, that is not the case today of futures markets, Fed funds future markets, saying more like 25 basis points is more likely because the Fed will not want to roil the banking system here, Max.",

We continue to watch the leaders of Ukraine, and China reportedly plan to speak next week for the first time since the Russian invasion.

Neither Ukraine nor China has confirmed what is said to be a virtual meeting, the U.S. will only officially say it's been encouraging Chinese President Xi Jinping to reach out to President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.Salma Abdelaziz joins us with a closer look at this potential meeting.

      "sentences": "The context here is absolutely everything. You're right, Max. President Xi Jinping has now secured his third term and unprecedented third term. And he seems to now be looking outwards, looking towards foreign policy, trying to play a more active role on the international stage. Take, for example, just last week, not to get too much into a sidebar, but that Saudi-Iran deal that was brokered by Beijing.And now Beijing looking to get potentially involved in trying to secure some sort of deal or being a peacemaker, and negotiator when it comes to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. So we have these reports that there's going to be a virtual meeting held at some point between President Xi Jinping and President Zelenskyy, that's something that the United States welcomes and encourages, but it comes off of the back of a potential meeting that we're expecting next week in Moscow. President Xi is expected to meet with President Putin in Moscow. These leaders have met dozens of times, but experts say their relationship is growing ever closer in the wake of the invasion of Ukraine. President Putin just a few months ago was boasting how their relationship was reaching new frontiers, that there is no limit to the relationship between China and Russia. The United States has been highly concerned because intelligence officials say China could be preparing to send weapons to Russia to replenish its arsenal. You also saw just last month, this 12-point plan coming from Beijing. It was a proposal essentially for peace coming from China, again, that's trying to position itself as a neutral power broker when it comes to Ukraine. That was dismissed by the United States, seen as Beijing trying to side with Russia in this conflict. But it matters, of course, when you're talking about a superpower like China, trying to get involved on the world stage, increasing or growing its relationship there with President Putin, who very much needs friends right now. And then finally, I have to point to President Biden as well, who is also expecting a call from President Xi Jinping in the coming weeks and months. So a lot of geopolitics playing around here. But for President Zelenskyy, if this call takes place, it's going to be absolutely crucial for him to express the importance of what's happening on the ground and to try to gain --",

      "sentences": "Max, what we're seeing here in Kramatorsk is a repetition of what is basically being played out day after day across this country ever since Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine a little bit more than a year ago.The Ukrainian authorities say a Russian projectile, whether it's a rocket or missile, it's not clear, slammed into the side of a four- storey apartment block, somewhat similar to the ones I'm standing in here, killing at least one person, wounding several others. In the hours since then, when we arrived on the scene, already, residents were cleaning up the rubble from their own apartments, knocking out shattered window from -- glass from their windows. Very close by, there was a kindergarten where volunteers and teachers were cleaning up. They'd been supplied with plywood from the local administration to board up those buildings. Thankfully, none of the children were there because they have been evacuated some six months ago, have not been going to the school. The school's director tells me who was knocked to the ground by the blast at about 8:30 this morning. This is just one example, again, of what we see taking place all across this country. Every day, there's a report, one civilian, two civilian, servant civilians killed by a Russian rocket strike in the north, in the east, in the south. This is the war that is being waged against Ukraine right now. There are soldiers, service personnel on both sides of the frontlines who are dying, also killing each other. But civilians are also being mutilated in this deadly conflict. Kramatorsk is a city perhaps somewhat similar to the south eastern city of Bakhmut that has been this deadly battleground between both militaries for the better part of six months. And that is the kind of scenario that the Ukrainian military is trying to prevent from expanding further to reaching a city like this. That said, there are communities all across eastern Ukraine that are living with this constant threat. This city is about 25 kilometers, some 15 miles from a very active frontline. You can hear periodically, the echo of artillery in the distance. And there are still families here, there are still businesses open. And when you talk to the people in the immediate aftermath of this deadly strike, nobody's complaining. Nobody's crying. Everybody's just kind of cleaning up and getting on with it. Jose Andres, the chef, his world central kitchen was on the scene within hours of the strike distributing food to people. And this is just a reality that, quite sadly, Ukrainians have become quite inured to. Max?",

The Federal Reserve has already launched a review into its supervision of Silicon Valley Bank amid widespread criticism that essentially took his eye off off the ball there.
