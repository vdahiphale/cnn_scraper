The U.S. Coast Guard is redirecting its search this morning after a Canadian military plane picked up underwater noises.Now, there are five people on board running out of oxygen, running out of time. A new round of ships left Newfoundland this morning to join the search efforts. Now, noises are not uncommon in the open ocean, but rescuers say they heard banging sounds in 30-minute intervals, regular spaces. An ocean expert and friend of one of the missing sub passengers told us that fact could be significant. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TOM DETTWEILER, OCEAN EXPLORER AND FRIEND OF PAUL-HENRI NARGEOLET: The banging sounds are interesting because knowing P.H. Nargeoloet and his experience with submersibles and his background in submarines, this is exactly how he would try to indicate that they were still alive and tries to communicate with surface. He would do some banging. He would do it on a regular schedule so that it was distinguishable from the background noises that are in the ocean all the time. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

It is understandably and inherently dangerous.

You mentioned the employees there. An industry group also jumped in, and there was a letter that was found by The New York Times from them in which they said about what was happening at OceanGate. Our apprehension is that the current experimental approach adopted by OceanGate in developing this craft could result in negative outcomes from minor to catastrophic that would have serious consequences for everyone in the industry.And it went on to say, your marketing material advertises that the Titan design will meet or exceed the DNVGL safety standards. These were standards developed a long time ago for this type of vessel. Yet it does not appear that OceanGate has the intention of following these class rules. Your representation is, at minimum, misleading to the public and breaches an industry-wide professional code of conduct we all endeavor to uphold. Simply put, Kate, years ago, there were people in the company and outside the company saying your approach to developing this craft is too experimental, too outside the norms, and is not being submitted to the standards that worldwide maritime organizations expect. Bottom line is, a vehicle like this, engineers will say, should be tested to maybe two, three, four, five times the amount of pressure you expect to encounter. And the question is, was this one tested to that level at any point?",

You were part of the first expedition to locate the wreckage of the Titanic, but you had an experience down there that may, in some ways, rival this. Did you actually get stuck without communications for a while? And what was that like?DR. JOE MACINNIS, MEMBER OF FIRST EXPEDITION TO LOCATE TITANIC WRECKAGE:  Well, on my second dive to the Titanic, I made one in 1987 with the French government research sub and then with the Russian research sub from Russian Academy of Sciences in 1991. And on that dive, we made 17 dives to the Titanic. I co-led the expedition. We made 17 dives. We did the science. And on the last dive, I climbed into the sub with the chief pilot and we went down to the Titanic and landed on the floor of the pilot house and spent some time reflecting about what we'd done and what we'd seen and having a moment of respect for the ocean and for the Titanic accident. And as we were about to leave, the pilot put on the thrusters, up we went and stopped about meter above the floor and then he put it back down. [10:10:10] So, he found out very quickly that we were stuck. And so, wisely, because he was an excellent pilot, called in the second sub. And they came in. The two pilots talked about what the situation was. And we had put our -- the pilot had slid his left side skid underneath the sub. When he landed, the skid went under some telephone wire. And so with the help of the second sub and conversations between the two, we moved up and down and backwards and were able to kind of tiptoe out of that pretty tense situation. But, again, it was great coordination, great pilots, great submarines.",

Nargeolet is one of the members of the team and you couldn't have a better person with you in a situation like this than P.H., who's made 35 dives to the Titanic, who is calm under pressure. The best kind of leadership will be coming from P.H.

And that's something that you really feel when you take your shoes off and stepped into that vessel sitting in it. It was cramped. It's small. It's roughly the size of a minivan, which, of course, is why it can only fit five people. There's just a small makeshift bathroom set up on board.But bear in mind, again, this was designed for passengers to sit inside for a short amount of time, eight, nine, ten hours. They've now been trapped down there, these five passengers, for 72 hours. So, it was never designed to handle people for that length of time. We've also talked a lot about the off-the-shelf components on board that you notice as you enter the Titan, one of the big things, the gaming controller that's used to operate the vessel. But OceanGate has stressed that they have used some of those components to streamline the construction of the vessel, but that they cut no corners when it came to the pressure vessel, that actual vessel that people are sitting inside, the carbon fiber and titanium shell, they said it was safe and that it was tested. But, of course, as Tom Foreman went through a little bit earlier, we now know that some former employees and industry specialists had raised some concerns about the construction.",

That's your money bite from this testimony.And also, inflation pressures continue to run too high. It will be a long way to go to get inflation back down to 2 percent, a long way to go. That's why markets are down this morning, because the Fed is promising more interest rate hikes ahead. There have been ten. Then there was that pause and we've got a meeting coming up in July where a lot of people think the Fed will have to raise interest rates again. The job market is strong.

But these had been double-digit numbers for many of these areas. In France, it's 5.1 percent. You compare that to the United States at 4 percent. You can see we've made progress on the inflation front but not enough progress for Jerome Powell.So, this is a global story, the inflation story, and the big concern from central bankers is that those numbers are just going to get sticky. They will get harder and harder to have more meaningful improvement there. That's where the higher rates come in. So, John, if you're watching this at home and you're looking to buy a house or to borrow money for a car down later this year, you could have higher costs to borrow.
