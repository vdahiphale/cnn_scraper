      "sentences": "It not only ignores the interests and suffering of Ukrainians who are affected by the war the most. It not only ignores reality but also gives Putin the political space to continue the war and pressure the world to bring more nations under control. Any parallel or alternative attempts to seek peace are in fact efforts to achieve, allow instead of an end to the war as a global initiative. The peace formula has already existed for two years. And maybe somebody wants a Nobel Prize for their political biography for frozen truce instead of real peace. But the only prices Putin will give you in return are more suffering and disasters.We must restore nuclear safety. Energy must stop being used as a weapon. We must ensure food security. We need to bring home all our captured soldiers and civilians possibly deported to Russia. We must uphold the U.N. Charter and guarantee our right, Ukraine's right to territorial integrity and sovereignty, just as we do for any other nation. We need to withdraw the Russian occupiers, which will bring an end to the hostilities in Ukraine. And we must hold those responsible for war crimes accountable. We need to prevent ecocide and stop the destruction of nature caused by the war. And we must not allow a second or sword face of this Russian invasion, and we need to make it clear the war is over. This is the peace formula. What part of this could be unacceptable to anyone who upholds the U.N. Charter? If someone in the world seeks alternatives to any of these points or tries to ignore any of them, it likely means they themselves want to do a part of what Putin is doing. The point they ignore reveals the desire they're hiding. And when the Chinese-Brazilian duo tries to grow into a choir of voices with someone in Europe, with someone in Africa saying something alternative to a full and just peace, the question arises. What is the true interest? Everyone must understand you will not boost your power at Ukraine's expense. And the world has already been through colonial wars and conspiracies of great powers and the expense of those who are smaller, every country, including China, Brazil, European nations, African nations, Middle East, all understand why this must remain in the past. And Ukrainians will never accept why anyone in the world believes that such a brutal colonial past, which suits no one today can be imposed on Ukraine. Now, instead of a normal, peaceful life, I want this for my people real peace and justice. And I'm asking for your support from all nations of the world. We do not divide the world. I ask the same of you do not divide the world. Be United Nations. And that will bring us peace. Thank you.",

Alex, we just heard President Zelenskyy just a few moments ago appeal to the United Nations to remain united when it comes to the subject of Ukraine, but that's not really the case. Tell us a little bit more about what you thought in terms of what stood out from Zelenskyy's speech and the challenge that he has in the days and months ahead.",

There's an aid package that we expect, at least at first, to be around some $375 billion. But, Jim, there's $6 billion of presidential authority for Ukraine that's going to be expiring in less than a week before the end of the month that the U.S. has every intention, the Pentagon says, of rolling out. So, we could see some massive aid packages in the billions of dollars in the coming days.President Zelenskyy will certainly be asking yet again for those U.S. weapons, long range missiles called ATACMs to be allowed to be used inside of Russia. But, really, the big focus tomorrow at the White House is going to be this plan for victory that President Zelenskyy is going to present to President Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris. And I'm told by someone who got a briefing from Zelenskyy, who got the broad strokes of what is intended to be presented, is that it focuses on long-term military and economic support, lifting those restrictions on those weapons that I just mentioned so they can be fired into Russia, and long-term security assurances, so what happens in the future when Ukraine -- if Ukraine were to get attacked again, how would the U.S. respond? But we don't have too many details, and you can be sure that the president and his top aides are going to be looking for specifics tomorrow at the White House. Jim?",

Your impression of what President Zelenskyy had to say, and apparently he is going to be presenting this what he's calling a victory plan to the president tomorrow. What do you want to hear from Zelenskyy? REP. MADELEINE DEAN (D-PA):  Well, I'm always impressed when the president speaks, especially on such a large stage, as he did this morning. I had the chance to meet with the president in Ukraine after we passed the supplemental. What an amazing man, a man of courage who just stands and represents everything that we see in patriotism and protecting democracy. As you know, there's a $5.8 billion drawdown and I know very desperately that they need the weapons and the materiel. What I have said all along is Ukraine, for these past 2.5 years, United States must give Ukraine everything it needs to win. We have to finish that sentence and say to win. And so I'm glad it will be a speech about victory because the United States plays a critical role. We can be part of the peacemaking.",

Average price of eggs is around $3 right now. It was about that four years ago as well, although a little dip in that.People care about the cost of living, but what we can say is, look what's going on. Manufacturing jobs are up. Jobs are up. Almost 16 million jobs created in this administration, which she has been a key figure in. She's going to Pittsburgh today to talk about manufacturing, and to talk about the jobs surrounding manufacturing. One of the things she's going to point out is that the contrast is Donald Trump cares about those who own the big skyscrapers. She cares about those who build and clean them. Jobs are important. The economy is improving. You saw the Fed drop the rate half a point. We think they'll go another half point by the end of the year. Expenses are down, cost of borrowing is down, chance to invest in your company is increasing. So, the economy is good.

And we know that being tough on China and imposing tariffs, those are popular moves when you ask voters.But I've got to tell you, talking to mainstream economists out of all parts of the Trump agenda, it's his trade agenda that scares them the most. They worry all this is going to backfire on the very people that Trump claims to be trying to help. And he has made a number of misleading or even false claims when it comes to tariffs. First, Trump has repeatedly claimed that it's foreign countries that are paying tariffs, but that's just not how it works, right? These are taxes paid by American businesses when they buy stuff from overseas. And study after study shows that Americans have borne almost the entire cost of Trump's tariffs on China. And to date, federal data shows that Americans have paid more than $250 billion on Trump's tariffs on solar panels, steel, aluminum and Chinese-made goods. Trump has also repeatedly claimed that tariffs don't raise prices. Just yesterday in Savannah, he says that tariffs will not cause inflation. But, again, economists, they're saying the exact opposite. They fear that all of this will reignite inflation. The Peterson Institute has found that Trump's trade proposals would cost the typical middle income family $2,600 a year at least, and that doesn't even account for the almost definite retaliation that you would get from other countries who, of course, would not take any of this lying down. We even heard from some Republicans pushing back on Trump's trade proposals. Mitch McConnell says he's no fan of tariffs because, yes, they will raise prices on consumers. And earlier this week, Trump's own vice president, Mike Pence, he had an op-ed in The Wall Street Journal where he advised Republicans to pledge to deliver better trade deals that increase prosperity, not protectionist tariffs that make products more expensive. One other point here, Trump has repeatedly argued that his tariffs will make jobs come roaring back. But again, experts, they worry the exact opposite will happen. The right leaning tax foundation has warned that Trump's tariffs and retaliation would wipe out 1.4 million jobs. Listen, none of this is to say that Trump is not raising some legitimate points on trade, especially when it comes to China. We've heard from Republicans, Democrats, business leaders that China does not play fair on trade. But, Jim, the question is whether or not your proposed solution causes more harm than it does good.",
