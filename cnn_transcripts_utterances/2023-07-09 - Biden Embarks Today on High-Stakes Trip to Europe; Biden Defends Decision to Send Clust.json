Biden's first stop will be the U.K. where he's expected to arrive later today.While in London, he'll meet with the Prime Minister and King Charles, who will then travel to Vilnius, Lithuania where he will meet with the Lithuanian President and attend the annual NATO Summit. Finland is NATO's newest member and the President's final stop will be Helsinki. There, will attend his first Nordic summit with the leaders of Sweden, Norway, Iceland, Denmark and Finland. Now this is all happening while Biden is on the defensive over his decision to include cluster bombs in his administration's latest military aid package to Ukraine. Human rights groups oppose cluster bombs which carry dozens or even hundreds of smaller explosives known as bomblets. Now sometimes the bomblets don't explode on impact on the unexploded ordnance can kill and maim civilians years later. More than 120 countries have outlawed cluster bombs, but not the U.S., Russia or Ukraine. For more on the President's upcoming trip, here's CNN's Priscilla Alvarez. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

But that summit is going to be key. And it is one in which there will likely be discussions about whether or not Ukraine will join NATO.Now, on Friday, National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan told reporters that it's unlikely that coming out of the summit, Ukraine will be joining NATO, but they could be discussing steps forward. And that is something that President Biden himself has acknowledged would be premature for Ukraine to join now, but they could be discussing what that looks like moving forward. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN, (D) U.S. PRESIDENT: I don't think there is unanimity in NATO about whether or not to bring Ukraine into the NATO family now, at this moment, in the middle of a war. For example, if you did that, then, you know, we -- and I mean, what I say we're determined to commit every inch of territory that is NATO territory. It's a commitment that we've all made no matter what. If the war is going on, then we're all in war. You know, we're at war with Russia, if that were the case. So I think we have to lay out a path for the rational path for Russia, for -- excuse me, for Ukraine to be able to qualify to get into NATO. NATO is a process that takes some time to meet all the qualifications, and from democratization to a whole range of other issues. So in the meantime, though, I've spoken with Zelenskyy at length about this. And one of the things I indicated is the United States would be ready to provide while the process was going on, and it's going to take a while, while that process is going on to provide security all -- the security we provide for -- for Israel, providing the weaponry, the needs, the capacity to defend themselves.

The group returned home on Saturday greeted by supporters and church leaders in a ceremony. In this speech they pledged to return to the battlefield and join the counter offensive against Russia. The group was released on the 500th day of the war. To mark that milestone, Ukraine's Deputy Defense Minister listed some of the country's achievements, she said one of them, was striking the bridge that links Russia to occupy Crimea. Now, her statement appears to be the first time Ukraine has acknowledged it was responsible for the bridge explosion in October, and over the past day, more attacks have been reported by both sides. On Saturday, Russian officials said the Belgorod border region had come under heavy shelling from Ukraine and happened on the same day that Russia shell the eastern Ukrainian town of Lyman killing at least nine people according to Ukraine.

The gains that have been made by the Ukrainian Armed Forces certainly haven't been as substantial, as had been anticipated. But of course, this is deeply controversial. The U.S. itself began phasing out the use of cluster munitions back in 2016. And there has been some backlash from even the U.S.' own NATO allies.

Of course, the probability of any weapon is -- is really bad for the human lives. But it really depends on how it's used. Because we had in -- in Ukraine within the last years, the Russians using anti-ship missiles, bombing the shopping mall in the peaceful town, the, you know, recreation center, hotel in -- near Odessa, war, for instance, yes, they used cluster ammunition to fire the train station in Kramatorsk, where there were 3000, mainly women and children fleeing, you know, so that's the point.While working on the recommending war crimes, we also can say that the Ukrainian army isn't really fighting against civilians, it's fighting against numerous infantry, which is what the cluster ammunition is. It's definitely difficult decision what I understand and the Ukrainians would prefer to have a better, more precise weapon. They are, you know, advocating for the fighter jets, which would also speed up the counter offense. So I understand this decision is taken, as I made speculate or even guessed that, you know, this is what the U.S. is ready to give, it would be something better, that would be -- that would be better. Maybe the one excuse, which I would say that, you know, in the frontline area where there is now the counter offense, the fight is going on for a year and a half. It's mainly already unlivable. The city of Bakhmut which the world heard had 70,000 people living before the war. Now, there is around 1000. It's really a bit like a dead, you know, this zone, where nothing is already there. So it's the only weapon. And in that event, in the defense war, wherever you have, the sticks and hammer, you will defend your life to exist. So there is a bit of like a different thinking.

So I think that's also very important to mark that Ukraine still control most of its territory. And somehow managed to have a livable OK life for the majority.But of course, even now, we have this year, the strengthening of the Russian indiscriminate attack on the peaceful towns, and in particularly on the civilian infrastructure and the civilian object like houses in western Ukraine, like in Lviv this week, in Kramatorsk, like on the pizzeria last week, and also on Kyiv and other towns. And as well, we recorded more and more relations and the Russian occupation. So, so far, the Ukrainian general prosecutor office registered over 90 sovereigns cases of possible breaches of the, you know, the way how the Russians fighting this war. It's really a lot.

So you're still going to see that sort of thing, Kim, but in terms of something more bigger, more dangerous, more disruptive, the hope is on, you know, the economist side, that they can keep this relationship professional and they can get through this long list of contentious issues they have to deal with.",
