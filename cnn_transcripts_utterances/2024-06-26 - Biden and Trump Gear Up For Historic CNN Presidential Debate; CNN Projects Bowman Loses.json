New polling shows 57% of Americans are likely to follow coverage of the CNN presidential debate, and it's gearing up to be a consequential showdown.Both men will be on stage, their legacies on, you know, up for the test. But according to new CNN reporting, some top Democrats are urging Biden not to focus on his legacy tomorrow night, instead advising him to spend more time going after Trump directly. Here to talk about how these candidates are preparing are two people that couldn't be better to do it, Senior White House Correspondent here at CNN, Kayla Tausche, and CNN Reporter Alayna Treene, who covers Donald Trump for us, along with some others on our team.

      "sentences": "Well, there are some statistics that the President has a tendency to lean on, to try to explain that the economy actually is doing better than voters feel, and that's the 15 million jobs created, the fact that the domestic growth in the country has continued to be good, and the fact that inflation is improving. But the problem is that still hasn't really improved the way that voters feel about the cost of living, which has been considerably higher than it was four years ago, and also notably pre-pandemic.They're saying, don't waste your two minutes of response time going deep into the litany of accomplishments, which hasn't moved voters so far. Focus on Trump. Focus on the contrast. Focus on the choice. Try to recenter that for voters who are newly engaged. But to that end, when he's focused on that contrast and that choice, there's a thing that he's not going to be doing that he has employed in prior debates, and that is unveiling new policies or new personnel. You may remember in March 2020 when CNN hosted a debate between Biden and Senator Bernie Sanders. President Biden, or then-candidate Biden, came out and announced that he'd pick a woman for vice president. He was a new supporter of student loan forgiveness, and he reiterated a pledge to put a black woman on the Supreme Court. And Sanders' advisers say that was a really effective strategy. It earned a lot of media. But I'm told that Biden, if he decides to employ that strategy, won't do it until a later debate because he really wants to make this one about the substance. His aides are helping him practice substance and stamina at Camp David. Long working days. Some staff are staying in cabins. And so that's really where their -- that's really where their strategy is at debate camp right now.",

They don't want that to be the takeaway.They want him to outperform. They want him to be the type of Joe Biden that the American people saw at the State of the Union, which is seen as something of a corollary. I mean, he got very high marks for the State of the Union, for the high energy, for the content, for the delivery. And there was a lot of practice, including at Camp David, for that address.

I'm told that a lot of that is just the rumor mill and it's speculation. But also, you never know with Donald Trump. And when he decides he wants to make this announcement, I think some of it is also going to depend on how the debate goes if they need to change the narrative, we could see a difference. But as for all of the people in Donald Trump's ear about this, that's another thing. I just find it fascinating the different -- there's so many people that Donald Trump speaks to frequently that he respects, who he listens to, who are pushing entirely different candidates.

The Trump team is trying to raise them, as we were just discussing. I want to ask you, we talked a lot about this ahead of the State of the Union, where President Biden performed in a way that Democrats were really happy with. How are the nerves going into this around the potential for President Biden's performance to meet or not meet what people hope are their expectations? REP. DEBBIE DINGELL (D-MI): I think people love to wring their hands and have a lot of angst and play this game of how well are either candidates going to do. I think that President Joe Biden is doing what he's got to do to prepare for this debate. I can't quite say I think that President Trump is.

And so a lot of people on our side are just really unsure about this. [6:40:15] And I have a theory about debates, and my friend Debbie Dingell is wonderful to be here with me. But you bring your side, I bring my side, and we both leave thinking we won. I don't really think a lot's going to -- nothing will happen from this because people already have predetermined expectations. And I think all you're going to do, their team is going to get soundbites from Donald Trump and we'll get soundbites from Joe Biden, and they'll probably both be taken out of context. And -- and that's -- and this is what this will be because I really just think the time has passed for debates because these aren't really true debates. It used to be debates, people would travel the country and in the history of Tennessee, I mean, they literally had a stump that they put out and one guy for governor would get up and speak and the next one would and people would ask questions and it would be that.

So is Evan Perez, who I've mistakenly said thank you to earlier in the show. Evan, let me start with you on the immunity question in particular because we are entering these kind of final days of Supreme Court decisions.

That seems to be the direction they're going.The question is how much work does she have to do, the judge have to do, before restarting the trials, and how much time does she want? I mean, the big -- the big, I think, controlling factor is how much time do you need to be able to get a jury together? So it looks like about maybe five, six weeks. You know, so conceivably, if Judge Tanya Chutkan gets this trial back from the Supreme Court, you know, she could be trying to start a trial in August sometime or early September. And the question is, Kasie, is that enough time, right? Because the election is right upon -- right -- looming right behind it, and so the decision will be on the part of the judge.",

But whether, you know, whether this transpires before the election or not, I don't think it fundamentally changes the argument Biden is making about what Americans saw with their own eyes on January 6th. I mean, that's the other piece of this. I mean, it was televised, people have seen the video. This is not -- you know, this is not something where you need the ultimate decision from the court to make a determination about whether, like Donald Trump was involved. We've seen significant reporting that shows that, you know, he didn't do anything to prevent the crowd from storming, from looking for Mike Pence, from, you know, committing violence.
