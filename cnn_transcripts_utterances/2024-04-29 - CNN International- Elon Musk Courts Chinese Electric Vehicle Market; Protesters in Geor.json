      "sentences": "Max, this is a very competitive market here in China. This is astounding. There are more than 200 EV makers. Chances are not all of them are going to survive. And then you also have Elon Musk and Tesla into the mix.We are at the exhibition space for Xiaomi. It's a tech company here in China. This is really one of the hot spots. This is a company known for cell phones and for household appliances, but now it's made a car. This is its entry vehicle, the SU7. Yes, it is fast. It is aerodynamic. Its battery has a very long life. But what really makes this car unique is the electronic system inside. You really can coordinate your entire lifestyle through this car. That includes turning the lights on and off in your home, even the coffee maker. So this is a very competitive time for car makers like Xiaomi. They need to stand out and for good reason, because right now, if we look at the Chinese EV market, there is an oversupply. The Chinese economy is very uncertain, not to mention in some parts of the world, there's just a lack of interest in EVs. Over there is the Ford exhibit. There's a very sleek Ford Bronco, but it's not getting nearly as much attention as the Chinese brands. And now we have Elon Musk in this mix. As you mentioned, he met with the Chinese premier. He has a very successful factory in Shanghai and would like for things to continue. But there have been some security issues, a familiar theme we hear between the U.S. and China. He sat down with the premier to try to make a more agreeable business environment, and it seems like that has occurred. And to be honest with you, China really does need players like Tesla. It needs more foreign dollars. So to hear that some kind of agreement has been reached is not a big surprise. But for these Chinese car makers that are here at the show, entering the U.S. market is probably going to be a lot more difficult. There are concerns from U.S. officials that some of these vehicles could potentially gather information and send it back to Beijing. So China for now is the world's largest auto exporter, but without the U.S. market, that's going to be a real tough sell. By the way, Max, if we look at all of these cars here, certainly some very bright and unique colors, also many price points. These vehicles where I am right now, so anywhere from around $30,000 to $40,000 -- Max.",

China is looking to see how much U.S. leadership is exerted in the war in Ukraine, and then using that to sort of calculate its next move. So if the U.S. pulls out of Ukraine, that could embolden China. That is an argument that many in favor of the U.S. staying in support of Ukraine have put forward.The other one, in terms of whether the Europeans can step up and handle this alone, he says that, you know, Vance says that Putin is a lot weaker than many had feared. Russia is also a moving target. Russia has evolved dramatically from the army that had to withdraw very quickly from the Kyiv region two years ago. It's not alone in the world. It's getting support from China in the form of sort of dual-use technology, chips, things like that. Antony Blinken, the U.S. Secretary of State, warning China about this in the last few days. It's fired, apparently, according to a U.N. panel, a North Korean missile at the Kharkiv region back in January. It's getting support from Iran. It's actually building Iranian-designed drones inside Russia. So this is very much a moving target, an evolving military force. And I think that is something to consider when looking at the argument as to whether the U.S. can afford to pull out and just concentrate on China.",

Liverpool have kind of fallen away in recent weeks, so it's now down to the Gunners to challenge Man City and try to prevent them from becoming the first team to win four consecutive crowns. But they had a tricky assignment on Sunday, away at their bitter north London rivals Tottenham, and although Spurs played well, Arsenal got the goals.That's Bukayo Saka making it 2-0 midway through the first half and Arsenal were cruising when Kai Havertz made it 3-0 in the 38th minute. This was a frustrating day for Spurs. They had more possession, they had chances, but nothing dropped until the 64th minute when Cristian Romero punished Arsenal's goalie for a dreadful mistake. And then, three minutes from time, Spurs really rattled their opponents with a penalty from Son Heung-min. Tottenham, though, unable to find another, so Arsenal held on for three crucial points. The Gunners must win every game and hope that Manchester City somehow slip up. Otherwise, it is City's title to lose. It's in their hands right now. They picked up another three points on Sunday with a 2-0 win at Nottingham Forest. City's defender, Josko Gvardiol, is having a wonderful month. That was his third goal in just five games, while Erling Haaland returned from injury, coming off the bench to make the point safe. That's his 21st Premier League goal of the season. 2-0 the final score. So here's the table. Arsenal still top. The Gunners are a point ahead of Man City, but City have a game in hand.
