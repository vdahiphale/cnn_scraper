They said you're not going to win, you can't win. You're out. And at first, they said it nicely, and he wasn't leaving, and then you - you know the - you know it better than anybody.Wait a minute. So when you think about it, they said at first they were going to go out to another vote, they were going to go through a primary system, a quick primary system, which it would have to be, and then it all disappeared and they just picked a person that was the first out. She was the first loser, OK? So we call her the first loser. She was the first loser when - during the primary system, during the Democratic primary system, she was the first one to quit, and she quit. She had no votes, no support. And she was a bad debater, by the way, very bad debater. And that's not the thing I'm looking forward to, but she was a bad debater. She did a - obviously a bad job. She never made it to Iowa. Then, for some reason - and I'm - I know he regrets it, you do too - he picked her. And she turned on him too. She was working with the people that wanted him out. But the fact that you can be - get no votes, lose in the primary system - in other words, you had 14 or 15 people - she was the first one out, and then you can then be picked to run for President?

      "sentences": "So I think the abortion issue has been very much tempered down. And I've answered, I think, very well in the debate, and it seems to be much less of an issue, especially for those where they have the exceptions, as you know.And I think it's - when I - look, for 52 years, they wanted to bring abortion back to the states, they wanted to get rid of Roe v. Wade, and that's Democrats, Republicans, and Independents and everybody. Liberals, conservatives, everybody wanted it back in the states, and I did that. Now the states are voting. And frankly, some of the votes are much more, if you could say, liberal than you would think. Ohio turned out to be - they had a big vote and it turned out to be a much more liberal standing than people would have thought. Kansas, the same thing. And then you have Texas and you have other places where it may be different. But the issue's been brought back to the states now. And like Ronald Reagan, I believe in the exceptions for rape, incest, and life of the mother. I believe, you know, I believe strongly I think that that's a very important thing. I think when you don't -- you have to follow your heart. But when you don't believe in the exceptions, I think it's much tougher, it's a much tougher issue. But about 82% of Republicans do believe in exceptions. I think the -- and a lot of them are changing their mind and coming even further. I think that abortion has become much less of an issue. It's a very small -- I think it's actually going to be a very small issue. What I've done is I've done what every Democrat and every Republican wanted to have done, and we brought that issue back to the states. And now the states are voting on it. And frankly, some of the votes are a lot different than people would have thought, but it's the vote of the people that's taking care of it. And, you know, when you think about the radical, the Democrats are really the radical ones on this because they're allowed to do abortion on the eighth and ninth month and even after birth. If you look at your new governor from Minnesota, he's talking about -- he's like the governor previous, the former governor. I don't want to get him mixed up because Glenn is doing a good job and he's leading our -- he's leading our whole campaign in Virginia, Glenn Youngkin. But previous to Glenn, the governor, he said, \"The baby will be born. We will put the baby aside and we will decide with the mother what we're going to do.\" In other words, whether or not we're going to kill the baby. The Minnesota gentleman, he -- this guy agrees with that. He is the most liberal. Look, between her and him, there's never been anything like this. There's never been a combination. So, I'll use the word \"progressive\". You know, they want to go progress -- they don't like the word \"liberal\". I like liberal better. I think it's more appropriate because nobody knows what progressive means. But they now like to use the word \"progressive\", but there's certainly never been anybody so liberal like these two or even close. I think the abortion issue has been taken down many notches. I don't think it's of -- I don't think it's a big factor anymore, really. And when people hear what I said in the debate, and I think I said it very well during the debate, we brought it back to the states. Everybody wanted it in the states. And very importantly, and you think about this, assuming you have exceptions, if you don't have exceptions, it's a more difficult thing. At the same time, there are people that strongly feel that way, and you have to follow your heart. And you should follow your heart, but that issue is very much subdued. You know? Thank you.",

If you look at some countries, I don't want to go -- I don't want to get them in trouble, but some countries have actually gone the opposite way. They had very strong gun laws. And now they have gone the opposite way, where they allowed people to have guns, where in one case they encouraged people to go out and get guns, and crime is down 29 percent. And remember this. What is the toughest gun law in the United States? Chicago. On July 4th, 117 people were shot and 17 died. The toughest gun laws in the United States are in the city of Chicago. You know that. They had 117 people shot. Afghanistan does not have that. Afghanistan, by the way, was the lowest point in the history of our country, in my opinion. That was the worst embarrassment to the history of this country. And I say Putin would not have gone into Ukraine if that didn't happen. When he saw the incompetence of Milley and all these guys that are incompetent, when he saw that happen, when they took out the soldiers first -- they took out the soldiers first. You know, if you go back and check your records, for 18 months, I had a talk with Abdul. Abdul was the leader of the Taliban, still is, but I had a strong talk with him. For 18 months, not one American soldier was shot at or killed -- but not even shot at. Eighteen months.

But in all the years of studying politics, I've never seen people get elected by saying, we're going to give you a tax increase. These guys get up -- think of it. We're going to give you no security. We're going to give you a weak military. We're going to give you no walls, no borders, no anything. We're going to -- all these things they're doing. I mean, the transgender, the transgender became such a big thing. But they do all of these things. But they always say, \"We're going to give you a tax increase.\" I never heard anybody campaign on a tax increase. A politician has always said, \"I will cut taxes. I'll give you one example. Social Security, they're going to destroy Social Security. I am going to leave Social Security. I'm not raising the years. I'm not raising the age. I will be saving Social Security. And I'm going to work it out that there's no tax on Social Security for seniors. I'm also doing no tax on tips. No tax on tips. So, waiters, waitresses, caddies, people that drive cars, people that get tips who have been harassed by this government, we're going to have no tax on tips. That's a big thing.",

All of these cases.By the way, the New York cases are totally controlled out of the Department of Justice. They sent their top person to the various places. They went to the AG's office, got that one going. Then he went to the DA's office, got that one going, ran through it. No, no, this is all politics, and it's a disgrace. Never happened in this country. It's very common that it happens, but not in our country. It happens in banana republics and third-world countries, and that's what we're becoming. We have no borders. We have bad voting regulations. Anytime you have mail-in ballots, you're going to have problems. France learned that lesson. You know, France had all mail-in voting, and they went back to paper ballots, voter identification, voter ID. They went back to a normal system, one-day voting. They don't want to be around, you know, voting for 64 days. And look, the election, I keep talking about November 5th, but the election really starts on September 6th. That's when it starts, because it's early voting. We should have one-day voting. We should have paper ballots. We should have voter ID, and we should have proof of citizenship. Please?",

Look at what's happened not only to their cars, where gasoline's gone from $1.87 - $1.87, and we had moments when it was below that. But it's gone from $1.87 to $5, $6, and $7.

And he's using that to keep the gasoline prices as low as possible. He's sucked all of the oil out, essentially, the gasoline to keep the -- to keep the price down a little bit, and it's had very little impact. But you know what? We have no Strategic National Reserves now. He's emptied it. It's almost empty. It's never been this low. And I had it at a good level, and I would have had it more if the Democrats would have approved the deal. You know, I had a deal to buy it at $22 a barrel, and now it's getting -- it's going to be close to $100 pretty soon, in my opinion. And the Democrats didn't want to do that, but we bought a lot anyway. And we had it pretty good. And what they've done to the national reserves, the Strategic National Reserves is, as you know very well, because you cover it, but what they've done is incredible. They've just -- for the sake of getting some votes, for the sake of having gasoline, you know, that's meant for wars. It's meant for like tragedy. It's not meant to keep a gasoline price down so that somebody can vote for Biden, or in this case Kamala, who by the way is worse than Biden. And she's actually not as smart. OK?
