Now, do I think that this Matt Gaetz choice was sort of a head fake and some 4D chess? No. I think -- you know, every conversation I've had with people close to Trump indicates that it is -- sometimes, the simplest answer is the correct answer. He likes Matt Gaetz. He has promised to drastically reshape how government is run, and he believes that Matt Gaetz is a person who is going to do that. Now, coincidentally, if Matt Gaetz doesn't get confirmed, does it help him potentially get RFK Jr. and Tulsi Gabbard confirmed? Yes.

They also say that he paid inmates through intermediaries, used three-way calls to reach unapproved contacts, and used a non-authorized third-party system to send hundreds of text messages to dozens of people, including some not- unapproved contact lists.

And if obstruction and witness tampering come in, that really undercuts the two defenses in the case. First, that the sexual contact was consensual, because minors can't consent, and then the jurors will hear all the evidence of Diddy trying to blackmail, bribe, pay off, threaten, intimidate these witnesses. And really, I think that's his only defense here.
