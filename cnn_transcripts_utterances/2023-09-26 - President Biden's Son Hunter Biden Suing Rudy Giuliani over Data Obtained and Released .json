And what Hunter Biden is accusing Robert Costello and Rudy Giuliani of doing is essentially getting access to data that was taken from his laptop. So that laptop was the laptop that he had given over to a computer repair shop in Delaware, and at some point Rudy Giuliani and Robert Costello got access to a drive of information that Hunter Biden says at least some of that was indeed from the laptop. He is not saying that everything was. There might have been manipulated data on there.But what they are accusing Giuliani and Robert Costello of doing here in this lawsuit is essentially unlawfully invading his privacy, hacking into a computer. That's some of the language that they use in this lawsuit. And one of the things that they say is that defendant statements suggests that their unlawful hacking activities are ongoing today and that unless stopped will continue into the future, thereby necessitating this action. So that's the reason that they are going to court on this. But it's also just one of these moments where Hunter Biden is on the offensive bringing a case against Rudy Giuliani, quite a well-known figure in the world of people who were talking about Hunter Biden, and at one point a person who held up the laptop, or held up a drive on air and said, this is the hard drive that all of the Hunter Biden material is on.",

      "sentences": "No one else may want the job at this moment, Poppy, given how difficult it is. But the reality is that McCarthy potentially still does face potentially an ouster from some of his colleagues because of the pickle that he is in when it comes to government funding.One of the things to be watching right now is there is a lot of drama that is going to play out in the House this week. They are going to try to move forward with one-year individual spending bills while leadership is simultaneously trying to rally members around a short- term spending package in order to try to get some leverage with the Senate. That is largely going to be a distraction because most of those options, all of those options would not avoid a government shutdown at this point. Right now, the focus is in the Senate where you have Republican and Democratic negotiators and leadership trying to find a path forward on a short-term spending package that sources are telling me and our colleague Manu Raju, would likely be around 45 days long. That's not a whole lot of time. But one of the reasons for that shorter timeline is because they may not be able to include the full $24 billion in Ukraine funding that the White House has requested, nor will they necessarily be able to include disaster aid. Those conversations are fluid right now, and there's a lot of things that could change in the next several hours as they try to get members of their respective caucuses behind this short-term spending plan. But the Senate is trying to find a way forward, and they need to move quickly so that they can send it over to the House of Representatives. And then it will be up to House Speaker Kevin McCarthy to decide what to do. Depending when the bill goes over to the House of Representatives, it's possible that there may not be enough final for McCarthy to have any option other than deciding whether or not to put the bill on the floor in the House. It's also possible, of course, that the House may find some way to come together, that Republicans may try to change that bill that comes from the Senate. But so many moving pieces here. And because we have such a short timeline that these leaders are trying to work within, that is the challenge, and that that is why McCarthy certainly does not have any good options left on the menu right now.

Again, it assumes that the Senate can negotiate a short- term spending package, can pass it out of their chamber in short order, and volley it over to the House of Representatives. A lot of things have to happen for that to be a choice that McCarthy has to make. But if it happens, that is, obviously, the easiest path forward if you forget about the fact that any one member could call to oust the speaker at any moment.

When the Democrats controlled both houses they forced trillions of dollars into the economy that fueled inflation, everything from gas to groceries on the rise. And by the way, I represent people in upstate New York who know their government. And this, with all due respect, this president living in some kind of fog, expecting people to believe something they know isn't true. The economy is certainly at risk. There are folks paying too much to get too little in return, and they want a government to respect them.
