It's based on a Glock kind of model, but you put it together yourself. And investigators believe that this particular gun, and you see it there with the slide pulled back and a magazine, which is probably capable of holding 14 rounds in the box there, they believe that this was created by a 3D printer.Now, it's interesting because Mangione is a guy who graduated from UPenn with a master's degree in engineering and it's something he might have an interest in making his own gun, but when I talk to firearms experts in New York, they say one of the reasons when he went to commit this murder, we see the gun apparently malfunction three times, is that suppressor, the silencer, which was also reportedly homemade or self-manufactured, actually altered the balance of the gun and probably caused those malfunctions. So, getting the bullets fired through this gun that they have in custody now and comparing them to the shell casings and bullets they have on the scene is going to be critical because that will be the smoking gun moment, if you will, in the case.

And so there's still a lot of work that has to be done. They have to build that criminal case now because this is something that's going to go to trial. But, you know, my hat's off to the employee of McDonald's that had the presence of mind to call 911 when she saw this individual. And I think by putting out the photographs, particularly the last group of photographs that the NYPD put out, because one thing I noticed about him was he's got very distinctive looking eyebrows. You didn't see that when you had the other photos of him with the hood on. But when they showed the picture of him in the taxicab, you could clearly see that part of his face.

And so he was sort of, in some ways, evading what we might call the surveillance state in terms of cameras in terms of no credit cards, everything's in cash, multiple modes of transportation. He staked out New York.So, there's a lot of talk about he is from an affluent family. He went to some of the best schools in the country in high school and college. He's a smart guy. He has studied technology, engineering, all the things that now make it more understandable how he was able to do that. His reference to Ted Kaczynski, the Unabomber, people remember also was a well educated man who evaded police for a very long time in a campaign that was also anti, you know, big brother, big man. So, I can see where he would view his connection to Kaczynski and the Unabomber in terms of that sort of mythic aura that these people create, want to create around themselves and that social media and people on social media were more than willing to run with.",

This is a classic example. If you see something, say something. That really matters, Wolf. I mean, people should understand this country how much one person can make a difference in solving crime and stopping other crimes. So, this is a good day for that example.

And we tend to think of radicalization as sort of purely about politics or right or left. But sometimes this can be focused on an idea or sort of, you know, the nature of healthcare in America. He has taken on an issue, whether it was personal based on his own medical history, we can't confirm yet, and then focus it on an individual, why he chose Thompson. We do not know. The other thing is he is aware of regret. He expresses regret. He knows the moral -- that he knows that what he's doing is immoral and wrong. So, that's going to go to an insanity defense. And he sort of made that more difficult for him to claim in court. What we don't know is, was his possession of the gun and his anticipation that he would be caught, because he kept the manifesto, mean that he had other targets?

And, you know, why Brian Thompson, why UnitedHealthcare? Probably because UnitedHealthcare is the single largest, you know, healthcare insurance provider in the country at a $371 billion business of which, you know, if you looked at him online, he's worth tens of millions of dollars worth of that stock. So, he's a personal target, but he's also a symbolic target to this kind of offender.And I think, you know, Juliette raises that interesting point, which is, why are you carrying this manifesto? Is it because when you say parasites and you say it in the plural, you're on your way to another target, and you're going to leave it at the scene, or you're going to mail it to the media, or you're going to send it to the cops?

So, they're looking at things like the ballistics, for sure, the shell casings, the bullets themselves. They're looking at DNA evidence. They're looking at fingerprint evidence. And given what I know about the way prosecutors work and the way police officers work, once they make a definitive hit on one of those things, I think we should expect to see a murder charge lodged in New York State.

Another question that I think we should watch for here and this relates to the question of motive, Wolf, is will this be charged by state authorities in New York or federal authorities or both? Now, typically this kind of murder is going to be a state crime. Youhave to show certain specific types of motives in order to get it over into federal court. But it could be depending on what his motive was, if there was some element of murder for hire here, we've not seen evidence of that, but that's an example. If this was done in furtherance of some organized racketeering activity, again, there's not evidence of that. But also there is a way you can charge this federally if it involves traveling across a state line in order to commit a violent felony. So I -- what I'm keeping my ears out for here are number one, what exactly is he charged with in Pennsylvania? But hopefully soon we'll find out what's he charged with in New York. And then secondarily, is this going to be handled by state authorities, federal authorities or both?",

In the meantime, other news we're following, Donald Trump's pick to lead the Pentagon. Pete Hegseth appears to be closing in on winning the support of a key Republican senator regarded as a crucial swing vote. I want to bring in CNN's Manu Raju. He's up on Capitol Hill. Manu, what are you -- what are you hearing? What are you learning?",

That second meeting occurred today. Afterwards she told me and other reporters that she, quote, supports him going through the process. Would not say if she's a yes yet, but she sounded very positive as Pete Hegseth made some key assurances to her going forward. Now, there are also others as well, including a Senator Lindsey Graham, who just met with Tulsi Gabbard, Donald Trump's pick to lead the department -- to be the director of national intelligence. Graham has a different view on issues like Ukraine and issues like Syria, but coming out of that meeting, Graham sounded positive about Gabbard's nomination. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R-SC):  We've had policy differences. I know her, I like her, you know? She wanted to stay in the JCPOA. I thought that was a mistake. But, you know, she'll be serving Trump.

In fact, a lot of them are falling in line behind Kash Patel, including the incoming Republican chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Chuck Grassley, told me earlier today that he is essentially supportive of some of the things that Kash Patel assured him in their private meeting today and others, including Senator Joni Ernst, who I mentioned there earlier, is also back signaling she will back Kash Patel. So, overall, a positive day for Donald Trump's picks on Capitol Hill -- Wolf.",
