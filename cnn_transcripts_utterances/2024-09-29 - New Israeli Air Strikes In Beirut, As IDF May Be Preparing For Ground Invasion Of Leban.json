I'm Paula Newton.It is 8:00 a.m. in Beirut, where fears are growing that the exchange of missile fire between Israel and Hezbollah could now turn into a ground war. U.S. officials say Israeli troops have mobilized and are moving to the border with Lebanon in what could be, could be preparation for a ground incursion. Israel is saying that a ground offensive is only one option that is currently being considered the IDF continued their air offensive on Saturday, with blasts hitting close to the Beirut airport. Saturday strikes in Lebanon reportedly killed more than 30 people and wounded close to 200 others. Hezbollah, for its part, fired back, saying it launched missiles toward Jerusalem, prompting a response from Israeli air defenses, police say pieces of an interest intercepted missile crashed in the suburbs. All that is happening after Israel killed Hezbollah's leader Hassan Nasrallah, prompting new fears of a wider war in the region. Now, Hezbollah is pledging to continue its fight, while Iran says Israel will face, quote, \"a crushing blow\" for the killing. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says his country is now one step closer to achieving its military goals. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BENJAMIN NETENYAHU, ISRAEL PRIME MINISTER (voiceover): The elimination of Nasrallah is a necessary condition for achieving the goals we have set, returning the residents of the North safely to their homes and changing the balance of power in the region over the years. Because as long as Nasrallah lived, he would quickly restore the capabilities we took away from Hezbollah. That's why I gave the directive, and Nasrallah is no longer with us. (END VIDEOTAPE) NEWTON: Our reporters are standing by to bring us right up to date. Elliott Gotkine is in London. Paula Hancock joins us from Abu Dhabi and Elliot first to you. What more are you learning about Israel's next moves, potentially. And crucially, what has stated are its strategic goals when it comes to Hezbollah.",

      "sentences": "Well, Paula, Israel has learned many times in the past that assassinating a leader does not eradicate a movement. They have been assassinating Hamas leaders for decades now, and yet, it was the ground invasion into Gaza that weakened that movement ultimately. So I think there is an understanding that this is a massive demoralization for the Hezbollah group, but it doesn't necessarily mean that it is going to have a direct impact on its operational capabilities. It is still a significant threat to Israel. It is still a significant military force in the region.And of course, as you mentioned, you do have to consider what Iran it's its main funder and supporter would be willing to do. We've heard from many former and senior U.S. officials saying that they believe this assassination and what is happening now does make it far more likely that there will be a wider conflict. But also pointing out that that one senior U.S. official said they believe that Iran will intervene if they feel that they are about to lose Hezbollah. So that could be the key. If Hezbollah does seem to be suitably weakened in Israel's eyes, then maybe that would encourage Iran to get involved as well, and that does become a far wider and more dangerous conflict. Now we've had a statement from Hezbollah. They have said that they will continue to fight despite what has happened. We've also heard from the Iranian Ambassador to the United Nations calling for United Nations Security Council emergency meeting on what has happened. But we've also heard from the Iranian Supreme Leader saying that the fate of this region now rests on the resistance groups, and at the top of that is Hezbollah. So what this is really pointing out to is that this is not just about one group. It is not just about Hezbollah and the leader of that group. There are many other militias around the region that could step in now and give more support to Hezbollah, and we've certainly been hearing that support vocally around the region. Let's listen to one Palestinian leader. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MAJIDA AL-MASRI, FORMER PALESTINIAN MINISTER (voiceover): If Netanyahu thinks that the assassination of the great leader, the master and the icon of the resistance, Saeed Hassan Nasrallah, will impact the resistance and will impact our ability to continue our struggle. Then he is delusional, and we will see that he is in the coming days. On the contrary, this will inflame the resistance and the fighters and their willingness to struggle. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

There was one that was intercepted close to the Tel Aviv area, which Hezbollah said was targeting the Mossad, Mossad headquarters at that point. But it is a reminder as well that there is an awful lot of arsenal that can reach further into Israel that Hezbollah has not really used up until this point. Paula.",

I mean, obliterated, the house is gone, etc. If you walk around Beirut, you can see the effect already as well, with hundreds of people just sleeping on the pavements. I mean, yesterday I did a quick drive around the city and basically all around Beirut's waterfront areas like the Corniche near to by the public beach area near Dosha. I mean, you just see basically people sleeping on the sidewalks in parks and public spaces.And most of those have been, I mean, they were residents of the Bahia, which was the Beirut. I mean, the Beirut southern suburbs that are dominated by Hezbollah. That area, too, I should tell you, is now a ghost town. I actually dared to drive around the periphery yesterday and go a little bit closer in, and you could see just columns of smoke everywhere, of course. But more to the point, the whole area was just completely emptied of civilians, transfer clothes. Obviously, you could see no lights. It was quite an eerie situation, because this used to be a very, very crowded neighborhood in Beirut with its own rhythm and its own personality, and now it's very much a ghost town. So you can see the effect firsthand when it comes to, I guess, the military defeat. And what that means, I suppose, is that now that we talk about a ground invasion, there is a fear of repeating history in Lebanon you know, when we go back to the previous Israeli occupation of South Lebanon and parts of Beirut.",

In Arabic, they would say (inaudible). And the idea was here that they would basically, they had established an equation with Israel since 26 whereby if Israel struck a, I mean, if they killed civilians or they struck a Lebanese city, that Hezbollah would strike Israeli cities and attack Israeli civilians.And the fact of the matter is that, for every time Israel has escalated in the last 11 months, Hezbollah blinked in the sense that, yes, it would lob additional rockets, yes, it would love additional missiles. But escalations were not really, or the responses perhaps, were not equal to Israel's escalation in each case. And frankly, at some point it just seemed that Israel understood that this notion of deterrence was no longer there, and that the arsenal, although in theory, impressive, you know, hadn't been used. And so I think at that point the feeling was since there was no deterrence, that they could go for it. And indeed they did. And the result is, what we see now. All which is to say is that, yes, it's great to say that you have a deterrence and that you have a missile or that you have a missile arsenal, but if you're not willing to use it at some point, then it really is a questionable idea.",

      "sentences": "The U.S. sees the possibility of a limited Israeli ground incursion into southern Lebanon, according to two U.S. officials, but crucially, the U.S. believes Israel hasn't made a final decision on whether to carry out a ground incursion into Lebanon. Now, Israelis have signaled quite openly that they're preparing for that possibility. The top Israeli General said as much on Wednesday, and crucially, a senior Israeli official said on Friday, just before the strike that killed Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah, that Israel hopes it doesn't have to carry out a ground incursion into Lebanon. But the officials say that the U.S. has seen the mobilization of more Israeli forces the clearing of areas along Israel's northern border that would be in preparation for a ground incursion. So that possibility is widening, is growing as the U.S. continues to try to head off a regional war and tries to signal to Israel that a ground incursion is very much not the way to proceed here.Crucially, and this is important to note. Israel's goal when it comes to Lebanon and Hezbollah is not the elimination of Hezbollah or the destruction of Hezbollah completely, that would almost certainly require a very large ground incursion. Its goal here is to return more than 60,000 residents to their homes in northern Israel, which they have been displaced from basically since October 8 and since Hezbollah started firing rockets and drones into northern Israel. The question, of course, is, what does it take to make that happen? At what point did Israel feel comfortable doing that? And that's where a ceasefire, an agreement, may very well be necessary, and that's why the U.S. keeps pushing in that direction. Still, Israel very clearly has the advantage over Hezbollah, and it's going to push that advantage. Israel has long believed that another war with Hezbollah was inevitable. Basically, ever since the end of the 2006 warrant because of that, the Israeli security establishment has been working on its intelligence when it comes to Hezbollah, working on preparations and plans for that war. And now that it seems we're at that point, Israel is very much pressing the advantage that it has, how far it will go. That's what the U.S. is trying to figure out, and that's what it seems Israel itself is trying to figure out, as we see the continuation of Israeli strikes in Lebanon. The displacement of hundreds of thousands of Lebanese civilians in southern Lebanon, in Beirut, and beyond. U.S. trying to steer off the regional war. But of course, part of that question is, what does Iran decide to do at this point? The U.S. has significant forces in the region, a carrier strike group in and around the Gulf of Oman in the Persian Gulf, an amphibious ready group in the eastern Mediterranean Sea. They've had fighter squadrons, additional fighter squadrons in the Middle East for several months now, and President Joe Biden ordered Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, to further enhance force posture. So we'll learn over the next several days what exactly that entails. The region bracing for a response. The U.S. State Department pulling some personnel from Lebanon. That being said, a NEO a noncombatant evacuation order, the evacuation of U.S. citizens from Lebanon that has not been ordered yet the region very much bracing for what comes next.

I think Harris, on a lot of fronts, has put tremendous focus on seeming tough. You saw the way her border speech went on Friday, where she talked about her role in prosecuting transnational gangs. And she does not really, I think want to accept in the you know, the most fleeting ways signal any daylight, any more willingness to confront Netanyahu than Biden has done. She does not want to let Trump portray her as, you know, someone who is kind of soft in pursuing these challenges in the Mideast. But I think the people around her certainly, and I think the broad range of experts in the Democratic Party are deeply concerned about the direction this is heading, even as they may cheer some of the Israeli successes on the battlefield and disabling a terrorist organization, or at least debilitating a terrorist organization.",

Same thing about Detroit and the Republican Party in Michigan. Harris has the challenge in turn of turning out, in particular, younger voters who are beginning to show more enthusiasm, more interest in the campaign, also more support for her, but who were deeply disengaged from Biden and are frustrated about their economic situation, same with many relatively younger black and Latino voters. So yes, as always, the question of who comes out to vote is critical. We in the media focus a lot on the 4, 5, 6 percent of voters who say in Paula, they're pretty certain to vote, but don't know who they're going to vote for. There were 80 million people who are eligible and didn't vote in 2020, and that is the bigger prize for the candidates.
