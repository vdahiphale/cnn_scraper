As the federal shutdown looms, U.S. House Republicans are attempting to push through the impeachment of President Joe Biden. And later this hour, Biden has his own warning for America, that something dangerous is happening right now. We'll bring you his speech on the state of democracy when it happens. Plus, two shooting incidents in Rotterdam leave at least two people dead. We'll have an update on what we know so far just ahead. Well, U.S. House Republicans are holding the first hearing today in the impeachment inquiry into President Joe Biden. They claim that he profited off his son's business deals and abused his office. The White House denies this and the Republicans have yet to back up their claim with any type of proof. Impeachment inquiries usually start with more evidence, but the Republicans are going forward with it, even though it's less than three days before the government runs out of money and shuts down potentially. Well, the U.S. President is set to speak in the battleground state of Arizona this hour and honor the legacy of late Republican Senator John McCain. We'll bring you that live when it happens. But first, I want to bring in CNN legal analyst and former federal prosecutor, Jennifer Rodgers. Good to have you with us.",

So, nothing new was happening today. They say that they are issuing a lot of subpoenas and they have a lot of evidence to come. But as you've pointed out, there have been years of investigation into the Bidens, and I personally think that if they had evidence that demonstrated an abuse of power on the part of the current president, they would have made that public. That said, you know, they do have subpoena power and the ability to hold hearings like this. So, we'll see what they come up with.",

It's almost impossible to work out a scenario how this doesn'thappen when the money from the government runs out just after midnight on Saturday evening in Washington. The reason for this is, we have an inoperable Republican majority in the House of Representatives, both because it is so small, Kevin McCarthy, the sneaky, can only lose four votes and still pass a bill. And because there is this wing of pro-Trump extremists right-wingers who are basically holding the speaker hostage and refusing to vote to keep the government open without massive spending cuts, much lower than the Republicans have already agreed for the next year with President Joe Biden. So, it looks like the only way this ever get solved is if there is a shutdown and pressure builds on McCarthy, if troops don't start -- if troops start losing their paychecks. If the air traffic control system grinds to a halt, then possibly, McCarthy will have outside leverage to bring to bear on some of these extremists.

The hearing we saw today was none of that really, apart from the fact that there wasn't any real evidence brought forward by Republicans to back up their charges. The evidence they did bring didn't back up what they were accusing Biden of. Which is as you said earlier, profiting from his son's business affairs. This hearing only will add I think to perceptions of this as an attempt by Trump's allies in the house to revenge for his own double impeachments when he was in office, and to try to weaken Biden and to mitigate some of the criminal and other issues hanging over Trump's head as he heads into the 2024 election, presume he is the Republican nominee. So, it wasn't really a very serious process, even the witnesses called by the Republicans refuted many of the thrusts of the Republican impeachment theory.

Especially during the midterm elections infact, last year, when a lot of outside observers and journalists were quite skeptical that with Trump not on the ballot, this idea that America is under siege from an anti-democratic Republican Party, which is pushing the return of an increasingly autocratic candidate, Donald Trump. We were quite surprised, a lot of us there actually worked in the midterm elections. Biden has been having a difficult political time the last few weeks, there's been a lot of talk about his age, whether he would get through and fully fulfill a second term, his approval rating is very low. The public isn't believing his arguments, the economy is improving. So what we've seen is the president really getting to give the last week or so, tackling some of those issues head on, and his returning to the argument which actually got him into the 2020 election race in the beginning, which is that Donald Trump is a clear and present danger to American democracy. This is not a normal election, the issue on the ballot is a survival of American democracy. And I think that's what you will hear from the president, even though where, you know, this is September 2023 and not September 2024 just a few months before the election. It's looking a lot like Trump v. Biden all over again.",

This is a residential area, what looks to be a low-rise apartment building and the footage that you see there that we have from the scene shows emergency crews, looks like they're working on one person, helping one person on the pavement, then you can see smoke billowing out of the actual building. According to CNN's affiliate \"RTL\", a 32-year-old suspect went into that building and shot dead a 39-year-old woman and injured her 14-year-old daughter, who was seriously hurt. He then set fire to that building. Then the second location is the Rasmussen University Medical Center, it's about a kilometer and a half or so away, a short drive, maybe 15-minute walk or so. \"RTL\" reports that the suspect then went inside of a classroom and shot dead a 46-year-old male teacher. This is the very same medical school where the suspect himself was a student. And \"RTL\" also reports that he did in fact have a previous criminal record, he was convicted of animal abuse back in 2021. Now, initially, police reported the suspect was wearing combat clothes, may have been on a motorcycle carrying a handgun. Where they ended up finding him was hiding underneath of a helipad on the campus of that university medical center.

There are no terrorists. So the (INAUDIBLE) institutions in Azerbaijan talks to this institutions, these military against these institutions. Doesn't matter. Civilian doesn't matter. Military, but this attacks are against institutions that these people are building. So of course, nobody recognized the independence of the Nagorno-Karabakh but the Nagorno-Karabakh always had autonomy, always had self government and self-governance. So what will happen after this? So they just were arguing that you must dissolve everything. And we are not going to guarantee any rights and securities on the international mechanism. That means that these people must leave the territory; otherwise, we already know what's going happen with that. As you said, (INAUDIBLE) were killed, wounded; people are in Baku prisons tortured.",

The hearing wrapped up just a few hours ago. It is not clear when we will have a ruling. The law could apply to any prime minister; the critics say it is built to shield the current leader, Benjamin Netanyahu. His efforts to overhaul the courts have been met with mass protests. And Mr. Netanyahu has been on trial for alleged corruption, which he denies. To break down what's at stake, CNN's Hadas Gold joins me now from Jerusalem. Good to have you with us. Netanyahu is obviously facing this ongoing corruption trial. And this law that was passed earlier this year would make it harder to remove someone like him, a prime minister, from office. Take us through the arguments and the appeal that happened in the Supreme Court today.",

      "sentences": "Of all the cases being heard in the supreme court, this could have the most direct significant personalimpact on Benjamin Netanyahu and his ability to serve. It's because his hearing today heard challenges to the law that was passed essentially to help protect Benjamin Netanyahu. This was passed very quickly in March and it essentially put down into law that the only way you can remove a prime minister from office for declaring him unfit to serve is for physical or mental reasons. The prime minister can do it themselves or a supermajority in the Israeli cabinet ratified by the Israeli parliament could then remove a prime minister from office. If you know anything about Israeli politics, getting a supermajority in the parliament is very difficult to do. To be clear, there wasn't any sort of settled law before this passed about exactly how you can remove a prime minister from office. But case law had suggested the attorney general could do it. As you noted, Benjamin Netanyahu has been facing an ongoing corruption trial and there were serious possibilities that the attorney general would have declared Benjamin Netanyahu unfit for office because of the circumstances surrounding his ongoing corruption trial. Again, he's denied all the charges. But this law was passed, seen very much as protecting Netanyahu. And today in court, we actually heard from the lawyers representing the parliament, essentially admitting, yes, sure; this law does help Benjamin Netanyahu. But they believe it should stand because they say, if the supreme court knocks it down, they argue the supreme court would be doing damage to democracy, taking away the millions of votes who voted for Benjamin Netanyahu, wanting him in power. The petitioners who were arguing for the law to be annulled, they say it is a misuse of constituent power. And the attorney general, a member of the government technically, does not necessarily political ally of the prime minister, she's on the opposite end of the government on this. Lawyers representing her said that a basic law cannot be used as a kind of private resource that removes personal problems from the field of morality and criminal law. They are arguing that at minimum if the law is not going to be taken down, at least it should be delayed. It should only take effect in the next parliament, which could be a few years from now. We do know this case needs to be decided by January when some of the justices retire but it is possible we will likely get a decision on this specific case possibly within the next few weeks.",

And they have been making the trek for about 18 days. They're originally from Venezuela. A couple of families and some other stragglers who have come together and they've gotten to know each other along the way. Interestingly enough, the reason we're walking right now with them and some of them are trying to hurry up is because they're trying to go around a migration checkpoint. They were picked up on the riverbank on the Mexico side. And they were taken in a van. They of course, had to pay and brought to just before the checkpoint, that's when they were all unloaded. And you can see that's where these folks are walking behind high grass. And they're finding their way to catch up with that same van but on the other side of the checkpoint. We should point out; we're able to go around it because we can choose any route we're here illegally. They are not in Mexico legally, that they have not entered any of the countries since leaving Venezuela legally. Their hope is, of course, like everyone else to get to the U.S. But this just shows you how extensive even what is normally an hour drive and what's going to be a whole day for them turns out to be.
