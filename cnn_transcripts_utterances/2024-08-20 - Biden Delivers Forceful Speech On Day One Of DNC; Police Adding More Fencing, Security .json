So as you mentioned, this was a smaller than anticipated group, but it was plenty to try to topple areas of this fence around the United Center. This is the outer security layer. This is really the first stop between the general public and this protected zone and that -- you know, the fence is something that security forces had told us over and over and over was a really critical part of the plan. They have many redundancies. And so when that fence was breached, you saw law enforcement get on that situation very quickly. It was just a handful of protesters, but it was enough to basically lift out these panels of the fencing. So if you can see, they're hooked in to these areas down here. And so what the protesters did was it kind of just wiggled them out of that spot and then they hoisted them over. So now what you see is a higher panel up here. So this top panel was not here the last few days that we were here. So that's an added layer. And then in addition, you can see that they fortified parts of the fencing here. And this goes on for several blocks. Finally, Bianna, what you see too is this extra fence here. So before, it was just this black fence and then this much thinner red fence. Now there's another iron fence in between that, so they're adding a layer of this physical security. This is not a great start to what could be a very long week of protests here. Law enforcement has made clear though that they want to try to protect the rights of citizens to exercise their First Amendment. They want to be able to do that with the space that they're looking for, with the amount of time that they're looking for. But what law enforcement made very clear was they were not going to tolerate any criminal activity. That is why those four protesters were arrested so quickly moving forward. There are again big questions about how it got to that point. Questions of Chicago police should have intervened earlier to keep those protesters away from this area.

But then, of course, there are also the cases of those who are finding out at the very same time that their loved ones who they had hoped, who they had prayed were alive, are now confirmed to be dead and their bodies recovered. That was the case of one of the six hostages in this instance whose bodies were recovered. Avraham Munder, his family did not know until today that he was actually confirmed dead, but his body was among the six bodies recovered by the Israeli military in an overnight operation in tunnels in the southern Gaza city of Khan Yunis. And now leaves us with 105 hostages who are believed to still be held in Gaza, 35 -- 34 of whom are believed to be dead. But we know, of course, that beyond those who have been confirmed dead, there are many others who likely are as well.

They truly believe this ispotentially the last best opportunity for a ceasefire deal to be reached, for hostages to be returned to Israel alive. And that is very much the context of Secretary Blinken's visit. Yesterday, while he was in Israel, he said that the Israeli government, that the Israeli Prime Minister had told him that he signed on to this bridging proposal that the United States has offered to bridge the remaining gaps between Israel and Hamas. Hamas, so far, has indicated that they believe that proposal effectively caves into a number of Israeli demands and does not appear to be something that they can support. But that has not slowed the U.S.'s efforts to try and push these negotiations further. And after being in Cairo, Secretary Blinken is expected to arrive in Doha, Qatar. And that is where he will get the best sense of the temperature of Hamas. The Qataris are the key interlocutors with Hamas, and they will have the best sense of what Hamas is thinking is behind the scenes. It is clear that even if they can get agreement on this bridging proposal, that there are a number of technical details that are still being worked out. And the Israeli Prime Minister himself today, a day after indicating to the Secretary of State that he is on board with this proposal, he even said he's not sure that there will be a deal and continue to point to the insistence that he has that Israel preserves some of the strategic security assets it has gained over the course of these 10 months of war. One of those key security assets we know is Israeli control of the Philadelphi Corridor, that strip of land in Gaza along the Egypt-Gaza border, which the Israeli government very much wants to retain security control of, whereas Hamas has very much said they think Israeli troops should be pulling out from there, as well as the rest of Gaza.",

We're seeing that still being carried out by Russia and Iran, obviously, looking back at this most recent warning. The Iranians have become more sophisticated year-by-year in their own cyber operations. The Russians are continuing to carry out influence operations and potentially other sort of election interference oriented operations. We all with -- so the U.S. officials are really finding this a multi-front war, but at the end of the day, this is really bubbling under the surface. We haven't seen any sort of overt action of the sanctions being taken to respond.

      "sentences": "Well, I will start by saying that, for me, this is a very personal issue, because I -- my community thatI'm a member of, a small community located on the border with Gaza. We still have two of our neighbors held by Hamas who were kidnapped in front of their families on October 7th. Omri Miran and Tsachi Idan, both of them fathers of young children who saw them being taken away by the terrorists on October 7. And now 10 and a half months we're waiting. And, of course, the news today is terrible because all of the six bodies that were returned to Israel today by the IDF, these are the bodies of people who were taken into Gaza by Hamas alive on October 7. These are not people who were murdered and then kidnapped as dead bodies. These are people who were alive October 7, and were alive in November when the first hostage release deal happened. And some of them were alive this late, it's January, February and March. According to information that Israel has, they could have been saved. There could have been a deal to bring them back alive, and instead, they are coming back in caskets. So, just to frame the urgency of doing a deal right now. Now, this urgency is very clear to the majority of the Israeli public. We've seen public opinion polls that most Israelis want to deal with them because they understand it's the only way we can get people back alive. Make their operations have brought us until now seven living hostages and more than 20 dead bodies. We want more living hostages and less dead bodies. We need a deal. And we also know that most of the Palestinians in Gaza will support the deal that is being discussed right now because it would lead to an end of the hostilities or at least a very long break in weeks, months without fighting and everybody's suffering. Now, we have a problem with two people who are not as eager and don't feel the urgency. First one is Yahya Sinwar, leader of Hamas. We're talking here about an ultra-religious, messianic religious fanatic. And he's waiting for a regional war to break out. He believes that just around the corner is another escalation in which Iran and Hezbollah will rain thousands of missiles and rockets on Israel. And what he began on October 7, the massacre that his men conducted in Southern Israel will become an all-out regional war that will put basically the entire Middle East in flames. That's his vision. He's waiting for it to happen. It is very important that the Biden administration is trying to deescalate that Israel running Hezbollah. Because every passing day, without an Iran or Hezbollah massive attack on Israel, Sinwar's fantasy gets pushed back a little bit. The other actor who's problematic is Prime Minister Netanyahu. And what he's doing is his classic move of double speech. And he's been doing this for years. He says one thing in English, American audience says and American diplomats and to President Biden and Secretary Blinken. And then he says the opposite in Hebrew to his cabinets, including the far-right ultra-religious elements that he relies on to hold the war and to his supporters. And he tells Blinken the other day, we're really ready to make a deal. And then he meets with some of his supporters and says, actually, we're not going to give up A, B, C, and D, basically making a deal impossible. And between Sinwar's ultra-religious messianic fantasies and Netanyahu's political interest, we are stuck and lives are hanging in the balance.",

Six highways converge on the town, roads which if Russia took the city would open the way to other strongholds and bring Russia closer to controlling the whole of Donetsk. So if the core objective of the Kursk incursion was to stretch Russia so thin, it couldn't advance in Ukraine, well, it hasn't worked. But Ukraine has more than one goal here. Right now, they still seem to be advancing slowly in Kursk. A new video Ukraine released Tuesday showing intense fighting still ongoing. They're also consolidating, blowing up bridges on a critical Russian supply route, setting up a military office to handle law and order in the town of Sudzha. All of that fits with the goal of holding on to a buffer zone to prevent cross-border shelling.
