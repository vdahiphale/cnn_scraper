Nothing could be further from the truth.\" But Poppy, this is one of many measures that are being taken by the Biden administration as they anticipate an influx of migrants have Title 42 lifts next week. And it includes also a deal struck with Mexico that we learned about overnight that will allow the U.S. to return certain nationalities, non-Mexicans, to Mexico. It includes expediting asylum processes, as well, and bolstering transportation and capacity along the U.S./Mexico border. And look, this is an issue that is a political vulnerability for Biden.

And as you noted, Trump's considered main rival, Ron DeSantis, hasn't even entered the race yet. But according to these people, they are looking at the current landscape and seeing those poll numbers, seeing that lead. And they think it would only benefit Trump's rivals for Trump to get up on the stage with them. Now, the other thing to note is that there are two other reasons that he would potentially skip these early debates, the first being timing. Trump has told a number of sources that I have spoken to that he doesn't want to debate in August. He thinks it's too early. He wants to enjoy his summer. Trump advisers told me that they told the RNC that before those dates were ever announced. But I did have two sources push back on that, saying that Ronna McDaniel, the chairwoman, called Trump directly and told him about those debates, and there was not this aggressive level of pushback. The other reason is location. That second debate is supposed to be held at Ronald Reagan Library in Simi Valley, California. Former President Trump has told a number of people close to him that he doesn't want to perform there, because he holds a little bit of resentment for the fact that they have never invited him to speak, despite the fact that they have invited a number of other Republican leaders to speak.",

The meeting at the revolving door, going upstairs to the lingerie department, and then that's where she says she was assaulted. And her friend says she told her, \"E. Jean, he raped you, and you need to go to the police.\" And that Carroll said, No, no, no, we got into a fight, and, like, let's not talk about this again. And that's exactly what Carroll had testified to. But they also called another woman who is not associated with E. Jean Carroll, but she said that she was assaulted by Trump on an airplane in 1979. And she provided this testimony, saying that he groped her, he grabbed her. And the reason why Carroll's attorneys called her is they want to show a pattern.

Gore, is from 1994 to the year 2004. All of these papers are opened up, so we can see who influenced whom, what other justices who might have secretly steered the outcome, how much they might have been looking to outside forces. It's just a real treasure-trove to understand how the law of the nation is decided. And in Bush v. Gore that you asked about, you know, that 5-4 opinion that came down late on the night of December 12, 2000, deciding the election, giving George W. Bush the White House over then-Vice President Al Gore was an unsigned opinion. We weren't sure exactly who truly influenced it. And what we see is that the actual writing was done by Anthony Kennedy, but he was using a framework that was provided by Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, the first woman on the Supreme Court, and a woman who herself was steeped in politics, because she was in Arizona state legislature. And I love to say that she came to Washington knowing how to count votes, and she truly did. And they worked together, again, to give Bush the White House. But also. to rob Chief Justice William Rehnquist of a theory that he was pushing that would have, frankly, really empowered state legislatures at the expense of state courts and state constitutions. So we got to see all that, plus some of the tensions behind the scenes. You know, just as Antonin Scalia, who was in the majority, famously used to tell the public, get over it. And we see some of -- we saw yesterday some of what he was writing to his colleagues about how angry he was at dissenters. But even mild-mannered Anthony Kennedy was saying, you know, You -- you liberal dissenters who are saying that the integrity of the court will be -- will be lost, you're just putting forward something that will be a self-fulfilling prophesy.",
