Shaky or sound, First Republic Bank collapses weekend deal to buy it, bails out Uber wealthy depositors but it does stir worries about the strength of the economy.Plus, the head of the Republican National Committee delivers a blunt warning to Republican candidates coast-to-coast, ignore the abortion issue at your own expense and entire lives packed into a single suitcase. CNN captures the desperation on the dock in Port Sudan, thousands hoping to leave a nation at war with itself. Up first for us, First Republic goes bust. The company's 84 branches are open, but under a new banner that after regulators seized it and then broken an emergency weekend deal to sell it off. JPMorgan Chase now takes over, nearly all of First Republic's assets. The government says all depositors are protected, and that the 92 billion in First Republic deposits are safe. First Republicans failure is the second largest in U.S. history. And it happens despite a big bank effort to prop it up, remember a $30 billion cash infusion in March. The president hopes bad things come only in threes and that the string of bank failures; Silicon Valley, Signature, now First Republic is finished. And the president hopes the collapse doesn't complicate the Feds mission of trying to cool down inflation. Let's get straight to CNN's Matt Egan in New York. Matt, a big deal over the weekend. Walk us through what happened and what it means?",

      "sentences": "Well, John, JPMorgan is coming to the rescue. And that is a big relief to U.S. officials and really everyone worried about this banking crisis. Let me run you through some of the numbers here. So, JP Morgan is paying the FDIC $10.6 billion to buy most of First Republic. So, what does that mean?Well, JPMorgan is taking $173 billion of First Republic's loans, putting it on their books, and this is very important. JPMorgan is acquiring all $92 billion in First Republic deposits. That means if you have your money with First Republic, you're good, your money is safe. Even above that $250,000 FDIC insurance limit. The government did have to sweeten the deal here a little bit that the FDIC is sharing with JPMorgan on the bulk of the losses on potential loan losses. Now all of this comes together after a another weekend scramble in Washington and on Wall Street to try to come to a solution on this First Republic situation. A source tell CNN that, Secretary -- Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, she had been in touch with regulators all week as First Republic was teetering. JPMorgan says that more than 800 of its employees were doing homework and doing due diligence on First Republic trying to get this deal done. Ultimately, First Republic does become the second biggest bank failure in U.S. history. Second only since the 2008 failure of Washington Mutual, but they are breathing a sigh of relief in Washington and on Wall Street about how this deal gets done. The fact that JPMorgan is stepping up here with a private sector solution is certainly better than a situation where the government had to control this bank and rescue uninsured depositors. John?",

Inflation is still pretty rapid. Maybe we need to do more.And I think that what we saw this morning, what we saw last night is probably an argument against doing more. You know, it certainly puts the thumb down in that that camp, because like you said, what we're going to see out of this is some amount of nervousness on the part of banks, and that's likely to lead to less lending, less mortgages, fewer business expansions and that's going to hurt the little guy.",

And so, I think that the question is, how do we beef up bank regulation and supervision going forward to make sure that those problems that we can these banks that allowed these problems to grow? How do we make sure that that doesn't happen again? And I think that's the next phase of the situation.",

So, you see a pullback in the banking system. You can pretty quickly see that translate into a pullback in jobs and wages, and all the things that we all care about.I think the second thing that matters, and we haven't seen this yet, but you could see this is there have been a lot of headlines about this. You know, I've been reading about this every day for the last month and a lot of my colleagues have as well. And sometimes you can see a situation where that will sort of trickle out to hurt consumer sentiment. It will make people feel less confident and will make businesses feel less good about expanding.

It's going to go through the committee process, sidestep that question.Mitch McConnell, in the immediate aftermath of the Dobbs decision would not get behind a federal ban. So, this is a state's issue. The Republicans have been, the dog who got the car since Roe went over was overturned. They want this. They advocate for this for so many years. They got conservative justices on the Supreme Court. But when it happened, what was the Republican response really all over the map?

Lots of states that are passing, are trying to pass various bills would happen in South Carolina. Last week, as an example of this of a bill that would have been really restrictive on abortion. And putting that forward, not just for Nikki Haley and Tim Scott, who are from South Carolina, but for all the Republican candidates. Or is the standard going to be the Florida ban after six weeks at Ron DeSantis is at. I've talked to Democrats who say to me that they are expecting that when the Republican candidates come together for their first presidential debate. One of those raise your hands, do you agree or disagree moments is going to be? Do you think that the Florida ban after six weeks should be the national standard? If it is, then that is pretty far from what seems like based on polling where many voters are. I think the other thing that's going on here is that after the Dobbs decision, there was a lot of talk of Republican legislatures of well, we're going to do things to make adoption easier or things like that none of that has been in place.
