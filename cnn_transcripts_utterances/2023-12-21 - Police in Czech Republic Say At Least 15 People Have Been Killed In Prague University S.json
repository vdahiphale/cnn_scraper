Tonight, we are tracking breaking news out of the CzechRepublic where a mass shooting has caused at least 15 people and injured dozens of others. Authorities say the 24-year-old shooter is dead and this is not an act of terrorism. The attack took place at Prague's historic Charles University where the gunman was apparently a student. The police say they were tipped off that the gunman may be traveling to Prague to take his own life. They evacuated the building as a precaution, they then received a call about a shooting at a different location. Now, the pictures are quite distressing. Students locked themselves in the classrooms if they could end this dramatic image shows clinging to the ledge of a building, trying to hide from the attacker to save their own lives. Security forces quickly swarmed the area around the campus as the attack unfolded. Mass readings are common in places like the U.S., however, of course, this is extremely unusual in somewhere like the Czech Republic, and the president says he is shocked. Melissa Bell is monitoring the breaking story for us. Melissa, not terrorism in the sense of organized terrorism. What do we believe it is?",

In fact, we've just been hearing from the Czech leader in a speech to the nation, clearly very shocked about what has happened. That there was no link to that, giving thoughts, of course, and condolences to the families who had Christmas will find themselves without their loved ones. It is a tragically high death toll already. At least, 15 dead and many of those wounded critically so. So, that could yet rise. What we understand happened is that this young man, a  24-year-old Czech man who had been a philosophy student at the Charles University in the heart of Prague, had been planning to take his own life. That tip-off from the police, as you say, allowed them to clear one building, and it is in fact, a different one that he struck, not in the building where he was due to have his 2:00 p.m. philosophy lecture. They also found the body of his father, who he had apparently killed in his village a couple of hours from Prague before heading to Prague University to carry on with --",

Today is the 21st ofDecember, four days for many in the world, of course, celebrate Christmas. And yet, absolutely no sign of any political solution to the deadly war between Israel and Hamas. Hostage negotiations are simply deadlocked. Israel says it wants to broker another deal to release more hostages from Gaza. Hamas are saying, no negotiations will go ahead without -- in their words, full cessation of aggression. And the fighting grinds on. Civilians continue to pay the heavy price. Israel's military operations in Gaza is now said to have killed approximately 20,000 people. That's according to the Palestinian Health Ministry, and most of those people, women and children. And when it comes to hopes of a truce or indeed a diplomatic solution, it's a standstill. The U.N. Security Council vote on a resolution in Gaza has been delayed several times. Negotiations are reportedly ongoing. Jerusalem correspondent Jeremy Diamond is with me from Tel Aviv. It feels - - I mean, the way we've written it tonight, you know, everywhere I am going, from New York through here to London and onwards, everywhere is slowly starting to shut down and get ready for Christmas, and shops closing, festive atmosphere.

But unfortunately, today, Hamas putting out a statement saying that they would effectively stick with their position that they have had for several weeks now, which is to say that they will not engage in negotiations until there is a ceasefire by Israel. Effectively saying that they will not negotiate while fighting is still happening in Gaza. That is, of course, antithetical to the position of Israel, which has said that it is willing to offer a week-long pause in the fighting, but only if there is an exchange of hostages, only if there is a deal, effectively. And so, that puts the two parties in a very different position. There -- effectively, there was a lot of hope in recent days, especially in the wake of the killing of those three hostages. But there was a lot of pressure on the Israeli government. And the Israeli government does seem to have moved. The issue now, apparently, is that Hamas is not moving.

Theoretically, major crisis of this sort, this is -- we don't want, in decades, kind of, crisis, canopen up theoretically, you know, political opportunities, diplomatic opportunities. I don't see it for several reasons. One is that I don't see it happening in Israel right now. I don't see it happening in -- amongst Palestinians. But more importantly, the U.S. which has the biggest role, I don't see anything in this president's resume that says he is able to do what needs to be done to move anything moving forward given the fact that he couldn't even condemn the bombings that most in the world see as, at a minimum, war crimes. So, it's -- and even worse being essentially complicit in them. So, it's a problem right now for diplomacy. And I would go even further. I don't think it's right to talk about it now because we're near an ending. We need to think about ending the conflict, both the Palestinians and Israelis are suffering. A lot of innocents mostly innocents, as you know. I mean, people are homeless. People are, you know, facing increasing casualties. But also, we still are possibly facing escalation. It's not on the question that the northern front between Hezbollah and Israel could erupt any time. It's not on the question that Iran could be drawn in. It's not on the question that the U.S. could be drawn in. So, we really are up against what we should put all our efforts in is not thinking so much, because we don't know how this is going to end. Anybody who thinks they do -- well, I, at least they're smarter than me as a political scientist who've been observing this for decades. I don't know how this is going to go.

Now, whether it likes it or not, the U.S. Supreme Court is very likely to play a major role in next year's U.S. presidential election. It's already got at least two cases. Lawyers for Former President Donald Trump are asking the court to stay out of a dispute on immunity. This may be a delaying tactic after the special counsel for extraordinary rulings on Trump's immunity claims. Trump's team is also vowing to appeal a rule by Colorado's Supreme Court. Kicking the former president off the ballot because of the 14th Amendment to the constitution, insurrection. Smith has weighed in today. He's urged the court to decide immediately on immunity. He said the charges of the utmost gravity. CNN's Justice Correspondent Jessica Schneider joins me from Washington. I'm fascinated by the Colorado decision because I'm seeing lots of serious academic people saying that, actually, the Colorado majority is right. Legally, they got the decision right. But if we -- and since this is a state matter, what happens when it gets to the Supreme Court? And then just to really muddle your mind, the three people that Trump put on the court.

So, yes, I would agree with you. I think they will find ultimately if when -- if and when they take up this case to keep Donald Trump on the ballot.

It's all about the amount of money that we're going to have for the end of year, but services can be expected to be very busy. Now, ruling by Europe's top court on Thursday basically could open up new opportunities for competitive football. You remember a few years ago, there was an idea for a Super League involving Europe's 12 biggest clubs. It ended in failure in less than 48 hours after UEFA and FIFA really went after it. There was outrage, players in the sporting and governing bodies. Now, the European courts ruled that the actions of FIFA and UEFA were monopolistic. That they had no right to do what they did, or if they did, it was so un -- in transparent that these acted as a monopoly. Darren Lewis is with me, CNN Senior Sports Analyst. The interesting thing is, Darren, the court didn't say, you can't have this or you can't do this. They basically said, FIFA and UEFA had acted as a monopoly and therefore had acted unfairly. And as I read FIFA's statement tonight, they have sort of avoided that little bit of it.",

The whole idea of a Super League would have been over. Instead, crucially, they did say no uncertain terms that FIFA and UEFA rules blocking the formation of a Super League are contrary to E.U. law. And they also did say crucially that the commercial rights, the rules around those are anti-competitive. Now, as you and our viewers know UEFA are the European football's governing body.
