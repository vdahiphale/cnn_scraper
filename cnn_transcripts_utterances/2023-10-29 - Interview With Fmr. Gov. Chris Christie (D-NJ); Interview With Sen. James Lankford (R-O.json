With drones, helicopters and Israeli fighter jets circling the skies, Israel says the next phase of its war against the terrorist group Hamas has begun, with Israeli leaders confirming their troops are inside Gaza and prepared for a -- quote -- \"long and difficult fight.\" We're just now getting our first looks at the damage inside Gaza, as lines of communication to the area are slowly coming back online after they were cut days ago, prompting increasingly dire warnings from aid workers about the conditions for civilians there. There's 2.3 million Palestinians in Gaza in Israel. That concern is shared by the families of Hamas hostages still trapped in Gaza. They fear the barrage of Israeli attacks make it less likely their loved ones will ever return home. And, this morning, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is apologizing after tweeting blame at his military and security service leaders, accusing them of being unprepared for the October 7 Hamas attack. That tweet received widespread criticism and prompted a rare deletion of the tweet and apology from Netanyahu. Joining us now from Cairo, CNN's Melissa Bell. And, Melissa, we're learning that a small number of aid trucks have entered Gaza this morning. Tell us more.",

And we stand firmly for the proposition that all measures should be taken that are reasonable and responsible to protect the lives of civilians. As I said before, Hamas is going out of its way to make this more difficult. They are hiding among, integrating among those civilians and turning those civilians into human shields. But that does not lessen Israel's responsibility in this regard. And we have had conversations privately, as well as our public pronouncements, private conversations with Israel about the need to protect innocent civilians and to be targeted in their military operations, so that it's focused on the terrorists and not on innocent people whose lives deserve to be protected.",

And even though we have started to see Israel move in on the ground, that has not changed our basic view that this has to remain a paramount priority, that we have to keep working at it.

And Speaker Mike Johnson of Louisiana is already laying out his priorities, one of the most pressing issues on his plate, aid for Israel. Our next guest is on the Senate Intelligence Committee, Senator James Lankford, Republican of Oklahoma. Senator, thanks so much for joining us. So, the U.S. has been encouraging Israel to delay a full ground invasion in order to make an effort to get all 230, I think it is, hostages out. Israel has, of course, announced the second phase of the war and is launching more attacks in the Gaza Strip from air and also from land. Does the intelligence suggest that a delay would hurt Israel's goals to destroy Hamas? SEN. JAMES LANKFORD (R-OK):  Yes, obviously, I can't get into the actual intelligence documents itself, but it is a very complicated issue, where Hamas has about 500 miles' worth of tunnels underneath all of the area in Gaza. So it's a very complicated environment to be able to hide hostages. Right now, Israel is trying to be able to bombard some of those areas. They know where there is Hamas fighters, where there are leadership, and where there are key whether ammunition depot, missile storage, or, obviously, where their military typically functions underground. But going after hostages is incredibly difficult in an urban environment, because no one knows where they are. Hamas is obviously trickling them out, trying to prevent anyone. But if you stop right now and if you pause, it gives opportunity for Hamas to dig in more and to be able to lay more booby traps. So it is a judgment call that has to be made on the ground based on intelligence right now. It also has to be an issue of the United States positioning more and more missile defense systems, as we have already seen the Houthis actually launch guided precision missiles from Yemen towards Israel that our forces were able to take out on their way in. So we have seen that. This is an ongoing issue, not only to preposition more missile defense, but also to watch out for hostages.",

These are folks that were just at their homes, at music events, at other places where they were snatched away and kidnapped. So everyone is very concerned for them. The challenge is, what's the right way to be able to go get them? How do you actually go do that? How long are they going to be used as a pawn? What is Hamas going to do? We have already seen their ruthlessness. What are they going to do in the meantime to those individuals? So, there's a priority to go after those individuals, to make sure they can get to them and to be able to rescue them, which, obviously, Israel has done many times, to go rescue hostages. But there's a priority to also make sure Hamas doesn't come back on the ground forces, as you have seen their on the ground, multiple missile attacks from Gaza every single moment, where they continue to be able to attack Israel over and over again. So it's not as if they have paused. They certainly continue to be able to fight.",

They know the Israelis will fight morally, though they are -- Hamas is not fighting morally. Hamas can step in and can slaughter 1,400 people while they're sleeping in their beds, and they hold Israel to a higher standard to say, you won't go after a hospital. And even when Hamas itself actually launched out rockets and actually struck one of their own hospitals, they blamed Israel for that, which has been well-documented now that that was actually a rocket that was actually fired from within Gaza that hit one of the their own hospitals. But, again, they will blame Israel for any of that.

We're vulnerable in our nation. We have had 70,000 people in the last two years that have crossed our Southern border that have been released in to the United States that the administration calls special interest aliens. These are individuals, most of them fighting-age men from Iran, from Iraq, from Syria, from other war-torn areas that have crossed into our border and have been released. We continue to be able to challenge to say, we have got to do more than just identify these individuals and release them into the country. They can't be just released. So, the administration has asked for additional funding. Unfortunately, the funding that they have asked for actually facilitates faster movement across the border, rather than actually deterring people. So we have got to actually have a change in policy on how we're going to handle parole, how we're going to handle asylum, the most basic elements to deter people, not facilitate faster movement. So there's a lot to still be done in that time. Israel, we have got to be able to respond quickly on.

So it does happen quite often. Mostly, you see it there in places like Sderot, very close to Gaza. You see it in Ashkelon. You see it in Ashdod. But what is unusual is that you are seeing it here every single day. Tel Aviv, it doesn't happen all the time. Now, since the war started, you are seeing it every single day. Just an hour-and-a-half or so ago, we saw rockets intercepted here again. And you get it very, very -- so, it's why the population here is extremely worried. Tel Aviv looks nothing like it would normally look. It is usually filled with people, everyone's on the beach, especially on a weekend, on a Sunday. You would see people everywhere. You're not seeing that, because people are afraid, and they have gone into their homes, near their safe rooms.
