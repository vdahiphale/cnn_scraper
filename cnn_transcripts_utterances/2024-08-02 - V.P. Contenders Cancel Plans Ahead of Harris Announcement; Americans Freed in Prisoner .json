A number of Kamala Harris' final vice presidential contenders are canceling events this weekend ahead of her highly anticipated V.P. announcement on Tuesday. Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear calling off a planned stop at a local distillery, Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg canceling a trip to Indiana due to, quote, unforeseen scheduling constraints, and Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro scrambling a scheduled fundraising swing through New York. Then there's contender J.B. Pritzker cracking this joke when asked about his weekend plans.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV. J.B. PRITZKER (D-IL):  Lalapalooza is happening this weekend here in Chicago. And my kids and, I mean, tens of thousands of others are going to be there. You know, I've heard other governors talk about how they've canceled their weekend plans. I was going to perform, of course, with Blink 182 on Sunday, but I've canceled in order to clear my schedule. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

I think he makes sense ideologically. I think there's also just a practical consideration. I can't imagine that the vice president comes to Philadelphia on Tuesday, has Josh Shapiro on that stage and introduces someone other than Josh Shapiro as her running mate.Geographically, everyone knows the importance of Pennsylvania in the 19 electoral votes. Ideologically, he provides balance to her, and I think it helps contend and limit some of that perception of her as being far left and a progressive from San Francisco.",

We've seen Vice President Harris, to your point, that her record in that primary, especially in 2019 into the 2020 race, when she took some of these positions that she's now being criticized for, for being too far left. She's in recent days disavowed her past support for banning fracking, which is a huge issue in Pennsylvania? How do you think that is playing?

I mean, there have been any number of positions on which it seems in the last couple of months that it's a different Kamala Harris than she who ran initially as a candidate herself. Shapiro brings the necessary ideological balance.It's interesting to me because the very thing that some progressives are raising and saying are problematic for him, I think, are advantageous, for example, his support of school vouchers, or some of the words that he has used in being critical of anti-Semitism and some of the protesters in the last several months on college campuses. I think it's great for Kamala Harris because every time she's perceived as or portrayed as being very far to the left, there's Josh Shapiro who's going to lend some ideological balance to that ticket. She has other choices. I mean, Mark Kelly is central casting good, and he provides what she needs in terms of a response to her border policy, and whatever that role is that she had in the border. So, she's got a lot of good choices, but I'd be floored if it weren't Shapiro. DEAN:  And in your mind, there's a lot of different ways to kind of look at this and picking a running mate. Are they balancing out? Are they going to bring their home state with them, like you're talking about with Josh Shapiro? Are they going to balance out the ticket? Maybe in terms of in this case, it's a white man with a black woman of South Asia -- South Asian black woman. What do you see in terms of your Kamala Harris and her team? How are you balancing out the ticket? What are you looking for?",

Everybody's going to have something, you know, that they've got to deal with. The best thing about this vice presidential audition, though, man, the thing that Biden had been lacking for so long that I would come on the show and complain about all the time is where are the surrogates? Where are the surrogates? He's not a super strong communicator. Where's the rest of the Democratic Party? They got this deep bench. Why aren't they putting them out there? A V.P. audition was apparently how you did it. Suddenly, there's Gretchen Whitmer. There's Pete. There's Tim. Who knew about Tim Waltz? We didn't know. And so to have all of them out there, you know, putting on a show so that they got the attention that they needed, but what I am curious about is they're going to bring them all together. And she's only going to choose one of them. I don't know if they're going to have a fist fight or what they're going to do. What is happening? But I hope that on the other side of this thing (ph), they all continue the surrogacy with the same enthusiasm with which they've auditioned for the vice presidency.",

But there are really three reasons -- three things -- three directions you can go when you're looking at a running mate. If you think someone can bring you a state, historically that actually hasn't really worked very often, but could Shapiro really help in Pennsylvania, maybe when it's this close.Number two, to balance out a weakness of yours, and, you know, maybe Mark Kelly on immigration helps there as voters still think Republicans are stronger. Or the third option is double down on your strength, double down on the contrast you want to make with the other side, like when Bill Clinton picked Al Gore, and people were like, wait, there's no geographic balance there, but if they were presenting change, generational change, someone like Shapiro, someone like Buttigieg really could underscore that whole part of it. So, I think there's a few different ways she can go, but I don't think she can go wrong with any of them.",

Not only do you have to coordinate those diverse interests, you have to keep it from leaking.And it was only two nights ago, and I worked with all these governments that I actually heard about it. I mean, literally not a peep that they had created a deal had actually transpired. So, I think that it's not just that the Biden administration deserves a lot of credit here, NATO deserves a lot of credit here. NATO is stronger. It is more coordinated.

First, the editor-in-chief of Foreign Policy Magazine writing this, it is the contrast drawn by Thursday's events that will be remembered. There was Washington fighting for the freedom of not only its own citizens, but also Russians who dared to criticize their own government. And in stark relief, there was Moscow openly trading journalists for criminals and Nobel winners, for fraudsters. The symbolism of the movement will not have been lost on Russian President Vladimir Putin. This exchange isn't a great look for him.And then you have Tom Nichols in The Atlantic writing, more important and more dangerous is the fact that every successful hostage deal is a signal from Putin to the people who do his bidding overseas, that he will rescue them if they are caught. Make no mistake that Kremlin is getting what it wants. Where do you land kind of in those two ways of thinking about this?",

They are cyber hackers. They've engaged in espionage. In one case, he's an assassin, in the case of the one that was arrested in Germany. And these are not people that we should in any way be happy are getting freed and going back to Russia where they can continue to engage in that criminal behavior. That's a win for Putin.But the reason that Putin gets that win is because we in the United States and our allies care about freeing our citizens. We care about getting them back to their families, that we place an even greater value on their lives than we do on Russia scoring this win. And I personally am proud to live in a society that acts that way. I think that's the way we should act. But we need to recognize that Russia is getting what they want here. And there's a reason why Russia has hundreds of billions of dollars of their assets seized and now used for Ukraine's defense. There's a reason why there are such heavy sanctions on Russian oligarchs. There's a reason why someone like me can be sanctioned by the Russian government just for writing the honest truth about what's happening in international relations around the world. And that's why we're fighting with this country. It's a dangerous, again, dangerous environment with a country with that many nuclear weapons, that behaves with such impunity on the global stage with allies who are also powerful.
