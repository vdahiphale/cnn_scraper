I don't need to tell you that, but it's 9 a.m. here in London, 11 p.m. still in Honolulu, Hawaii, with less than an hour left until the islands enter 2025 too. In the last hour, the Western U.S. rang in the New Year, including Vegas, where there wasn't a bad seat really in the house or on the streets, with multiple fireworks displays filling the skies there. CNN crews in Austin, Texas, captured these shots just as the central time zone marked the start of 2025. Meanwhile, in South America, officials in Rio de Janeiro say about 2.5 million people crowded Copacabana Beach to see the midnight fireworks. CNN's Leigh Waldman takes us now to New York, though, for a look at how Times Square began the New Year. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

At one point on Tuesday, nearly 90 percent of customers were without power. Right now, about 30 percent remain in the dark, according to Luma Energy.Sherrell Hubbard brings us that story. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SHERRELL HUBBARD, CNN REPORTER (voice-over): A massive power outage in Puerto Rico has its population scrambling. The power went out 5:30 a.m. Tuesday, leaving island dwellers waking up in the dark. Residents spent the better part of Tuesday getting gas to run generators. Some expressed their frustration, saying the outage is affecting them at an inopportune time. UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator): I understand it's a critical situation, a day like today, New Year's Eve. Well, we'll be in a difficult situation. HUBBARD (voice-over): Puerto Rico's governor says a critical failure in the island's power grid caused the blackout. He said the government and providers are working to restore service as quickly as possible. Luma Energy, a power company responsible for power distribution and transmission on the island, says it'll take up to 48 hours to reach full restoration. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (through translator): Complete frustration, frustration, disappointment in the government, in the institutions and everything. HUBBARD (voice-over): Power outages on the island have been an ongoing source of frustration throughout the years. The island's inconsistent power system has faltered before. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (through translator): More than the holidays, what worries me is this country's development. I work here in the pharmaceutical industry. No industries that really want to invest in this country will come here if we don't improve the infrastructure. HUBBARD (voice-over): I'm Sherrell Hubbard reporting. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

The skies above Victoria Harbor in Hong Kong lit up with fireworks launched from barges with an impressive laser light show there in the background. In New York, the famous Kiss Cam came out as Times Square attendees took part in that New Year's tradition. And the London Eye took center stage as fireworks illuminated the skies here in the U.K. Right now, at St Peter's Basilica in Vatican City, Pope Francis is holding his first Mass of the year to mark the World Day of Peace. In his New Year's message, the Pope is asking God to help a world filled with chaos of war and uncertainty. And in Bangladesh, thousands of people rallied at a March for Unity five months after the country's Prime Minister was ousted from power. On Tuesday, student groups and families gathered in Dakar to remember the victims of the unrest. More than 1,000 people were killed during last year's anti-government protests. Now, in Puerto Rico, a not-so-festive and bright lead-up to the new year, a critical failure in the island's power grid caused a massive blackout. More than half of all customers rang in the new year in the dark, and nearly a third are still without power. Luma Energy, the Canadian- American power company that took over management from the government in 2021, is still investigating the cause of the outage. CNN en Espanol spoke with residents who were left with no choice but to deal with the unreliable power system. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator): I understand that it is a difficult situation, a critical situation. A day like today, the end of the year, well, we are going to be in a difficult situation. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (through translator): Complete frustration.
