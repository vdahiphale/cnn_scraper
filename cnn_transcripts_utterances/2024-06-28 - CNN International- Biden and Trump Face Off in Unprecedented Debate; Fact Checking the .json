We're told the president had been battling a cold and was suffering from a sore throat.His delivery was at times shaky and his messages muddled. Donald Trump went on the offensive with personal and often bitter attacks against his opponent.

This shouldn't be a debate. He is the worst president. He just said it about me because I said it. But look, he's the worst president in the history of our country. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Thomas, I think we've got a pretty good sense there that there was a lot that President Biden could have challenged President Trump on and he failed.THOMAS GIFT, DIRECTOR, CENTRE ON U.S. POLITICS, UNIVERSITY COLLEGE LONDON: I think you're absolutely right, Max. And thanks so much for having me as always. Joe Biden's job last night was really to demonstrate that at age 81, he's capable of serving four more years in office. For Democrats, my sense is that opinions on last night's performance range anywhere from disappointing to fully cataclysmic. Debates don't matter until they do. And I think that this debate mattered. Biden was incoherent at times, he didn't project, he struggled to maintain his train of thought. He wasn't able to fact check Trump on the fly. That's the assessment not from Republicans, but from liberal surrogates, from campaign operatives, from advisors, from lawmakers. I do think that if you just read the transcript of the debate, maybe last night was a draw or a slight advantage to Trump. But Americans don't read the transcript. They look at the performance debates or theater. And on what is the biggest night of this campaign so far, I think Biden proved largely incapable of defending his own record and also of attacking Trump on being the threat to democracy that he insists that he is.",

It's all about one minute, two minute sound bites, and it's hard to get into too much detail.But in this instance, you know, Biden seemed largely incapable of going into depth on a lot of his record. Donald Trump wasn't necessarily interrupting him because he couldn't with this mute button. But at the same time, Biden essentially just wasn't able to get all of it out that he wanted to. So it was not a very substantive debate. It's one that probably Americans aren't going to learn very much from in terms of what both of these candidates offer. But maybe that's OK, because on some level, I think these candidates offer such radically and diametrically opposed visions of America that everyone kind of knows what they're getting with a Trump presidency and a Biden presidency.",

And no surprise, it looks a lot like his previous foreign policy. Absolutely willing to turn to tariffs to turn around trade imbalances, he sees, be it with China, be it with the European Union. And again, this sort of his relationship with President Putin, which he claims to be great, and Putin would never have invaded Ukraine under his watch. He sort of doubles down on that. And I think it's instructive when you listen to what he had to say about the support the United States is giving right now to Ukraine.

The U.S. State Department is again urging citizens to strongly reconsider travel to that country. In Gaza 68 sick and injured children were evacuated to Egypt. Israel says they'll receive medical treatment in Egypt or elsewhere. Gaza's health care system has largely collapsed after months of relentless fighting. The World Health Organization says more than 10,000 patients still need medical evacuations. For more we're joined by CNN correspondent Nada Bashir.

So even the care that is available in the Gaza Strip right now isn't necessarily the care that is needed by many of those who have been wounded including of course adults who have been injured over the course of this war. But according to Israeli authorities this latest evacuation saw 68 injured and sick children along with their companions being evacuated into Egypt. We haven't seen an evacuation like this for months really but there has been continuing pressure for Israel to allow for some evacuations to take place. This has been carried out in coordination with both Egypt and the United States and of course U.N. coordination as well. But we've heard from U.N. officials saying that there are still more than 10,000 patients who need to be evacuated from Gaza. And it's very unlikely that we're going to see that taking place at any time soon because of course the security situation on the ground is extremely challenging for these aid organizations.",

They have said that they will stand by and provide that security assistance if indeed Israel and Lebanon enter into an all-out war. They have clarified there will not be U.S. boots on the ground. But again this is a warning signal perhaps. There is certainly rising concern over the potential for an all-out war between Hezbollah and the Israeli military. And of course we've heard from the Lebanese government as well. They don't want to see a war on Lebanese territory.

They'll decide whether they want to keep President Emmanuel Macron and his centrist government in power or chose the far-right National Rally party and its longtime leader Marine Le Pen. If no one gets a majority on Sunday, a second round of voting will be held a week later. Macron called the snap election, the national election, after his party came in a distant second to Le Pen's far-right group in the recent European parliament elections. More now from CNN's Melissa Bell. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MELISSA BELL, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): It was, for France's national rally, a historic win. The European elections marked the first time the hard right had won a poll nationally. Now the party is campaigning for seats in France's parliament and a shot at government. UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator): The party was long demonized. But that's the work that Marine Le Pen and her team have managed to do, to show that we are a party capable of governing and a party that is democratic. BELL (voice-over): No mean feat for a woman who inherited the party from her father, the Holocaust denier Jean-Marie Le Pen, who founded the National Rally, or National Front as it was known, with former French members of Hitler's SS. A history steeped in fascism that was credited with long keeping the party from power, even when it got close. France is a country, after all, heavily marked by the horrors of Nazi Germany.",

But in the new village, rebuilt after the war, the European elections saw the National Rally come first here too. PHILIPPE LACROIX, MAYOR OF ORADOUR-SUR-GLANE, FRANCE (through translator): Here the national rally did a big score, like in other rural communities. Times have changed, the means of communication are no longer the same, societal issues have evolved too, and there's been a detoxification of the extremes, of the far right. BELL (voice-over): The key also for the National Rally, the young, who voted massively in favor of a party that few in the past would have admitted voting for, but that has now gained something that long eluded it. UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator): Legitimacy, that's it. We're no longer ostracized, we're taken seriously. They said that 30 percent of French voted for us. French people who love their country, who don't want to see it change and get eaten by globalization. BELL (voice-over): A message that looks set to resonate in a parliamentary poll that could see the national rally gain not just legitimacy, but power itself. Melissa Bell, CNN, Oradour-sur-Glane.

The San Diego Zoo, of course, has a history of cooperating with China at panda conservation and actually has a special connection to one of the pandas on board. Yun Chuan's mother was actually born in San Diego. Now, as part of these agreements, zoos typically pay China a million U.S. dollars a year for their conservation efforts, and the Chinese say in many ways that has paid off with the population of pandas almost doubling in the past 30 years. Prompting the government in 2021 downgrading panda status from endangered species to vulnerable. China also has a history of engaging in so-called panda diplomacy, initially giving and then loaning pandas to countries with friendly or improving ties with Beijing. The U.S. received its two pandas in 1972, following then President Nixon's historic visit to China. But in more recent years, the number of pandas has dwindled in the U.S. with tensions rising between the two governments. Now, with bilateral ties somewhat stabilized, zoos in the U.S. and indeed in many countries that are U.S. allies are anticipating new arrivals again, with fresh agreements just announced for the National Zoo in Washington, DC, as well as zoos in Australia and most recently in Austria.
