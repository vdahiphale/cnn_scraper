      "sentences": "So, first, the war cabinet meeting itself, which starts in half an hour and will likely take place at the defense minister here behind me, is the first in a series of steps towards getting -- towards what would be getting a deal approved that would allow for the release of Palestinian prisoners in exchange for the release of hostages held in Gaza both Israeli and perhaps from other nationalities as well. For example, we know there are Nepali and Thai citizens who are hostages as well.This has to go through a legal and political process. First with the war cabinet, which as you said, is scheduled to meet in half an hour. Second, with the security cabinet, which is a slightly larger cabinet that includes other ministries. And then with the full cabinet, each gets a vote. There can be some arguments, some discussion in each of those. But crucially, the process looks like it's moving and moving quite quickly here. Following that, there's a 24-hour period where there can be appeals to the Supreme Court to try to stop this process. And then after that happens, if we get to an agreement, that can lead to the release of Palestinian prisoners and the freeing of Israeli hostages held in Gaza. We did just learn a little bit more here about what's happening on the government side. And again, this is more of a critical indication that this entire process is moving forward and that we might expect an announcement soon. This from the prime minister's office a short time ago, it says, in light of developments on the issue of the release of our hostages, the prime minister's office director general, Yossi Shelley, is now convening the Forum of Directors General of Government Ministries to prepare for dealing with and assisting on all necessary civilian aspects. So, although that doesn't tell us much about exactly what's happening, it is more statements and more indications that the government is preparing to handle the release of hostages and everything that entails.

      "sentences": "And there's a lot that this deal entails, and we don't know the full contours of exactly what it would be until announced and until hostages are actually freed. But one aspect that we've heard about, especially learned about this morning, is that this would -- could, would include three Palestinian prisoners in Israel being released for every one hostage being released by Hamas from Gaza. What do you know about prisoners in Israel?",

      "speaker": "LIEBERMANN",
      "sentences": "There are obviously thousands of Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli prisons, and that was the overarching goal of Hamas at the very beginning. They said quite early on, look, we'll release our 240 hostages in exchange for all of the Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails.Now, that's not what's happening here. From our understanding of the framework of the agreement, it'll be 50 women and children in exchange, as you said, at a three to one ratio for Palestinian women and children. And if that works over the course of a four-or five-day pause in the fighting, then it could be extended, 50 more hostages released in exchange for another 150 women and children, we still believe at this point. How it will work from the release of Israeli prisoners is 10 a day. We will see how it works on the Palestinian side of prisoners, whether it will be all at once or the same three to one. So, if 10 Israeli prisoners or hostages are released from Gaza, it will be 30 released. It's worth noting, though, that we have gotten no indication that any of the hostages held in Gaza are to be Israeli soldiers who will be released. And that's a key question because for the full release of the hostages, Hamas will have to agree to the release of Israeli soldiers who were captured in the terror attack on October 7th. But Hamas believes likely that those hostages that are soldiers are much more valuable to the Israeli government. Why? Because back in 2011, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu released 1027 Palestinian prisoners for a single Israeli soldier. It is likely that Hamas believes they can get many more of their prisoners released if they were to release the Israeli soldiers held in Gaza. So, that too is something we'll have to keep a very close eye on.",

It's been like this for about an hour. I mean, some of these security lines don't even have anybody in them. You can walk right up to TSA. So, all things considered, when you think about how many people are coming through O'Hare, as well as Midway, which is the airport on the other side of the city here in Chicago, when you consider 1.65 million travelers are expected to come through both of those airports this week, right now, this is looking pretty good.

A federal appeals court issuing a ruling that effectively prevents any private citizen or civil rights group from bringing a legal challenge under Section 2 of the law, the crucial part of the Voting Rights Act that prohibits voting or election discrimination based on race.Now, this ruling almost certainly will set up for another major showdown over voting rights and the Voting Rights Act, specifically before the Supreme Court. But before then, CNN Political Commentator and Former Democratic Member of the South Carolina House of Representatives Bakari Sellers is here to discuss. Bakari, I want to read something for you. It was a stat that was cited in court over this that has stuck with me, over the past 40 years, there have been at least 182 successful Section 2 cases. Of those 182 cases, only 15 were brought solely by the attorney general. This is part of the dissent. I mean, so what do you think the practical impact then of this ruling is?",

If you think back to the Edmund Pettus Bridge, you think back to sit ins, you think back to the Montgomery Bus Boycott, et cetera. So, there's a lot of blood on the ballot box in this country. And there was a high price that was paid for the Voting Rights Act.One of the things that happened in the Voting Rights Act, particularly with these southern states that have a history of discrimination, is you had these organizations, the ACLU, you had the NAACP, the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, that were able to come in and fight for that right and access to the ballot box when they felt as if that right was being infringed upon by laws that were passed by these state legislatures in the south. And so, now, it's a gut punch. Because now you just simply have to rely on the attorney general of the United States. And we're going to see how that plays out. I have faith in Merrick Garland. Don't get me wrong. I have more faith in Kristen Clarke who is over his department, his civil rights department. But this is not simply about this period of time, this is about what happens in the future. This is about what happens if there's a President Trump and what that means for his Department of Justice and what that means for voting rights around the country.
