The White House press secretary also said that Hawaii's governor, Josh Green, advised that he believes the search and recovery efforts will be at a stage by early next week to allow for a presidential visit.Now, throughout this process the White House has stressed that the president has been on the phones, receiving regular updates from both his FEMA administrator, as well as the state's senators and also the state's governors. But you have heard some frustration on the ground from people experiencing the devastation of these wildfires about the official response. So, this will give the president an opportunity perhaps to hear some of that frustration, to see some of this devastation and the loss of life that so many families are dealing with in this devastating moment.",

Meanwhile, prosecutors now also want to get the separate tax chargesoriginally filed in Delaware dismissed, instead bringing those charges to Washington, D.C., or California, locations where the alleged crimes occurred. And now that that -- now that the case appears to be heading to trial, Hunter Biden's top lawyer has asked a federal judge to allow him to withdraw from the case because he could now be called as a witness.

Trump is among eight presidential hopefuls who meet the polling and donor thresholds to take the stage, but he says he's not going to sign that RNC loyalty pledge that is needed to participate. And, of course, he's facing mounting legal troubles. He's now got a fourth criminal indictment against him. And his rivals are, of course, reacting to that.Former Republican congressman, and former GOP presidential candidate, Joe Walsh, is joining us now. Just, really quickly, will it matter if Donald Trump does not take this debate stage at this point? JOE WALSH (R), FORMER U.S. REPRESENTATIVE: Oh, God, no, not at all. Not one lick, Sara, will it matter if he's there.",

The most sweeping criminal case turns out against Donald Trump to be out of Georgia. There are 19 defendants, Donald Trump being one of them, and he is saying, I'm going to have this press conference and I'm going to show you all the fraud that happened in Georgia. There's only one person that has really come out strongly against him when it comes to the Republican Party, and that's Governor Kemp, who has said there is no fraud. That did not happen. And that 2024 -- this is really an important election, giving a hint that he's very concerned. He says the future of our country is at stake. I want to now let you listen to what the candidates who are actually running against Donald Trump in this GOP presidential race have to say about these charges. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV. RON DESANTIS (R-FL) AND 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I think it's an example of this criminalization of politics. SEN. TIM SCOTT (R-SC) AND 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: We see the legal system being weaponized against political opponents. That is un- American and unacceptable. VIVEK RAMASWAMI (R), 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: The reality is this, these are politicized persecutions through prosecution. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

He just wants to and has to be the story. Look, there's no anti-Trump lane in this Republican Party. I wish the - the world would wake up to this. All of these challengers, Sara, that he's got, from the beginning they've never really challenged him. DeSantis, Pence, Haley, Scott, none of them have gone after or condemned Trump. Why? Because if you condemn Donald Trump, you are done as a Republican. Period. So, what they've all done, Sara, is they've kind of hugged him and bowed to him and embraced him and echoed his deep state, he's a victim, they're coming after me bull crap, because that's the only lane. And, Sara, what they're hoping for is that a jail cell or a heart attack will take Trump out. But that's -- that's their only play. They know they can't beat him.",

Sixty-three-year-old Gordon Petersen, that you see clearly hawking something in that picture, has been on the run since 2020. The Utah state attorney's office says that he was selling fake products online claiming that they destroy the virus using vibrations. Petersen is also accused of falsely claiming to have two Ph.D.'s, falsely claiming also to be an anti-aging medical doctor.A highway in North Carolina has reopened after a 32-car pileup Tuesday. Parts of I-40 West near Durham, it was shut down, this is after severe weather led to the crash. Police say the storms also downed trees and power lines and closed other roads in the area. Durham authorities say that a 78-year-old woman was killed after a tree fell and struck her SUV in all of this. A new twist following the shooting on the \"Rust\" film set. Charges against actor Alec Baldwin could be refiled. This is because a new forensic report shows that the gun would only fire if the trigger of that gun, which was used in the incident, was pulled. The report was filed as part of a defense motion on behalf of the set's armorer, Hannah Gutierrez-Reed, who has been charged and is facing charges in this case. Baldwin was also originally charged, you'll remember, with involuntary manslaughter, but those charges were dropped earlier this year after prosecutors cited evidence that the gun had been modified. Baldwin has consistently said he did not pull the trigger. John.",

      "sentences": "Well, John, it's important to start this off with the fact, as you say, they claim. This is from the North Korean state-run media, KCNA. This is not coming directly from Travis King himself. But what Pyongyang is saying is that the reason that Travis King, they claim, went across the border was so that he could seek refuge in North Korea or in a third country. Now, in this article they say the soldier felt, quote, \"harbored illfeeling against inhuman maltreatment and racial discrimination within the U.S. Army.\" Now, a U.S. defense official has said that they can't verify the alleged comments from Travis King, but their priority remains to be making sure that they can get him home quickly and safely. Now, we have also heard from the mother of Travis King, through a statement from the spokesperson, since this has come out from North Korea. And this is reading, \"Mrs. Gates is aware of today's report from KCNA. DPRK authorities are responsible for Travis' well-being and she continues to appeal to them to treat him humanly. She's a mom worried about her son and would be grateful for a phone call from him.\" Now, of course, this is a very worrying time for the family. What we didn't see in this article, though, was any indication about the condition of Travis King or even his whereabouts. It's worth pointing out as well that this was an article in KCNA, which means its read by the outside world. It's not read inside North Korea. And as far as we know at this point they are completely unaware within the country that this has even happened. Now, this did happen a month ago. It's the first time we have heard anything about Travis King. So, certainly that at least will give some hope. John.",
