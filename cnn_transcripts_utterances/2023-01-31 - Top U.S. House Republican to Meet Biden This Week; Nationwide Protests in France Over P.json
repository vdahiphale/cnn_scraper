It will be the opening act of sorts on this debt ceiling situation that we will expect to be a very long and drawn out process. The House GOP and Speaker McCarthy trying to get together on what exactly they want to ask for.The White House is saying this is nonnegotiable. They do not want to negotiate lifting the debt ceiling which essentially allows the U.S. to go ahead and continue to pain what they've already signed up for. It's no new spending. This is paying for things that have already happened. Meantime House GOP and Kevin McCarthy the Speaker are saying, no, no, no, hold on a second. We want to negotiate some spending cuts and we're not going to agree to raise the debt ceiling without those spending cuts. So the question becomes now what will the House GOP asked for? That is what they're grappling with right now. At this point it appears it would be cut to domestic spending perhaps even cut to military spending. But we know that they want to stay away from Medicare and Social Security. Those two entitlement that they believe are still key that they do not want to touch. Because they are afraid, they may face voter backlash on that. But this meeting on Wednesday will be the first time these two men have sat down since Speaker McCarthy became the Speaker. And again, there is a big difference remember between just sitting down and meeting and actually negotiating. We don't expect any sort of negotiation to start until at least the House GOP can name exactly what it is they want and that is continued -- what we're continuing to hear from the president and also Senate Democrat which is that we want to see a plan first before we even begin speaking to you about it. So now it's up to the Speaker and House GOP to really drill down into what they're asking for. Jessica Dean, CNN, Capitol Hill. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

I've seen a lot in my career, but some things do stick with you and this will -- this will stay stained in my memory for many years to come.KAFANOV (voice-over): On Thursday, local state and federal authorities raided a property about 20 miles north of Grants Pass, where they seized evidence, including Foster's 2008 Nissan Sentra. During that search, police arrested a 68 year old woman for hindering prosecution and allegedly helping Foster evade law enforcement. Police say Foster evaded capture and likely received assistance in fleeing the area and believe he is actively using online dating applications to contact unsuspecting individuals who may be lured into assisting with a suspect's escaped or potentially as additional victims. This isn't Foster's first run in with the law. Court records show he was charged in two separate cases, accusing him of attacking women while living in Las Vegas years earlier. In the first case, Foster was charged with felony battery constituting domestic violence. His ex-girlfriend testified that he had attempted to strangle her in a rage in 2017 after another man texted her. LT. JEFF HATTERSLEY, GRANTS PASS POLICE DEPARTMENT: He's a felon on the run. He doesn't want to go back to prison. He's probably willing to do anything to stay out of prison. KAFANOV (voice-over): While that case was still pending in court in 2019, Foster was charged with felony assault, battery and kidnapping for allegedly attacking another woman, his girlfriend at the time. The victim told police Foster strangled her to the point of unconsciousness several times and kept her tied up for most of the next two weeks. Court records show she said she escaped after convincing Foster to go shopping. Foster ultimately agreed to plead deals, sentenced to a maximum of 30 months in prison, but given credit for the 729 days served in the first case.

There was a question of how to persuade new recruits who arrived at the front lines and saw what is going on there and decided they don't want to fight, to still go ahead and fight.

Strong decisions to be taking timely and implemented very quickly. In other words, figure out what your actually going to send us and then send it to us quickly. Because is needed very badly.And so of course, they were asking for the HIMARS artillery systems. They got those. Then they were asking for air defense. They got not only just air defense but they got the Rolls-Royce of air defense systems in the Patriot batteries that are being sent to Ukraine. And then it was tanks. Something that didn't really seem like it was on the table that Western allies were going to send these fighting vehicles. They look like tanks but they're not as heavily armored. They don't have the same gauge or anything on them. And so, then eventually Western allies came around. And even the U.S. had said its tank this M1 Abrams was too complicated, too finicky, too much of a gas guzzler to send. Maybe too much of a headache than it was actually worth. The Americans actually did come around on those. Same with the Germans as well. And so, now the big asking for these fighter jets and you hear President Biden say point-blank, will you send fighter jets -- or F-16 fighter jets to Ukraine. His answer was very clearly, no. The German chancellor also saying he doesn't see a situation where that happens. So, remember he said the same thing about tanks. You have France and the Netherlands saying yesterday that they actually have a been asked so nothing is off the table. Incidentally, the Ukrainian defense minister was actually in Paris today. But remember, even if Ukraine were to get these things, nothing happens overnight. I mean, the training on the Patriot missile system is several months, the same with the tanks. And now you have a situation where even if F-16s were to be sent today -- which is obviously not the situation -- it would still require Ukrainian pilots to train on them for some six months before ever getting onto the battlefield. So, that's why President Zelenskyy is saying, look, guys, make up your minds, figure out what you're going to send and get it to us ASAP.",

That's not me saying that that's not Ukraine saying that that's the head of the Wagner private mercenary group saying that the Ukrainian have it extremely well defended. It also has the natural defenses he says as well that make it extremely difficult to take. But now the Russians really not having a lot of success going straightat it. They are using a more familiar tactic which is to try to encircle it. So, slowly but surely, they are moving in from the north and from the South and the few escape routes at the Ukrainians have left are under a heavy fire over the last week or so as well. And so, now the Ukrainians are floating even the possibility of withdrawal. One commander saying, look, if we were to withdraw it would be to preserve the lives of our soldiers.
