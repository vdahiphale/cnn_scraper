And this of course, is likely to happen in the coming hours as rescuers reach more remote parts of the quake zone.Now, that is one of the two key challenges they were facing the location of this quake zone even though on paper, the epicenter is only some 100 kilometers away from Gansu provincial capital city Lanzhou where residents by the way also felt strong tremors overnight. But because this area is mountainous, and mostly rural, and sparsely populated, it really is hampering the speed of the rescuers getting to some of the far flung corners of this area. And the other challenge, of course, is the weather as you mentioned, much of northern China, including that part of the country has been experiencing a cold snap in the past few days. Overnight temperatures in this quake zone reaching minus 15 minus 16 Celsius, that is only five degrees Fahrenheit. So this kind of bitter winter cold, obviously, impacting the rescuers efforts as well. And also, it could shorten the so called golden window that it's 72 hours of golden window for survivors to be pulled out of the rubble, according to experts. So that's why the clock is literally ticking here. But already of course, we've seen the authorities both in the central government and local governments sprang into action, the Chinese military joining the effort as well as sending a large transport aircraft carrying 14 tons of goods including vehicles and other supplies as well as personnel to Lanzhou the provincial capital city and also the central government here in Beijing already releasing 30 million U.S. dollars worth of emergency release funds to the two provinces affected. And already we have seen 1,600 firefighters on the scene that with more reinforcement on the way but still, this is on course to become the deadliest earthquake in China in nearly a decade and because of the remote location and because of the weather condition. Time is really of the essence here. John.",

I remember for really decades of covering American politics, people used to say on both sides of the aisle, that you never win by comparing anyone or anything to Nazi, Germany. It always seems like a bridge too far to borrow a World War II analogy. But in this case Donald Trump is directly quoting \"Mein Kampf\" on the American campaign trail. Talking about poisoning the blood of the country is an argument that Adolf Hitler specifically used in his rise to power. And there is an audience for it and there is a broader audience for a redirection of policy at the border.

A lot of Americans unhappy about the economy, unhappy about crime, certainly unhappy about the border and the question whether Joe Biden can do his job for another term at his age. But it is another issue, another question, whether there is ultimately a majority that is willing to put in power an American president who is approvingly quoting, not only Vladimir Putin but Adolf Hitler.

You know, don't take it literally, take it symbolically that kind of stuff. This time, we know what we're getting.
