Earlier, the Biden administration announced a massive new round of sanctions against 500 targets, all of which, he says, are linked to Navalny's imprisonment. But some experts say the move is strictly symbolic, lacking any real substance. I want you to listen to what the President and founder of Eurasia Group told CNN. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Those U.N experts are calling for independent investigation on the unique toll on women in this conflict cannot be ignored. Statistics from the U.N. show that around 70 percent of those killed in Gaza are estimated to be women and children, and that two mothers are killed every hour.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REEM ALSALEM, U.S. SPECIAL RAPPORTEUR ON VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN AND GIRLS:  We must remember that these reports of sexual violence especially I would say committed against Palestinian women, is one of many egregious human rights and humanitarian law violations that Palestinian women are being subjected to, including an unfolding genocide, occupation for decades, arbitrary killing, forced starvation, the use of reproductive violence in particular as a tool of war against them. And I would say that these allegations that we've heard also are not new. They've been pointed out by human rights organizations on the ground. My colleague, the special rapporteur on the occupied territories in our last report also pointed out that there have been long-standing reports of the ill treatment and torture that Palestinian women and sexual assault that they have faced in Israeli detention.

Williams has been diagnosed with progressive aphasia and dementia, a diagnosis that often leads to deteriorating communication skills. This weekend, a new \"Lifetime\" series is set to air detailing Williams' story. However, her court-ordered guardian has just filed a lawsuit against the network's parent company, A and E Television ahead of its debut. I want to bring in Elizabeth Wagmeister to talk about this. Elizabeth, when I think of Wendy Williams, I think of a fun-loving, hilarious, like impossibly hilarious talk show host who was always so bright and happy and you know, obviously known for her hot topics and her very controversial takes on celebrities. She was definitely a guilty pleasure of mine. But of course, what was happening behind the scenes, or what has been happening behind the scenes with her over the past two years is very different. She's been battling some really scary things. Just take us through it.",

We see her struggling with cognitive health issues, which we now know are aphasia and dementia. We also see her struggling with alcohol abuse. It is a Wendy that we have seen maybe in paparazzi photos, but now seeing her on air participating, I think will shock a lot of fans.",
