We're now counting down to what could be a career defining moment for Former president Donald Trump's new running mate Senator J.D. Vance.Tonight the 39-year-old from Ohio will introduce himself to the world in a prime time speech. A source telling CNN that Vance will reach out to working class voters by playing up his remarkable life story growing up poor in a family that struggled with addiction before becoming a U.S. Marine, a Yale Law -- Yale Law School graduate and now a sitting U.S. Senator. The theme of night three of the RNC is \"Make America Strong Once Again\" and it's going to focus on foreign policy while showcasing some of Trump's staunchest supporters. We've got a team of reporters here in Milwaukee covering all angles CNN's Kristen Holmes and Alayna Treene join us now. So Kristen, what more are you expecting from night three of the convention?",

He is obviously going to speak for the first time in an actual speech.Excuse me. Excuse me, since he was brought to the table. And this is really his first debut on the national stage. A lot of people don't know anything about him. But in addition to that, we also know we're going to hear from Don Jr., Donald Trump's Son, also a close ally of J.D. Vance's, as well as Kellyanne Conway, who was in charge of his 2016 campaign. He also still -- she also still advises the former president. We're going to hear from Matt Gaetz, Mike Waltz, and Nancy Mace lawmakers who again are staunch supporters. But the really key thing here is J.D. Vance, because he has not really introduced himself to the American people. And he is not only somebody who said negative things about Donald Trump in the past. He's also someone who is considered now the heir to the MAGA throne. So people want to hear from him and hear what he has to say.",

I want to start with the up close view that you got of President Trump last night.You were sitting in at a friends and family box with him. There's been a lot of speculation because folks haven't heard him address the country since what happened over the weekend? I know you spoke with him after the shooting. Do you think that he's changed after that attempt? SEN. MARKWAYNE MULLIN (R-OK): Yes. I mean, as a person you're going to -- you're going to change a little bit at or something like that, right? You can't help it -- help it. But his spirit and his fight has it. I spoke to him the day after he was cracking jokes like he always does. You speak to him early in the morning. I mean, the guy's an animal. He doesn't -- he doesn't ever sleep. I mean, I get text messages from one o'clock 4:30 in the morning. And I think I was talking to him at seven o'clock in the morning. It was just like any other day except he was -- he acknowledged that it was only by the grace of God that his -- that he turned his head to look at the graph on immigration that saved his life. He said, I heard the bullet whizzed through my -- passed my ear before I actually felt the pain. And then he made a joke, because you can tell my ears are kind of jacked up from wrestling on my ears. And he says my ears are going to be messed up like yours. And so while he acknowledged the Lord, he also acknowledged the fact that it was a close call, but he had it with humor. But I think what you're going to hear is a unity message. I know he I know he changed his speech because he said he was going to change his speech. And it's taken away some more of the divisiveness that's -- plague both parties, and maybe talking about the country as a whole and how we move forward as a country and get away from this boiling point that brought us to where we're at.",

The outer ring is typically set up by local law enforcement. You had the inner ring, that's more of your really tight security where you're checking all the bags, everybody coming in.You'll see more SWAT or more of a military presence. And then you have the inner circle the diamond, right? That's the guys that jumped on President Trump right at the end of it. I think when you start looking at it, where was the breakdown? There's no excuse for having a building within 150 foot or 150 yards of the podium with a direct line of sight. There is no excuse for that. But what happened was a person that AIC the agent in charge. Did they -- did that -- did they send up a request for more resources and was denied. Was that actually supposed to be secured and the outer perimeter didn't have anybody station because their manpower that was supposed to be there didn't show up that day. So before you can actually call for someone's resignation, I think you had to do an investigation, there was a failure, obviously. So where does it -- where does that failure happen? What was that break point? And that's where you have to -- that's someone needs to be fired. But wherever that breakpoint was, is where that should happen. Now, if we went all the way the head, then the buck stops at the top at the end of the day, the United States Secret Service is the one that's in charge of all of it, even though they're using local law enforcement. They're the one in charge of all of it. But we don't know the plan that they had laid out.",

He said I read everybody's bio on that -- but yours and I should read yours and looked at me -- that was before my buddy -- even sit down at the table.

So he took Mike Pence, because he thought that there were a lot of doubts about his standing with Evangelicals, Christian fundamentalists.I think Donald Trump now thinks this is my party. And instead of trying to reach out in other ways, I think it's I'm going to cement this. You've heard a lot about Project 2025. And Trump has distanced himself from it. But a lot of its tenants are embraced by J.D. Vance, for instance, the idea of getting rid of a lot of civil servants, even though that's questionable legally, and filling the administration with Trump loyalists. So I mean, to me this is an indication Trump thinks he is in control of the party. He's going to pursue his agenda, and he sees J.D. Vance as somebody who can help them do that.",

I thought that was a pretty chilly reception. Yes, she's said I fully endorse Donald Trump, but she did seem unhappy to be here. And Donald Trump, although he invited her and obviously wanted her to bend the knee, if you will, and also to reach out to her supporters, which is a significant part of the Republican Party to say, hey, come along and support this guy, even if you don't agree 100 percent. You could tell she didn't like being here. And I don't think Donald Trump particularly enjoyed listening to where he wanted to have her make the statement.
