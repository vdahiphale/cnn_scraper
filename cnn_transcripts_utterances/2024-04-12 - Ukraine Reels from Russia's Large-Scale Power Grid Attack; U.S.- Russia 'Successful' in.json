And on Thursday morning, Russian missiles and drones scored a major blow, destroying one of Ukraine's biggest plants just outside the capital of Kyiv while strikes elsewhere have reduced output from the largest energy provider to 20 percent.Most troubling for the Ukrainians, air defenses were unable to shoot down a third of incoming Russian fire. At a regional summit in Lithuania, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, once again, pleaded with Western allies for more air defenses and other military assistance. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT (through translator): I can clearly outline what Putin is planning to do this year. We have enough information from our intelligence. It is critical that each partner fulfills its promises regarding the supply of weapons and ammunition, as well as our joint production agreements. Every day, Russian missiles are fired, and every day, the number of promises increases. Every day, Ukrainian soldiers at the front, withstand the brutal pressure of Russian artillery and guided aerial bombs. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Ukrainian officials are becoming increasingly alarm not just by the high number of missiles and drones fired by Russia, but also their accuracy, which indicates better intelligence and fresh tactics by Moscow in this ongoing offensive on Ukraine's electrical grid.More details now from CNN's Fred Pleitgen. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Kyiv's largest power plant destroyed. The energy company Centrenergo declaring Thursday, quote, \"a black day.\" The dark smoke and the skyline marking the end of the company's energy supply, all three of its power plants across the country either destroyed or occupied. Russian strikes systematically targeting power facilities have been a constant in Ukraine since late 2022 but have ramped up in recent weeks. DTEK, Ukraine's largest power company, saying two of their plans were also targeted overnight. They say their facilities have suffered their worst attacks this month since the war began, with 80 percent of their infrastructure already destroyed. Employees trying to repair and to rebuild. The burnt-out skeleton of their facilities needing to be back up and running as soon as possible, echoing each other's calls for the world to ramp up its weapons support. UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator): We need more air fences. If we don't have air defenses, there won't be anything left. A lot of missiles and drones get through. and we get a lot of hits. PLEITGEN (voice-over): It's a call heard many times over, with the Ukrainian president currently in Lithuania to meet European leaders and to ensure those calls do not become white noise in this very long war. Warnings by generals also becoming more desperate, with the country's parliament voting on Thursday to overhaul mobilization rules, potentially allowing the military to call up more men. GEN. YURLY SODOL, COMMANDER, JOINT FORCES OF UKRAINE (through translator): The enemy outnumbers us by seven to ten times. We lack manpower. We are holding the defenses on the last breath. PLEITGEN (voice-over): The bill still needing to be signed into law by Zelenskyy is a sign of an exhausted front line. Civilians in Kyiv spending the night once again underground, a routine too familiar for a country resilient as ever. Fred Pleitgen, CNN, Delphi, Greece. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

And you're not going to be able to sell those guys. If I get elected. Now if I don't get elected, it's going to be a bloodbath for the whole -- that's going to be the least of it.

It is difficult to predict the economic impact from Trump's new, more aggressive approach to tariffs, but Moody's is predicting a 10 percent tariff on imports and a 60 percent tariff on Chinese goods would cost the U.S. 675,000 jobs, wipe out 0.6 percentage points from U.S. GDP, and boost the unemployment rate by 0.4 percentage points.Well, those numbers can be up for debate. The bottom line, though, is tariffs are specifically designed to increase the cost of certain imports, either by the importer paying that cost or the consumer paying that cost. Someone has to pay. So right now, with the Federal Reserve struggling to bring down inflation, a policy which deliberately increases prices does not seem like a very good idea.",

      "sentences": "I would say that that is broadly true.Tariffs are essentially what happened in the 1930s when we got the Great Depression it was interesting to me in, that clip, that Donald Trump is now talking about 100 percent tariffs. We went from 10 percent to 100 percent. So you know that, in and of itself is a bit worrisome. But you know, you can spin the numbers either way. By and large, most economists think that tariffs do raise prices. Now, one thing I will say is that both the Trump administration, when he was in office and the Biden administration today are taking a different tact in terms of thinking about trade. I mean, they're thinking about not just prices for consumers, but what it means for workers when so many jobs go abroad to cheap -- cheaper labor countries. So tariffs are basically about keeping Chinese goods out of America and thus potentially increasing U.S. industrialization. You can model that as a gain, but you can also model it as a loss. The bottom line is, we don't know. We haven't been here in 100 years.",
