It is 9:00 a.m. in Baltimore, it is 5:00 p.m. here in Abu Dhabi, I'm Eleni Giokos, this is CONNECT THE WORLD, also happening in one hour from now. The U.S. Supreme Court will hear arguments in the most significant abortion case since the reversal of Roe versus Wade, and we'll bring you a report from outside the court. Well, we start with our breaking news. What is being called a dynamic search and rescue operation in Baltimore after a bridge was hit by a container ship and collapsed, this happened just before 1:30 a.m. local time. So, that's around 7.5 hours ago. The collapse captured on video, it's a startling scene. The Francis Scott Key Bridge crumbling into the river. My emergency officials say two people were rescued, one with serious injuries, the other apparently on Hertz and refusing treatment. It is believed at least seven others were either in vehicles crossing the bridge or working on the bridge when it collapsed? (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Now, Maryland's governor has declared a state of emergency. Now, the ship that was hit and it hit -- that hit the bridge is a Singaporean-flagged vessel. Law enforcement officials say there was no indication of terrorism, but there are a lot of questions about how this could happen. CNN's Gabe Cohen has more from Baltimore for us. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) GABE COHEN, CNN CORRESPONDENT (on camera): At this point, they are still carrying this out as an urgent rescue operation, even though as the hours pass, it is very difficult to imagine somebody could survive in water like this, a temperature around 48 degrees for such an extended period of time. But if you look behind me and we're going to zoom in now, you did -- you can actually see this search and rescue operation unfolding. There are several -- I've counted close to a dozen of boats in the water, rescuers, divers that are trying to save anyone that they can find in the water. And as we push closer, I mean, that is the massive container ship, the Dalai(ph) that crashed into the Key Bridge and sent those massive chunks of steel sections of the bridge down into the water. You can see one is laying across the deck of that ship right now mangled. We've also seen on the top of the ship -- the bridge, where the operating controls presumably would be -- it looks like there are people inside who have been walking around. We know that there is a crew on board. We have gotten word from the operating company at this point that there were no injuries from anyone on the ship. But as you mentioned, major concern for the people who were on the bridge, people who were inside cars or even construction crews that may have been working at the time, as you mentioned. Officials have said they are searching for at least seven people, and they have found through Sonar, they can detect that there are vehicles in the water. And so, look, I've been out here for hours now. It is -- there are frigid conditions along the river, winds are whipping, it is very cold and there are quite substantial waves, and so conditions are not ideal for rescuers who are searching a really large portion of this river.

We -- the Baltimore City Fire Department, we're a port city, so, we have a very robust response when incidents occur that involve the inner harbor or even our inland bodies of water. We have a very robust response, but we're also a city that's very fortunate to have the partners that we have in other fire departments and the police departments around us. We all train together. We train for emergencies that will bring multiple teams together, so that we have a strong command component. But we're also very coordinated.

And as you heard in that last interview, it is still very much an urgent operation. They are trying and hoping there are still people to rescue, to save, who are inside the water. But obviously, as the minutes tick by, things are growing more dire and potentially more catastrophic. And as you see here, as we push in on this container ship, gives you a sense of the scale of this boat. This massive ship, and you can see pieces of the Key Bridge, several chunks that have fallen into the water, one, laying across the deck of the ship. And if you look at the top of the ship, which we have been watching over the past hour or so, you can see the bridge where the control operations for the ship would most likely be. And we can see people moving around. There are -- there is a crew on board. We have gotten word that none of them were injured in this incident, but those rescuers are still searching crews on the water. We've seen close to a dozen of those rescue boats with dozens of divers that are in the water right now. They have been searching for potentially seven or more people that they believe might be in the water, either construction workers who were on the bridge or even drivers, passengers who were inside cars when it collapsed early this morning. We also on the riverbank are seeing a lot of emergency vehicles also participating in this operation. Look, certainly officials as the morning moves forward are preparing the public for potential tragedy, because at this point, hours into this, it's growing less and less likely that someone could survive in water this cold for this long. It has been hours now, and this water, 48 degrees, it's likely somebody could only survive, you know, one to three hours, and conditions I can tell you along the water are brutal. It has been freezing cold this morning, really strong winds, these powerful waves.

We're going to go to a very short break and we'll be backwith more of our breaking news coverage, that massive bridge collapse in Baltimore. We're also waiting for a press conference to get more details on how the search and rescue operation is going on right now. We can see that collapsed bridge there, and of course, reporters waiting for more information from local authorities. All right, we'll be right back. Stay with CNN. (COMMERCIAL BREAK)",

At least, seven people who were believed to be on the bridge at the time are missing. Two others were rescued, one with serious injuries, no one was on board -- no one onboard the cargo ship was hurt. Now, a collapse of this magnitude can echo differently for the people around it. A former Baltimore Fire official describes the moment of the collapse as feeling like an earthquake. Listen to this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And that's the only thing we should be talking about. This is a tragedy as you can never imagine, right? And I was awake when Chief Wallace called me, but never would you think that you would see, physically see the Key Bridge  tumbled down like that. It looked like something out of an action movie. And you just think about motion in Portland, which is where we all should be thinking about right now. Nothing but those families and people that are impacted, and those people who are risking their lives right now, from not just Baltimore City and Baltimore County, but all over this state to try to save lives. That should be our focus. The preservation of life, because no one wants to see that happen, let alone someone in their family, someone that they know be injured in an incident like this.

We also, of course, know that the NTSB is launching a go-team, a go-team is what they're calling it, to investigate the collapse of this bridge after that vessel crashed into it at 1:30 a.m. local time in Baltimore. All right now, in the meantime, White House officials say President Biden has been briefed on the bridge collapse and officials there are closely monitoring the situation. Now, as we've mentioned, local and state officials say there is no indication this was a terrorist attack. We've got Kevin Liptak joining us right now. Kevin, we know that there were FBI, local FBI teams on the ground as this event occurred. They've ruled out terrorist attack, but we know the White House is monitoring this very closely.

And President Biden, as you mentioned, was briefed on this and will be continually updated on it throughout the course of the day. We have also heard from the Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, who has been in touch with top officials in the state of Maryland and also the mayor of Baltimore. And I wouldn't be surprised if we also saw the Transportation Secretary on the ground there in Baltimore before long. I know President Biden himself is scheduled to depart the White House midday for an event in the -- North Carolina. He'll be talking about healthcare, he'll be joined there by the Vice President Kamala Harris. And he does plan to keep his schedule today, he isn't planning to cancel any of it, but it does give you an indication of this balance that an incumbent president running for re-election has to strike while they are also monitoring --",
