So, that was a success. Did we get everything we want? No, you don't get everything you want in a negotiation.

Republicans wanted to cut veterans' benefits very deeply, particularly those who had been exposed to toxic substances as they served in the armed forces. They protected the homeless. They protected their foster care children. They protected Social Security and Medicare. So that -- yes, are there some things I would oppose? Absolutely. But again, the harm that would be caused by defaulting far exceeds the harm that would be caused by this bill. And we can -- we can work and will work to correct those things that we think are wrong. And very frankly, this bill is a two-year bill as opposed to a 10-year bill that the Republicans proposed, which would have been extraordinarily harmful to the United States. I think the administration has gotten an agreement that is supportable. It's not perfect. It's not everything we would have done.

You can see that in the video when the Chinese fighter jet cuts in front and you can see the shaking there as it passes through the wake turbulence of that Chinese fighter jet which disturbed that air and caused that shutter there. In terms of this being a pattern, not the first time we've seen something like this. If we go back to December, there was a very similar incident in the same piece of airspace, in the international airspace above the South China Sea, when a Chinese Navy fighter jet came to within 20 feet of another RC-135 Rivet Joint, another U.S. reconnaissance plane according to the U.S., forcing the larger, heavier U.S. aircraft to take evasive maneuvers. The Chinese position has also been the same thing. Saying effectively, this is Chinese airspace and the U.S. is in the way. That gets into a dispute about the South China Sea itself, much of which China claims as its own territorial waters and airspace, a position that the U.S. doesn't recognize and neither does international law.

And number two, what did the people this person was talking to, know about the footage, and who had access to boxes, who had access to the footage, and so on?
