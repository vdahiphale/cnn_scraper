Vice President Kamala Harris is saying she disagrees with President Biden's comments calling Trump supporters -- quote -- \"garbage.\" The president and the White House have put out statements saying the president was only referring to a joke from Donald Trump's rally in New York on Sunday when a comedian described Puerto Rico as garbage. But here's what the vice president told reporters just a short while ago. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KAMALA HARRIS, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES (D) AND U.S. PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  I think that first of all, he clarified his comments. But let me be clear. I strongly disagree with any criticism of people based on who they vote for. It's -- you heard my speech last night and continuously throughout my career. I believe that the work that I do is about representing all the people, whether they support me or not. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And, look, the problem for Kamala Harris here is, and why this is so problematic, is she has spent 90 some days being unable to separate herself from the Biden administration. She's been asked time and again, what is the difference between you and Joe Biden? And when she's asked what she would have done differently over the last four years, she cannot think of a thing. And that is why, today, and if you look at last night, she's on the stage telling people, look, I want to be a president for all Americans. And then uncle Joe comes out and says the quiet part out loud, beyond the fact that she's been tossing around the words Nazi and fascism and Hitler over the course of the last couple weeks. So I think that is why it is such a big problem for her in the last six days of this race. ROGINSKY:  I'm sorry, are you actually offended by what Joe Biden said? Because if you are, are you offended that Donald Trump calls people like me vermin? Are you going to -- or if you are offended by what Joe Biden said, congratulations, you don't have to vote for him. Kamala Harris just distanced herself from his comments. You said she wouldn't distance herself. She just did. Now, are you going to sit here and use the same metric to apply to Donald Trump? Are you going to use the same metric to say that Donald Trump should not be calling people vermin, Donald Trump should not be calling people like me the enemy from within, he should not be calling the United States a garbage can? Are you going to distance yourself from your candidate, the one who's running to be president for the next four years?

And that's what you're getting with Kamala Harris. I don't know what extremism you're talking about. She's got a four-year record as vice president to lean back on.

He probably got some bad internals, and this is his way of setting the stage for why he's going to lose Pennsylvania. So, quite honestly, I don't mind debating these issues. I just mind the hypocrisy were for some reason people are up in arms about Joe Biden's word salad, but can't bring to distance themselves from the fact that Donald Trump refers to people as vermin and the enemy from within and basically threatens to arrest people like General Milley and put them put them up on treason charges, people like that, because he's not happy with them being critical of him, right?",

We knock every door, make every call, pull out every vote. And look how close the elections always are. Our Senate race last time was just within a couple of points. So that's not that unusual for us. But we're not taking anything for granted. And we believe that, by the end of the day, because of the ground game that we have, that we will beat Trump for a third time.",

What the justices did just in the last hour, Jim, was clear the way for Virginia officials to purge certain people from their voting rolls. Now, it will only involve an estimated 1,600 people at this point, but what it does is potentially compromise a federal law that says that there should be a 90-day so-called quiet period before an election where people can't be systematically removed from voting rolls because they might be suspected of being a noncitizen, potentially based on outdated state data. So, here the Biden administration and immigrant rights groups, civil rights groups had challenged Virginia's sudden policy put in place in August by the governor there to do a broad-scale purge, rather than individual purge, of someone -- of people who might be suspected of not being U.S. citizens. I wanted to state outright that, of course, only U.S. citizens can vote in federal elections and state elections here, so it matters. Lower court judges had sided with the challengers, the Biden administration, and said, no, it's too close to an election, it's within this 90-day safety period, and -- but the Supreme Court today reversed it, and, as I said, only the three liberal dissenters. Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan, and Ketanji Brown Jackson dissented, Jim.",

Now, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court had ruled that, yes, they can. Pennsylvania Republicans, the Republican Party have come up to the Supreme Court asking them to intervene. And what they say, in particular, Jim, could have consequences for other disputes that could arise in the next six days. The issue is whether -- how a state court is allowed to interpret state law, and what the challengers are saying is that the state of Pennsylvania's highest court went too far. And that's something that could play into this conservative Supreme Court wanting to maybe tamp down state court interpretations of their own law. But we will have to see in that one. Jim, just so you know, we're going to see a filing come in this afternoon, and I expect that we will see a decision from the Supreme Court, either Thursday or Friday, that would affect, as you say, this big swing state of Pennsylvania and potentially other states as more disputes come up to the High Court.",
