And Harris really cornered him. She baited him. Of course, he took the bait. She dictated she was in control. She came across as very presidential, and the snap poll done by CNN showed that 63 percent of those debate watchers felt that she did win the debate.Now, I would expect that she's going to get a little bit of a bump from this, but it's still early on. As the report already mentioned, there's still plenty of time for things to change. And actually, the polls are still incredibly close, and one of the worrying things is those that were watching the debate are still a 20 point lead for Trump in terms of the way they feel he can handle the economy versus Harris. So, she definitely has a lot of work to do in terms of winning over those last five percent of voters who I would imagine are Republican leaning, but don't like Trump and think that they were better off when he was in charge. In addition to doing that, she's going to have to mobilize her base of supporters to actually vote on Election Day, getting them out with early voting, particularly in the state of Pennsylvania, where there's early voting, and then also trying to target these unlikely voters that would lean towards voting for her, getting them to the polls. This is something that Democrats have really struggled with year on year on out, getting people to vote that would normally maybe their views might be aligned with them, but that don't bother to vote on Election Day. So, she definitely has a lot to do, but I'm sure her campaign is incredibly happy with her debate performance.",

She has over 250 million followers on Instagram. We don't know how many of those are eligible voters in the U.S., so it's very difficult to tell, but that was something that Trump's campaign was actually fearing.

The storm roared ashore Wednesday afternoon in Terrebonne Parish in southern Louisiana. Dangerous wind and heavy rain pounded the area, leading to flooding, downed trees and power outages.So, right now, more than 380,000 homes and businesses across the state are without power. And have a look images and -- images and video taken from One Marina (ph) in Louisiana show exactly Francine's fury. These are shots taken before the storm made landfall. The owners of CoCo Marina say it took just a few hours for flood waters to move in. A picnic table said to be at least three feet tall, was almost completely submerged. Now, in New Orleans, a flash flood warning is still in effect. The National Weather Service says between six to eight inches of rain have fallen in the area, and that's more than a month's worth of rain over the past several hours alone.

The bridge fire in San Bernardino County is now the largest in the state, scorching about 48,000 acres, or 19,000 hectares in two days. Thousands have been forced to evacuate as the flames tore through the area and the lifts at a nearby ski resort have also been damaged by the fire.

So there may be another chance at that. They'll continue series of experiments. They flew to a very high altitude, surpassing an altitude record set by Gemini 11 back almost 60 years ago, and that gave them a dose of radiation. They're trying to understand the radiation environment. For any crew that heads out to Mars, it's an important issue that needs to be addressed to protect the crew from the radiation which exists in space. And then, subsequent to the spacewalk, they're going to test out a communications system that hasn't been tried in space before. Starlink, also an Elon Musk company, they are actually above the satellites which make that satellite-enabled communication system work. And they'll use a laser scheme to try to communicate with it. Yet another thing that's important if you're serious about colonizing the moon and mars is you want to have some good bandwidth as well.

Of course, Ukraine now also has a new foreign minister as well. However, as far as that topic of those long-distance weapons is concerned, there really wasn't much in the way of substance. One of the things that the secretary of state said is that he did have that discussion with Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and that he would take the points that were made in that discussion back to Washington, talk it over with President Biden, and President Biden would then debate all of this with his British counterpart when they meet later this week.
