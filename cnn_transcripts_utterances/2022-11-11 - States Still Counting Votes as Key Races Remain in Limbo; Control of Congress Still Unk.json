And, of course, we're talking about a very tight margin when you look at these two key races, a U.S. Senate matchup between Senator Mark Kelly and venture capitalism Blake Masters. As of last night, that split was about 115,000 votes. On the gubernatorial race, it's a lot closer. We're looking at about 27,000 votes separating Katie Hobbs and Kari Lake, and as you mentioned here in Arizona, still hundreds of thousands of ballots yet to be cast.Where I am now in Maricopa County, they are still waiting on 340,000 ballots. That includes two -- I know that's a lot of numbers but that includes 290,000 ballots that were delivered in person that were intended to be voted by mail. So, if a person gets a ballot and they don't actually put them in the mail, they can take them Election Day, drop it off, but that means it has to go through a separate process where the signature is verified, the voter is verified. That's why we're seeing the backlog. But election officials here are asking for patience as they move through that process. They're also contending with conspiracy theories, particularly from the gubernatorial candidate, Kari Lake, who has suggested that officials here in Maricopa County have been slow rolling, or slow walking the results for political purposes. That causing election officials here to come out slamming those comments, take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

So far, groups have invested another $10 million into the runoff that just began, that on top of millions already spent. Of course there will be more if this is the race that decides control of the Senate. CNN National Politics Reporter Eva McKend joins us now from Atlanta. Now, maybe the control is decided before this runoff, but we don't know. And folks are already drawing a lot of money that way. So, how is that going to play out in the coming days and weeks?",

Senator Warnock, for his part, is getting a $7 million boost from the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. That is a key fund raising operation for Senate Democrats. Meanwhile, Herschel Walker, he will get about $2 million from the Senate Leadership Fund and another $1 million, about $1 million from anti-abortion groups. So, this is a very costly affair. You talk to Georgians, they say they are sick of seeing the ads but they're likely to see a whole lot more of them in the final sprint here, Jim.",

But that is -- and I think that's also going to determine how much spending you're going to see in Georgia, right? They're already investing a ton of money.

Okay, Heidi, looking at the House, it still remains the most likely outcome that Republicans do take control of the house though with a smaller majority than expected but control, nonetheless, and, therefore, the speakership. There is a fight already under way within the Republican Party in the House over who that speaker will be and what the issues will be, a lot of pressure on McCarthy from the Freedom Caucus.I want to read a quote from a senior GOP lawmaker to CNN and a story out just this morning describing members of the freedom caucus. They are a bunch of selfish Prima donna a-holes, as far as I'm going, who want attention for themselves. They are trading effectiveness for the warm embrace of their social media followers. It indicates the division you have within that party going forward. Are we going to see more of that? We're seeing it between Trump and DeSantis. We're seeing it here inside the House -- Republicans in the house. Is that going to be a very public battle in the coming couple of years?",

I wonder, Jackie, there was, it seems, successful Republican pressure prior midterms for the former president to push any such announcement to after the midterms, worried about negative effect on those races. Now, there's concern about the potential effect it might have on a Georgia Senate race. But the president, also, has concerns about legal deadlines coming up. Does he announce next week?",

I think that if you look at the indications from many Republicans now putting out the statements, just look at the cover of the New York Post and the Murdochs moving away from Trump, the party, very much wants to move away from this direction. They want to go in the direction of folks, like Glenn Youngkin, the governor of Virginia, who proved to be a successful model, who didn't repudiate Trump, but also didn't hug him. Trump is already attacking him on social media.But if you look at the performance, Jim, of election deniers, they have been repudiated up and down the ballot in state after state with the exceptions being red states. The one exception might be Kari Lake in Arizona. You know, for the most part, these folks have conceded. But if she does not win, mark my words, there will be a fight in that state. She's not going to go away. She's already made it clear that she's going to challenge those results. For the Democrats, you know, we could have a long discussion here about lessons, but let's just give credit where credit is due.

Well, I'll just say, first of all, on the climate change issue, you know, the reason that China withdrew from the climate change talks with the United States was presumably because Nancy Pelosi went to Taiwan. That should tell you sort of how they view this issue. They also refuse to deal with John Kerry because the U.S. was sanctioning them for forced labor abuses Xinjiang.So, at the same time, the U.S. hasn't met its international climate change obligations either. There's a bill in request of $11 billion to help developing countries that the Congress hasn't funded, and that's a Democratic Congress. Now, when President Biden meets with President Xi for the first time as presidents, these are guys who known each other for 25 years and spent all of this time together, the goal is to put guardrails on what is steadily becoming a very awful U.S.-China bilateral relationship. We're going into full blown competition on technology, trade, tensions over Taiwan, human rights, it's all going south. So, they're going to try to find a way to keep talking because that's the bare minimum that we need, frankly, to make sure that this competition doesn't devolve into conflict.",
