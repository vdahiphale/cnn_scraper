And as the race for the White House sprints ahead, Trump is beefing up his political coalition.CNN is learning that former democratic congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard and Robert F. Kennedy Jr. have now joined Trump's transition team. Both have offered their endorsements here in recent days. Right now, both campaigns are laser-focused on battleground states. Of course, Trump's VP pick, Senator J.D. Vance, is in Michigan today ahead of Trump's visit to the state later this week.

And that means casting a wide net, trying to get more voters than would traditionally vote for just Donald Trump or would traditionally vote Republican. And part of that clearly is trying to court these RFK supporters.One of the things we talked about when RFK endorsed Donald Trump was what the actual polling looked like and what this could mean for the general election. So in some states, he had 6% or 5%. Well, the thing you have to remember about these RFK supporters, and it's also the same likely supporters of Tulsi Gabbard kind of independent mix, some are Democrats, some are Republicans. There's some crossover, is that there is a belief or at least an uncertainty that they show up at the polls in November, particularly if their candidate is not on the ballot. So what you're seeing here in some extent is taking this endorsement and trying to use it in a way that will drive people to the polls. It's one thing to say that you are endorsed by RFK Jr. by Tulsi Gabbard. It's quite another to say, they will have an impact on personnel and potentially even policy if I am elected. So clearly, a way to drive people who support them to the polls. And here's what we have in a statement from the campaign. They say, we are proud that Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Tulsi Gabbard have been added to the Trump-Vance transition team. We look forward to having their powerful voices on the team as we work to restore America's greatness. Again, these are two politicians who, at some point, have been very progressive Democrats who have now come out for Donald Trump. They are clearly trying to ride these endorsements and turn it into votes at the polls.",

Usually when a politician does a media interview, it's because they've got something to say. They're going out there to, quote, \"advance something,\" right, to push out a piece of policy they're talking about, to talk about, you know, maybe she's going to talk with Tim Walz about his joining the ticket, which I'm understanding that perhaps he's going to be in that first interview. There's a reason for a politician to go out and speak to the media.So the Vice President's had a lot to do over the last few weeks, right? She had to pick a VP nominee. She had to get ready for a convention, completely reorient a convention during convention speech, preparing for debates. There's a lot happening. So they're fixing to do a media interview in the middle of a lot of other things that the campaign has been trying to get done.

There's basically should she answer questions? And I think, you know, as a reporter, I would be biased in saying, yes, she should. But is it a politically smart thing to do? And that's the debate also going on within Democratic Party circles. The fact is that, you know, some of her worst moments as Vice President were when she did interviews on camera that she got a little flustered. She sort of did these roundabouts and answers about immigration or about COVID-19. And so that's the other thing that Democrats are thinking. You know, can you basically only do a few interviews?

And by full-throatedly endorsing, the bipartisan border bill that was negotiated earlier this year with Senator Lankford, Senator Kyrsten Sinema, and Senator Murphy, you know, that bill includes hundreds of millions of dollars to continue building the border wall.So the bill that she now says that she will sign includes building more border wall. Now, you can say that, you know, circumstances have shifted. You can also say, you know, that you actually don't support the border wall, but it was necessary in order to get a compromise done. But the fact is that her campaign didn't tell us those things for that story. And again, it's part of the reason why it's important for her probably to do interviews, to answer these questions. You know, there could be explanations for, you know, not supporting Medicare for all anymore, not supporting banning fracking.

That was really a coalition government, right? This coalition of people who believed in democracy, who believed in -- they didn't believe in Maga, they didn't want Trump to be in office anymore. And that coalition sort of goes all the way from AOC and Bernie Sanders on the left, all the way to sort of Liz Cheney on the right.And so the Vice President and the President looked to pass bipartisan legislation. They passed a lot of it when they were in office. And now you're seeing the Vice President come out, Kamala Harris, and say that she is going to also support more bipartisan legislation, even though it may contain things that she doesn't necessarily agree with. And so my understanding of the border bill, it's not that she's allocating new money for the border. It's that, here's money that was already present from the Trump administration that hadn't been spent yet. And they're going to lengthen the amount of time that they have to spend that money for the border and so -- on the border wall. And so that's a little bit different. But still, if you're running a bipartisan and kind of coalition way of a political movement, you're going to have to sometimes compromise and cooperate with Republicans on things that aren't necessarily your core values.",

They were acting on intelligence that there may be hostages in the area. And that is when they came across this man, Kaid Farhan Al-Qadi, a 52-year-old hostage who had been held hostage by Hamas for 326 days. An Israeli military official telling me that he was alone when he wasfound without his captors who may have fled the area before those Israeli troops arrived on the scene. But they were able to rescue him, take him to a waiting Israeli military helicopter and then out of Gaza to a hospital in southern Israel where he was finally able to be reunited with his very large family. He is a father of 11 children. He has several brothers who were at the hospital and who were overjoyed to see him there. They had started to lose hope that he would even emerged from Gaza alive. And that is when they got the call early this morning that he was indeed alive, that he had been rescued by Israeli forces, and that he was on his way to this hospital in southern Israel. He is the 8th Israeli hostage to actually be rescued in an Israeli military operation. But as you said, he is the first to be rescued from an underground tunnel. The others were all being held above ground. However, the hostage and families' forum calling this rescue operation miraculous is also pointing to the fact that they know that the remaining 104 hostages who were taken captive on October 7th and are still in Gaza, they will not all be rescued in Israeli military operations. And they are pointing to the fact that it is a ceasefire deal and a hostage release deal that will lead to the rescue and to the release of the remaining hostages. Those negotiations, as we know, are still ongoing in Cairo as well as in Doha, Qatar. And tonight, that rescued hostage speaking with the Israeli prime minister, thanking him for getting him out of Gaza, but also reminding him that there are more hostages that still need to be rescued.

This was quite a doozy that Russia unleashed here. And this is the second night in a row that they've been bombarding Ukraine with missiles. Tell us what Russia is trying to target here. CEDRIC LEIGHTON, RETIRED U.S. AIR FORCE: So basically, Brianna, what we see here is several major things that the Russians are trying to do. So what are they actually targeting? They are going after places like Kryvyi Rih, which happens to be Zelenskyy's hometown, Dnipro, Kyiv, and some of the other areas right here. Now, they're doing this from an aerial perspective. But when it comes to the ground perspective, this town right here, Pokrovsk is a major facet of Russian operations. This is their main goal right here. The other things are designed to basically destroy the infrastructure, the Ukrainian infrastructure in terms of electricity, in terms of communications, and, of course, in terms of heating, because winter is coming and the Russians want to destroy as much of this as possible.

And that allowed them to go after the Shahed drones, as well as incoming missiles that the Russians were using. So this impacted a lot of what the Russians were trying to do and rendered it far less effective. So the F-16s have made their debut in the Ukraine- Russia war.",

And this is a major logistics hub for the Russian military.So what the Russians are doing is they've actually started to move troops from here into these areas right here, probably with the idea of basically providing a buffer for their forces so that they are not impacted by the kind of thing that happened in Kursk.

This area is basically the center of the Russian effort right now.So at the moment, there is no diminution, no lessening of Russian activity in the Pokrovsk region. What the Russians want to do is they want to capture this entire region for Russia, the Donbas region right here. That's been Putin's goal, really, since the beginning of this conflict. But what can also happen is the more the Ukrainians do things here in the Kursk area, the less likely it will be for the Russians to sustain this offensive, especially if the Ukrainians move in other areas, potentially around here, and protect this area. So that is what they can do. They can also move into parts of Russia here. If they do that, that's going to tax the Russians more.

They could also potentially force the Ukrainians out of Sutra (ph) or -- and possibly out of Oleshnya.
