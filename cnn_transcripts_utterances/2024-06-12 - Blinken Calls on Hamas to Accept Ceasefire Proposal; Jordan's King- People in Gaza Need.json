They have neither accepted nor rejected this at this point. There's been some confusion Oren, as to whether Israel has actually signed up categorically for this latest plan announced by Joe Biden 12 days ago.

As we just heard from Secretary of State Antony Blinken some are workable, some are not. But as it stands right now, the U.S. clearly believes Israel is on board with this proposal. How categorical is that? Have they officially signed a document? In all likelihood not, but the U.S. believes they are on board. And you heard that very much in Blinken's comments. Now, we saw the Hamas response as it came in, and we're learning a bit more about it through the words of Blinken and the country Prime Minister and Foreign Minister, we also know from an Israeli official last night. Israel views this as a rejection, as a Hamas rejection of what's on the table. We'll hear more from Israeli officials later on tonight after a holiday here. And we'll see if that sheds any more light on this, as we've seen so many times in the past. It's in the details here. And it's in the details that this has fallen apart before. But clearly Blinken and the countries the U.S. that is, see a chance here a window. How big is that window? It's not clear that it's very large at all. But there is an opportunity to try to move forward. And as the country foreign minister said, bridge the gaps here as part of a negotiation and that's what this has been difficult though it gets when you get down to sort of the last few meters there. This is where the details of caused it to break apart again. And as Kiley pointed out, where do you go from here if the U.S. backed Israeli supported internationally back proposal doesn't go through?

And since then, you have one report that focuses on what happened in Israel on October 7th. And they are they found that Hamas, six other Palestinian armed groups, and they say in some cases, also, Palestinians in civilian clothing, they say committed war crimes. And these war crimes include intentionally directing attacks against civilian's murder, or willful killing, torture, taking hostages, including children and more. Now, they also say that they identified quote, patterns indicative of sexual violence and concluded that these were not isolated incidents. But they were perpetrated in similar ways, in several locations primarily against Israeli women. And then you've got the report on the situation in Gaza, on Israel's military operations there. And they found that they say that Israel's committed crimes against humanity and war crimes, and these include using starvation as a method of warfare where they say that Israel has imposed a total siege on Gaza. And that amounts to collective punishment of a civilian population. And intentionally directing attacks against civilians and civilian structures. And what they say here, Becky, is what you're seeing there, this immense number of civilian casualties, the devastation across Gaza, the Commission here accusing Israel of using a strategy to cause maximum damage and disregarding the rules of war of proportionality distinction, and adequate precautions. They also list other crimes here, accusing the Israelis of committing sexual violence, extermination, murder, or willful killing, forcible transfer, and more. Now, the Commission says that its investigation had been obstructed by Israel that they were not given access to the occupied Palestinian territories or Israel. And but that's no surprise really, because Israel had made its position clear for months saying that it was not going to cooperate with a body that it is described as anti-Semitic and anti-Israeli and today responding to these findings. Israel says that the U.N. Commission of Inquiry showed systematic anti-Israeli discrimination. That, again, they're rejecting accusations here against the IDF and saying that they adhere to international laws, they carry out their own investigations. And on the accusations, Becky, of sexual violence, Israel is outraged. They say by attempt to draw a quote, false equivalence between Israeli soldiers and Hamas and they also say that the report disregarded what they say is Hamas using Palestinian civilians as human shields.",
