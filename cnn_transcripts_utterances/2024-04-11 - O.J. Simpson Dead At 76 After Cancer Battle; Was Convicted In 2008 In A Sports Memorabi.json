In that case, Simpson and armed accomplices raided a hotel room in what he called an attempt to just get back some of his stolen belongings. O.J.

I think everyone thought at the time, you know, this was a life felony, kidnapping. That's what he's charged with. But the factual scenario was he and his cronies wanted to go get back some of his personal items, like his trophies and things they were owned by others.So, they had meetings and they got together, and they went over there. Well, two of his buddies had guns on them. One even pointed the gun. And that culminated into kidnapping and armed robbery charges. I covered the trial. I was a correspondent. He was out on bail. He would just talk to everybody in the hallway. And he was so nice to everyone, anyone. He was just very humble. And I would talk to him. But when he found out that I was from Southern California and I graduated from USC, he just wanted to talk to me like crazy because of his passion for those days. His passion for USC. I remember, he thought we went there together. And I said, no, no, no. I went a little after you did. So, I did. I was much younger than him. But he was very humble. Now when he got to the trial itself, he had two sisters, and they came every single day to that trial. And I got to know them. They were quiet. They were demure. They would stand in a corner, it breaks. Nobody even knew who they were, but they will wonderful, wonderful ladies. One has passed away now. One I believe is still alive. But they were there every day to support their brother. Now he was convicted. The judge couldn't stand him. It was so obvious. The jury convicted him, and many people will have believed at the time that because he was acquitted in California, Nevada was going to show that they meant business. You're not going to get away with something in Nevada. We're law and order. And he was convicted by that jury sentenced to 33 years in prison, lovelock northern Nevada. And we had heard after that that he became a mentor for young men in the prison that he was counseling them. And that was sort of his job there to lead the right road in life. Well, he went before the parole board after nine years and that was televised too. We watched that. When he got out and the parole board allowed him out. I was in Las Vegas. And he went up at the dead of night. But we heard that the next day we were still in Las Vegas. For the next day, he was out at the golf course. So -- and he really lived a fairly quiet life after that with some Twitter videos, but he was still in the public eye.",

Simpson's house. Where the other glove was found to see if they matched could that have caused a blood transfer? The blanket that was put over one of the bodies could hair or fiber from the Bronco or O.J. have come there in different way. It was the testimony of Mark Fuhrman and what he had lied about. It was the doubt that was cast on Dennis Fung and the scientific evidence collected. And the way it was collected and processed, was it put in the refrigerator, or wasn't it?

It was not based on the facts, the evidence that was laid out right there.And I think also celebrity may have played a role in that because this was Southern California. This was O.J. Simpson. This is someone who was adored in Southern California, USC graduate, Heisman Trophy. This was their own person right there. And that may have all interplay with that also. And so, the fact of whether he's guilty or not, yes, a jury rendered him not guilty. But forevermore, people will really think that maybe the result was actually -- should have been the opposite.",

Simpson case, you're like, there's the Bronco and O.J. is driveway. There's the blood stain on the Bronco's handle. There's blood on the console. There's a blood trail leading to the house. All of this is collected.You go into this with -- not just detectives who are trained to do crime scene, but by criminalists. These are civilians trained in science. This is their only job. And they collected all of this. And by most standards that was a pretty high standard. When he was acquitted based on so much of the doubt about the -- about the forensics, about how it was collected, about the testimony of the experts and the cross examination bringing into question and things like, well, why wasn't it in the refrigerator? Well, because the refrigerator didn't always work for more than a few hours at a time. Crime scene units across the country. And this was before there was a TV show called CSI, where everything's done perfectly, and the results come magically within 20 minutes. Crime scene units really had to step up their game. And this was a challenge for a lot of smaller places where police budgets, budget cuts, getting gasoline and patrol cars is paying overtime, you know, cause challenges to invest in things like that. The FBI started its evidence recovery teams with extremely high training and consistent procedures, cities up their game. It made a real difference. Wolf, one of the really interesting things is O.J. Simpson getting acquitted in a murder trial where both eyewitness, testimony and mostly the forensic evidence was so strong. And then being convicted in Las Vegas, in Nevada, in a fairly low rent case about trying to rob back stuff he said belong to him. And the difference in the two cases was significant. The Las Vegas case wasn't about science. It wasn't about forensics. It wasn't about DNA. It was about eyewitnesses who said they were in the room and what happened. It was about video from the hotel, showing the comings and goings of the people before and after the incident. It was a -- he said -- he said case with direct testimony, and that's why he got 33 years. He was paroled after eight and a half. But that's the kind of sentence you would get in a murder case. And as I think you raise the issue earlier, a lot of people thought that that was some subliminal payback by the criminal justice system for what many believed was getting away with murder. What others, as Joey said, thought was justice and well served.",
