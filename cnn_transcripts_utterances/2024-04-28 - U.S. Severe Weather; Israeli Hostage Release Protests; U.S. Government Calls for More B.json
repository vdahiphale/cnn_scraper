They say the rapid progression of the highly contagious disease is challenging country's efforts to maintain what they call elimination status or the absence of endemic transmission.Researchers say, 83 percent of the world's children received one vaccine before their first birthday in 2022, the lowest vaccination rate since 2008. Epidemiologists warn one in five unvaccinated people in the U.S. who become infected will be hospitalized, while one in every 20 children with the disease will develop pneumonia. One in every 1,000 kids who are infected may develop a dangerous swelling in the brain, and up to three of every 1,000 children who catch the disease may die from complications. Concern over the spread of bird flu is prompting the U.S. to implement testing and tracking of the disease in dairy cows. Now, previously, that hasn't been a requirement, but with 33 farms in eight states identifying cases, additional measures are being taken out of concern it could spread to humans. And while the U.S. Food and Drug Administration says it has found traces of bird flu genetic material in milk from grocery stores, it believes pasteurized milk is still safe, although it's conducting more tests.

DEMETRE DASKALAKIS, INFECTIOUS DISEASE EXPERT:  The risk to most people is very, very low.

So, just off the top, it's important to say that so far there's only been one confirmed human case. Right now, we're only seeing it in animals. But the fact that it's spreading, you know, from birds to mammals so far and so fast, what do you make of what you're seeing? MAURICE PITESKY, ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR, U.C. DAVIS SCHOOL OF VETERINARY MEDICINE:  Yes, so, the big picture is that, we are having globally the equivalent of an animal pandemic, primarily in birds that has crossed over into mammals. Some of those mammals are wildlife elephant seals, sea lions. What we've seen over the last month or so in dairy cows is concerning at two levels. Number one, it's concerning because this virus is showing an extraordinary ability to move into new species. It's also concerning from a food security perspective. The virus in cows doesn't kill cows, but it does reduce milk production. And anytime we are infecting animals that produce an important source of protein around the globe, that's a really important concern. The worker that was affected that was an occupational risk. That worker was in a dusty dairy with cows that were infected. But it's important to realize that that scenario is certainly possible. That humans can actually be infected, and that's concerning.

To me, this outbreak is extraordinary in the sense that it is infecting all kinds of animals, including some of the animals that we rely on for global food security.But to your point. It is certainly demonstrating an ability to cross into humans. And, you know, we've only had a handful of infections at this point. We need to keep a very vigilant eye on understanding how the virus is spreading into these animals and potentially what the risks are to humans from those animals that we rely on for our food.",

And of course, the worry as we were just talking about measles there, given the increase in vaccine hesitancy, how big of a risk would that be as well?",

And we do have vaccines that are potentially in the pipeline that are available. What we haven't done so much in the U.S. and there's reasons we don't do this from a scientific perspective but also from a trade and economic perspective, we do have the ability to vaccinate our poultry, for example.And that's important from a public health perspective in humans, because if we can reduce the amount of virus that are in our animals, that reduces the potential for some of these reassortments of virus which can create new versions of the virus which can be significant to humans and others.",

And as recent reports indicate, those dangers are growing. CNN's Michael Holmes has more.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MICHAEL HOLMES, CNN INTERNATIONAL NEWS ANCHOR AND CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  A terrifying moment in Kenya when a truck attempting to cross a rushing river is swept away by the strong currents. Its passengers toppled into the water, as horrified people watch from the bank. Rescuers are still searching for survivors, but at least seven bodies have been found. It's painstaking work, looking for the missing and the dead. And it's happening across Kenya after deadly floods deluged the country. In one of Nairobi's biggest slums, people dig through thick mud and debris with their hands, looking for any trace of their loved ones or anything salvageable. The Kenyan government says, at least 70 people have died in the floods. The military helping with recovery efforts, but for some residents, like this man who lost his mother, there is little left to save.",

Forecasters say, more heavy rain is expected in the region over the weekend. Some residents of Dar es Salaam say they've already had too much. ABDALLAH MUHAMMAD, DAR ES SALAAM, TANZANIA RESIDENT (through translator):  It has reached a point where water is going through the windows and doors, which has led to many people losing their property. When people go to work in the morning, then it rains in the afternoon. When they return in the evening, they find all their property has been carried away by water.

Comedian Colin Jost hit hard at the media, as well as President Biden, as well as Former President Donald Trump.Indeed, Joe Biden, of course, also got in some nice verbal barbs against the former president and his opponent in this upcoming general election. But the truth is, it wasn't just about politics this evening. It was also about celebrities. Many celebrities came out. Scarlett Johansson, who of course, is the wife of the man who delivered the comedic address this evening. We also had Fran Drescher who came out, a personal favorite of mine. We were able to share some matzah together here on the red carpet. We also had Da'Vine, who of course recently won an Oscar, and let me just tell you, she was absolutely delightful. I was not exactly sure if she would be as friendly as she was but she was. Rachel Brosnahan, who of course is going to be Lois Lane in the upcoming \"Superman\" movie, and of course from Mrs. Maisel and \"House of Cards\" for those of you who like Washington, D.C. She was absolutely great. We spoke about what the true Chicago pizza was. We had a little disagreement on that, but we'll leave that to our private discussions. Overall, it was an absolutely magical evening here at the White House Correspondents' Dinner, the red carpet, and I was happy to be part of it. Anyway, folks, that's it from here. Back to you.
