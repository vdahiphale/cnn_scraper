I'm Jake Tapper in Washington, where the state of our union is unsettled.We begin this morning with urgent questions surrounding the 2024 presidential race, some for the U.S. Secret Service, reeling from serious security failure surrounding the attempted assassination of Donald Trump eight days ago. The agency is finally acknowledging it did indeed deny requests by Trump's team for additional resources and personnel over the past two years, after initially claiming those charges were not true. Said Trump's campaign manager, Chris LaCivita -- quote -- \"They lied,\" this amid serious questions for President Joe Biden, who is wrapping up his medical isolation period after a COVID diagnosis, though his political isolation continues, as more than 30 Democratic lawmakers are now openly calling on him to step aside, given his political weakness and unanswered questions about his health and cognitive fitness. President Biden says he's not going anywhere, announcing plans to campaign this week and meet with the prime minister of Israel, Benjamin Netanyahu, on Tuesday. Still, as many agitate to push him out of the race, it's not clear exactly how Democrats would pick his replacement or if a new candidate would definitely perform better. Joining us now to discuss all of this, independent Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia. Thank you so much for being here. SEN. JOE MANCHIN (I-WV):  Thanks for having me, Jake.",

And I thought that might happen. And then I -- the next two weeks, I was saying, well, let's see what my colleagues who are in very difficult races, whether it's in the statewide race as a senator or in a district or as a congressperson. They have been speaking out pretty loud and clear-thinking, and it has an effect on them. And then seeing the donors, which campaign finance is the mother's milk of campaigning. You know that. Makes it very challenging. With all that being said, my prayers are with the health and well- being of my friend the president. And I believe that he has a chance, an opportunity, to finish the five months of his presidency with the way he has always basically overseen his office, whether it be as senator or as president, wanting to be that uniter, bringing this together, being able to bring peace to the Middle East, being able to support Ukraine in their fight for freedom, and also being able to show the whole world how the transfer of power can be done by the superpower of the world in a most respectful way. I'm hoping for that, because I think it'll leave him with a tremendous legacy as one of the greatest leaders that we have had.

And we are totally encapsulated in ask not what your country can do for you, what you can do for your country. And we're changing into a society, how much work can my country do for me? That's not how I was raised. I was always fiscally responsible and socially compassionate. I never believed that government should be your provider. It should be your partner. And we always are willing to give people a helping hand, a hand up, not a continuous handout, make them dependent. I'm -- we have lost that. And I think we need to bring that back. And that's the Democratic Party. But let me explain what we're dealing with in the demographics; 51 percent of people registered to participate in elections are registered like me, as an independent, 51 percent. Only 25 percent are registered as Republican. Only 23 percent are registered as Democrats. You can't win without the sensible, rational, moderated middle. They want sensible and moderation.

Joining us now is House Speaker Mike Johnson.

They are demanding it for good reason. But people are concerned. This is unconscionable what we have seen out of this Secret Service. And this director has shown and proven in her public statements that she is not fit to lead that very important agency. We need the Secret Service to do one simple thing, protect our presidents and former presidents in these cases. That's not happening. And the initial excuses that she has given for the lapses that happened last Saturday are just unbelievable. So we're going to get down to the bottom of it.

I mean, I think they have got legal hurdles in some of these states, and it'll be litigated, I would expect, on the ground there and they will have to sort through that. They have got a real problem. It was interesting. I listened to the -- Joe Manchin's interview, which was compelling, at the opening of the show. And he made the point that this is not his father's Democrat Party. It's not the party he knew as a young man. He wanted them to be sensible and moderate, and they aren't anymore. And that's why he left the party. We're seeing that across the board. We have a demographic shift going on in the country right now with a record number of Hispanic and Latino voters and black voters, African-American voters, the Jewish community coming into the Republican Party because they're looking for answers to all these great challenges facing the country. And they feel like the woke progressive left has taken the Democrat Party way over the edge. They have. And Joe Biden and Kamala Harris helped engineer that. And I think they're responsible for it.",

It was not until 1948 that the Democratic Party opened itself up to African-Americans. No, this is not the Democratic Party of my father, and that is a great thing. And so let's go forward with these improvements that we have been making in this party, opening this party up to everybody, and keep it open to everybody. So the process is there. And I think we ought to utilize that process and go to Chicago and, when we open on the 19th of August, do so on one accord. So, whatever is going to happen, all these people who are interested in getting into the process, the process is open. Get into it. Look at the rules. It's there. And I have said, you could use this process to effectively have a mini-primary, if that's what you are interested in having. But if you go to the convention, have an open process in the convention, it will come out the same way it came out in 1968, 1972, and 1980, when we had contested processes on the floor of the convention. And, in 1980, we lost an incumbent president. And, in 1972, we carried one state, Massachusetts, and the District of Columbia, and all of us know what happened in 1968, when we took -- we ran Lyndon Johnson out of the race.

I'm Jake Tapper.With President Biden facing rising scrutiny, what are Democratic governors saying behind closed doors about his continued candidacy? Joining us now, Colorado Democratic Governor Jared Polis, the new chair of the National Governors Association. Governor Polis, thanks so much for joining us. You have said that, if the election were held today, Joe Biden would lose, and you have called on Democrats to -- quote -- \"change something.\" And to continue the quote, you said -- quote -- \"That could mean changing the message, the strategy, the candidate\" -- unquote. You heard Senator Manchin say that President Biden should step aside as the Democratic nominee just a few minutes ago on this program, Congressman Clyburn keeping the door open for that possibility. What do you think? Should President Biden step aside as the Democratic nominee? Would that be best for the Democratic Party, for him, for the country? GOV. JARED POLIS (D-CO):  Well, look, first, wish -- strong wishes for President Biden's full recovery from COVID. That can be nasty at any age, particularly in your 80s. And I think that I join all your previous guests and the world in wishing him a speedy recovery from what he's facing now. Look, yes -- look, I believe in facts. I believe in data. You look at the polls, we are down. You have got to admit that. You can't pretend like you're ahead when you're down. Can we come back? Absolutely. Probably four or five points down nationally. It might be a little bit harder than that, because I think we probably need to win by at least two or three to win nationally, depending on where the votes are. So, yes, look, we need to change something about what we're doing. If we keep repeating the way that we have been campaigning, we're likely not to see a good result. The good news is, there's a very weak candidate on the other side, convicted felon. I think, more people learn about his economic plan that would raise taxes on every American family by $2,000 to $3,000 with his tariff plan, as well as destroy jobs, people are really looking for that alternative. And it's up to us to provide that forward-looking alternative about what the Democrats would do if we have the opportunity to govern for the next four years.",
