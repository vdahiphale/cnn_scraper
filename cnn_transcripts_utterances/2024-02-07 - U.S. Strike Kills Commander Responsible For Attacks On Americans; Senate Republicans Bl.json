What the stunning failure could also mean for aid to Ukraine and Israel. Plus, final preparations for tomorrow's unprecedented U.S. Supreme Court arguments on Donald Trump's Colorado ballot ban. We have exclusive new reporting on the Trump team's strategy just ahead of the historic hearing. Welcome to our viewers here in the United States and around the world. I'm Wolf Blitzer.

Our correspondents and analysts are standing by with more on all the late-breaking developments. First, to CNN's Oren Liebermann. He's over at the Pentagon. He's getting new information.

The U.S. holds this Kata'ib Hezbollah commander partly responsible, and that's why you see this attack.If you look there on your screen, you could see how targeted this was, going after a vehicle specifically. U.S. officials say this was a drone strike. The target, according to three U.S. officials, Wissam Mohammed Sabir al-Saadi, a senior Kata'ib Hezbollah commander who was taking part in those attacks on U.S. forces. And that's why the U.S. made the decision to carry out these strikes. This goes above and beyond Friday's strikes in Iraq and Syria. You can see a map of those locations here in just a moment. Those were attacks on facilities, weaponries, hubs used by not only Kata'ib Hezbollah but also other Iran-backed militant groups. This was very different. This, a targeted attack on a commander of one of those militant groups, instead of going after their capabilities, this was going after their leadership. Kata'ib Hezbollah is part of the Islamic resistance in Iraq. The U.S. holds them responsible for a drone attack that killed three U.S. service members and wounded scores more at the end of January. The challenging part here for the U.S. and the diplomatic side is they are also part of the popular mobilization units, meaning they fall under the Iraqi government. And that's where we're seeing some tension here. The U.S. -- this looks like part of the U.S. response to that drone strike, the U.S. promising more response ahead.",

Colonel Leighton, when you look at the video, and we've been showing our viewers the video, how targeted was this strike right in Baghdad? COL. CEDRIC LEIGHTON (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST: Well, Wolf, it was extremely precise. It was in the Al Mashtal neighborhood of Baghdad, which is just southeast of Sadr City. It's a Shiite neighborhood, and as you can see from the traffic, it is a very crowded, densely populated area. So, this targeting effort was extremely precise using the intelligence that we had on his movements, al-Saadi's movement.

I will sign a bill that gives DREAMERs a pathway to citizenship. Former President Trump himself killed that bill on the floor that day. That's what's happened here. We had a strong bipartisan majority eager to move this bill forward until just a few days ago, as you just heard Senator McConnell said, it's because Republicans were insisting on a border security provision before they would support Ukraine that we began this four-month-long journey of negotiation. And it's James Lankford of Oklahoma, one of the most conservative members of this Senate, who was the lead negotiator on the Senate side, they struck a hard bargain. Don't take my word for it. Brandon Judd, the head of the Border Patrol labor organization, has endorsed this bill. He's someone who is no fan of Democrats, but said that this bill would make the border more secure. Even in the face of that, because Donald Trump said, don't solve the border problem, I want an issue to run on, unfortunately, Republicans in the Senate have abandoned this bill. We are now going to try to take up the bill without the border provisions, and I hope and pray we will succeed in passing it and sending it to the House.",

And that's because he wants to break at least the 6-3 lock.Just to remind you, as I said, there are six on one side who, in the public's mind, would be ready to keep Donald Trump on the ballot and then these three liberals. And I've seen John Roberts do this before, strategize enough behind the scenes to take what would be a very narrow vote, 5-4, and work on his colleagues to make it 7-2, so it doesn't look so partisan. And I think the most likely person from the left who could join John Roberts' colleagues on the right would be Elena Kagan. She's as strategic as he is. And I do have to say, this is all premised on the idea, that they're going to go narrowly, that they don't want to go to the absolute question of, was Donald Trump engaged in an insurrection? And I think right now, not having heard the arguments yet, that's the conventional wisdom and it's also the wise wisdom, that this is a court that is not going to want to break a lot of ground, and it would be breaking ground, because this has never been interpreted in modern times, especially to involve someone like Donald Trump and his chances to be on the ballot and essentially affect who would become president of the United States.",

On the other hand, if they strike down what Colorado did, if they do it in a certain way, if they say either the president does not count under the 14th Amendment, or if they say it's not up to the states, Congress has to act first, then they'll put an end to this for good.",

Circuit.And when she was on a trial court, she presided over the early January 6th cases and just for a couple months, but she had a chance to see face-to-face the consequences of that attack and the people who were involved in it. And she is distinct among her colleagues in that way, and at one point she referred to the violence at the Capitol as -- you know, she compared it to a lynch mob. So she had very strong words. She's had to experience it in a way that her colleagues haven't. The other thing I would mention is she's already a historic justice that, you know, we haven't seen really an action much yet. She's the first African-American woman on the court. So, I think, you know, people will be wise to be listening to her. But unlike Elena Kagan, her more senior colleague on the left, she is probably not going to be ready to be part of a compromise at the center, but she will probably speak some uncomfortable truths about January 6th.",
