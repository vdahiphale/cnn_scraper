The jury could soon hear from more key members of the Biden family.It's the defense's turn to call witnesses. And the defense has indicated they plan to call on Hunter Biden's daughter Naomi Biden as they look to counter yesterday's testimony from Hallie Biden. She's Hunter Biden's sister-in-law turned girlfriend. She detailed their past relationship and how he introduced her to crack cocaine and how she disposed of the gun at the center of this case back in 2018. Meanwhile, President Biden told ABC News he will respect the jury's verdict in his son's trial. Listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

You know, you've got a situation here where the witnesses both for the state and now for the defense -- for the government, the defense, are people of character.They are people who are respected in the area. They're -- certainly, the Biden name is no secret there in that area. And so, to have Hallie Biden come in and talk and sort of lay out what she saw, what she did, what she was exposed to, what she participated in, in some respects, you know, these are -- this is -- this is significant. And it was a bad day for the defense to hear that, and a good day for the government, you know. And so now, you know the question will be in -- the problem for Biden, I think, is that he -- about everybody that he's around it seemed at the time that he was in some type of relationship with, he was either exposing or using drugs with. And that's a problem for him because the crime does not center on whether or not he just happened to have a crack pipe in his hand at the time that he checked the form when he bought the gun. But they're telling -- painting a bigger picture of the troubles he was dealing with, what his life was like, and she filled in -- Hallie Biden that is filled in a big part of that story yesterday. BLITZER: Yes. Evan, you've been inside that courtroom every day. What's it like during the course of that really explicit testimony that we're hearing?",

There are times when -- again, over four and a half days, there's been just an overwhelming amount of testimony from the prosecution. You can see sometimes the jurors are falling asleep.But during the testimony of Hallie Biden, during the times that the prosecutors have played Hunter's own voice from his audiobook, more than an hour of it, you could see them paying very, very close attention. And you can see also that his family members, in some cases, are very upset about what they're seeing. In some cases, you know, Jill Biden, the first -- the first lady, just avoids looking up at the screen when pictures of her son are shown where he is passed out with a crack pipe in the background. This is very tough stuff for the family to hear. And that's what we expect to continue next week.",

The Ukrainian president addressed France's parliament this morning, telling lawmakers that Europe is no longer at peace.He also accused Russia's Vladimir Putin of crossing red -- a red line after a red line, just like Hitler did. And later in Paris, Zelenskyy sat down with President Biden, who announced a new aid package for Ukraine. And also did something that world leaders rarely do. He publicly apologized, blaming what he called some conservatives in Congress for the delay in providing military assistance to Ukraine. The Ukrainian leader thanked President Biden and stressed the importance of continued U.S. support. Listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

He gave his keynote speech there. He's actually still on a panel debating right now. And there were two things that he was quite bullish on, actually. One of them was the Russian economy, which, of course, is one of the most sanctioned in the world.He said that economy is still going strong. Of course, the data seems to show that as well. One of the things that the Russians have been saying is they believe a country of Russia size simply cannot be isolated on the international stage. Of course, one of the things that the U.S., Wolf, has been so concerned about is China apparently giving assistance to the Russians. Not necessarily as far as weapons are concerned, but certainly for components that can be used to manufacture weapons. Those are something that the U.S. has been talking about a lot. The Russians essentially talking about a new world economic order, as they put it. But then also, as far as the battlefield is concerned, Wolf, Vladimir Putin is still extremely bullish as well, saying right now the Russians don't need mobilization. At the same time, also saying that the Russians are advancing, Wolf.",

This one further north in Al-Shati camp. Three killed there. Dozens injured according to the IDF. They say there was a container that they were targeting that had Hamas militants operating out of it.
