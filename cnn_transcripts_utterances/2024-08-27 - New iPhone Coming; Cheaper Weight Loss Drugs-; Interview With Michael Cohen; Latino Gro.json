One of them, a candidate for the Texas House, tells CNN that officials took away her own rights in her own home. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) CECILIA CASTELLANO (D), TEXAS STATE CONGRESSIONAL CANDIDATE:  The office of the attorney general did come to my home that morning at 6:00 a.m. They said: \"Ma'am, can we come in?\" I said: \"Well, can you please hold on so I can get my husband?\" When I went to go get my husband, they were already standing by my dinner table. They provided a search warrant, a one-page search warrant, but there was no specifics on it as far as, why did they want my phone? Since that day, as I walk into my home, I feel no peace in my home. I can look towards my dinner table and see those men standing there. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

But in this letter, they're essentially asking for a civil rights investigation into Republican Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton's actions in this investigation. And in that letter, LULAC says that this -- Paxton's move is a serious violation of the civil rights of Latino citizens. Also goes on to say that Ken Paxton's investigation and these raids that were carried out last week are a -- quote -- \"direct attempt to suppress the Latino vote through intimidation and harassment.\" We have made multiple attempts to reach Ken Paxton. They have not -- his office has not responded to our requests for information. But in a statement last week, the attorney general said that this was part of an investigation into illegal voter harvesting and organized electoral crimes. And that is what he is saying that this is about, saying that the integrity of Texas elections is at stake here. But LULAC officials are saying this could not be further from the truth. There were at least six different raids that we know of at this point that took place last week. There could be even more. And LULAC officials say that this is all much ado about nothing, that no illegal activity is ongoing. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

She is adamant that she has done nothing wrong, has followed all the rules in the voter registration process.She says she was interrogated for about three hours last week and forced to wait on her front porch in her bathrobe while investigators were inside looking for evidence and carrying out that search warrant. It's also important to point out, Jim, that the Texas attorney general has a history in recent years of going after these electoral integrity cases, but there hasn't been much \"there\" there. In fact, many of these cases have kind of floundered and there hasn't really been any kind of evidence of widespread fraud across the state, Jim.",

Zepbound itself is a tirzepatide weight loss drug, but the semaglutides are equally important. These include Ozempic and Wegovy. And prescriptions specifically for semaglutides have gone up 40-fold in the past five years, Jim. So that's the demand that we're seeing right now.

And this is really going to be the first iPhone that is custom-built, designed with artificial intelligence features in mind. We do know some of what to expect from that event earlier this year, things like a smarter Siri that will be able to answer more complex questions. There will also be help in drafting e-mails. You can create personalized emojis. And Apple Intelligence is going to draw on people's personal data on their devices. So I could ask it what to expect from my day and it could pull information from my calendar and my e-mail to get me that answer. And the big question for Apple here is, will these artificial intelligence features be enough to drive a major iPhone cycle? Apple hasn't given people very exciting reasons to upgrade in the past few years, and they're hoping that these A.I. features will be that exciting feature.",

With ABC, NBC, CBS, et cetera, he cannot do that. So, of course, he's going to claim that there's a bias towards him. None of it is true. It's all a figment of his imagination, which is getting more and more weird each and every day. But he's going to end up showing up, despite all of the nonsense, because he knows what Kamala Harris is going to do to him, right, if he doesn't show up. She will just put a cardboard cut out of him in the spot and she will talk to him as if he's there. Now, he's really stuck right now in a very weird situation, using that word again. Why?
