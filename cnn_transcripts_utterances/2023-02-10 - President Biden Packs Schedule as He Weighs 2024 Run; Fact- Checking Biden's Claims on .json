They are currently in D.C. for their annual Washington meeting, and as the president sort of kicks off the second half of his first term this obviously gives him an opportunity to have a significant check in with the various leaders of the states across the country.We know that a big focus will obviously be on economic issues, particularly as this White House focuses on implementation of some of the bills that were signed into law over the last two years. What that means for funding for various states, COVID of course is expected to be one of the topics just simply even given that the public health emergency is expected to go away in a few months and that will have a big impact on how different states, you know, deal with the COVID pandemic that is ongoing. But later in the day we will see the focus here at the White House turn from these domestic priorities to foreign policy. The president is going to be hosting the president of Brazil here at the White House and that is going to be a really interesting and fascinating meeting, especially if you consider the fact that these two leaders have really in so many ways have had to deal with similar dynamics over the last few years in their respective countries. You know, both countries have seen and dealt with the rise of political extremism, right-wing populism, and then sort of different protests and efforts to undermine election results. And we saw this on such clear display a number of weeks ago in Brazil when supporters of the ex-president of the country tried to storm major government buildings. That was such an echo of what we saw here in our own country of course on January 6th. And U.S. officials are saying that those are the kinds of themes that they expect the two leaders to discuss at this bilateral meeting. Of course, President Biden also would very much like to turn the chapter on the U.S.-Brazil relationship. Obviously he didn't exactly have a close relationship with the former Brazil president, Jair Bolsonaro.",

And that is just not true at all. That's a claim that was roundly, widely debunked by CNN and a bunch of other outlets when Scott and his NRSC made it last year.What the Inflation Reduction Act actually does is save the government and seniors money by reducing the amount of money that the government has to pay to pharmaceutical companies for prescription drugs. So that is pure savings. It is the not a benefit cut. And I spoke to experts about this again this week. A Vanderbilt University professor named Stacie Dusetzina said that framing this as a cut to benefits is, quote, \"nonsense.\" Again, she's a Vanderbilt professor. Another expert at the Kaiser Family Foundation Juliette Cubanski told me that the Congressional Budget Office said that prescription drug provisions in the law will reduce the federal deficit by $237 billion. This is savings from the federal government and Medicare from lowering what Medicare pays for prescription drugs. This is not the same thing as a $237 billion cut to Medicare. So debunked last year and debunked again this year.",
