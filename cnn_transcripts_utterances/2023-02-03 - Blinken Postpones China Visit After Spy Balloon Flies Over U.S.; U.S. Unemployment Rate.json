      "sentences": "Hello, everyone. I'm Kate Bolduan. We do begin with breaking news. CNN has just learned that Secretary of State Tony Blinken's trip to China is off. Postponing the planned visit to Beijing after a Chinese spy balloon was found flying over the United States. The Pentagon is tracking this spy balloon, which the balloon itself is huge. It's about the size of three buses.Officials tell CNN that President Biden has decided against shooting it down. I guess we can say at least as of now, because this really is developing. It's still not known what the Chinese are trying to do with this thing. Despite the apology issued this morning, the Chinese government now saying it's a wayward weather research balloon. Let's get to it. There's a lot of questions, even more mounting at this hour. First to Kylie Atwood, who's here with me. Kylie, what are you hearing from the State Department about Blinken's trip now being postponed?",

      "sentences": "OK, so we just got off the phone with senior State Department officials, and what they told us is that this balloon is violating U.S. sovereignty and international law. That's why they're postponing this trip. The Secretary of State made a call earlier this morning to his counterpart, Wang Yi, and told him that the conditions aren't right for this trip to go ahead. They told us that he was supposed to leave tonight.So this is a very last minute cancellation. They're saying it's postponed, but we don't have a date for when this is going to be rescheduled. And one question that I asked the senior State Department officials was, what are the conditions that are needed to reschedule this trip? And they aren't specifically saying that. What they're saying right now is they acknowledge that the Chinese side is saying that they regret this. But what the United States is very clear on is their own assessment that this is a Chinese spy balloon. It was over U.S. territory. It was over Montana. And that's why there are these frustrations. And I do think it's important to note that there are other Chinese spy balloons that have been over U.S. territory in the past. And so the question is, you know, why is this different? What a senior State Department official said is the difference here is that it comes on the eve of this top diplomat's trip to China. And so it's really a question of timing here. And they felt like they were going to have this wide ranging conversation with Chinese officials, and their agenda would have been dramatically decreased because they'd have to focus on this so much. So it wouldn't be a productive visit to make it this time.",

We'll see when a date is next set and what exactly that means. It's great to have to you. I'm so glad you're here, Kylie. Thank you.So we do expect to learn more details about all of this at Pentagon briefing next hour. U.S. Military officials have said that they have been tracking this balloon for several days at least. Alex Marquardt has more on all of this in this side of it for us. Alex, so the military advised the President to not shoot down this balloon. Why?",

      "sentences": "Yes, that's right, Kate. They have been tracking this for several days. President Biden was briefed on this and was told by his senior most officials that it was not worth taking it down because of the potential damage that falling debris could do to both people and property on the ground. This is obviously a sophisticated intelligence balloon, but the Pentagon believes that it is not a threat to people, it is not a threat to the homeland.And the Pentagon says that they have taken steps to limit the kind of, or the amount of intelligence that is able to gather on the ground. Of course, as Kylie was noting, it has flown over Montana, which has some of the most sensitive military and nuclear sites in the country. Now, China, of course, claiming this is a civilian craft used to study, among other things, meteorological conditions. It has very limited control, we understand, over its path. It is carried by the winds. It does have surveillance equipment that China does indeed have some control over. But U.S. officials tell us that there is no motor, so it is floating through the air over the continental United States. And, of course, there are a lot of people questioning this decision so far by the Pentagon not to shoot this down. This was an option, were told on Wednesday when it was over a sparsely populated area in Montana airspace over Billings, Montana was shut down. F-22 -- F-22s were mobilized. Decision was made not to do this. Of course, we're going to hear, we are already hearing a lot of calls that it should be shut down, including by Senator Marco Rubio, who's the top Republican on the Senate Intelligence Committee. But for now, Kate, this balloon continues to float over American airspace. Kate?",

And Jamil Jaffer, he's founder and executive director of the National Security Institute at George Mason University. Guys, thanks for being here. I think Marc Stewart used a great word, Jamil, for kind of where this is, as this whole thing is kind of unraveled. What do you think of Blinken postponing over this?JAMIL JAFFER, EXEC. DIRECTOR, NATIONAL SECURITY INSTITUTE AT GEORGE MASON UNIV.: Look, I think it makes a solid point, which is to say, look, you can't get caught flying spy balloons over the United States without some consequences. So I think it's the right move for the secretary to postpone his trip. Not necessarily cancel it, but make clear that we're not happy that this happened. Of course, we conduct these type of surveillance missions in Chinese -- in the Chinese neighborhood all the time. They do it to us oftentimes from outer space. But getting caught doing it is really the problem here. And that's why I think he's making this point very clearly that they violated the sovereignty in our airspace.",

      "sentences": "I think that's the exactly correct way to look at the Chinese statement. I understand that it's unprecedented. They don't ever really express regret for anything. But if you look at the details of the statement, it doesn't clearly identify what this device is doing, why it's there. And the fact is, I'm pretty surprised that the statements we've heard coming out of the administration on this over the last 24 hours, have been very dismissive of the capabilities of this airship, when, in fact, it doesn't seem like anyone has any idea what's actually in that balloon.It's also a potential intelligence collection gold mine for the United States. So, you know, I saw Secretary Esper's talk on this exact topic earlier today on CNN, and I have to say, I agree with them wholeheartedly. We are in a position to take this device down. We should do so for our own benefit and for the very clear message it says to the Chinese that this is not an acceptable act of surveillance on U.S. territory.",

      "sentences": "Yes, I do, Kate. I mean, look, I come at this from a very distinct perspective, right? The FBI is the lead agency for counterintelligence activity here in the United States. So that's what we do. We try to find out what the adversary is doing, what information they're trying to collect or steal, and we try to stop that. And I think we have a unique opportunity to do that here.The first step in doing so is to understand what the adversary's capabilities are, what kind of equipment do they have, and what their intentions are. So by downing the vehicle and examining its contents, we have this opportunity to collect that sort of intelligence. We also have every right to do it. It is intruding over our territorial airspace, you could do it with the full knowledge of the Chinese if this is their vehicle and they can control it, you could demand that they bring it to the ground. And if they're not able to do that, we, of course, have the military option to do so. So I think for many reasons, it is the prudent course, understanding the possible danger to people on the ground. But that seems like something that the U.S. Military should be able to manage.",

      "sentences": "Well, I think Kate, that's really a possibility. I think it's making the point that Blinken is not going to go, that we might down it, demonstrates to them that we don't appreciate what they're doing here. It is different, you know, surveilling from outer space versus over our sovereign airspace. The two do make a difference. And, you know, getting in closer to the ground allows you to get better visibility, but it also allows you potentially to collect signals that might be closer to the ground that are making it out to outer space.So there are benefits for the Chinese in conducting this cast surveillance, but there are obviously downsides, getting caught and having the U.S. take action. I think, Kate, Andy is right. That the collection goldmine that could come from identifying what's on this balloon, what they're collecting, the kind of capabilities they have. And by the way, there's a precedent for this, the Chinese forced down an American EP-3 spy plane in 2001, forced down in Hainan Island, held our airmen and air women hostage for 10 days and took all the surveillance equipment off of that plane and learned a lot about our capabilities. So there's definitely a precedent here. So I think there's a good reason to really take action and get a little more aggressive than the administration is currently being. And Andy is right, the U.S. military should be able to take this thing down without causing problems on the ground.",

It looks like it's actually speeding up, which is really incredible. The unemployment rate went lower 3.4 percent. So that is not just a new post COVID low. That is the lowest since May of 1969. I mean, think about that before man walked on the moon. Pretty amazing especially considering we had almost 15 percent unemployment back in spring of 2020.Now, there was across the board strength in this report if you look at the sector breakdown, restaurants and bars added almost 100,000 jobs by themselves, government, healthcare, retail, construction, manufacturing, hotels, all of them adding jobs almost no weakness. Now, normally this kind of report would raise fears of an overheating jobs market that would worsen inflation. But there were actually some encouraging signs on that front wage at growth that slowed down. It's still too hot, but it is cooling off. Also, the supply of workers increased. Now, if anything though, these numbers were so strong that some economists don't totally believe them. Moody's economist Mark Zandi, he told me he thinks that maybe COVID related issue or weather have overstated the jobs growth. But he said that anything about this report I mean, there's no reason to think that there'd be a recession right now or anytime soon. These numbers are too strong.",
