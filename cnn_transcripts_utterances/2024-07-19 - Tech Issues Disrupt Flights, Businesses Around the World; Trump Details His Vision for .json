This thing is everywhere.I'm John Berman with Sarah Sidner in New York, Kate Bolduan is in Milwaukee. This is CNN News Central. All right, and the breaking news this morning, this is a live look at the airport in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. There might be some reporters and politico types in there. They're trying to get out of Milwaukee. But right now, Milwaukee is just like almost every other airport, I mean, on Earth right now, airports all around the world, businesses, so many different institutions being affected right now by this I.T. outage, this major, major glitch. So, a short time ago, we got a sense of what is causing this. The CEO of CrowdStrike Cybersecurity Firm says that a content update to its software triggered outages within Windows. And, of course, Windows is the most widely used computer operating system in the world. CrowdStrike insists this is not a security incident or a cyberattack, it's just bad. It is packing a wallop. Airports, airlines, businesses, stock exchanges, you know, the metro in D.C., anyone trying to get on a computer in these places overnight, they were seeing that blue screen of death on their monitors. So many are still experiencing issues.",

Just make sure that your flight hasn't been canceled or delayed. Bigger impacts actually at Gatwick, at Stansted, other airports just outside of London, also Edinburgh, and right across Europe, Sara. I mean, Amsterdam's Schiphol, which is one of the other world's busiest airports, is perhaps feeling the most impact today. KLM, the airline, is saying that the outages are making flight handling impossible. So, just imagine for all those poor people trying to get on holiday, surely going to be huge delays, trying to reroute all of those flights. And then right beyond the airlines and the travel, and I think this is where most people will feel this sort of disruption. But there are also issues for healthcare services. Here in the U.K. G.P.s are struggling to be able to book appointments or send prescriptions. There are issues with London Stock Exchange website, there are telecoms issues.

I'm not exactly sure if that's what it was, but, look, I think overall, it was a tale of two speeches. We really did see, and I was kind of shocked in the beginning, we saw a much more vulnerable side of Donald Trump as he was walking through what had happened to him. I am told that he has been very personally, I mean, of course, affected by that shooting. He has been talking about divine intervention, that he wasn't supposed to be here, something he said himself last night But then, when it started to go back to his vision for America, what he would do if he were put back in office.

And now Senator Jon Tester of Montana and California Congressman Jim Costa have joined the growing list of Democrats calling on the president to withdraw from the race.CNN's Priscilla Alvarez joins me now from Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, where the president does remain in isolation because he tested positive for COVID.

And he is increasingly isolated. His inner circle has grown even tighter as he deliberates what his next steps are going to be. One source saying, quote, the walls are closing in. But those loyal aides also remain dug in. So, the president, for example, has often cast doubt over any polling that suggests that he can't go up against former President Donald Trump. And many of his aides still maintain that he is in this race and that he is not going anywhere, often pointing to their own internal polling showing that he is the best candidate to go up against his Republican rival. But the polls that we have also seen are ones that show him slipping and going -- and losing points when put up against Trump, and also donors who just remain furious that he is still in the race because they too are concerned about the trajectory of this race and whether he is the most viable candidate at this time. And so there are a lot of factors that are sort of playing out here in, in how the aides are thinking about this, but also how the president is thinking about this. Now, a lot of folks have tried to speculate that he'll make a decision this weekend, but sources also tell CNN, this is ultimately up to him and anyone that says that they know what's going to happen, it really doesn't. What we do know is that last night, the campaign was very closely watching what former President Donald Trump had to say at the Republican convention, with the campaign chair saying that the former president sought to find problems with America, not provide solutions. So, they are continuing their criticism and attacks against the former president, even as all of this unfolds within their own party.",
