Next hour, the families are going to begin reading out the names of the lives that were lost, something that they do every year. A beautiful, somber, heart wrenching moment that goes on and on and on. Nearly 3,000 lives lost. Those names will be read. And then we will stop -- 8:46 a.m. will be the first moment of silence to mark when the first tower, the North Tower, was struck. You see those moments that we will be following and bringing to you live throughout the morning.

He thinks the number of illegal immigrants that are in the United States is far more than -- undocumented immigrants than the 11 million believed. He said last night he believes it's 21 million.

Obviously, any presidential campaign is looking most closely at how the voters who are yet to decide -- who may be either undecided or soft Trump-soft Harris viewed the debate. And what we saw was just a dominating performance.You know, I think particularly, their exchange on abortion was one where the biggest gap I've ever seen in a debate in terms of people liking what Kamala Harris said and really disliking Donald Trump. But throughout the night I think that she did herself a lot of good on the issues of the economy, on health care, on foreign policy, and Donald Trump did not. I mean, I'm not sure I've ever seen a group of voters react so poorly to something as they did to Donald Trump's strange detour into dog- and cat-eating land. But it wasn't just that. I mean, I think -- John, I've always -- you always have to focus on the campaign. You have a good night, and you've got to focus on the next day. You've got to move on. And I think 1) he -- we've waited 11 years for his health care plan, and we've never seen it and we never will. His only plan is to kick tens of millions of people off health care. I think he said I have the concepts of a plan after 11 years. You'll hear a lot more about that in the days to come. He refused to say he wouldn't sign a national abortion ban. I'll remind your viewers he personally said he's going to cast his vote in Florida for a six-week abortion ban before many women know they're pregnant. And then he basically said, you know, he wouldn't take Ukraine's side. He was asked repeatedly. And so I think those are three key moments we'll see a lot about in the coming days and weeks.",

She said clearly that she believes obviously a lot of people get their health care through their employer, but a lot of people also rely on the ACA, so that's a big difference.If you get your health care from your employer, Kamala Harris is going to work to strengthen our health care system. If you get it on the individual market, like over 20 million Americans get, with her, you'll save it, and we'll improve it. Donald Trump will get rid of it. So at the end of the day -- listen, I look at Donald Trump -- all these questions posed to Kamala Harris and that's fair. You know he's had seven or eight positions on just about every issue through his life. At this late stage of his life where he's settled is the most extreme version on all of them. Project 2025 is a big part of that. But you saw on abortion last night, on health care last night -- by the way, how delusional is he? He said he saved Obamacare. Sixty time he tried to kill it. And if it wasn't for the courage of John McCain, he would have been successful. So at the end of the day, I think what people saw last night is a candidate who is very much focused on the future. And I think, listen, whether you're Donald Trump or Kamala Harris, people are going to compare what you're offering the American people over the next four years. And I think there's a big distinction there on a range of issues that matter greatly to the American people.",

She triggered him from crowd size to dog-eating. I mean, it just was a -- it was terrible for Trump. And I thought that Harris was particularly powerful on women's health and reproductive rights where she made some very strong points. He didn't. The only thing I could say about Trump that I thought at the end of the debate he made a comment that he probably should have made repeatedly. He said if you're going to do all these things why didn't you do them in the first 3 1/2 years of your time in office? But by then it was -- it was too late. You know, he -- Harris also effectively attacked him on tariffs and Trump retorted well then, why haven't you repealed them? But Trump was just so -- you know, he was just obsessed with his own issues of crowd size. And I think she really got him pretty good, too, with the comment about all your former staffers and generals all say you're a disgrace. And so, I -- it was clearly -- she clearly got under his skin.

But until then I'd run it as good as I can run it.\" And he was asked yesterday, \"Do you have a plan?\" And he says, \"I have a concept of a plan. I would only change it if we came up with something that's better and less expensive than Obamacare.\" BLAKE:  Look, so this man ran because of his disdain for Barack Obama -- President Obama -- where the fundamental policy he got done was health care. The notion this long that they have a concept of a plan not only is disastrous and foolish, it shows he is not serious in trying to be president.
