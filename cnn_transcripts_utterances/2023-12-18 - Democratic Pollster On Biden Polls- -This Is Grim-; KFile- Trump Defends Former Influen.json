His name is Douglass Mackey. He went by the pseudonym Ricky Vaughn on Twitter.That's where he posted this meme, which prosecutors said suggested that people vote for Hillary Clinton by text. They say at least 44,900 people texted this number. Now, Mackey and the Trumps have sort of claimed this is a joke that no reasonable person would believe, but prosecutors allege this is part of a much more sinister plot to deprive people of their right to vote. He was convicted in March. He was sentenced in October. He's currently out on while his appeal goes through the justice system. Let's flash forward to today, and Donald Trump is claiming this is an example of Joe Biden's Justice Department going after his supporters for attacking their free speech. Take a listen to this.
