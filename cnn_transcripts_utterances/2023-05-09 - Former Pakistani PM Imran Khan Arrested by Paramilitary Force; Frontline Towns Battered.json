      "sentences": "This hour Pakistan's Former Prime Minister Imran Khan has been arrested at Islamabad's High Court we explore what this meansfor Pakistani politics going forward. But first, Vladimir Putin presides over a toned down military parade in Russia where only one tank was on display. It was an old one that he proclaimed Ukraine has become a \"Hostage to a regime led by Western masters\". A cloud of smoke was seen over Gaza Skyline this morning as Israel launched deadly airstrikes on Islamic Jihad targets the IDF said. The Palestinian Ministry of Health in Gaza meantime, says 13 people were killed including at least 5 women and several children. U.S. authorities will launch an enforcement operation Tuesday in El Paso, Texas targeting migrants who have crossed the border but have not been processed by immigration authorities. And we want to get straight to developing news out of Pakistan where political tensions are rising by the minute. Protests have broken out in multiple cities, after Former Prime Minister Imran Khan was arrested by paramilitary police. What you're seeing here is Khan's supporters breaking through the gates of the General Headquarters of Pakistan's military, the army. In fact earlier police and rioters smashed a window very dramatic footage here to get Khan who was inside Islamabad's high court. Khan says the corruption charges against him are political and his party calls the arrest \"An Abduction\". For more now from Khan Supporters' and how they're responding to this arrest I want to bring in Dr. Shireen Mazari. She's the Senior Vice President of Khan's Political Party in Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf. And I want to thank you for joining us to give us more information on a developing story. You know, it was clear to me anyway that Mr. Khan was tipped off about this somehow, his video was quite explicit. And it indicates that he knew that he would be arrested, that your party claims that all of this is politically motivated. What proof do you have of that? DR. SHIREEN MAZARI, SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT, PAKISTAN TEHREEK-E-INSAF: We know it's politically motivated, because the charges that have been framed there are over 100 cases, and a lot of them are frivolous. He named one army general as being responsible for the two assassination plots against him, which both were unsuccessful. And on that itself, I'm just giving you one example. He was charged with treason. So there's an absurdity about the cases but more important, I want to correct he was not arrested. He was abducted. He was in the Islamabad High Court in the court premises. The paramilitary troops, the Rangers came in, they broke the windows of the High Court were building room where Khan was and he was in a wheelchair because of his injury from the first assassination attempt. And he was dragged; he was beaten on his head with wooden sticks, which had nails in them. He was then specially beaten and kicked on his foot that the whole leg which was injured. He was dragged from the wheelchair on the ground and then abducted by the paramilitary forces. So let's be clear. This was not an arrest. This was abduction. And what Khan had warned, were repeatedly that if anything like that happened, we would not be able to control the anger of the people of Pakistan. And that anger is now being vented all across Pakistan.",

It's the general public, which has been seething against what has been happening against the economic situation, the rising inflation, those rising food prices, so people have been seething.

Where Mr. Bajwa then, and the military did not allow when Khan was -- the assassination attempt against him. Khan was not allowed to file an FIR the first information report naming people that he alleged were behind his assassination. So there is no rule of law or civilian grip anymore in Pakistan. It's not just a question of the military abandoning one group and supporting another. This goes beyond that. This goes towards undermining your constitution and your parliamentary democracy.

Last year, there were about 12. So that's a reduction. But I mean, make no mistake, it was still a significant show of Russian military mice at the center of this parade, where you know, several, I mean, I counted three, there could have been more intercontinental ballistic missiles, the backbone of Russia's nuclear deterrence of Russia's nuclear threat, depending on how you want to see it. And there are all sorts of other bits of pieces of military equipment on display as well. You're right to point out the tank. And it was quite interesting, there was only one tank, usually you see whole columns of these things rumbling off around over the cobbles of red squared, that was just one this year. And it was an old tank, a T-34 from the 1940s of the kind that sort of sort of led the Red Army in the Second World War, what Russians call the Great Patriotic War. And obviously, that was homage to the sacrifice paid in that conflict. But it's also sort of led to all sorts of speculation that the Russians don't have enough tanks left because they've been hit so hard on the battlefield in Ukraine, to put any on the streets of central Moscow. I'm sure that's probably an exaggeration. I'm sure they've got some tanks tucked away somewhere. But it was an interesting choice, that they would only put out one tank not of their most modern military equipment at a time when they are digging in, waiting for this Ukrainian counter offensive to try and take back territory that they've conquered in the course of the past year and a half.",

But the vast majorities do get shot down because the capabilities of the Ukrainians have been improved because of the help that they've been getting from the west. The Ukrainian position on this though Paula, particularly as plans for their summer or spring offensive advance is that they want more aerial defensives. And they also want attack capability from the air. They're continuing to call for the international community to supply them with F-16s or similar type aircraft or older NATO aircraft that they say they can put to decisive strategic use here.

Among its claims the Israeli military has killed at least 20 journalists over the past two decades and took no accountability for its actions. The watchdog group says 18 of those killed by the IDF were Palestinian. In response, Israel's military says it regrets any harm to civilians and does not intentionally target non-combatants. Joining me now from Jerusalem is Robert Mahoney. He is the Director of Special Projects with the Committee to Protect Journalists. And I'm glad you can be with us.

We saw a lot of journalists died last year in Ukraine, for example, at the beginning of that war, where it wasnot clear where the front lines were, and who was shooting at whom. In the case here of the territories, the West Bank and Gaza, it was the killing last year of Shireen Abu Akleh, the Al Jazeera correspondent that really marked a watershed for many Palestinian journalists. She was an instantly recognizable face; she brought news to Arab houses around the world. And she has been killed so far with impunity. Shireen was a U.S. citizen. And so the FBI after pressure has opened an investigation. But we don't know where that is. And Israel has refused to cooperate with the authorities. We would like the U.S. to give us an update on where we are with that investigation of the FBI. And to use its best efforts with Israel to get Israel to cooperate, because without that kind of investigation, she will have died with impunity and impunity is a cancer on independent journalism around the world. If journalists can't do their job without fearing for their lives, they will often be hesitant to go to stories to cover stories, and to put themselves in harm's way. So we really want an end to impunity. And this is a perfect example, where we think that we can get to the bottom of the killing of an American citizen.",

What that does is it has a chilling effect on independent reporting and press freedom. Palestinian journalists are now telling us that they're thinking twice before going out sometimes to cover assignments. They fear for their own safety. One said if they can kill Shireen, then what about me? I'm nobody compared to her. So the effects on the quality and the timeliness of the news that we receive are affected by this impunity.",

And we all started using the word pandemic. Here is one of the first times it was added on CNN, listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DR. SANJAY GUPTA, CNN CHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: There are criteria that are somewhat defined to call something a pandemic. And let me just preface by saying you know, this, this terminology that we're going to start using now isn't so much to cause panic, but rather to really cause a focus on preparedness.

Chief Medical Correspondent for us, Dr. Sanjay Gupta, OK, so they're saying this is the end, right. But what does this mean? Are we out of the woods here? DR. GUPTA: Well, you know, I think this is a formal end to things. But I don't know that we can say that we're out of the woods yet, either. You know, the W.H.O. is saying that the public health emergency of international concern is over; the United States is going to say basically the same thing on Thursday. The CDC director is stepping down on June 30, so all these things are happening. But to your point, I mean, you know, there's still COVID out there, and people who are vulnerable, I think, are quite worried about this. For some Paula, this will seem like an arbitrary end to thing. For others, it'll be like, hey, looking; I thought this thing was over months, if not a year ago. But let me show you, for example, in the United States, there's still around 77,000 or so cases every week in the United States. But you get an idea of what has happened there, if you look at that graph, those surges that we've seen over the past few years. When it comes to hospitalizations, there are still about 1200 people in the hospital right now lower than it has been; the trends are going in the right direction, but still a lot of people and about 1100 people dying every year in the United States, Paula. So you know if you if you do the math on that, what you'll see is that about 55,000 people, 54,000 people would die every year from COVID in the United States alone, which is on par with a bad flu season. So you know, I've often thought about the country as my own patient. If that were the case, I'd say, OK, we're ready to let you be discharged. But we got to keep a close eye on things because one of the big concerns is a re-admission. So that's, that's sort of the position we're in now.",
