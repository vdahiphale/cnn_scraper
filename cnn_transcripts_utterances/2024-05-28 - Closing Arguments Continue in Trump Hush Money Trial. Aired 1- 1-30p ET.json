And welcome to CNN's special coverage of the closing arguments in former President Donald Trump's criminal hush money trial.I'm Wolf Blitzer in Washington, alongside Abby Phillip, who is outside the courthouse in New York. A very consequential day, as we enter the homestretch of this truly historic trial. Court is out now for lunch following a morning of blistering closing arguments by Trump's defense team. Unsurprisingly, Trump attorney Todd Blanche made the case that payments made to Michael Cohen, the heart of the prosecution's charges, were not illegal -- Abby, over to you.",

And the claims that the alleged tryst between Trump and adult film actress Stormy Daniels, he implied that it never even happened. At one point, Blanche told jurors you cannot convict President Trump of any crime beyond a reasonable doubt on the words of Michael Cohen. So, now that the defense has finished with its summation, the prosecution, they will have their final word before jurors begin their deliberations. We're expecting that to begin in just about an hour. So, while we wait, let's bring in chief legal affairs correspondent Paula Reid. And with us also is CNN national correspondent Kristen Holmes. Ladies, I was just in the courtroom not that long ago listening to the vast majority of Blanche's summations. And as a good defense attorney might do, the main thing that he was trying to accomplish was just to say to the jury, you don't have to overthink this. This is really easy. You have got a liar on the stand. (CROSSTALK)",

He is ending this case, despite the Bob Costello testimony and the back-and-forth -- and there are two camps there, that some believe that it could affect him.

You can hear, he's hitting a bunch of different points, but I'm not sure that he's making a through line that's easy for the jury to follow. Ladies, hold that thought for just a moment. I want to go to Kara Scannell. She just got out of the courthouse as they're taking their lunch break here.

Another person's lips were pursed for most of the closing arguments. Other jurors, their eyes were wandering a bit, some looking down at the monitors on their screen where Blanche put up some of the testimony, the excerpts that he was citing to the jury, as well as some of the e-mails and the phone logs that he was using in his demonstration. So the jurors seemed pretty attentive. You -- it's very hard to read their faces, but they were paying close attention to what Blanche was saying throughout this multihour closing argument. And Donald Trump was too. At one point, he had turned his chair so that he was facing Blanche and the jury as Blanche was addressing them. Blanche was at the podium, which was slightly turned as well. So it appeared that Trump had a clear view of the jury as he was watching both his lawyer and the jury as they were hearing Blanche's arguments. And a lot of this was focused on Michael Cohen, that he, as Blanche put it, was the MVP of liars, the GLOAT of liars, the greatest liar of all time, just really trying to underscore why the jury could not convict Donald Trump based on Michael Cohen's words alone and focusing the jury to other parts of the evidence that he is hoping that they view in his favor, such as David Pecker being part of this alleged conspiracy, but saying that David Pecker wanted nothing to do with the Stormy Daniels story. David Pecker testified to that, and so saying, how could this be a conspiracy if one of the catch-and-kill deals that's at the center of it was something that David Pecker wanted nothing to do with? So, trying to raise questions in the minds of the jury, focusing in on them, saying that Michael Cohen is the human embodiment of reasonable doubt, and that is why they should not convict based on his testimony, his words, arguing that Cohen lies about things big and small. He lies to his family. He lies mostly for his own benefit. So, a lot for the jury to digest over this quick lunch break, and then the prosecutors will have their turn to do their closing arguments. We are now expected to go later than the usual 4:30 close today. Exactly how late really depends on how long the prosecutor goes. But the jury gave the thumbs-up that they would be willing to stay to hear this through the end today. The prosecutor said he thought his closing could go four hours, but he also said he would react to what Todd Blanche said during his closing arguments. So we expect this will continue much later than court usually ends today, so the jury can hear arguments from both sides before they head home for the night and before the judge instructs them tomorrow -- Abby.",

Stormy Daniels, I would just given that the back of the hand. I think the way -- go back -- what I think Todd Blanche hopes the jury takes away from this is this. You cannot make this case without relying on Michael Cohen, and you cannot trust Michael Cohen. He got there, but he could have done it more powerfully, more succinctly.

But, number two, what does this person look like as they're arguing? Is he putting people to sleep and so on? Very important point that the state of New York puts the rest of America at a huge disadvantage there. Now, a few sort of things, picking up on some of the points that Elie had made. There's a lot of time that Todd Blanche spent today on things that they ought to have let go, the affair, whether it happened. Spending any breath denying whether it happened did not benefit their case in any way. Now, he made the argument that the prosecution merely brought in the testimony of Stormy Daniels so as to inflame the passions of the jury. But don't go down that road. It's not a relevant fact. And, quite frankly, most people probably believe that it happened, so it's almost insulting to the jury in many ways. It was an odd argument to make. And the other thing that I was struck by is, there were a number of places where he used absolutes, using arguments -- and I tried to stay away from this whenever I was arguing a case -- there is not a shred of evidence that establishes blank. Well, there is a shred of evidence that establishes virtually everything in the case. Now, the jury doesn't necessarily have to believe it, but you lose credibility as a practitioner when you start saying, absolutely yes or absolutely no anything, right? It -- everything comes down to whether the jury trusts what they heard. But that doesn't mean that they heard the evidence -- that they didn't hear the evidence. And they did. It was there.

I would say, though, that as we saw during the testimony, not just in the summation, this whole notion that the defense team has been focused on of making this Stormy Daniels scenario as just one of a normal order of business for a place like \"The Enquirer,\" this happens with celebrities, this happens with everyone -- they brought up Arnold Schwarzenegger. The -- all of this was to, like, try to convince the jury that there's nothing really to see here about the salacious stuff, the hush money, the catch-and-kill, the porn star, that that is not part of what is going on here.

And he's just getting picked on it because it's a witch-hunt. And, in that way, it actually plays into something that's sort of, like, commonly held and discussed when people have talked about this case, in particular, that, while it's unsavory, is it illegal?
