Emergency officials in southern France are racing to fight a fire the size of one usually seen in the summer months. Hundreds of firefighters were deployed on Sunday to control a blaze that has consumed more than 660 hectares of land.Meantime, in northern Spain, huge clouds of smoke darkened the skies on Sunday. The fires in both Spain and France have been made worse by drought conditions throughout the year. At least 16 people were killed and nine others were injured after a fire broke out in an apartment building in Dubai. Local media report, the blaze on Saturday started on the fourth floor of the five-storey building, which is located in one of the most densely populated areas of the city. According to Dubai Civil Defense, preliminary investigations showed the fire was caused by a lack of compliance with building security and safety requirements. They say a more detailed investigation is underway. The U.S. Border Patrol says it encountered more than 2 million migrants at the southern border last year. And tens of thousands are still waiting in northern Mexico for the opportunity to enter the U.S. Hoping that will be easier once the Trump era policy known as Title 42 ends next month. CNN's Rosa Flores explains what could happen when it does. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ROSA FLORES, CNN CORRESPONDENT (on-camera): Where are we?",

Now, from reporting from both sides of the border, I can tell you that what the net effect of these current policies look like is a valve. A valve that allows the U.S. government to manage the flow of migration into the United States and has thousands of migrants waiting in Mexico. Rosa Flores, CNN, El Paso, Texas.",

Now it is the Mexican Navy who is leading the search here with the help of the U.S. Coast Guard.The three Americans that are currently missing are Kerry and Frank O'Brien, they are a married couple and William Gross. I spoke to Kerry's mother, and she says that Kerry and her husband have about 20 years of experience and said that Bill has about 50 years of experience when it comes to sailing. She says, you know, a mother always worries, but she wasn't particularly concerned about this trip. She speaks to her daughter every single day. But on day two, when she didn't hear from her, she began to feel scared, to feel concerned. She says she is now heartbroken, but is not losing hope. Here's part of the conversation I had with that mother. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ELLEN ARGALL, MOTHER OF MISSING AMERICAN KERRY O'BRIEN: We're so close. We either talk on the phone or we text each other. So when I didn't hear from her when she was supposed to Cabo, I started getting very worried. I'm very worried, sad, concerned, but I'm still hopeful. I'm hanging on to the hope.

Well, this included a push for all member countries to end plastic pollution by the year 2040.The United Nations says the volume of plastics entering the world's oceans will triple by that time. A statement from Germany's Minister of the Environment says countries will promote sustainable consumption and production of plastics in an effort to hit the goal. But they must also change how plastic waste is managed. Joining me now, Carroll Muffett, the President and CEO of the Center for International Environmental Law. Sir, thank you so much for coming on.
