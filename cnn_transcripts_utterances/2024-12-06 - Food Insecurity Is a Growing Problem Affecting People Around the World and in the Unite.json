An astronaut recently captured video of objects in space of what he called cosmic fireflies.

But there`s more than meets the eye to this eye-popping celestial sight. Astronaut Don Pettit is no stranger to surreal scenes spotted from his orbiting ISS perch and shared to his socials. This latest trippy video could inspire all manner of astrophilosophical and existential questions if the true explanation wasn`t so vanilla. Pettit explained that what looks like cosmic fireflies are actually scores of Starlink satellites glinting and gleaming in the sun as they hover above the Earth. SpaceX has sent thousands of the internet communications satellites into orbit, with even more in the works, sparking a debate amongst some astronomers on what their impact may be on future celestial studies. In the meantime, though, hey, they sure are pretty. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Now, it`s no secret that production companies release their hit movies around the holidays and in the summer, but it turns out there`s an even more design behind releasing multiple blockbusters at the same time.

We`ve seen matching U.S. release dates in the past, including The Dark Knight and Mamma Mia, which was later coined The Dark Mama, Casino and Toy Story, and way back in the 1990s, 10 Things I Hate About You and The Matrix. So why do they do this? Well, in the movie biz, it`s called a counter- programming strategy. That`s when companies release their film the same time as a film that is tonally very different to target, on paper, two traditionally different audiences. But they can also feed off of each other, as we saw with Barbenheimer, allowing social media to do a lot of the marketing for the studios, making people want to be a part of the conversation. And there`s an economic aspect, too. In the 1930s, the double feature where you`d get to see two selected films with one ticket was created to attract moviegoers during the Great Depression.
