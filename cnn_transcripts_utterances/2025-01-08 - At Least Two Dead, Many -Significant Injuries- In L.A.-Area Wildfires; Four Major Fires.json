But I mean, it's been incredibly dry. There's no rain anticipated.Usually, you know, they pray for rain and something like this which will dampen things down. There's no rain. Last I heard from a weather forecaster anticipated for two weeks or so, at the very least. So I think obviously these are incredibly dry conditions. Obviously, they're going to have to look at the water situation in terms of the water pressure issues, certainly in the Palisades, because the way -- look at this. I mean -- this is sorry, Jake, but this is just -- I mean, this is now just really erupted. You can hear that, that crackling. And now it's a real question, just. Jake, I just want to show you some of. Look over here, this fire. Now, there's a small fire that spread to that hedge over there, that hedge will very likely then erupt, and that will very possibly ignite that house then. And it is this domino effect that we see. And again, it's largely, you know, it's pushed by the winds. But there's just -- the lack of water is a problem. In the Palisades, the water issue was, is according to authorities, is a gravity issue in order to get the water through the hydrants, up in the -- up in the hills, in the mountains, you know, they have these giant water tanks that use gravity. And those water tanks ran dry. Part of the problem is a lot of people are using hoses, trying to understandably hose down their lawns, hoping that will stop the fire. A lot of firefighters will say, that's not going to stop a fire like this from burning down your house. You may keep your lawn, but it's not going to keep your house. But you know, there's this huge water usage all of a sudden. And those tanks on the top, there may be water in the system down below, but if the tanks on the top run dry, there's not enough pressure for gravity to bring the water up into the hydrants. That's in the Palisades. I don't know the water system here in Altadena. But again, very concerned about this house now next door, these flames spreading. It's already destroyed, by the way, the block over. So it's not a question of more houses on that block being destroyed. They're already gone. They -- they burned down a long time ago. Something really just ignited inside this house. You can hear that kind of very distinctive sound that that it makes. It's also, Jake, I mean -- it's the middle of the day. I don't know what time it is, but it is like. It is, you know, 10:00 at night. You can't see the sun through, through, through -- peeks through. And as you said, Jake, there's a surrealness to it. I mean, I was in, you know, I woke up in a hotel in, I don't know, Hollywood area and looked out my window and you could see black smoke, but there was a Starbucks open. And, you know, people are going about their business. It's surreal. It's ominous seeing that in the sky, you drive 30 minutes and you know, you people aren't allowed in this area. Thankfully, it's all cordoned off, but 30 minutes away, there is this inferno and this entire neighborhood is just been devastated. It is -- it's hard to wrap your mind around it.",

That's another office building going up.This over here -- I mean, there is smoke and flames just every which way you look. I was here in the middle of the night last night as the embers were just flying on the wind. Since I was last here, all of this has been destroyed. And if you move around here, this used to be an Italian restaurant. This used to be the main street of Pacific Palisades, one of the most salubrious neighborhoods in the country. And, you know, because of the value of the property here, Jake, this could end up being one of the most expensive, one of the costliest wildfires that we have ever, ever seen. Now, as I said, we are in downtown Pacific Palisades now. Of course, many people have lost homes, over a thousand structures lost in this fire that will no doubt rise injuries. We are also getting some confirmation of a few injuries. Those figures will keep on trickling in. But the next question is how does this community come back? Both of their grocery stores burned down, their theater, burned down, their library burned down, a bunch of the schools burned down. And of course, all of those homes. And it's not over. This wind is still pretty high. We are still seeing embers. We are still seeing flames getting whipped by these strong Santa Ana winds, which peaked in the early hours of the morning. Now, everybody here knew that the Santa Ana winds were coming. So we knew that there was going to be some issue. Now, city and county officials prepared for maybe 1 or 2 fires. The problem is we've had four major fires here in the Los Angeles area. That is really stretching the authorities to about 250 firefighters on this fire, about 30 departments from around California here to help. But still, that's not enough. And it's a very difficult environment in which to fight the fires, particularly up in the hills. And also the problem is for a long period of time, they weren't able to get any air assets up in the air. They couldn't get the choppers, they couldn't get the fixed wing aircraft that drop retardant drop water. So it was people on the ground sweating through 24 hour shifts, 48 hour shifts, trying to contain this blaze. Jake, it's not over. And this will leave scars in this community for decades.

We're seeing house after house going up in flames as these this fire jumps over streets, jumps over highways and ends up going through neighborhoods like this one at the foothills of the Angeles national forest. That's how this fire got here in the first place. These engines, they're doing so much work of just following around these flames and trying to pin down. We saw earlier I spoke to a woman who had come back from being away about 24 hours, where she was told to leave her house. She comes back and it's gone. It's up in flames. There's no hope at this point for so many people. But we have also seen, Jake, this is something really beautiful that we've seen in this community, is volunteers coming up right over here. We have some of them clearing some of the brush, hoping that this will help keep the fire from spreading any further. We also spoke to some volunteers who are just going into people's properties, turning on their garden hoses and just swapping the whole house, getting that water into the walls, hoping to keep the fire from spreading into more of these homes. But firefighters have, in some of those instances, told us then it's too late. Get out. We want to make sure that you are in a safe place, 10,600 acres. This fire has just ballooned in this community and people were caught off guard. And it goes to show how important it is to heed those warnings.

So there are places for people to go. And I've even heard of community groups trying to find more permanent housing for people who need housing, as well as emergency shelters. So people are taking it on themselves to take care of their neighbors. And also the cities are prepared to -- but let's be clear, we have hundreds of people losing their homes, and we are having tens of thousands of people under evacuation orders. That's a lot of housing to have to find for -- for our residents. This is a fire that is ringing Los Angeles. And I want to be clear that its not the kind of fires that we've sometimes seen in the past in California that are more remote, that are in more rural areas or up in the mountains. This is in fairly central Los Angeles. These are very dense communities of many, many homes. So when these fires go into a community, it's not a house here separated by an acre and another home. These are homes that are right next to each other. And that's why these fires are so hard to contain, because there's very little to stop them from going from climbing onto the fuel from home to home. Now, California has done a lot, and I've done a lot of work, when I was an assembly member to try to make communities more resilient. So California has done more than most other places when it comes to fire, because we have seen massive fires around Los Angeles.

So now that we know there's a chopper here in the sky, we know that there's fire one, two, three and four, I've seen that on flightradar24. They are in the air. They will be able to start the air attack because now for I don't know, it must be 15 hours, there hasn't been an air attack. There's been no water, no Phos-Chek being dropped and everything was on the ground. So now that we have the winds dying off a little bit, now it's just enough to get those firefighters in the air, dropping water and really helping out the entire situation, as the winds continue to blow. But they're no longer 60 or 70. They're 20, 30 and 40. Yes, we have four big fires well over 25,000 acres combined. So the winds from the 30s down to the 20s tonight and even overnight down by tomorrow morning, still down even lower than that, likely only in the teens.

You can't project for months ahead in polling, but we know what polling was on Election Day, which and Joe Biden had a 40 percent approval rating.

It wasn't on Montana, but I kept going up to sunset, and that's where I started videotaping the planes, dropping water, and it looked pretty bad, but it looked like they had it because they it was different from the Woolsey Fire. The planes were up right away, and there were a lot of them, and they were doing a phenomenal job. So I thought things were going to be fine, and it turns out things were not fine. And -- and I got a few text messages. I'm sort of in a rescue organization. I work with Eastwood Ranch Foundation, which is Allison Eastwood's Dog and Cat Rescue and Adoption. So I've been doing this for a long time. I did it in the Woolsey Fires. I went into the fires and rescued some horses, some pigs, and a tortoise. So I kind of feel comfortable doing it. I want to stay out of everybody's way, of course. But -- so I drove in there and -- and it was, it was, it was, it was, it was -- it was crazy. I've never seen anything like it. And I was in the Palisades trying to look in windows to see if there were any pets in there, because people were like in a complete panic, the fire and the smoke. The fire was bad, obviously, but the smoke was overwhelming. It was just -- you couldn't -- you couldn't stay in it.",

      "sentences": "Well, that's an interesting story. So not -- not so much success. And, you know, I -- when I -- by the time it took a long time, believe it or not, to get from -- to get from the village of Pacific Palisades to those houses where I was looking around down on to where I was asked to go to next, which is the RV center. The RV, sort of the -- the homes, the mobile homes, the modular homes on PCH, just -- just south of Sunset.But there are a lot of police and barriers. So it was very tricky. It took a couple of hours. Unfortunately, by the time I got there, the fire was raging and I got trapped on PCH. I couldn't go north or south because it was so hot going in either direction that I had to go to a parking lot on the beach, thank God. And -- and I waited there and I tried to cross to go into the RV. It was just out of control and the firemen weren't doing anything. Not that they could, by the way. And I just want to respond to your reporter when he said that there was no water. The other issue is because I talked to the firemen all night last night is a lot of people were using the water on their homes, which is a good intention, but so many people were using the water to spray down their roofs that they lost the, you know, the water pressure. So the best thing to do is, is probably not to do that.",

I'm Jake Tapper, and we are following two major stories this hour.The first was on Capitol Hill, where this evening, President-elect Donald Trump is going to meet behind closed doors with Senate Republicans. There are 53 Senate Republicans now. They have the majority, and they are the very lawmakers who will ultimately decide whether President-elect Trump gets his cabinet picks confirmed. Our teams are spread across the capitol. We're going to check in with them in moments, but we're going to start with our lead story and the incredible grim scenes on the West Coast, four wildfires burning out of control in and around Los Angeles. New images showing incredibly large flames burning right now in Altadena, California. These flames, fueled by these strong winds, gusts of up to 100 miles per hour, and homes, cars and businesses reduced to ash in just minutes. The flames spreading so fast that fire hydrants are running out of water. At least two people have been killed. Fire officials say there are, quote, significant number of people injured. And the Los Angeles County fire chief says there are simply not enough firefighters to contain these blazes. CNN anchor Anderson Cooper is on the scene in Altadena, California, right now near the Eaton Fire. Anderson, what we saw from you there about an hour ago was -- was heartbreaking. Homes just going up in flames seconds after seconds. How widespread are those flames?",
