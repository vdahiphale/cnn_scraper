Ivan Watson has more from Taipei. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) IVAN WATSON, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Just before 8:00 a.m. on Wednesday, the ground in Taiwan starts to shake. The island rocked by the most powerful earthquake to hit Taiwan in a quarter century. In the capital, Taipei, CNN Photojournalist John Mees tries to protect his wife and children as the walls of their home lurch back and forth. An earthquake has just hit, announces the anchor of this morning news show, as she struggles to stay on her feet. But the worst damage is at the epicenter, in the rugged mountains of Hualien County on the island's east coast. The 7.4 magnitude earthquake triggers massive landslides. Authorities say several people were killed by falling rocks. In the town of Hualien, apartment buildings on the verge of collapse, emergency workers in action. Authorities say they've rescued scores of people from toppled buildings and highway tunnels. But more than 900 people have been injured, and rescue teams are still trying to reach others trapped high in the mountains. The work has continued in Hualien throughout the night. No one's left inside this building, says this firefighter. He adds, people are frightened. There are constant earthquakes here, says this woman. I've lived here 50 years and never felt one so big. It's really scary. People in Taiwan are accustomed to feeling the earth shake, but rarely with this much destructive force. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And to stop all of that when there's such huge need, a need at a scale that I think is hard for the world to comprehend, that's the difficult part, deciding to put a pause on that essential need that we were delivering in large volumes, very hard. On the other hand, it was not a hard decision because our staff said they couldn't do it anymore. They couldn't go on. And to hear our staff, who for six months had never stopped, had never wavered, had responded immediately after October 7th, knowing what was coming and had never stopped and were always in danger and had close calls and we had bullets go through the windows of our shelter, and then we had our colleague killed just over -- just under four weeks ago in his home, in a shelter that had been deconflicted with the Israeli authorities on more than one occasion, including four days before the bomb that killed him. And so, for them to say, no, no, no, we have to stop. We have to pause. We can't go on. That was a strong reaction to people they knew and worked with and cared for and loved being killed but also, I think, the sense of -- the senselessness of it and the illogic of it and that just made them say, we can't keep doing this.

In the World Central Kitchen convoy, two of the three cars were armored cars. They had security consultants they had hired with them. That didn't save them. That didn't protect them. The only thing that really does make sense is the deconfliction. And deconfliction is a process that is used in these situations around the world and usually works. International NGOs have direct contact with the military, with the fighting forces to be able to say, these are our people, this is where they're working, this is where they're living, this is where our distribution center is, these are our cars. And all of that had been done by us and by World Central Kitchen. And so, it is incumbent on the Israeli authorities to build up that trust. And I am heartened to see that the world is asking for that and particularly countries of the nationals who were lost are demanding that, they're demanding independent investigations, they're demanding -- or if they're not demanding independent investigations, they should be, they're all demanding investigations. I think they need to be independent investigations and they want assurances. And I think it's incumbent on Israel to tell us all how they are going to provide security and safety and assurances that we can continue to do our humanitarian aid work. And this is about humanity. The war is separate. In any war, the civilians are protected, humanitarian work needs to go on so that people aren't starving to death in the middle of a war.",

More than $60 million was spent, all told by all sides, in this proxy, and it goes to show you what was at stake in the battle, the potential direction and strategy for Disney and Bob Iger's own tenure at the company. But this was a legacy defining victory for Bob. And according to a source familiar with the initial numbers, they won by quite a bit. Bob Iger's seat on the board was approved by 94 percent of shareholders. Nelson Peltz's seats, he only got 31 percent vote. So, he was losing by a margin of 2 to 1 to the Disney pick. And Pelter's partner in this, Jay Rasulo, who was a former Disney executive who was also up for a seat, he lost by even more, by more than a 5 to 1 margin. And those retail investors, you know, Disney has an unusually high proportion of its and of its shareholders to be kind of your regular, everyday person. So, more than 35 percent of their shareholders are these retail investors. They overwhelmingly voted for the Disney slate. 75 percent voted them for it. The source familiar also calling this as Peltz's biggest loss in a proxy fight. Of course, Peltz has done these sort of proxy fights in the past. Now, we heard there from Bob Iger calling this a distracting proxy contest now behind us. Try in for their part, they sort took credit, they said, for Disney stock going up 50 percent in the last six months. They saying that it was their re-engagement, their sort of kicking the tires that caused Disney to rev up their plans. But all of the things that Nelson Peltz had criticized about Disney, about what he wants to see changed, these are things Disney has identified and say they're working on. And it's not necessarily surprising that shareholders wouldn't go for a guy who has no media experience over somebody like Bob Iger. But again, these problems that Disney is facing, you know, trying to get a profit on their streaming business, trying reinvigorate their studios after a few flops, and then of course the question of succession. Who is going to take over for Bob Iger? They've had these promises of success in the past with Bob Chapek. So, they need to figure out who will take over from Bob Iger. They need turn the profit on the streaming. They needed to get their films back on track. And Bob Iger, in this presentation, said they're doing that and he talked about their new investment in Fortnite, talked about getting ESPN on Disney+, talking about, you know, going back to sort of their basics, back their characters, doing sequels of huge successes like \"Moana.\" So, now, for Disney, they need to prove to their investors that their vote was the right one.",

And again, I'll use the word, the authenticity. That's hard come by. I mean, you've got access to places in Tokyo.

And so, we only dealt -- we had many Yakuza advisers, but they were all officially ex-Yakuza. They had certificates that showed they had either left or been excommunicated from the gang that they were a part of. And we still got a lot of inside info. And also, Jake Adelstein, who wrote the memoir and who's the character that Ansel plays, has spent a lot of time in the trenches with the Yakuza. And he has had a lot of contact, I'll say.

So, I've opened up a cellar door. I've got a little urban winery going now. I do lots of events. I sell into restaurants and bars.

And so, I'm finding that there's -- I feel, personally, there'll probably be a little of a pipe fill happen. So, initially, I'll be able to get back into the market, hopefully, within the next four, five weeks, you know, start shipping containers over there. And then after that, I think we'll see. It might settle down a little bit as, you know, people start to find their feet in the new dynamics of the market. You know, as you said, there's an economic slowdown in China at the moment. So, we'll see. However, that said, I really feel that I'm going to approach the market differently this time. You know, this is what's given me an opportunity of not being there for three and a half years. You sort of think, well, how could I do it better? And what would I want to change from last time?
