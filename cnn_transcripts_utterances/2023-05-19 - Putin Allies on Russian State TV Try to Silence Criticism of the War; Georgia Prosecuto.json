      "sentences": "OUTFRONT next, a fiery blast tears through a Russian base. A strike deep in Russian occupied territory, as Putin sets his sights on Americans, targeting 500 of them tonight, including me.Plus, a man tells a joke about two dogs and a squirrel gets a $2 million fine and could be headed to prison. What is happening? And police said the Utah mom accused of killing her husband and then writing a children's book about her grief went after her sister-in- law, punching her in the face while trying to get into her husband's safe. New details. Let's go OUTFRONT. Good evening, I'm Erin Burnett. OUTFRONT tonight, strike on a Russian base. New video into OUTFRONT tonight, this is a fiery blast on a Russian base. You will see the mass explosion there, right? Well, the ball of fire that you see there is inside the Russian occupied city of Mariupol. This is according to Ukrainian officials, and that base where that struck is home to at least 150 Russian soldiers. Now, Mariupol has been an important staging ground for Russian forces, and the reason for that is it's been occupied. It's been outside Ukraine's shooting range. It's been safe from attack for months. But thanks to the powerful new missiles from the U.K., it is now in Ukraine's crosshairs. Ukraine's military also posted a video. This is a drone. They say it only cost $1,000. They show it taking on a Russian tank, which is valued at more than $1 million. And tonight, what could be a turning point in this war, here we are in May 2023, and the United States finally giving the go ahead for its allies to provide Ukraine with F-16 fighter jets. This is a big development. It is what Zelenskyy has been begging for repeatedly for months, and months. He does have support from Democrats, and Republicans on Capitol Hill. Meanwhile in Russia, Putin now taking new and more extreme measures against Americans. A statement on Russian's ministry of foreign affairs website reads, and I quote: U.S. citizens under personal sanctions including a ban on entry into the Russian Federation. And it goes on to list 500 people submit to that, including me. The Russian government also issued a warning with this announcement, and it says, quote, not a single hostile attack against Russia will go without a strong reaction. That is why covering this war every night matters, and we will continue to do it, because something supremely important to all of us is happening in the Ukraine, and also inside Russia, where tonight, Putin's allies are turning on their own, and telling those who are critical of Putin's war to be quiet. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator): All of these panicking alarmists can stick it where the sun doesn't shine. They should calm down, once and for all. MARGARITA SIMONYAN, HEAD OF RT (through translator): Sure, sometimes we make wonders. But who doesn't? How about we support our own and keep the criticism in your own kitchen. (END VIDEO CLIP)",
