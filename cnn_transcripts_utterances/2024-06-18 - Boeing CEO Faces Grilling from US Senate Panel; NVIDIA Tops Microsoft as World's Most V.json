It made the share price much moreaccessible to retail investors, and I think we are seeing that retail investors continue to be very interested in this company. It is interesting since this AI boom, NVIDIA has really become more of a household name because it really is powering this revolution in technology. You saw CEO, Jensen Huang really get the superstar rockstar treatment when he was in Taiwan last month and I think that is just a sign of how much more recognizable this company now is and as a result, how much more you might see retail investors really being interested in this company and buying the stock. Again, stock is up 11 percent since that stock split happened just about a week ago. And so I think it is justified too, because look, this company still has very little competition when it comes to these semiconductors that are powering AI technology. We've seen all of the big tech companies they are investing billions of dollars in AI infrastructure, and so as much as this company's growth has been insane over the last couple of months, there is still so much more runway for this company to go.",

There are also some other hurdles. Export restrictions to China have taken a hit to that key market, and we are also going to see NVIDIA start to lap the year ago when it really started to see sales take off. And so its sales growth isn't going to look as big, which is really just a cosmetic thing, but it may end up affecting the share price. But I think what is clear is that this is still really the beginning of this AI revolution. We are still only in the early stages. And the most important thing at this point is for these big tech companies to be building out data centers that can process the data that's necessary to build out these AI software tools.

O'Carroll says Kim's wish list for Putin could include advanced Russian fighter jets, ballistic missile, and spy satellite expertise, sending North Korean workers to Russia, generating critical revenue. The two are expected to sign a new strategic partnership replacing previous agreements from 1961 and nearly a quarter century ago when Putin last traveled to Pyongyang a few months into his presidency. Analysts say North Korea may have been an afterthought to the Russian leadership back then. O'Carroll says times have changed. What do you think Kim Jong-un is getting right now?
