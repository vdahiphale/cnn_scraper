It was hit by a bank run and a capital crisis as well as rapid rising interest rates. The failure sent bank stocks plummeting customers withdrew a whopping $42 billion in deposits by the end of Thursday. In Massachusetts, customers were turned away from accessing their cash and were told to come back on Monday. Deposits are insured by the FDIC up to $250,000. The FDIC said all insured depositors will have full access to their insured deposits by no later than Monday morning. And it would pay uninsured depositors a, quote, \"advanced dividend within the next week.\" But for corporations, it's a different story. For instance, Roku held approximately $487 million, a quarter of its cash at SVB. And Roku said most of its deposits with the bank are uninsured. Could this the second biggest U.S. financial institution failure since the crisis of 2008 lead to a larger systemic failure? That is this week's poll question. If you go to smerconish.com and cast a ballot, and I hope that you will, is the failure of Silicon Valley Bank an isolated event or will there be broader financial contagion? Joining me now to discuss is Aaron Klein, a Senior Fellow at the Brookings Institution and former Deputy Assistant Secretary for Economic Policy at the Treasury Department. Thanks so much for being here, Aaron. What's your answer to this week's poll question, isolated or more contagion? AARON KLEIN, SR. FELLOW, BROOKINGS INSTITUTE/ FMR. DEP. ASST. SECRETARY, U.S. TREASURY DEPT.: Well, look, I don't think this is the type of contagion that's going to lead to a horrible disease that's going to bring down the financial system as we saw in 2007 and in '08. However, I'm not sure it's completely an isolated incident either. Look, Silicon Valley Bank isn't the first bank to go under this week. Silvergate, a smaller bank that had leaned heavily into crypto self- liquidated and went down a few days earlier, there are a couple more dominoes that could fall. So, I'm not sure this is a completely isolated one-off event. But I also think the regulators have been telling us that the contagion from crypto is contained within parts of our financial system. And Silicon Valley Bank is big, but it's not like other banks of its size, the large regional banks, so they have a different business model.",

Those banks are about the same size, but they have about 1000 branches, Silicon Valley only had 16 branches. Despite being the 16th largest bank in America, how could that be? Well, they didn't take that much money from regular consumers. They took it more from companies.They banked startups. And as those startups got bigger, they kept those relationships. You mentioned Roku who is a perfect example of something like that. So, companies tend to have money in excess of deposit insurance. Whereas ordinary Americans, regular viewers rarely have more than $250,000 in the bank account. Frankly, a lot of Americans would be happy to have $250,000 period among all their assets.",

Data shows more than a million Americans go to Mexico every year for medical tourism. And the Mexican government says medical tourism brought in over $137 million in 2021.In fact, it's so common there that these dedicated traffic lane at the San Diego, Tijuana border designed to speed American medical tourists into Mexico. These people are traveling to what's known as Mexico's health clusters. That's where dental procedures cosmetic procedures fertility treatments, even veterinary care are typically cheaper than in the United States on average. Americans can save up to 60 percent on the most common procedures received by medical tourists in Mexico. The more frequented and reliable destinations are Mexico City, Cancun and Tijuana. There's also an area in Mexico near Yuma, Arizona known as Molar City for the 300 dental offices there. But Matamoros is not considered a primary medical travel destination mainly because there are no internationally accredited medical centers or specialty clinics there or in the immediate region. But that is where this group of American friends were so that one of them could get a tummy tuck. The procedure typically costs about $9,000 in the United States, but it's half that price in Mexico. Other examples include a tooth implant with an acrylic crown that would cost $3,400 in the U.S., but it's less than $1,700 in Mexico, a coronary artery bypass would be $73,000 here, it's a little more than 27,000 there. Overall, up to 70 percent of the medical tourism trips to Mexico are for dental care, 15 percent are for cosmetic care, 5 percent are for weight loss surgeries. The remaining 10 percent are for a variety of procedures led by orthopedic care. As for security, there are shuttles provided for patients crossing at the Texas border, although many Americans prefer to arrive by private car so that they can shop and dine at the restaurants. Officials also say that there are federal security forces to guard the Medical District in addition to state and local police. The founder of the group Patients Beyond Borders says that since the kidnappings, he's been inundated by requests from people seeking medical care across the border and not expressed any concern about the violence there because the risks are just astronomically low. Joining me now is Katy Moreau. She lives in Texas near the border and has seen the practice firsthand. Katy, tell me about what you know of this. KATY MOREAU. LIVES NEAR MEXICAN BORDER: Hey, good morning, Michael. It's not a weird thing for anybody in the surrounding communities to Matamoros on this side of the border or on the other to go there for dental surgeries, for dental work, such as fillings. It's pretty normal. Everybody does it. It's a lot more affordable than it is here in the States. And honestly, a lot of the dentists that work there have gotten their education and their certifications here in the United States and just chose to run their business in their home of Matamoros.",

Also the day, more importantly, that MH370 disappeared, which marked the start of one of the biggest aviation mysteries of all time. The plane carried 239 passengers and crew members. It was set to arrive in Beijing that morning after departing from Kuala Lumpur but has never been seen since.Coverage of MH370 then took over our air waves and everybody else's for months after that. And yet despite launching the largest aviation search in history, virtually nothing was found of the aircraft. Theories on how a plane could vanish into thin air have gripped the world for almost a decade, but so far none have been proven. Now, Netflix is streaming a brand new three-episode docuseries. It's called \"MH370, The Plane That Disappeared\" investigating the still unsolved mystery. Jeff Wise is an aviation journalist who plays an important role in the Netflix series. He's the author of the book \"The Taking of MH370.\" I invested the three hours in the Netflix show. I'm not sorry that I did. I learned a heck of a lot. But at the end, Jeff, we still don't know. JEFF WISE, AVIATION JOURNALIST/AUTHOR, \"THE TAKING OF MH370\": We still don't know, Michael. And I think that's the point. You know, in the months that followed, the investigators performed this intricate mathematical calculation that told them where the plane went. And they devoted a year's long search to scanning the seabed really challenging amazing feat the water there is as deep as three miles. And they cover an area the size of Great Britain and yet the plane was not there. And so, this is really, I think, what the documentary series is trying to tackle with. How do we reconcile those facts? How can they have performed this really rigorous mathematical analysis and yet failed to find the plane? What could have happened?

Maybe we'll answer together. Put it up on the screen, Catherine. I'll read it aloud. If Trump runs third-party and he gains enough electoral votes to block the others from hitting 270, then it goes to the House and Trump could win outright. Jason, your thought?",
