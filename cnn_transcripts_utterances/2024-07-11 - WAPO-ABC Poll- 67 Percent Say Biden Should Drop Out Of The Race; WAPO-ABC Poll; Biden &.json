A team of top Biden campaign officials are headed to the Hill today to hold a special meeting with Senate Democrats to try and calm their nerves. CNN's Lauren Fox is tracking all of this for us.And that's not even to add in all this going on, still among House Democrats, Lauren. What are you learning?",

      "sentences": "Yes, there's really been this slow drip of Democrats coming out one by one every couple of hours through the course of the last four days saying that they believe that Biden should step aside. Right now that number is right around nine members who have said that Biden should no longer be the candidate in this race. And last night, we got the very first United States senator saying that -- Peter Welch of Vermont wrote in an op- ed, \"We need him to put us first, as he has done this before. I urge him to do it now.\" He wrote that, of course, and an op-ed in \"The Washington Post.\"But it just highlights, Kate, that so many members right now are paralyzed about how to move forward. There's a small number who have come out publicly, but there are many more who have publicly said that they hope Biden makes the right decision, despite the fact that Biden has made explicitly clear that he has decided to stick and stay in this race as the nominee for president. And I think that that is really Democrats trying to give him some kind of bridge to reconsider at this point. And that's really what you saw yesterday with Nancy Pelosi's comments on \"Morning, Joe.\" And then her subsequent statement, she repeated that she hopes that Biden can make the decision quickly despite the fact that Biden has already decided. I think, Kate, that this is a complicated moment because members aren't sure whether or not they should continue to voice these concerns. So publicly knowing that if Biden ultimately stays in this race, it could potentially put him at a disadvantage against Donald Trump. I think that that ABC poll this morning is really important. But it also is a good reminder that these state by state polls are going to matter to members who are running for reelection in places like Montana, states like Ohio. You've already heard that Sherrod Brown and Jon Tester privately in that discussion on Tuesday's lunch, said that they didn't think Biden could win. I think that these factors are all going into this race. And it's going to be really interesting to see whether or not the Biden officials, campaign officials who come to lunch today, whether they can change anyone's mind, because I will tell you, there are still a lot of doubts.

Sixty-two percent of Democrats and Democratic leaning voters say he should drop out. Even 54 percent of Biden supporters, Joe, say he should drop out.What do you make of these numbers? What does that tell you? This can't just be a least, there are 54 percent of a least in the country to fill that number right now, Joe?",

That's why he's still in a dead heat with Donald Trump. And the reason for that, I think is, you know, in a different poll 53 percent -- majority of Americans were asked who's a threat to democracy, Trump or Biden, it was Trump, a majority said Trump. Fifty-three percent of Independents said Trump was a threat to the -- to democracy.So what obviously is going on here, we've known for some time that the case against Trump is he's a threat to democracy, the case of the people been making and concerns about Biden has been his age. It's been a dead he with both those questions. Certainly the debate raised the questions about Biden up. But still in most of the national polls, because I think we are frozen in that kind of frame of the race, it's not changing much. So I agree. The next thing here is, look, one of the things -- I don't think the press conference today is going to change much at all, either. What I do think we'll either ratchet up the pressure on the President will be what these, as members are now polling in their districts and in the states, what we're just talking about, those polls are coming back. No one was pulling over July 4 weekend, you can't do that. I mean it's like throw off the numbers. So I think what a lot of them have done is waited till after the post July 4 gone into the field. [07:35:13] And those polls are all coming back now. And I would not -- you know, that's what's going to be reflected in this lunch today. And when -- you know, and either the pressure ratchets up that those polls come back showing big erosion. Or do they show the same thing that the race is basically stayed the same?",

If you look, there's an ABC News poll earlier this year, again, two thirds or so 70 percent folks said he was too old. I don't think there was as much of a vote or reckoning with the debate and might have calcified what they thought and maybe there's some new people, the Biden voters you talk about suddenly thrown into a panic. But I don't think all of a sudden it was a massive surprise to a lot of people that they're paying attention.And I also think, though, that Joe's right, I think what you're seeing is folks going out of the field, Monday and Tuesday, got their results late Tuesday night, Wednesday morning, and this is where the panic started. But I guess my point is this, right, if Democrats really truly feel, right, that democracy hinges on this one election, then why are they putting up the 81-year-old man who is clearly diminished and who is working from 10 to four, essentially, according to Axios, right? Their words, their actions don't match. And so, if they change out, maybe that might say something, but right now it doesn't.",

That's not how the Democratic Party works. No one's playing -- no one's going, you know, doubts, raising the issue, raising doubts and voicing, your seeing that, nine members and senator have already called on Biden to step aside.That's -- I think that's healthy. I think this is a healthy party having a real debate about the future of the party. And I do -- but look, there's only one person, Joe Biden, the sides of this. Either way, I believe the party will unify and move on. And yes, we have a big strong bench. And I -- you know, but again, we can all speculate this is going to -- I think in the few -- next few days, you're going to see either an increase in pressure as these polls come back and people under -- members of Congress, the senators understand exactly what the implications are and decide to openly -- you know, to ratchet up the tension. Or do we see it subside as it turns out like the national polls, that nothing really has changed? I don't have an answer to that. But I do -- but I'm not really concerned either way. I think we're showing -- Democrats are showing the country what it's like to have an actual party that's not afraid of its leader. You don't have to worry about getting on a list. Joe Biden's not going to come back and get revenge on you like Trump will. No one is -- you know, Matt, and everybody can talk about this, but they're not out there. They're not going to tell you that Trump's not fit to be president. Why? Because who the hell wants to be on that list of Donald Trump.

Grier, as you noted, she pleaded guilty to carrying ammunition into the Turks and Caicos earlier this year. She was visiting the British Overseas Territory from Orlando, Florida. And just like the other Americans that were arrested, she claimed that she had no idea that she had ammunition in her luggage.Now under the previous law, the mandatory minimum was 12 years in prison, though judges, they had the discretion to find what they called, quote, \"exceptional circumstances in departing from the sentencing guidelines,\" which is what happened with the previous cases involving the other Americans. Now in response to all of this criticism over all of these arrests, lawmakers in Turks and Caicos they amended the law last month to say that courts have the discretion to impose either a fine, a custodial sentencing or a mix of both. Grier again is expected in court later this morning. And if the proceedings play out just like the other cases, Sara, she could be back in the U.S. as early as later today.",

But now we've seen him crash, and therefore we all need to see him go a foot higher than he ever did before. It's a hard standard to beat between that. And they say that the Ukrainians are grateful but unhappy with the level of support they're getting. They didn't get a pathway to NATO with certain dates that they could hit a timeline.They didn't get multiyear funding that they were hoping for, just a pledge for 43 billion a year or so just for the coming year. And everything that they're getting, they feel could be undone, depending on how the U.S. presidential race goes.

We can't say, hey, we want to be close to European nations and at the same time support an illegal and a criminal war by Russia within Europe.So it is devastating that the secretary general said this, but it's something that a lot of folks have known for a very long time and then in the intelligence community.",
