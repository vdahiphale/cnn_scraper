Seen by some as more comparatively moderate, mostly in Doha in recent months, but involved in negotiations with the United States. So a kind of bifurcation of Hamas leadership to some degree, but one that didn't make a distinction in terms of who Israel said they were necessarily going to hit. ANDERSONNick, you raise a really important point about where we stand with regard to the region at present. You and I spoke earlier, and I think it's worth bringing up again, that Lloyd Austin has said overnight, the U.S. defense minister, that he doesn't see a regional escalation as inevitable at this point. What he hasn't said is it's not going to happen. He's just said it's not inevitable at this point.",

But ultimately, he's on the same talking points as he was yesterday.The big question in all of this is, did the U.S. have foreknowledge? Did they end possibly in some way assist? That would seem unlikely. They're certainly making it clear publicly, it seems at this stage, that that's not the case. And where does this leave U.S. traction in the region, period? They were calling for de-escalation prior to the strike on southern Beirut against the key Hezbollah commander. Now we're seeing an unprecedented attack on a Hamas political figure inside of Tehran itself, really pushing the envelope of quite what Israel has done so far, if indeed it was Israel at this point, but all fingers pointing in that direction. And so, are the U.S. simply finding their calls not being returned anymore by Benjamin Netanyahu after his recent visit? Is he just pursuing his own direction? Or is there something else at play here which we don't yet fully understand? But, you know, situations like this, it's very possible to think that the worst is ultimately unavoidable. But we've seen in previous months, people pull back. I think the utter humanitarian catastrophe of a Hezbollah-Israel war would be so devastating for both Israelis and Lebanese, and I think both sides there are exceptionally anxious to avoid it. No one's going to be a winner from it. It's not going to get the Israelis back into their homes in northern Israel by the beginning of the school year, even if it started now. It's just simply not going to happen. And so, yes, we're in a place where Iran will clearly feel pressure to respond in some way or other, but exactly how this went down will dictate the nature of that, as will also, too, their capabilities. They're not a 10-foot-tall giant walking around the region. You know, they didn't manage to get through with missiles and drones in April, and that will probably linger in the back of their minds.",

      "sentences": "It certainly represents an escalation of the likes of which we have not seen in a long time. Now, yesterday, just before 8 p.m. local time here in Beirut, Fuad Shukr, the military, senior military commander with Hezbollah, seems to have been assassinated, although Hezbollah hasn't actually confirmed that. And that was already a notching up of tensions, but certainly the assassination in Tehran of Ismail Haniyeh definitely represents just one more step to the edge of the abyss.And before, you were talking with Nick about the U.S. talking about they don't think there's going to be a regional war. I don't think they would have said that if they had known that Ismail Haniyeh was going to be assassinated in Tehran. This certainly does represent a notching up of tensions that we haven't seen yet. Now, Hezbollah has commented on the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh, describing him as one of the great resistance leaders of our present era. They go on to say: We in Hezbollah share with our dear brothers in the Hamas movement all the feelings of pain over the loss of this great leader, the feelings of anger at the enemy's crimes. Now, of course, we shall see what the response will be. Now, in 2004, the Israelis assassinated Sheikh Ahmed Yassin, who was the founder and the spiritual leader of Hamas. I was in Gaza at the time. Everyone anticipated some sort of massive response by Hamas, but they did relatively little. But that was 2004. That was 20 years ago. And I think if you look the broad -- take a broad view of the region, you have this horrendous ongoing war in Gaza, which has left more than 40,000 people dead. You have tensions on the Lebanese-Israeli border higher than they've ever been before. You've had the Houthis, who've successfully interfered with international navigation in the Red Sea. They've been able to fire a deadly drone all the way to Tel Aviv. You have Iranian-backed militias in Syria and Iraq ready to fire at U.S. forces in that area. And now you have Iran mortally offended that Israel has assassinated the head of the political leader of Hamas in the capital, Tehran. All of this adds up to a scenario where it's hard to imagine a positive outcome. As we've been reporting now for days, for months, neither side, Israel or Hezbollah, can afford really wants an all-out war. But we are at the point where there is a minefield of miscalculations through which everyone is walking, including the United States, which has been active in fairly passive diplomacy, not using all its leverage, all its power, to bring this conflict somehow to an end 10 months in. And it's just getting worse, and it's getting more dangerous, and it doesn't appear there's going to be a ceasefire in Gaza, which is really key to bringing the tensions to an end. Hezbollah has made it clear it will stop firing at Israel as soon as there is a ceasefire in Gaza. We saw they made good on that back in November of last year during that brief period during which more than 100 Israeli hostages were released in exchange for the release of Palestinian prisoners and detainees. So the solution is there. The problem is those who can actually make it happen aren't doing their job -- Max.",

      "sentences": "Well, certainly, there seems to be serious lapses in the security of Hezbollah, which is normally pretty good, as well as Iran. So clearly, the Israelis have a level of intelligence and an ability to reach targets. I mean, Beirut's not far from Israel, but Tehran is a long way away, and their ability to make such a pinpoint strike in the capital of Iran and also finding where Fuad Shukr was precisely yesterday, just before 8 p.m. local time, is quite an achievement.Now, having said that, let's not forget October 7th. It was a massive Israeli intelligence failure where for days they were unable to retake control of the border area around Gaza. So it's a mixed picture. And in terms of Israel's military abilities, it's one thing to do a pinpoint strike in Tehran, assassinating a Hamas leader, quite an accomplishment. It's another full-scale war, for instance, with Hezbollah. We have seen over the last 10 months that Hezbollah has military capabilities that even the Israelis were surprised at. They've been able to shoot down top-of-the-line Israeli drones. They've been able to disable much of the surveillance equipment that Israel has along its borders. They've been able to, in some instances, disable the Iron Dome system or Iron Dome batteries and also anti- drone defenses. And the Israelis themselves acknowledge Hezbollah has more than 150,000 missiles and rockets at their disposal, and they've only used a tiny fraction of them. So their intelligence, the Israelis, chapeau. But Hezbollah has real ability to inflict intense pain on Israel in the event of a full-scale war -- Becky. ANDERSON: Ben Wedeman is in Beirut.

And many people will tell you this is the guy who was, you know, they were leaning into to help find some sort of compromise on the deal.

And so, you know, one school of thought says basically, you know, the guy was hoping to help solve, you know, seal a deal has gone. The other school of thought says, and so therefore the deal is gone. And this was something that was, you know, some momentum for this in Rome just earlier this week. Others will say Benjamin Netanyahu has got a win out of this, assassinating, the Israelis aren't admitting to it as of yet, but the alleged assassination of the Hamas leader gives him a win.
