Very good news there.This is the slowest inflation for producers in more than two years. Almost back to where we were before this inflation crisis began. This is important progress.

So we don't always feel like we're caught off guard slamming the panic button to try to keep up with the latest iterations in artificial intelligence. And instead, a year or two ago, when research into these systems was starting to become a lot more prevalent, we could start to measure the potential disruption, the guardrails that should be applied, give institutions like academia, which tends to move a little bit slower, the chance to catch up and reformulate curriculums. And then, of course, for things like safety, our watermarks on AI generated content a possibility. What AI detection tools could be helpful? Do we have those in newsrooms?

So, the Major League Baseball Houston Astros home park, Minute Maid Park, the alcohol sales for last year were $28.4 million. Now that was across about 95 major events in 2022. But the vast majority of those were, in fact, baseball games. There were a few concerts in there as well. But 28.4 million gives you an idea that booze is a big sale point for baseball teams, right? So, the traditional rules was that you only sell through the end of the seventh inning. But the MLB's new pitch clock has made seven innings end about 24 minutes shorter, quicker, on average, right? So, what are some teams doing? Well, they're now going to sell alcohol until the eighth inning. That gets back about 75 percent of the time of lost sales, right, because of the faster games. And -- but by my estimate, that might make teams at most about a few extra million dollars. But, you know, obviously, that perhaps could lead to more people out on the roads, right, Poppy?",

So last year with the seventh inning cut off and the 2022 game time it was about 42 minutes. Now, with the 2023 game timing and the eighth inning cut off, look at that, it's only about 18 minutes. So now 24 minutes less time elapses from people getting alcohol in their system and then going out on the roads. You don't have to be a genius to figure out that might lead to some more people who perhaps shouldn't be driving, driving.And more than that, there's actually a study on this. OK, there was a study - there should be a one here. There we go. A study of 2006 to 2015 home Philly games. More time between the end of the game and the end of alcohol sales lead to less violent crime around the stadium. So, we know for a fact that when, in fact, you squeeze in the time and you're leaving less time for people to get the alcohol through their systems, we know that it does, in fact, lead to more crime, at least in Philadelphia, Phillies games. Hopefully, that doesn't happen this year, but we'll see.",
