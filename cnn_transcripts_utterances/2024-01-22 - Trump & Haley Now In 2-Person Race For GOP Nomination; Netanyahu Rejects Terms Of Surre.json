So she could do very well. I think they are going to need a 65 percent turnout there, which would be substantially above the usual 40-45 percent. Then if she is within a few points, I think there will be a lot of people who are encouraging her to keep the fight going. Although, it is a pretty tough road. S He'll have to quickly turn to South Carolina. And then Super Tuesday, March 12th, is now 12 states instead of five or six. So if she is close or wins, I think she stays in. If it is a double- digit lead, look, this contest is over and the Republicans will have spoken.",

If Donald Trump on January 6th had said, hey, the election is over, stand down and let a very calm, traditional, peaceful transfer of power then, I think he would be up to 20 points over Joe Biden. And there would not have been any primary contest whatsoever. I think there are a lot of people who are conservative but they want a president who is not so chaotic and is not tweeting of the time and insulting enemies and our foreign policy seeming to be zigging and zagging.

It may have done Wall Street a good turn but it has not made Americans better. And people are angry about it. They are angry at both parties. And he captured that better than anyone. That is the opposite of what the traditional, old-fashioned Republican like me sort of stood for. I think John McCain had such reverence for how, as the president of the United States, you can conduct yourself. You don't insult private citizens. You do not engage in name-calling with allies who you might disagree with. Maybe I am old-fashioned but I remember when Ronald Reagan was president and he did not let anybody in the Oval Office who was not wearing a suit. And he always wore his suit. I think it is a symbol. It teaches young people in this country how to behave in civil and civic life. And John McCain stood for that space.

Those are expensive and not widely accessible to people. So having a blood test could make this a much more available thing that people have done. This test looks at a marker known as P-TOW 217 in the blood and they found that it had highly accurate results that corresponded with what we might see with the cerebral spinal test or that lumbar puncture. They say that this should reduce the need for confirmatory testing by 80 percent. So mean that only about 20 percent of patients who had this blood test need to go on to confirm it with another form of testing.
