Rudy Giuliani struggling to find a lawyer as Mark Meadows is seeking an emergency order to avoid arrest.Also this hour, an update on threats against the sheriff's office just ahead of Trump's surrender at the Fulton County Jail on Thursday. Are law enforcement officials there prepared? And Trump's Republican rivals are little over 24 hours away from their first debate on the eve of the former president's arrest. GOP Candidate Asa Hutchinson joins us live this hour to discuss his debate strategy and Trump's decision to snub the event. Welcome to our viewers in the United States and around the world. I'm Wolf Blitzer. You're in The Situation Room. We're keeping a close eye right now on Fulton County Jail and the courthouse where multiple Trump co-defendants were arrested or involved in new legal maneuvers today. We're also following breaking news on two of the famous Trump allies indicted with the former president in Georgia. CNN's Paula Reid is outside the courthouse in Atlanta. She's got details. Paula, you have new reporting on Mark Meadows' bid to get the Georgia election subversion case tossed. What are you learning?",

Mark Meadows is hoping to move the state case in Fulton County to federal court where he believes he would be successful in getting it dismissed.And we're just learning that the district attorney here in Fulton County, Fani Willis, has subpoenaed two people to serve as witnesses in that dispute. Now, both of these individuals listened in on that infamous call between former President Trump and the Georgia secretary of state, where Trump was pressing the secretary of state to find him the votes needed to flip the state. Now, it's unclear if these witnesses will testify at a hearing on Monday, but we know both Mark Meadows and former Justice Department Official Jeffrey Clark, they are both trying to get their state cases moved to federal court and they're also now trying to get a federal judge to intervene so that they don't have to surrender by that Friday deadline that the district attorney has imposed.",

He also held a leadership role in the corrections system in New York. So, he knows what this process is like, and he's trying to help Giuliani find a Georgia lawyer, which is what he needs for someone to sign his bond agreement.

And so that's part of the issue for him and what he's going to confront. And as you can tell from what Paula just said, the Fulton County D.A. appears to be meeting him halfway here by saying, okay, let's talk about that infamous phone call to Brad Raffensperger and the pressure, because Meadows spoke on that call, not only the former president, and the pressure they put on state officials to try to find those 11,780 votes. That is part of -- is clearly part of what they're going to rebut what Meadows is making his argument on.",

One, you had to actually show that there was something about what you were doing under the, quote/unquote, color of the office, meaning this was in your job description to do. Remember, states are in charge of elections, not the federal government, not the chief of staff or a president of the United States.Another issue, of course, is that you have to have some kind of federal viable defense. What would the defense be in terms of actually not part of your job description already to do so, why would they make sense? But there is benefit to him that he hopes to be able to try it, nonetheless, and that is I'm sure he's hoping to get a jury in a different area other than Fulton County. Demographics might be more in his favor, he might believe, maybe the voting patterns in his favor. But what does not change here, Wolf, is it would still be state charges against him. It would be handled in a federal courtroom, yes. But it would still have state charges. If convicted, a state conviction would stand. And so it would be unpardonable as well. And so the benefit is the gamble of the jury pool. And if you remove, you go from somebody appointed by Brian Kemp in this current judge to now somebody appointed by President Barack Obama, more seasoned as well on the bench. So, if you buy into the philosophy that who appoints you might determine your fate, maybe he thinks Russian roulette is appropriate.",

He is the closest contender.Ramaswamy, for his part, has seen himself as somebody who is sort of the next generation of the Trump movement, sort of Trump 2.0 in many ways, and sees it as part of his mission to sort of stop DeSantis in his tracks here. So, having them center stage, seeing where, since both are not interested in sort of taking the Chris Christie approach and actually going directly at Donald Trump and taking him on over all of these indictments and the like, the two of them will largely, I assume, try to avoid that and actually try to engage each other on some of their policy prescriptions to differentiate themselves in front of all these Republican primary voters who will be watching.

In fact, we ran a great election. They're just, with a few exceptions, too chicken to say it. And I think, ultimately, where this is tracking is the weight of 91 indictments, the weight of multiple jurisdictions chasing Donald Trump every minute of every day is going to be more than he can bear.

And in this circumstance, when you have an elected official, when you have a public figure, when you have a host of a cable news show engaging in irresponsible rhetoric, they should be deemed to intend the consequences of their actions.",

The students, between ages 10 and 15, were on their way to school Tuesday, when one of the cable snapped, leaving the car dangling by a single cable over the valley below. Officials say that the cable car had done multiple trips Tuesday before the cable broke part way through its journey. It was a race against time to save the passengers, who were said to have no drinking water, two of them reportedly slipping in and out of consciousness. Pakistan's military scrambled to help save the group. By the initial rescue attempts by helicopter failed, after strong winds made the car to unstable. A large crowd on the mountainside watched in horror as the cable car was left tilted at a steep angle. Rescue personnel were able to give the passengers nausea medication after getting reports of the children vomiting. One child was also given heart medication, according to officials. (APPLAUSE)",
