Plus, thousands flee northern Gaza, creating what the U.N. describes as a humanitarian pressure cooker in the south.

We might hear from Iran, see from Iran in the days ahead? SANAM VAKIL, DIRECTOR, MIDDLE EAST &amp; NORTH AFRICA PROGRAMME, CHATHAM HOUSE: Well, much depends on casualties on the ground if IRGC commander, Quds force commander was indeed taken out by these strikes. We do also know that the U.S. has put on a new wave of sanctions on the Islamic republic, and their network across the Middle East. And supposedly there have been reports of a cyber attack on Iran. So Iran, should it choose to respond and it's important to know that they have been consistently messaging that they are not seeking a broader escalation. Could choose to pursue the cyber route in a response, and that might also be a climb down off of the escalation ladder.",

It has invested in individuals, built up their capacity, transferred technology, drones, missile capability to these groups, help them build their capabilities. And over the years, and particularly since Soleimani's death in 2020, Iran has sort of decentralized leadership control over these groups.It wants to take the onus of responsibility off of Tehran. And it has empowered key commanders across the region, also, Hezbollah plays a very important role in managing and coordinating among these groups. So sometimes, of course, Iran presses go or map I suggest that the escalation is good for the axis of resistance or to protect Hamas or distract Israel or pressure the United States. But sometimes Iran, and we've seen this in the past, has said, restraint is good for Tehran, and these groups also operate on their own volition and within their own domestic contexts. So this is why this is such a tricky situation, but clearly one that Iran is behind and should bear responsibility for -- I mean, Iran is gold in the region, our goals are to get rid of the Americans completely and to be the regional the regional power, right?",

That is an order of magnitude more powerful than the strikes we've seen the U.S. carried out in Iraq and Syria over the course of the past several months. It's also worth noting, this is the first time we have seen the U.S. strike Iraq and Syria simultaneously.Meanwhile, in a briefing following these strikes, the White House and DOD say from what they have initially know of the strikes, they were successful at hitting the targets they were going for and that included a long list of facilities used by Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, Quds Force, and associated militias here. Command and control operations centers, intelligence centers, weapons storage facilities -- you can really see in this targets that the U.S. going after the types of weapons used to target U.S. forces in the region, and all of logistics, and essentially command and control needed to carry out those sorts of attacks. The U.S. had made it clear it wasn't trying to start a war with Iran here, and very much trying to avoid that possibility. So no strikes in Iran directly, but very much going after Iran's proxies in a region -- in the region, and the ability of the proxies to carry out these ongoing attacks on U.S. forces. Worth noting that these strikes, of course, come five days after a drone attack in the region killed three U.S. service members in Jordan and wounded scores more. But it's not just that. There have been more than 160 attacks on U.S. forces in the region. And this was effectively a more powerful response to all of that. And yet there is no expectation that this is the end of it, because President Joe Biden saying there could very well be more to come and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin being even more blunt about this in a statement afterwards saying this is the start of our response.

The U.S. says the B1 bombers that flew from the U.S. made it in one nonstop flight.Joining us now is Mick Ryan, a retired major general in the Australian army. Now, talk to us about this B1. I mean, was this used for military reasons, for symbolic reasons, or perhaps both? MAJOR GEN. MICK RYAN, AUSTRALIAN ARMY (RET.): The use of the B1 comes from the end of its use seen in Iraq and Afghanistan over the last two decades. At the end of the day, the B1 is a good platform to carry a whole lot of munitions. And when you're doing these planings, it's the munitions that are used at the most important consideration. So, it can carry a lot of them. It means less aircraft that place at risk.",

The northern border of Israel with Hezbollah has exchange of fire every day, the IDF is engaged with Hamas inside of Gaza. The question is, could these strikes then trigger a misinterpretation of another move? Could it trigger one of the -- one of Iran's proxies in Iraq and Syria to strike back aggressively and therefore escalate the situation?Well, the first we've heard is from the Iraq government. A spokesman for the army there is saying it's a violation of their sovereignty. Now we've heard them say this before, so that in itself not necessarily an escalation, the biggest and strongest of the Iran- backed militias inside of Iraq, Kateab Hezbollah just before the strikes, minutes before the strikes on the Telegram channel, they said they were waiting for orders about what to do next, an indication that they're waiting for Tehran, their main sponsor, to tell them how to respond to the events of the night. It's not clear yet how much damage has been done. How many of the IRGC members and how much of their weapons who have been damaged and destroyed overnight. But I think perhaps looking to what the president of Iran has said, he said, we're not looking to get into a direct fight with the United States but he's clearly hinting very strongly that there will be a response. He said, we will deal with bullies authoritatively. I think in the language of this region, that means the United States strike, although there'll be more, they certainly won't be the last word from Iran's proxies in the region.

More than 100 farmers blocked a supermarket in western France on Friday. Elsewhere in the country, many other farmers started lifting blockades after the government announced concessions. To the north, Dutch and Belgian farmers joined together in a border blockade the same day complaining in part about E.U. regulations (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOHAN VAN ENCKEVORT, DUTCH PIG FARMER FROM THE NETHERLANDS (through translator): My message to Europe is that they should think very carefully. We are very nice products here in the E.U. And we want to continue to make those products. NICOLAS PUSSEMIER, FARMER (through translator): People are fed. We can see clearly, given the scale of the mobilization. We know that the level of being fed up has reached its maximum. JEAN CHENE, ORGANIC DAIRY FARMER (through translator): Why are we carrying on? Because lots of us farmers think we haven't been heard on keeping sustainability matters. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "Another very heavy round of rain in store for Central California from the Bay Area, all the way down to southern California after what we saw just a couple of days ago, record-breaking rain falls across SoCal. Even L.A. picked up 2.49 inches in one day. The total for the entire month of February should be around three inches. So, almost an entire months worth of rain in just 24 hours.The next atmospheric river is on the way for southern California. It will make significant rains from the bay area down through Monterey and all the way down even towards Santa Barbara, and eventually into L.A. It's going to take a to get there. But something else that's going to happen a significantly gusty winds here along the Central Coast, we are going to see wind gusts, 50 to 70 miles per hour that will bring down trees that will bring down power lines, all of those things that happen. And especially in places that already have saturated ground from the rain that we picked up three days ago. So here it is, the storm does come into San Francisco first, snow in the Sierra, and then all the way down even toward Santa -- about Santa Barbara, by the time we work our way into Sunday morning. It gets into la later in the day and into the night, and then it pushes to the east. How long this heavy band of rain stays over southern California before it moves inland is going to be the big question mark. How much of this forecasted rainfall actually comes down before it moves away. If this storm or if this front, a little system here begins to stall and it rains for hours and hours and hours, there will be a signal flood event for SoCal, all the way up even toward San Francisco, certainly along the coast where from Monterey, all the way down, even toward Pismo Beach, could pick in the mountains, could pick up a dozen inches of rainfall. Not along the coast as much, but when you start to push that air up into the mountains, all of that water has to run back downhill and we know what happens to the highway when that happens. So yes, we have only 53 percent of the snowpack in the Sierra. So well take the snow, but its that heavy, heavy rainfall that is going to run off possibly with mudslides all of the things that could happen just depends on where this storm, if it does stalls over California.
