The train's other 20 or so carriages, some updated as recently as last year but remained a closely guarded secret, until now. Zircon Service is a Russian company that builds what it calls elite wagons for its clients, specializing in luxury designs for private and state corporations -- and of course, the Kremlin. Among the trove of documents including blueprints, letters and images, obtained exclusively by the Russian Investigative Dossier Center and shared with CNN, is one from Zircon Service dated August 2018, notifying the Kremlin of a test run for what it calls the sports health wagon that's been ordered. Accompanying photos show what the Dossier Center says is Putin's private gym on board the train. As recently as last year, the Kremlin was looking to upgrade the gym with American equipment to replace the Italian machines originally installed. A former member of Putin's personal protection service, who says he fitted the train's secure communications equipment before defecting from Russia, told the Dossier Center the Kremlin leader started traveling by train more regularly in the build-up to the invasion of Ukraine last year.",

But in the aftermath of a recent armed rebellion here in Russia, in which Putin's authority was threatened the focus on his isolated existence is higher than ever. And the idea of Putin being pampered as he travels incognito by armored train underlines how strangely cloistered the Kremlin leader has become, even paranoid and besieged, according to his former speech writer.
