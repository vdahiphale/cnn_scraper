      "sentences": "This morning, we are observing a moment in history at the same time as witnessing an effort to define the future. We are standing by to hear from President Biden on the 80th anniversary of D-Day, the Allied landing on the beaches of Normandy, June 6th, 1944. But on June 6th, 2024, the president will also speak of the alliance fighting Russian aggression in Ukraine and the threats to democracy around the world. And you can bet, for the domestic audience, the president will implicitly or overtly describe what he feels are the threats to freedom if Donald Trump is elected again.There is a lot of news on the election front this morning, a list of potential running mates for Donald Trump. They're all given homework assignments. New polling that suggests a shift in the race since Trump's criminal convictions, and new information about a helium leak in orbit on the Boeing Starliner. We're going to get to it all. But, first, as we said, a moment in history, past, present, and future. We've got CNN anchors and reporters and analysts from all around the world with us this morning. First, let's go to Christiane Amapour in Normandy at these commemorations. Christiane?",

And this 80th anniversary is the one where everybody knows we may not see this number of survivors anymore, because they are in the region of a hundred years old. I'm sure that's their average age.I spoke to one Jake Larson, who stormed on to Omaha Beach 80 years ago, an amazing person who talked about just the sheer fear, but then having just battled through it and got on with it and managed to get across that beach. We know that it was the greatest amphibious invasion in history. It's never been matched, neither before or since. It was a secret. They deceived the Nazis. They landed at these five beaches down where we are in Normandy. The Nazis thought by, you know, misinformation and disinformation that it was going to be at a different point. Nonetheless, there were encampments and positions above on these cliffs that simply mowed down so many of those brave soldiers who came from America, from Canada, from the U.K., and just came up, and also from Poland as well. The free Poles came on shore as well. And today, we're going to hear from President Biden, from President Macron. We're going to see flyovers of the C-130 transport planes. We're going to see the Air Force fly over towards the end. There'll be taps. A number of U.S. veterans will be given the Legion d'Honneur, which is like the Presidential Medal of Honor, so to speak, for their service. And it is an incredible moment because, as you say, perhaps no one ever imagined that that kind of tyranny that the Allies liberated Europe from, the Nazi tyranny that, you know, slaughtered 6,000 Jews in the Holocaust and so many others around Europe in the fighting, that people thought was done after World War II. But now, 80 years later, we are in the midst of the first raging, massive ground war in Europe since that time and the stakes are massively high, as everybody knows and everybody will be referring to today.",

      "sentences": "Well, he's going to be highlighting common themes for the President, Kate, service, sacrifice and the importance of learning from history, which, in President Biden's words, can repeat itself. We expect him to talk about the mission. The mission on D-Day mattered. The mission was a noble one. And the mission that allied countries are fighting around the world right now is also a noble one.At home, though, this message is going to be received by a war weary electorate who heard from President Biden back in 2020 that he planned to end forever wars, like the war in Afghanistan, where the U.S. withdrew in 2021, albeit in a chaotic way. And since then, two new hot wars have begun, the war in Ukraine, that is now inching toward the three year mark, and the war between Israel and Hamas, which while only months-long at this point is still far longer than anyone in the Biden administration had expected it to last. And there's frustration among the electorate about how long these wars will continue to last and how long the U.S. will continue funding the defenses of this country. There also is expected to be an implicit nod to the future and the risk of isolationism, depending on the policies that some of these countries may pursue. We don't expect President Biden to name Donald Trump by name, either today or tomorrow in his speech from point to hope, which is the point overlooking the beaches here that cliffs that Army Rangers scaled to overtake the German lookout positions. But he is expected to warn of what would happen if the U.S. or other countries stepped back from these alliances and what would happen to the world in those cases. We know that Congress, in the case of NATO, has provided some safeguards, some guardrails that would prohibit a future president from withdrawing from NATO unilaterally. But that is not to stop a future president from, say, making NATO dormant or slowing some of the exercises or reducing the troop footprint across Europe. So, President Biden is going to talk at a very high level about the importance of these alliances and how important they will be for the future going forward.",

It is worth noting President Biden, almost definitely, definitely the last U.S. president who will be -- have been born before D-Day, June 6th, 1944. In fact, he's the first U.S. President born before D-Day since George H.W. Bush, who served obviously with distinction in the Pacific in World War II.I want to go to our Jim Sciutto, our chief national security analyst, who is watching this. Again, this day is to commemorate the past, Jim, but all around Europe, all around the world, the concerns are very much about the now and the future and the threats seen in capitals around the world.

All of you are seated here in one of those small plots of land. That is why this date, June 6th, this place, Normandy, and this ceremony here is so important. It is a reminder to all of us of the true cost of war and the real price of freedom. It is a price that we paid on D-Day 80 years ago. It is a price that we remind all authoritarian dictators today that if necessary, we will pay that price again to ensure the success of freedom. And that is ultimately why France knows, the United States knows, and we know La France (SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE) that the world's most powerful weapon system is not a T-72 manned by mercenaries, it is not a Fujian aircraft carrier patrolling artificial islands, it is not a suicide terrorist killing and slaughtering innocents, no.
