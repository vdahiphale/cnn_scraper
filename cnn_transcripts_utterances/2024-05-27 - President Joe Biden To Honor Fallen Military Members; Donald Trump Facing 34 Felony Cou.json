Later, he'll travel to Arlington National Cemetery to lay a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier and then deliver remarks at the Memorial Amphitheater, all honoring troops as he said last year, dared all and gave all fighting for their country. You know, I was driving here today past that World War II Memorial and I was reminded Jessica, we're only about a week and a half away from the 80th anniversary of D-Day. President Biden will be there in northern France next week, remembering the thousands of American and allied troops who died in the Normandy landing, all with a goal of protecting democracy in Europe. Of course, that has been sort of a consuming theme of President Biden's presidency, certainly, in an election year protecting democracy. And you did hear him discuss that this weekend at West Point, speaking to the graduating cadets, they're saying that they were swearing an oath not to a president or a political party, but to the Constitution of the United States of America.

First, rarely, if ever, has the Supreme Court faced as many decisions as they have in this term, with immediate implications for the next presidential election within months. I mean, not only the immunity case, but the question on the obstruction statute that's used as part of the case against Trump. And obviously, the ballot access. And at the same time, rarely, if ever have you had allegations as specific a partisan bias as those facing Alito. And for that matter, Justice Thomas, given his wife's involvement in the efforts to overturn the 2020 elections. So, you put those two things together and consider that Alito, whatever -- whether he may have already had enormous impact on this, because we don't know, of course, which justices agreed to hear Trump's appeal of the D.C. Circuit opinion, you know, sweeping away really his claims of immunity and just the act of hearing this case, and delaying it for months has had enormous impact on the -- on the, you know, potential of having his trial before November. Look at what's happening in New York. I mean, the timetable of the New York case, I think the ability to move that through the system toward final arguments, toward final decision under -- underscores what could have been in terms of a January 6th trial if the Supreme Court had not intervened in the way that it has.

He wants to -- he has said he will bring the National Guard over the objections of local officials into communities that he -- that he deems as where crime is out of control. There may be an audience for part of these policies. But I think the criminal justice experts I talked to universally agree whether they liked this policy or not, that it is going to mean more arrests of young Black and Latino men. And in that way, it fits into the broader net -- broader point, which is that if you compare where we are now to 2020, Trump's gain is primarily among non-white, rather than white voters.
