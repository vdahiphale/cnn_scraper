And I do think it's important to note that Donald Trump has been consistently trying to link all of his legal cases together, something we know is false. I mean a lot of the battles that he is facing, some are in federal court, some at the state level, some are criminal, some are civil. But the whole goal of that is to try and argue that President Joe Biden and Democrats are doing whatever they can to try and prevent him from becoming President once again, and that's what he's doing with this the death of Alexei Navalny. He's arguing that everyone's upset about Navalny. Everyone's calling out Russia. But look this is happening to me. Of course, it's, it's pretty much an absurd claim that a lot of people are pointing out and that's why you're seeing Joe Biden, as well as Nikki Haley his lone rival in this primary really attacking him for this language.

The President, yesterday, or two days ago, told reporters he was considering additional sanctions and yesterday said that he, in fact, will announce those sanctions that are coming on Friday. The White House has been quite careful not to detail exactly what these sanctions will be but yesterday, the National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan said that it -- they would be substantial, that they would in part be targeting the defense industrial base in Russia, as well as key sources of revenue for Russia's economy that Sullivan says are responsible for funding the, quote, war machine that is currently playing out. But it comes as the President had previously warned Putin that there would be devastating consequences were Navalny to die in Russian prison. This -- these sanctions were actually already under consideration, already in play before the death of Navalny. But certainly Navalny's death has taken this to a new level added a new significance to the fact that the U.S. will be announcing these sanctions. The U.S. has also been working with European partners to discuss the way forward. We will see whether any allies will follow suit in implementing sanctions, as well. But it really comes at a moment where the President is trying to use a series of events relating to Russia to make his case against former president Donald Trump. There is the death of Alexei Navalny. The fact that Trump has yet to condemn Vladimir Putin for his death. Also, the President has taken aim at Trump for his comments suggesting that he would encourage Putin to do whatever the hell he wants to countries that aren't meeting their NATO obligations. And then, there is the whole policy debate playing out on Capitol Hill as House Republicans so far has refused to consider a vote on additional aid for Ukraine at a time when the war between Russia and Ukraine is about to hit the two-year mark. President -- former President Trump has been lobbying Republican lawmakers to oppose that bill and this is all adding on to the list of the President's arguments that he is making against the former President as the 2024 race is heating up. We know that he personally really wants to start elevating these attacks on Trump. He's directed his campaign team to do that and everything surrounding Russia and Ukraine adds fodder -- that's coming from Trump, really adds fodder to the President's case as he's making these re-election arguments.",

So, Pete, the good news is people who might be afraid that attempts to sort of open emergency exit doors in the middle of a flight usually fail and that is because of the difference between the air pressure inside the cabin and the pressure outside. So, that is good news. So, in case people are afraid of that, it is very unlikely that someone's going to be able to pry the door open.

And a large part brought on by the federal transportation mask mandate continues to be a problem though in 2024. And passengers tell us that this man on this flight -- this American Airlines flight was sitting in the emergency exit row, tried to open the emergency exit when passengers started yelling and then tackled him. Flight attendants came in with tape and flex cuffs. This was on American Airlines flight 1219 between Albuquerque, New Mexico and Chicago O'Hare, diverted back to Albuquerque because this happened only about 20 minutes into the flight. You can see in some of the video, this man being led away by police down the stairwell there off of the jetway at the gate. Not clear if he was arrested, although we know the FBI is investigating this, they've acknowledged that to us. Also, the FAA investigating. They point out that there's been about 254 incidents, so far, this year of unruly passengers on commercial flights. Compare that to the more than 59000 reports of incidents back in 2021, the rate of incidents is really key though and the rate has actually gone way, way down. But it did go up a little bit last summer. Here is the big takeaway here. You just don't want to act out on a plane.

And you write in this report, the terrorist organization Hamas chose to harm Israel strategically in two clear ways, kidnapping citizens and committing sadistic sexual crimes you go on to say Silence will be remembered as a historical stain on those who chose to remain silent and deny the sexual crimes committed by Hamas.

But the other, it relates to the hostages who remain in Gaza because your report details the assaults that were committed against men and women that are held and then that that continue to be held in Gaza from those that have been released and reported back what they saw, what they heard and that's why it is so important to get these hostages home as soon as possible.
