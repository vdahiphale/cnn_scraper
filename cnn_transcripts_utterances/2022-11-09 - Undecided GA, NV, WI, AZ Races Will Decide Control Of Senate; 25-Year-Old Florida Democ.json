We learned a lesson in Arizona two years ago. Let's look at the presidential race. You know, I'm going to write this down right now. This is Mark Kelly. This is D plus what -- D plus about six? D plus six right now. Let's go to the presidential race from two years ago and I want to wind the clock back, OK? When there was 72 percent in, Joe Biden had a lead of some 218,000 votes. That was the first votes on election night. By the next morning, where we are now, that lead had been cut to 130,000 votes. By Wednesday, which is where we are at noon, down to 93,000. You can see that it keeps on shrinking. Thursday, just 68,000. Sunday, it was 18,000. And then, ultimately, a week after Election Day, 14,000. And by the time it was all done it was just 11,000. So the lead got smaller and smaller and smaller. Kelly's at .6 now. You can expect it to shrink. Does he have enough of a pad? That's what we're going to have to wait and see, Don.",

You can see we have projected winners in 14 competitive seats for Republicans, 23 for Democrats.In terms of the competitive seats, Republicans need to win 30 competitive seats to take control of the House. Democrats need to win 53 to maintain control. So Republicans need to figure out a way to get 16 more seats here. Now, where are they ahead? They're ahead in enough of them. They're ahead in 35 of the remaining seats, which would give them 221 -- a majority. But nowhere near the majority I think that Kevin McCarthy was hoping going into yesterday -- into Election Day. I want to put a different filter on here and take a look at the competitive seats in the country right now and really focus in on a couple of things. Actually, let's start with Colorado because I think this is fascinating. This is Lauren Boebert's seat here -- not even a seat that we considered to be competitive leading into Election Day. Lauren Boebert is trailing by about 3,500 votes. Lauren Boebert is an election-denying, very conservative Republican. The Democrats would love to unseat her. I'm not sure they thought they had a chance to. They have a chance to unseat her. Ninety percent reporting -- let me just look at the counties here so people can see where is the remaining vote here. Let's go down to 90 percent. These are the places that have more than 10 percent left. This is Garfield County. This is a Democratic-leaning district, very slightly. Only 86 percent in. Down here, not a very big county -- Montezuma County. This is a Republican district. You have 88 percent. There's not a ton of vote left. We'll have to wait and see if she's able to make up that margin and maintain that seat. Where could the control of the House be decided?

So it's almost a polar opposite of what you might think going into Election Day. Democrats trailing in so many of these districts, including Sean Patrick Maloney, the chair of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. Right now, he's 3,000 votes or so behind.

That's the historic benchmark going back to 1982. And Joe Biden is definitely below 50 percent approval rating.So that's not going to be where Republicans are. This is going to be much tighter. And that's going to make the loudest, most extremist members of his caucus more powerful because he's going to need every vote he can get. The other thing to keep in mind is it's those very extremists and the election deniers that were on the ballot because of Republican primaries and Trump's endorsements that end up making, I believe, Independent voters swing for Democrats narrowly over Republicans, which is unheard of in out-year elections. So, it's going to also come down to these states where there's redistricting. Where Republicans have effectively redistricted in Texas, and Florida, and Ohio. But Democrats tried the same thing in New York, overreached, got blowback, and that's why those districts are competitive right now.
