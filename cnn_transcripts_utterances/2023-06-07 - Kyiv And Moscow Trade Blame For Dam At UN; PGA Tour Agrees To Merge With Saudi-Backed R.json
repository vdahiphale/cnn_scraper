Evacuations have been ordered from multiple towns and cities, including Kherson. One official says more than 1,300 homes along the west bank of the Dnipro River appear to be underwater. Kyiv says Russian forces which have controlled the reservoir since the early days of the war littered the area with explosives and mines and are responsible for the breach. Moscow says a Ukrainian attack is to blame. Both, however, acknowledge the dam destruction will cause severe environmental long term damage. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT (through translator): The whole world will know about this Russian war crime, the crime of ecoside. Such deliberate destruction by the Russian occupiers of the dam and other structures at the Nova Kakhovka hydropower plant is an environmental bomb of mass destruction. SERGEI SHOIGU, RUSSIAN DEFENSE MINISTER (through translator): In order to prevent offensive actions by the Russian army in the Kherson region, the Kyiv regime carried out an eco sabotage, in fact a terrorist act which led to the flooding of large areas and will have severe and long term environmental consequences.

And this red area here is Russian occupied territory. The hydroelectric power plant itself is in Russian controlled territory.Well, this satellite image from late May really gives you a sense of the layout. This is Russian held territory here and Ukrainian up here. Now, the Ukrainian hydroelectric energy operator says the explosion happened in the engine room from the inside. So on Russian occupied territory. And while both Russia and Ukraine say the dam was breached overnight Monday into Tuesday. There is actually evidence of damage in the days leading up to that. Take a look at these satellite images. You can see from this image at the end of May, this part of the structure is intact. Fast forward to June 5th and clearly there's a piece missing. And it's right in the middle where we see the dam has now been breached. [01:30:02] Well, the biggest immediate risk from this breach is, of course, flooding. This is the danger zone here as identified by Ukraine's interior minister and we are already seeing images coming out of Ukrainian-controlled Kherson City. You can see water flowing out on streets there and across the river in Russian-controlled Nova Kakhovka, which is the town closest to that hydroelectric power plant. Another risk is that the reservoir that is created by that dam supplies water to Crimea down here in the south, Russian-held Crimea. The head of that region saying there is a risk the canal will run too shallow, that they have enough water for now. And Kakhovka also supplies water up here to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant to cool the reactors. The U.N.'s nuclear watchdog says there is no immediate danger. Now the question, of course, given the timing of this, is how it will affect Ukraine's counteroffensive? It's not 100 percent clear until we had the full picture of the damage, but flooding over here could potentially complicate the Ukrainian effort across the Dnipro River to head south even for Crimea or even over here to the Azov Sea, if that is in fact part of their plan. It could also divert attention and resources away from attacking other areas along this hundreds of miles of frontline. Clare Sebastian, CNN -- London. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

This meeting comes ahead of a slash in oil output by the kingdom and its ongoing strained relations between both countries, in particular with the Saudis moving closer to Moscow in recent years. Iran has officially reopened its embassy in Saudi Arabia for the first time in seven years. An official ceremony was held inside the embassy compound in Riyadh Tuesday. Dozens of diplomats and officials were present. The two countries severed diplomatic ties in 2016 but agreed to resume relations in March. The deal was brokered by China. Iran has unveiled what it called its first domestically made hypersonic missile, a move likely to heighten tensions with the west if it is true. According to state media, the precision guided missile called \"Fattah\" can target anti-missile systems, penetrate the most advanced air defenses including Israel's Iron Dome. Iran says it can travel 1,400 kilometers per hour (INAUDIBLE) a range of 1,400 kilometers, almost 900 miles. Tehran calls it a generational leap in technology.
