The case against Donald Trump will be won or lost on the details and how or if the prosecution fills in the blanks for the jury.Week three of the former president's criminal trial starts where we left off at week two with Gary Farro on the stand. Farro is the former banker that Trump lawyer and fixer Michael Cohen used to create a shell company Cohen then allegedly used to disguise the purpose of payments to adult film actress and director Stormy Daniels. Ones that Donald Trump ultimately reimbursed Cohen for, says the prosecution. Farro is the government's third witness, who they call next. And how they build on this story the prosecution is telling right now is unclear, but already the prosecution has used its witnesses to support what they've told the jury they will hear from Michael Cohen. Cohen is something of a centerpiece for the case. The man who played point guard for Trump's alleged attempt to silence Stormy Daniels and to make sure her story of an alleged tryst with the candidate stayed secret. CNN reporters are covering every angle of this trial. We're also closely monitoring another different breaking story this hour, protests consuming campuses across the United States. Columbia University in New York the latest flashpoint where protesters at the school have now barricaded themselves inside a building on campus. But first let's get right to Kaitlan Collins, who is outside the Manhattan criminal courthouse. Kaitlan, another big week for the defendant, Mr. Trump.",

We'll talk about that in a moment as we are wondering if there will be further restrictions placed on Mr. Trump. But, Paula, I should note, we're seeing these proceedings to start right now.

They started off with David Pecker. Pecker, of course, is a longtime friend of Donald Trump's. He was the chair of AMI, the company that published the \"National Enquirer.\"And Pecker took the jury inside the seedy world of the \"National Enquirer,\" of what he called checkbook journalism of putting stories out designed to help or hurt certain prominent people. And he went into detail on this practice of catch and kill, paying to silence stories. Three specific examples. One involving a doorman who had a story that turned out to be untrue about Donald Trump and two involving women, Karen McDougal and Stormy Daniels, who allege that they had sexual affairs with Donald Trump. And he -- David Pecker told the jury, the reason we did this in 2016 was because of the campaign. Now, on cross-examination, Donald Trump's team scored a few points relating to David Pecker. They got him to say that checkbook journalism, this was common. This wasn't something that was just invented for the first time for Donald Trump. They'd been doing it for a long time, for a lot of different people. They also pointed out certain minor inconsistencies in his testimony. Nothing that would worry me too much as a prosecutor. And Trump's team used David Pecker to score a point against Michael Cohen.",

And he is handing down his written decision to the parties so far.This is a notable moment in this trial. This judge had heard a hearing on this. First, the first ten violations that prosecutor said. They still have another hearing that's expected to happen this week on Thursday on four more violations. And we are hearing from the judge that he has fined Donald Trump $1,000 for each violation of this gag order.

And I'm sure he's warning Donald Trump what he can and cannot do in the future.Notably, he did start the morning saying, you can go to your son's graduation, before he held him in contempt, which if you recall, Kaitlan, prior to this, he never said he couldn't go, he just said I'll let you know whether or not you can go.

Of course you have a judge's order saying that he must remove them from Truth Social, and two offending posts from his campaign website by 2:15 p.m. today, before court is out of session, which I note the judge wants to be able to look and see if he, in fact, is complying before he leaves his sight.

There is always a tension between the defendant, who usually wants his lawyer on the attack, go after everybody, this is my liberty at stake, and the lawyer, who sometimes will say, well, hang on, we need to be strategic here. It doesn't make sense to go after Rhona Graff (ph), for example, they administrative assistant who testified last week.

And he's saying that the issue of re-posting appears to be a question of first impression.
