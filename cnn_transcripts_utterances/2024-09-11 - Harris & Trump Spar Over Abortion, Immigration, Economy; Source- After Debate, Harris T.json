      "sentences": "Well, Boris, the Harris team is certainly feeling really good about last night. They felt good about the vice president's performance. They were pleased to see Donald Trump taking the bait from her at multiple moments. But I think today, back in Wilmington, according to aides that I have spoken to, the vibe is very much it's back to work, even as the campaign is trying to strategize over how to maximize and capitalize on the momentum that they felt like they had last night. There is no sense from the campaign right now that that one debate ended up changing, fundamentally, the trajectory of this race.The assumption from here until Election Day is that this is going to be an incredibly close race and that the really hard work for them is to come still in the coming weeks. As one senior campaign aide put it, it'll be incredibly close. We cannot take our foot off the gas even when the moment feels really good. That, of course, again, is a reference to last night. In other words, I think, Boris, there's no sense right now in the Harris campaign that this race is suddenly a 45-55 race, that they still see this as a very close 50-50 race. And remember, this is a team that certainly remembers really well that the 2020 election ended up being decided in a number of battleground states by margins of 10s of thousands of votes. Now, obviously, this is why we are going to be seeing the campaign continue to be focused very much on a number of battleground states. If you even look at the places that Vice President Harris and Gov. Tim Walz are going to be traveling to in the coming days, Harris is going to North Carolina and Pennsylvania in the next couple of days. Tim Walz will be going to Michigan and Wisconsin. That just tells you everything that you need to know about where the campaign continues to focus its attention. Now, one other thing coming out of last night is, of course, this Taylor Swift endorsement. We are told that the bracelets, the friendship bracelets that the campaign started selling quickly last night, they actually sold out. They were $20 a pop, but if you go on the store website for the campaign, it says that they are sold out. So currently, they are taking pre-orders to come later in the month. The campaign so far is being very tight-lipped on whether there are discussions about potential events they could do with Taylor Swift herself, Boris.",

That was won, actually, by President Biden and yourself. But as you noted, Trump's allies, Trump himself, the right wing media, they are howling over this.

And drones in Jordan, I thought of the two Navy SEALs who died trying to intercept Iranian smugglers in - off the coast of Somalia. I thought about the ships that have been used as target practice by the Houthis with drones and anti ship missiles supplied by Iran. Heck, an aircraft carrier just got a combat medal for the first time since World War II for its actions off the Red Sea. We could keep going down the list. The special operators that are in Syria right now as we speak. We just had six wounded in a raid on an ISIS compound. We had another six wounded by a missile attack. I mean, this is a long list.
