More supervisors, more training for unusual circumstances.What also is really interesting here is that the FAA wants to improve training and reduce the training backlog because the staffing shortage of air traffic controllers is something that keeps coming up again and again. In fact, the FAA just owned up to it a bit, saying that there is a shortage at the New York TRACON (ph) control terminal radar approach, a key control facility. That's a key facility in New York that controls the airspace around the three busy airports in the metro area. The shortage there really severe, only 54 percent staffing there right now, 90 percent staffing nationwide. So the FAA really needs to hire some more people, according to air traffic control unions. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, though, attributes these problems to a kind of rust that has been seen among pilots and airports, and he says the system is really pressed to the limit right now and it can't compromise on safety. Listen to what Buttigieg said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

You know, on the Southwest flight, 6013 from Las Vegas to Columbus, Ohio, got only about 27 minutes into the flight Southwest says one of the pilots on board had an apparent medical emergency.That is when a pilot in the passenger cabin flying for a completely different airline was pressed into service and stepped into the flight deck. Southwest Airlines says that pilot who was off duty helped out with the radio communications to try and bring this plane back under the ground. Safely reverted back to Las Vegas airport. No real issues there. The big mystery now is who is this person? No airline really claiming who this off-duty pilot was. Pretty incredible work, though.",

You know what's really interesting here is that pilots, you know myself included, were all kinds of thinking always in the back of our minds, when we get into a commercial airliner, what will we do if the question comes up? Is there a pilot on board?And so it seems like this pilot flew for a different airline, and was just pressed into service. Helping out with the radios is a pretty good job. Although, remember that a Southwest 737 in general can be flown with one pilot. This is one of the reasons why there are two pilots on board. But you can still fly it with one.

BERNADA VILLALONA, CRIMINAL DEFENSE ATTORNEY &amp; FORMER PROSECUTOR: So as you can see, this is going to be a very complex case because, as you can see from the 50-page affidavit, probable cause affidavit, there is a lot of evidence that is showing the guilt of Mr. Craig. So in terms of, if he were to come to me and asked for me to defend them, of course, after I get paid, we will have to evaluate all the evidence that exists. But it looks like the most probing type of defense would be to say that she committed suicide as opposed to that he is the one who actually poisoned her. Because, based on what he has laid out in different text messages and talking to other people, it has to coincide with what he's already said to other people and has said to law enforcement. In the sense that when he tried to divorce her that she started going on opiates, and that may have may try to overdose in the past. But again, this is all coming from his mouth.",

So that's going to be very difficult. And as you can see, his own employees from that office, from the dental office have evidence and testimony to provide against that. And it doesn't help those searches on the computer where he's googling, what is the best option? Where can arsenic be detected in an autopsy? What are the top five points in that can't be detected?

CNN has reached out to the Blackhawks and the NHL for comment. And the players will not be wearing the warmup jersey. The team said in a statement to \"The Sun Times\" that \"the organization is proud to continue its annual Pride Night celebration.\" And that, quote, \"Together our activities will focus on fostering conversation and more equitable spaces in our pursuit to make hockey more inclusive. We do not condone anti-LGBTQIA-plus rhetoric and we stand firmly with the community,\" unquote. On the Blackhawks web.

And the Pride jerseys have been a sticking point, Brianna, with other players and teams this season. Recently, one Flyers player chose not to wear the Pride Night jersey, though the rest of the team did on their Pride Night festivities. The San Jose Sharks goaltender, citing Christian - his Christian beliefs, chose not to wear the jersey.
