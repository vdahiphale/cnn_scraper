Hamas has agreed to a cease-fire agreement proposed by both Egypt and Qatar. We know Israel helped craft this deal, but has not fully agreed to it, at least not yet. We have reached out to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office in Jerusalem. We are awaiting official response from the Israeli government. We will have a live report from Jerusalem in just a moment, but I want to make sure that everyone appreciates what's going on. Hamas has announced that Ismail Haniyeh, the head of its political bureau, has told both Qatari and Egyptian mediators that Hamas has agreed to their proposal for a cease-fire agreement. Much more on this coming up, a very significant development. But, right now, the -- we want to track what's going on in Donald Trump's four-week historic hush money criminal trial. A key witness just spent about three hours taking jurors inside the Trump Organization's bookkeeping, and specifically the reimbursement of former Trump lawyer and fixer Michael Cohen after Cohen fronted the money for the Stormy Daniels hush money deal. Brianna Keilar is joining us right now. She's outside the White House in New York City. Brianna, update our viewers.",

Those are payments that began after Trump was in the White House.And I'm here now with CNN chief domestic correspondent Phil Mattingly, along with CNN legal analyst Karen Friedman Agnifilo. She's counsel at a firm representing Michael Cohen, but she does not have contact with him, does not work on his case, and there are no restrictions on what she can say about this case. And, Karen, we should note right now the court has broken for lunch. They're going to be back around 2:15 eastern. But this break comes after testimony that was key to these charges of falsifying records.",

He's a key witness here to talk about how these payments were made. Don't forget, this is a falsifying business records case, and it's all about the record-keeping. And, so far, we haven't heard this link to Donald Trump, which is a little bit surprising. We were thinking that he was going to say, yes, of course, he was involved, and yes, he did it. Let's see what they say on redirect and how the -- when the prosecution gets back up again. But I think the defense did a good job at neutralizing his testimony and saying things like, you didn't have many options in the drop-down menu. It was an antiquated system. So, if it said attorney's fees, that's because it came out of the drop-down menu. You didn't have an option for whatever this was.",

It was driven largely -- though we don't have documentation of this specifically in this case, but it was largely driven by whatever the guy who ran the operation wanted.You know very well how the Trump White House operated. It was not traditionally like an executive branch. It was not traditionally like a West Wing was run. And it seems -- and I think we have seen lots of evidence of this, or at least anecdotes tied to this about the Trump Organization over the series of decades -- it was an operation that was driven by one individual. And it was designed to give him what he wanted for the business that he wanted to run. That was very much how the White House operated. I think what's fascinating in the testimony today is how you see the shift in the Trump Organization, according to the witness today, when Donald Trump went to the White House, recognizing that systems weren't that great, they were antiquated, recognizing that people who were running the systems or people who had to sign off on things perhaps weren't doing it anymore in a traditional or functional manner. Instead, Donald Trump took that to the White House.",

Let me just read to you a little bit from the statement that Hamas released. The statement said that Ismail Haniyeh, the head of the political bureau of Hamas -- quote -- \"made a phone call to the Qatari prime minister, Sheik Mohammed Bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, and to the Egyptian minister of intelligence, Mr. Abbas Kamel, and informed them of Hamas' agreement to their proposal regarding a cease-fire agreement.\" What's your reaction, Beth?",

That was an earlier proposal that was clearly discussed with both Qatar and Egypt. If that is the plan right now, and if Hamas has agreed to that, that would be a huge development.",

It's hard for them to do that. But, also, they're not completely on the same page and they don't have the same interests in some ways, given that Sinwar is potentially staring down the barrel of a gun and also the party who wants to walk away from this and survive. So it could be a very big deal. And I think that this delay may have been part of the discussion and trying to hear back from Sinwar inside of Gaza.",

I take it, M.J., the president, President Biden, had a conversation, a phone conversation, with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu earlier today? Is that right? M.J. LEE, CNN SENIOR WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT:  That's right. We know President Biden and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke earlier today. And, of course, these ongoing hostage deal negotiations was one of the many topics that the two leaders discussed, as has been the case for all of their recent phone conversations. But what we are waiting for right now is an official White House and U.S. reaction to this news that Hamas has apparently agreed to a temporary cease-fire deal. So we will bring that to you whenever we have word of that. But I heard Jeremy in his last conversation with you really leaning into the various caveats that are at play here. And I do think that kind of note of caution from here in Washington is wise as well. That is just to say that we have had moments like this before in the months of negotiations to get to a temporary cease-fire and hostages release deal where we appear to be on the brink of a deal, and other moments where we appear to be on the brink of these talks completely falling apart. So, again, as we wait for official U.S. word and reaction from the Israeli side to this news from Hamas that they are agreeing to this deal, I do think, again, just leaning into that note of caution is definitely worth doing. But what U.S. officials have been doing, of course, in recent weeks is very much pushing hard for this deal to get done, because the administration believes that this is really the only clear way to eventually getting to an end to this war. But I can't underscore enough how important it is for U.S. officials to try to get to that point, to try to get to the point of hostages coming out and this conflict that has been going on for so many months to come to an end. And, of course, a big part of that is avoiding a major Rafah incursion from taking place. And, of course, the Israelis have been warning for weeks and weeks now that they are getting increasingly prepared to go ahead and take that step if this deal does not come together, Wolf.",

      "sentences": "There's been such a wide gap on the key issue here, which is a permanent cease-fire, which is what Hamas has demanded and Israel says isn't on the table. It's been a salami slice deal, if you will, broken down into a period of six weeks of truce for an exchange of hostages, then another six weeks of truce, during which period a final cease-fire could have been agreed.But that really big sticking point, as far as we know, remains a sticking point. Precisely what Hamas is saying that they have agreed to, we don't know the details. They're saying they have agreed to a plan put forward, proposed by Qatar and Egypt. Now, we know over the weekend that there were negotiations in Egypt, and the -- and Hamas were given the Egyptian proposal. We understood that that proposal was simply a framework, that, even if that proposal, that framework proposal was agreed, there would still be days' worth of discussions hammering out the details. And, of course, the devil is in the detail. And I think it's worth noting that, in any negotiation, both sides are trying to unbalance the other. And it appeared earlier on this day, when Israel was dropping fliers over Rafah telling part of the population, 100,000 people, they needed to move, it really seemed as if Israel was potentially going to go ahead with this much-talked- about ground operation in Rafah, psychological pressure, if you will, on Hamas, because Prime Minister Netanyahu has said all along, the IDF has said all along it is military pressure on Hamas that will get the release of the hostages. But at this stage, when Israel appears on the front foot for a potential offensive into Rafah, which is not an easy consideration, takes a lot of resources, a lot of organization, now we hear from Hamas that they have agreed to, as far as -- an unspecified deal. We don't know the details. If we could know those details, we would know how realistic it is that Israel might respond in the affirmative. But it does seem that Hamas has put the ball back in Israel's court at what seems almost the 11th hour for a potential incursion into Rafah.",

We're still waiting for an update. It's clear that U.S. officials are trying to figure out what is going on here and how they respond to this news from Hamas, given we don't know the exact details, as Nic was saying, of the proposal that Hamas has said that they have accepted here. The last time that we heard from the secretary of state on these ongoing negotiations between Hamas and Israel through, of course, the interlocutors in Egypt and Qatar was last week, when he was traveling in the region. The secretary of state essentially said the onus is on Hamas, Hamas is standing in the way of the deal, because he said the current iteration of the deal that had been put on the table, crafted by the Egyptians, but had been reviewed by the Israelis, made significant compromises on behalf of the Israelis, essentially making the case that that deal was the best deal that Hamas was going to get and saying very clearly that Hamas should accept it. So if Hamas has accepted that version of the deal, this would be a major development and would put the ball back in Israel's court. We just don't know if it's exactly those terms that Hamas says that they are agreeing to right now. And the other thing I want to note is that U.S. officials have been saying that what's on the table is, of course, that temporary cease- fire that would be in exchange for the release of those hostages. But, of course, the hope from U.S. officials is that that temporary cease- fire would turn into more lasting cease-fire and then turn into a peace. Of course, that creates some tension with Israelis, who have been saying for quite some time now that they are hoping that there is, of course, this agreement to release these hostages, but they also are very clear in saying that their operation in Rafah will go ahead no matter what.",
