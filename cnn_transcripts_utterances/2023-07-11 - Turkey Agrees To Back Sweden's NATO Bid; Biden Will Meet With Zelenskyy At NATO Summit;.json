Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg announced that Turkey has now dropped objections to Sweden becoming a member. After standing in the way for more than a year. Well, Stockholm in turn appears to be supporting Turkish membership in the European Union according to Turkey's state-run news agency. While Sweden's defense minister says Turkey's decision to endorse the country will strengthen the security of both Sweden and NATO as similar sentiments echoed by the head of the military alliance.

It's been a year, in fact, it was here at this summit that Sweden was meant to officially be taken in as the 32nd member of the North-Atlantic Treaty Organization.And yet those objections from Turkey right up until the last minute, it was wrangling that went on even as Joe Biden was coming over to Europe. They were talking with each other and no breakthrough seems possible. It was that meeting last night, where from which a very happy Swedish Prime Minister emerged the brought the breakthrough. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ULF KRISTERSSON, PRIME MINISTER OF SWEDEN (through translator): You're a very long, I'm very happy that three of us the president of Turkey and the Secretary General of NATO and myself have shaken hands over this joint statement.

It has said it needs a signal that political agreement on membership would be considered a win. And as Melissa said, Zelenskyy has been leveraging his own appearance at the summit, not really saying publicly, that he'll go, though, of course, the U.S. training that meeting with Biden very unlikely to happen, if they think there's a risk of being stood up.There has been some tangible progress over the last 24 hours. The Ukrainian foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba saying on Twitter that Ukraine has been granted permission to bypass what's called the Membership Action Plan, which is a process under which countries are sort of guided through reforms that they need to undertake to start accession -- the accession process to NATO. This is something that some other countries have bypassed Finland and Sweden for example, but suppose you don't have to (INAUDIBLE) in the moment. And it seems likely that without this war, Ukraine, a country that's a young democracy, whose military has at least before the war not had clear interoperability with the NATO alliance, would have been put through. So, that I think is fairly significant for Ukraine. But Zelenskyy also stepping up his rhetoric ahead of the summit making it clear that he believes that in fighting of Russia, Ukraine is de facto already part of the NATO security architecture. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) VOLODYMR ZELENSKYY, PRESIDENT OF UKRAINE (through translator): The security reality here on NATO's eastern flank depends on Ukraine. When we apply to join NATO, we were frank, Ukraine is de facto already in the alliance. Our weapons are the weapons of the alliance. Our values are what the alliance believes in. Our defense is the very elements of the formula of Europe that makes it united, free and peaceful. Vilnius must confirm all of this. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

So, before the NATO summit, but also before the next round of negotiations for the grain deal, I think it's important for Turkey to send very strong message to Russia, that it has to abide by its commitments because Turkey also has leverages against Russia.
