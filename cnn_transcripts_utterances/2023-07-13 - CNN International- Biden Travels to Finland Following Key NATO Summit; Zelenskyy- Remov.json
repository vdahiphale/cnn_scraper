He'll be meeting with leaders of Norway and Finland and Sweden -- who's joining -- and Denmark and Iceland as well, all there in this Nordic group. I think the message -- sub text is hugely clear. He steps out of this NATO summit whereas he says he's got this unity and it's on the border with Russia and it's presenting this unity in very close proximity repeatedly now to Putin and Moscow. Saying, you thought you'd break us. We have this unity. And look at you. You're cracking. You had this rebellion from Prigozhin. You've just tired another general or disappeared another General Popov who complained about how the war would be fought in Ukraine -- a very senior general fighting for Russia in Ukraine. The cracks are appearing. President Macron yesterday at the NATO summit talked about the fragility of Moscow. So I think that there's a lot of sub text, but then that NATO unity is a sort of a bit of a bitter pill for Ukraine because it didn't get quite what it wanted.

A real coordinated, strategic effort, to try to block the counting of votes in our State, the certification of an election in our State, and then spread lies that then transformed into threats, against the lives of election officials, who were simply doing our job. And there's a lot of evidence that has already been revealed that it was presented to the January 6 committees, and it's already out there in the public square about all of this. And I think it's important that that evidence be taken seriously. And I have confidence that it is being taken seriously. And, you know, we are willing to go over and over again with the relevant authorities, everything we endured and experienced and witnessed, to ensure, again, where there's evidence of a pernicious and strategic effort to overturn the will of voters that there is justice that is served, so it can't happen again.

And heat temperatures, temperatures without the humidity -- because there won't be very much -- into parts of California, even parts of Arizona could approach 120 degrees over the weekend, that is where the biggest heat will be.It all kind of comes in from the east, goes back towards the west and then just sits there. This could be a one week long unfortunate heatwave out there and 60 possible records almost daily records here across the Southwest, every place is going to see a record. Now I know we've been over 110 for a long time in Phoenix and I don't see that changing especially when you are looking at Saturday at 119 in the shade. So Phoenix, Vegas, Twentynine Palms, all the in-land empire, all those areas out there going to be again, blisteringly hot. Something else that is going on being a cross parts of Miami, is that we have this heat index -- yes, that is the heat and the humidity combined in a long formula as long as this wall here. But that is heat index at 33 days in Miami above 100 degrees. And we're not breaking that anytime soon. That will continue to go. And so will the heat into parts of the ocean. We are still going to see temperatures, yes, that is Key West at 92, Vaca Key about the 93 or 94, even up toward Key Largo with the lighthouse there, the buoy out there that is 93 degrees in the afternoon. So, yes, a lot more rainfall coming up toward the Northeast as well. Some of this could be heavy and even though it is only 2 to 4 inches in any one spot, none of that 3 to 4 has anyplace to soak in. We're just going to see another possibility of these rivers and creeks rising again due to the fact that there's just nothing, there's not a piece of dry land out there to absorb any of it. So where you see that from a Albany, Saratoga, all the way back down into parts of even Massachusetts this time, very heavy rainfall coming up through the end of the weekend. One kind of a storm after another after another. And that could be the real problem later on this week.",

This is going to be so impactful and it is going to take years for the industry and for our world to recuperate. We're not just talking about weakening the ecosystem of Hollywood. The impact will be felt in industries all across. We're talking restaurants, hotels, transportation, hospitality, just to give you an idea.

Microsoft and the White House have both confirmed the hack was a spying campaign aimed at sensitive information.
