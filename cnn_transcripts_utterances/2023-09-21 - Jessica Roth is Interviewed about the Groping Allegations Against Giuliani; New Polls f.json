      "sentences": "There are new allegations that Rudy Giuliani is being forced to face today. Former White House aide Cassidy Hutchinson is now claiming Giuliani groped her when they were backstage at a January 6th rally. Hutchinson is well known now as the aide to Trump's chief of staff, Mark Meadows, who became the star witness really in the investigation by the January 6th congressional committee. She's laying out this explosive claim for the first time in her memoir, which is titled, \"Enough.\"In there Hutchinson compares Giuliani to, quote, \"a wolf closing in on its prey\" that day at the Ellipse, writing that it started with Giuliani excited and claiming to have real evidence of voter fraud. She then writes this, \"Rudy wraps one arm around my body, closing the space that was separating us. I feel his stack of documents press into the small of my back. I lower my eyes and watch his free hand reach for the hem of my blazer. By the way, he says, fingering the fabric, I'm loving this leather jacket on you. His hand slips under my blazer and then my skirt.\" Hutchinson goes on to say that she was frozen. She felt his frozen fingers trail up her thigh. He said - she says, \"he tilts his chin up. The whites of his eyes looked jaundiced. My eyes dart to John Eastman, who flashes a leering grin.\" Now, that is before Hutchinson says she recoiled from Giuliani's grip and was filled with rage. She then left the area. In response to this, Giuliani's team said these allegations are, and as they put it, a \"disgusting lie,\" questioning the timing of these allegations and claiming it's just marketing for her book. An attorney for Eastman called the claims \"libelous.\" For Giuliani, this adds to the mounting of trouble that he is in, including criminal charges that you well know he is facing in the Georgia election interference case, a lawsuit over unpaid legal bills and a sexual harassment lawsuit from a former personal assistant of Giuliani's. Giuliani has denied all of the allegations. John.",

They both charge broad conspiracies. In Georgia it's a RICO conspiracy as well. But neither involves allegations of sexual crimes or even as part of the means and methods of the conspiracies, sexual misconduct. And it would be extremely, I think, prejudicial to Mr. Giuliani for allegations of sexual misconduct to be heard by the jury. And he would, I think, have a very powerful argument that there's not sufficient probative value of the charges in the case to outweigh that danger of extreme prejudice.",

He's also been sued by a former assistant for allegations of sexual misconduct. And Cassidy Hutchinson's allegations potentially could be relevant in that case.

Calling out Republicans on kind of I would say being misleading a bit on abortion policy or what they can actually pull off, and also on being -- calling Republicans out for being part of the problem when it comes to the nation's deficits and debt.
