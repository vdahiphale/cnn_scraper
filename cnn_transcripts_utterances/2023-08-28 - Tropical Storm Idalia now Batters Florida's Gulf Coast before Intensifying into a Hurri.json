      "sentences": "Yes, well we'll be getting another update in the next couple of hours from the National Hurricane Center. This is the latest information right now, 60 mile an hour winds. A few hours ago the winds supporting this were at just 45. So that may not be much of a bump when you just say it out loud, butin fact that's fairly significant because it's just kind of spinning down here near the Yucatan Strait. But once it moves into that very warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico, that's really going to add fuel to the fire and really increase this rather intensely over the next 12 to 24 hours. We think that by this time tomorrow, we are going to look at a category one, possibly a category two hurricane. Should that happen? Yes. Everyone should take notice pretty much the entire coastline of Florida, that Gulf of Mexico coastline. But even as we go into the next several days up into northern sections of Florida, you will also be impacted by what happens with Idalia, should it become a hurricane, possibly a category two. The computer models are suggesting in fairly good agreement that this is going to make its way towards that bend area of Florida. Now Tampa has not been hit by a hurricane, directly hit, as in the eye moved over Tampa in more than 100 years. And in this particular scenario, it still looks like it's going to be a miss, but don't be fooled because the storm surge is going to be significant here. By storm surge, we mean that wall of water associated with an intense hurricane like this and we could see quite a bit of inundation in those coastal areas. We could see some localized flooding down trees down power lines and we could see this could be a multi-day event, not just for this West Coast of Florida, but in northern sections of Florida into Georgia, also coastal South Carolina, where my beloved state of South Carolina could be impacted, and Charleston in particular, where a summer thunderstorm floods the city there. There you can see the computer model the next five days, suggesting four to six to some isolated areas of as much as 10 inches of rainfall. As I mentioned, the computer models are in fairly good agreement, but remember any kind of a change whether it be 50 miles, could dramatically change where the system makes landfall. By landfall, we mean when that eye crosses the shore, and that's what we refer to as landfall. But it doesn't have to make landfall for the impacts to really be felt across this region. As we go towards Saturday, it'll be off the mid-Atlantic coast, so it will still have its impacts with perhaps the potential for rip current to materialize there. We do have the Hurricane Watch out all the way from the Bend area, the Appalachia Bay area towards Tampa. Even though it's not at hurricane intensity, we are expecting within the next 24 to 48 hours that there will be hurricane conditions there. We'll keep you updated here in the CNN Weather Center.

      "sentences": "Two court hearings are happening simultaneously Monday morning, and each could have significant implications for former President Trump's legal strategy next year.First, in Washington, D.C., a federal judge is holding a hearing on when former President Trump's trial will take place on special counsel Jack Smith's election subversion charges. The special counsel, he wants to hold the hearing in January of next year, about four months from now. But the former president's lawyers, they've proposed a trial date of April 2026, not for another two years. They argue that four months is not enough time and that a January trial would interfere with the former president's other criminal cases. Now, of course, this all will be playing out with the political calendar looming as a January trial date would be happening at the same time as the Republican presidential primaries. Now, in Georgia, a federal judge is holding a hearing on former White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows' request to move his case into federal court. Meadows is one of five of the 19 defendants in Georgia who are trying now to move their case. And the former president is expected to potentially file a similar motion. This is significant because it could affect the jury pool and a federal trial could include a broader spectrum of Georgia residents that could lead to a more pro-Trump jury. So the former president's lawyers, they're likely to be watching what transpires closely on Monday in Georgia. Jeremy Herb, CNN, Washington. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Also among those killed is one of his top lieutenants and a senior aide, and so ends that speculation around Yevgeny Prigozhin's fate. A man whose movements were often very shadowy, very secretive Rosemary, because of concerns, because of his own fears that he could be targeted, that he could be killed.Now, the Kremlin has denied, denied, denied any finger pointing, any accusations that it is involved in this plane crash, calling those absolute lies. But of course, for supporters of Yevgeny Prigozhin, for many Russians, for Western intelligence officials, for even President Biden himself, that simply doesn't fly. This seems to follow the pattern that President Putin, that Kremlin critics have faced, which is that they end up dead in very shadowy circumstances, whether that's poisonings or apparent suicides. And for nearly two months now, Yevgeny Prigozhin has looked like a dead man walking, essentially, since he launched that failed mutiny against President Putin posing the most serious challenge to his rule in nearly two decades. The question now is, as you asked, what happens to the Wagner mercenary group, a group that was very much centered around the personality, around the personhood of Yevgeny Prigozhin. It's hard to see it survive without him. And already before his death, Russia's Ministry of Defense had been taking steps to absorb the group, absorb those contractors under the wing of the regular Russian army. And now more steps being taken with President Putin signing a decree just a couple of days ago. This decree requires volunteer formations. Is the term used often a term used to describe mercenary groups? Volunteer formations, the decree says, have to take an oath to the Russian flag and swear loyalty to the Russian Federation. It goes on to say it must defend courageously the constitutional order. So you see here more moves, more steps that have already been taken before Yevgeny Prigozhin's death, more moves, more steps taken to bring in these contractors, bring in these private mercenary groups under the regular military and under the control of the Russian Ministry of Defense and indeed President Putin himself, Rosemary.",

Secretary-General Antonio Guterres is calling on Zimbabwe's leaders to resolve their election differences in a fair manner. But he says he is also concerned about reports of voter intimidation and suspicious arrests. Zimbabweans voted last week to elect a new president. The Electoral Commission says the incumbent, Emerson Mmengagwa, won with 52 percent. But the opposition and civil society groups say the vote was marred by delayed ballots and voter intimidation, including threats of violence, harassment and coercion. The opposition leader, Nelson Chamisa, is rejecting the vote as illegitimate. And this comes as police arrested 41 election observers after a coalition of human rights groups had publicly outlined multiple alleged voting irregularities. CNN's David McKenzie joins us now live from Johannesburg. So David, what's the latest on this story? DAVID MCKENZIE, CNN SR. INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, the latest is that the opposition is crying foul, as you described, and this is a critically-important election in Zimbabwe, where people in recent months and historically are dealing with rampant inflation and huge economic losses based on underemployment and unemployment. Now, you mentioned the U.N. Secretary General there has obliquely criticized the election. You've had much more forceful statements from both the European Union in their provisional assessment and SADC, the Southern African community of nations, also saying that this election fell short of the requirements of the Zimbabwean constitution. Now, that's significant because historically, SADC hasn't always been that unified in criticizing past issues at the polls in Zimbabwe. You know, opposition leaders I spoke to ahead of these polls, all of them feared that there could be some rigging or problems in the vote. They need to provide the proof of that. What we can expect from the opposition party and Nelson Chamisa in the coming hours, they say they're going to be releasing the details of their data that they say contradicts the official data coming out of both polling stations and out of wider districts. When the news was announced and there was the accusation of potentially rigging, this was the somewhat sarcastic response from the spokesperson of the ruling ZANU-PF.

It shows that Zimbabwe is a democratic. (END VIDEO CLIP) MCKENZIE: Well Zimbabweans are certainly democratic. It remains to be seen whether the Electoral Commission and the government are democratic. Of course, they will need to have proof and the courts will need to litigate this in a fair manner, something that many feel is not realistic in the context of Zimbabwe.
