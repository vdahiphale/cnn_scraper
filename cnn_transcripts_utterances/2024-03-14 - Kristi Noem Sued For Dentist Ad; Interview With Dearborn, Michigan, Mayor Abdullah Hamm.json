He's attending a hearing in Florida for his classified documents cases.His lawyers are trying to get the case dismissed. They're arguing that Trump was completely within his authority to deem the materials his personal records and bring them home after leaving the White House. Special counsel Jack Smith argues top secret national security documents had no place at Mar-a-Lago. Trump-appointed Judge Aileen Cannon is hearing the arguments and she's weighing a potential trial date. We have CNN's Katelyn Polantz at the federal courthouse in Florida.

      "sentences": "Well, Brianna, there are two parts to this hearing. This morning, it has been whether the law was clear enough for DonaldTrump to know that he may have been breaking it when he took those national defense records from the White House to Mar-a-Lago. The judge seemed to tip her hand at the end of the two hours of oral arguments in that question, saying to Trump's team, finding something like this so vague or unconstitutionally vague, as they say it is, that would be an extraordinary step. So that's where the judge seems to be on that particular question. That was one bid that Trump's team was making to try and get the case tossed. But there's another set of arguments this afternoon that are just starting any moment now. And that is about whether these are personal records. Donald Trump says that these were his to choose and his to take from the White House whenever he left the presidency, took them to Mar-a- Lago. He indeed took them. He's admitting to that. But the Justice Department has argued quite clearly that they weren't his. They were national security records. They were things about weapons, defense, military strikes, military retaliation, exposure the United States had, and that those were so clearly national defense pieces of information that Trump knew it because he was president, because he had a sense of how important national security was. And on top of that, already in court, we have heard prosecutors refer to that Bedminster meeting Trump had after he left the presidency, where he waved around a record of military significance and spoke about it being classified, wanting to have it shared more widely and knowing he could not. We're still waiting to see what else Judge Cannon will say today, but we aren't expecting a full ruling from her, at least during court today.",

      "sentences": "Yes, Brianna, he does not have to be there.But one thing to note about this particular case versus what we have seen in the past is that we're not going to see Donald Trump today. There is no microphone setup. There are no cameras there. He's basically going into a garage, going into court, there's no cameras there, leaving and going back to Mar-a-Lago, not delivering remarks, not making a spectacle of it. So it is slightly different from what we have seen on the campaign trail. The other part of this is that we are told that Donald Trump wants to participate in his defense, particularly in this case, and he wants the judge to see him as a willing participant when it comes to this case. But, soon, he is not going to have the option as to whether or not to attend trial. We know that, at the end of the month, we are expected to see that New York hush money trial. It's going to be the first trial, and Donald Trump is required to attend every day of the actual trial. And I'm told he's actually indicated to his staff that, even on the earlier days, like jury selection, that it's procedural, that he might not have to be there for, he wants to be there for. So what you're going to start seeing is even more of this navigating between running a general election campaign and being in and out of a courtroom. For example, Wednesdays and Saturdays, those are the days Donald Trump is not in court in New York. Those are the days they are looking at to plan campaign rallies, to plan campaign events. The other thing to point out here is that this is going to be a very fine line to walk, because they know, Donald Trump's team, just how close a general election rematch with President Joe Biden is going to be. They are trying to already build out their strategy, their teams in these battleground states, particularly states that they think that they could win, states that Biden won in 2020, but Trump won in 2016. However, Donald Trump's not visiting those states. Instead, as we said, he today is in a courtroom in Florida. Then, at the end of the month, he will be forced to be in a courtroom in New York. So how they navigate this is -- it's really going to be an unprecedented thing to watch. KEILAR:  All right. And we will be watching, for sure. Kristen Holmes, thank you for that report -- Boris.",

As to Mr. Butler's testimony, quite frankly, I think that the judge is probably not going to allow him to say a lot of those things in trial, because all he's really saying is that they were white bankers boxes. Let me tell you something. I have searched Trump Tower. There are a lot of white bankers boxes that look very much the same, because you can buy them at Staples. And he used them for old real estate documents, campaign documents, all sorts of things. Some of the documents in the National Archives right now are full of documents that all postdate the presidency. Things go into March of 2021. So the idea that, because there's white boxes, that must be classified documents, yes, that's a stretch that I don't think the judge would ever allow them to get to a jury.",
