It is 7 pm here in Abu Dhabi.Well, today, a focus on police in Brazil's capital after Sunday's violent protests. President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva says Brasilia's police not only neglected the threat of an attack but appeared to connive with rioters; 1,500 people have been arrested. Thousands of tips are now pouring in. Among the questions being asked, how did protesters apparently walk right into several government buildings and do so much damage? They're loyal to former president Jair Bolsonaro. He is in the U.S. Being treated for an old stab wound. Brazil is not planning to investigate him in this most recent unrest. We are seeing backlash against the protests. People taking to the streets on behalf of democracy, they say. CNN's Shasta Darlington is with us from Sao Paulo. Let's talk about those allegations by president Lula da Silva, that the police, at the very least, looked the other way. What can you tell us? What do we know at this point?",

And Iran's supreme leader has appointed a new hardline police chief who is already sanctioned by the United States. General Ahmad-Reza Radan was among the Iranian officials sanctioned by the U.S. in 2010 for human rights abuses during the 2009 protests.

      "sentences": "Well, Becky, these statements coming today from the office of the attorney general, the Iranian regime sayingthat they're ordering authorities to enforce harsher, stricter measures on those of violating the country's mandatory hijab or veil law. Now typically, women face 10 days to two months in prison for not wearing the veil. Right now, what they're saying is that these women are going to be facing the possibility of travel bans, fines, no access to public services and even harsher measures for those who encourage women, they say, not to wear the veil. They'll be facing one to 10 years in prison because, according to the attorney general's office, that is encouraging corruption. You know, Becky, as you recall, just a few weeks ago, there were all these speculations when we started hearing statements and reports coming out from different Iranian officials, indicating that they were reviewing the hijab law. All the speculation about the future of the morality police, reports that it was being abolished. Those who know the regime will have been saying all along that there is absolutely no way it is going to compromise one of on the pillars of the Islamic Republic and that is the hijab. There was no way they were going to show any sort of weakness by caving in to the pressure from protesters on the streets, by offering any sort of concessions. The regime's response has been very clear from the start with this brutal crackdown. It is now entering an even more terrifying phase with these executions. As you mentioned, also more indications that they're not backing down, the appointment of General Radan to become the country's national police chief by the supreme leader this Saturday. Also  indications we are going to be seeing an even harsher crackdown in the coming days. But Becky, it is very important to point out that, while the issue of the hijab, the death of Mahsa Amini in the, custody of the morality police was the spark of these protests, so many Iranians will tell you that this is not just what these protests have been about. As you know very well, this has been about the most basic of human rights and fundamental rights for the people, to women to choose whether or not to wear the hijab, to be able to speak freely without the fear of going to jail or facing the threat of the death penalty, Becky.",

And Palestinians are ready to see this as yet another attempt by this new right-wing and religiously conservative government to demonize Palestinians and undermine what is, for Palestinians, a hugely important symbol of national identity. Of course, this is not the first time the Palestinian flag has caused controversy. We -- you'll recall, the funeral of the Al Jazeera journalist, Shireen Abu Akleh, who was killed last year, probably by Israeli forces. And mourners there, some of whom were carrying or unfurling Palestinian flags, had the Palestinian flags confiscated from them. I should also add, Ben-Gvir today, seeking to clarify some of his words. He seems to be saying that he's not really creating new laws on the hoof; he wants police to enforce laws that are already in existence. He refers to the flag not as the Palestinian flag but as the PLO flag, the flag of the Palestinian Liberation Organization. He says this is a terrorist organization. It is bent on destroying the State of Israel. Whatever the case, I think, as I say, you know, Palestinians see this is another way -- there are cars going past here -- another way for this government to try to undermine Palestinians.

We're also told that there will be the announcement of the building of more physical resource centers, including one in southern Mexico. Again, the idea there, too, is to provide a resource for migrants to go to, to figure out how they can migrate to the U.S. following proper procedures. But back at home, at least, there are some questions being raised by immigration advocates and experts about how exactly effective these new measures will be. You know, the virtual portal that I just mentioned, it is going to be several months probably before that's actually launched. So we don't actually have the details of how that will work yet. And also, just keep in mind that, when you talk to experts on this issue, they will often point out the fact that, you know, these asylum seekers, for many of them, the reason they go straight to the U.S. southern border and try to enter the country there before first applying for asylum properly is because they're trying to escape the situation back at home that is so dire. And because they are feeling so desperate. So there are some concerns about closing the door on people like that.

The U.S. Justice Department reviewing the situation after several classified documents from Joe Biden's time as vice president were discovered at a Washington think tank. Now the president's lawyers found the materials last fall while closing out the private office. They of course were turned over to the National Archives the following day. The discovery is now being compared to the case involving former president Donald Trump, who is being investigated over scores of classified records found in his Florida home. A source says the Justice Department is asking the U.S. attorney in Chicago to investigate. Senior legal affairs correspondent Paula Reid joining us now from Washington, D.C.

The Biden team says they're fully cooperating with this investigation but there's still so many outstanding questions, including why this office, why this day, just a few days before critical midterms, why did you send your lawyers? What were these documents? A lot of questions still to be answered. I think the biggest one is, why didn't you get out in front of this? If everyone did what they were supposed to do, why didn't either the Biden team or the Justice Department come out? Well, it's usually frowned upon to talk about matters -- just get out in front of this? This leak came out through the press. Now, of course, the former president Trump, he's also under criminal investigation for possibly mishandling documents down at Mar-a-Lago. But a lot of differences here. First of all, the volume of material:  fewer than a dozen versus hundreds of documents, levels of cooperation. The former president has not been cooperative, really refused to turn over many documents until there were subpoenas obtained. He's also under investigation for obstruction of justice and other crimes. So the way the Biden team is laying this out, these appear to be very different. But we are still very new to the story.

Yesterday, we heard from the deputy defense minister, who said that the Russians had amassed a huge number of troops, a huge number of weaponry, equipment, and they were going ahead with what he described as a powerful assault, launching new multiple launch rocket strikes, new artillery strikes. Really trying their best to give everything that they can to try to punch a hole in that front line because, we know, Becky, that Soledar is especially important to the Russians for a couple of reasons. Number one, the head of the Wagner group says that there is a salt mine there. There is a salt mine there; the shaft is in the town.

It's what makes this observation of decreased artillery firing so interesting. At the height of the war into summer, that we saw the massive barrages of artillery, Russia was firing upwards of 20,000 artillery shells per day. A tremendous amount that speaks to the Russians' stores of artillery ammunition. Now according to U.S. officials familiar the matter, who have seen the information about this, Russia's artillery fire is way down; in some cases, as much as 75 percent, down to about 5,000  artillery rounds per day. What makes this so crucial and so critical to understand is that the Russian military doctrine basically calls for these mass barrages of artillery. And then ground troops go in and kind of mop up or take over whatever is left over. So the fact that Russia's artillery fire is down is significant. Of course, Becky, the key question is, why? The Pentagon and Defense officials here have spoken about Russia needing to use 40-, 50-year old artillery output (ph) to keep firing. So it could be a question of Russian stores. Defense officials have talked extensively about Russia's shortage of precision guided munitions. That, now, as we reach the one-year mark, may have also reached their conventional munitions. But U.S. and Ukrainian officials are not convinced of that. They say there are other possibilities. Ukraine has hit Russian weapons depots, so that may have made a dent at this point. But crucially, it may also be a shift in tactic coming from Russia's new theater commander, saving perhaps for an offensive or for months more fighting ahead.
