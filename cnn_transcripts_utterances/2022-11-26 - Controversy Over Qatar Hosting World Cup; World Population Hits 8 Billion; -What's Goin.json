Last Saturday in Colorado Springs, an attacker clad in body armor opened fire in an LGBTQ nightclub during a drag show and killed five people. Then on Tuesday in Virginia, a Walmart manager gunned down six coworkers. He purchased the gun legally that very morning.So far this year, there have been more than 600 mass shootings, according to the Gun Violence Archive. That's based on a definition of four or more shot or killed, not including the shooter. On Thanksgiving Day, President Biden spoke at a firehouse on Nantucket, said that he would attempt to pass some form of gun control before a new Congress is seated in January. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

REEVESThere's no reason to think that fathers matter any less just because women are in the workplace. Arguably, fathers matter even more now that we've changed the world so that women can work too. And so, it's not a zero-sum game. There's no evidence that the rise of women is responsible for the fall of men. But we are seeing many men struggling even as many women are doing better in the labor market and in the world in general. And so, we can think two thoughts at once.

And again, this is not a surprise to anyone that has sons and daughters, knows boys and girls, has never been a boy or a girl, which is a 15, 16-year-old boy and girl. They're actually just -- they're not equivalent in terms of their brain development.And so what that means is that girls are at something of an advantage just because they develop earlier, partly because they hit puberty earlier. So redshirting is a proposal whereby boys would start school a year later than girls in terms of their chronological age. That would somewhat narrow the developmental gap and would actually create more of a level playing field in education than the one we have right now, simply because of these biological differences in the timing of brain development.

Last week, FIFA, the sport's governing body, announced that no alcohol would be sold at the stadiums.And then on Monday, captains from seven countries were warned that they would receive yellow cards if they wore armbands, promoting inclusion and opposing discrimination. Qatar, a tiny golf nation with a population smaller than that of Connecticut, had little footballing history when it won the rights to host the sport's biggest event. Is the World Cup being played in Qatar good for the sport or good for the world? Qatar invested billions in preparation for the tournament. Seven new stadiums, new hotels, and expansion to the country's airport, rail networks, highways. Since migrants account for some 90 percent of Qatar's total workforce, according to Amnesty International, this raised the issue of Qatar's poor record around the welfare of migrant workers. Human rights organizations have found that since 2010, many migrant workers have faced delayed or unpaid wages, forced labor, long hours in hot weather, employer intimidation, and the inability to leave their jobs because of the country's sponsorship system. In response to Western critics, the FIFA President delivered an hour long tirade, including this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Now for the future, whether or not we'll see large waves of immigration really depend on whether the countries of Africa can build the resources, the resilience, the economies, to cope with the climate change that's already under way.
