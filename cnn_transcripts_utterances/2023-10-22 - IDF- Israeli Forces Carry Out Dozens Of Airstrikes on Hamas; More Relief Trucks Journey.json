And as you say, there are also the first skirmishes on the ground inside the Gaza strip between Israeli troops and Hamas militants.In that clash, one IDF soldier was killed, and three were injured. And Hamas says from an anti-tank missiles, Hamas says that it managed to destroy a couple bulldozers and a tank. But this wasn't, it doesn't seem, the starting gun, for lack of a better phrase, over ground invasion. There could be all matter of reasons as to why it's not happened just yet, everything ranging from the weather to attempts to secure the release of more hostages, to perhaps indecision, or perhaps to simply changing facts on the ground. We don't know when or how Israel is going to go in. It is adamant that it is going to go in one point, it's what we're expecting, I suppose it's what the Israeli public will be demanding given the savagery and the gravity of the attack and, of course, Hamas holding those 200-plus hostages still inside the Gaza Strip.

IYAD ISSA ABU ZAHER, DIRECTOR GENERAL, AL AQSA MARTYRS HOSPITAL (through translator): It's impossible for any hospital in the world to admit this number of injured. And it's impossible for any medical crew to work with these large numbers of injured. And every injured person needs four or five specialized surgeons and surgeries. And this puts a large burden on the medical group. You can't offer medical services the same way in a war zone that you would give to patients in a normal situation, injuries in the dozens. There is no room or hospital beds for these injuries. The injured were at the doorstep of operation rooms and on top of each other. Each waiting their turn for an operation, and the situation is catastrophic. at Al Aqsa Martyrs Hospital.

But the fact remains that without a cease-fire, without a massive increase in aid, we are going to see the number of children, boys and girls in Gaza, the number killed, we're going to see that skyrocket.We urgently, Michael, need a massive increase in aid there. It really is a matter of life or death now, getting medicines in, getting water in. There's grave shortages. And it can unfortunately get much worse. It's hard to say that when you quote the numbers you say of children being killed, but there's no doubt that the situation can get much worse for them, because aid in the amounts that they need right now is not nearly enough. Michael, UNICEF has enough aid for a quarter million people. We can get that into Gaza in a matter of hours. We're not able to do that right now. That has to change. We need unconditional aid.

And, yes, UNICEF, we are front line. I have colleagues in Gaza. And what we know is the longer the fighting goes on, the longer the intensity, the longer we wait for the adults to bring a cease-fire for these children, the more ingrained that gets.

This was initiated by House Republicans, and they have not been able to coalesce around anyone to replace McCarthy as of yet.And the House can't do any business, no legislating at all until a speaker is elected. And they have been unable to unite behind any candidate. First, they nominated Steve Scalise, the House Republican majority leader. He was unable to get the votes to be elected speaker. He bowed out before going to the floor. Jim Jordan, House judiciary committee chair, was nominated then to be the next speaker of the House. He did go to the floor, three times, and he failed to win over enough support. He could only afford to lose four Republican votes on this party vote. He lost 25 on his third ballot. Ultimately, he bowed to reality and stepped aside. Now nine Republican candidates have filed to run for speaker. Unclear which of those nine will ultimately get the Republican nomination and, more importantly, who can get the 217 votes that they would need on the floor of the House to be elected speaker. It is unclear if any of them can given the sharp divisions within the ranks. REP. DUSTY JOHNSON (R-SD): It is the biggest F-U to Republican I've ever seen. REP.
