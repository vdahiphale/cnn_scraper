Now there is no connection to our knowledge of any relationship beyond this photo that's still yet to be determined. So he put it up there basically with no truth behind this photo.That led to the court after lunch starting later today -- about 45 minutes later -- the judge took to the bench and essentially issued a warning to a particular defendant didn't say Trump by name, but essentially said that there was a disparaging, untrue and personally identifiable post about a member of his staff. He ordered that it be deleted. It was deleted, but he said it was also emailed out to millions of people. And he said: Personal attacks of any member of my court staff are unacceptable, inappropriate and I will not tolerate that. And he ordered that no one speak publicly about any member of his staff, and if so, that would result in serious sanctions. So a very strict warning to the defendants. He said he had warned about anything like this prior to this trial starting. And here he is again, warning again. And at this point, we also know that Eric Trump left the courtroom after that sort of admonishment by the judge. But certainly this was a delay in this trial.

And I would suggest chaotic. We cannot do that. It was only because we forced that to happen. And by the way, if we continue with Speaker McCarthy, the appropriations process will go right back to what he wanted it to go back to, just a sideshow. Just a puppet show. Just something to keep the hamsters on the hamster wheel as they continue to back people up against a calendar. Centralized power with the lobbyists and special interests that move all kind of money through the leadership. And then that's how they get their way.

PATRICK MCHENRY (R-NC): Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Every step of the way, Speaker McCarthy has been doubted. After the first speaker vote, he was mocked, right? And after 15, they called him Speaker. And even then, it was the media on the left that mocked him. With the narrowest Republican majority in a generation what do we achieve? We brought the President to the table when he stubbornly said for 100 days, they would not negotiate on the debt ceiling. I took him at his word. The speaker said no, we'll get him to the table. And sure enough, we did. The result, the most conservative spending package we've seen in generations, the largest spending cuts year over year than any Congress has passed. Conservative outcomes. So I understand your position on the left, I understand that. But my friends on the right. Why? And then this past weekend -- so I understand the frustration on the left and what happened on the continued resolution -- but why would we have conservatives object to that? Why will we have House members object to that? We rolled the Senate. We never roll the Senate as a House. Moreover, we never roll the Senate to get less spending and we got it this weekend. So I understand why the left is mad. What I don't understand is why some Republicans think that that's a bad thing. The frustration for me today, I understand where the liberals are. I know you could support the constitutional order, except in a moment like this when you are questioned on that. I understand that. You can't be counted on in a moment like this with the state of the speakership. But for Republicans, why will we give up a conservative working majority for better outcomes and hand the keys over to the Democrats? Why would we do that? And furthermore, with this record of success that we've seen Kevin McCarthy and a Republican majority produce in a Washington run by Democrats. We're going to throw that away, resulting in more liberal outcomes, not more conservative ones. So I understand why the left is where you are today. You don't like an effective conservative majority, and I don't blame you. But on the right, rethink there.",

Kevin McCarthy's fate as House Speaker is about to be decided, and frankly, it does not look good for him. Any minute the House of Representatives will vote on a motion to oust him from his job. It's a vote that he tried but failed to block earlier today with eleven of his fellow House Republicans voting with every Democrat to proceed with this vote coming up to kick him out.And if Kevin McCarthy loses this vote, coming up in just minutes, he will become the first House Speaker in the history of the United States of America to lose his job by a vote from his colleagues. It has simply never happened before. And the House of Representatives will then have to pick a new speaker which could become utter chaos. There is no obvious consensus pick at least as of now. We're also following some breaking news out of New York. Also kind of part of the same nihilistic chaotic theme. A judge has just issued A partial gag order in Donald Trump's civil fraud case. Judge Arthur Engoron rebuked Donald Trump. Because Donald Trump went on social media and smeared one of the judge's clerks. And the judge forbade everyone involved from making any future comments about his staff. One would think that would be obvious for a defendant to not do -- about a judge who is going to decide his fate, not to mention just basic decency. But welcome to 2023.

One is, hey, are we not doing anything? It seems like we're not doing anything. That's the Matt Gaetz, right? Maybe your oversight is political theater. Maybe we haven't passed all the things we said we did. And then the other are people like Jim Jordan, people who are getting up and saying, no, we have done a lot. And I can see why Democrats would want to sit through this debate and say, yes, let them have this conversation and explain to the American people whether or not they can do anything they said they have or anything at all functionally.

Our economy is breaking in half. A typical American family can't afford to buy a house in 99 percent of U.S. counties. Inflation is stealing more than $700.00 a month from working Americans nearly $9,000 a year. Kevin McCarthy is the Speaker of the House of Representatives and he has failed to take a stand where it matters. So if he won't, I will. I make no apologies for defending the right of every hard-working American to afford a decent life for themselves and their families, and we have a greater opportunity to do that, and to build coalitions under new leadership. We have to rip off the Band-Aid. We have to get back on a better course. And Mr. Speaker, I don't know how this vote's going to go. Usually when a vote comes to this floor, it's pretty predetermined. And this one I'm not so sure. But I am sure that we've made the right argument. That this place deserves single subject spending bills. That we should have 72 hours to read a bill. That's something that spends more than $100 million shouldn't be put on the suspension of the agenda such that we can't amend it. And there shouldn't be secret side deals made on a continuing resolution to lump Ukraine in with border security. That is a -- that is not right for Ukraine or border security because it fails to give either of those issues the dignity that they would require. But we can return that dignity to this House. We can get back on a better path. We can have single subject appropriations bills. We can set a budget, a budget, top line. We haven't had a budget in this place since I was in high school. So let's get a budget. Let's get our act together. Let's get on with it. Let's vacate the chair and let's get a better speaker. I yield back.",
