Ukraine, of course, expected to be high on the agenda. A strike by 33,000 workers is the latest trouble for Boeing, now, corporate America's problem child. And meet the TikTokers using the platform to try and influence US politics. Live from New York, it is Friday, September 13th. I'm Paula Newton for Richard Quest and this is QUEST MEANS BUSINESS. We do begin at the White House where US President Joe Biden is considering whether to let Ukraine use long-range missiles inside of Russia. Now, it is sure to come up when Mr. Biden meets with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer later this hour. Officials say they don't expect the president to lift those restrictions on western missiles right away, but the fact that it is up for discussion is in fact a major development. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy sat down with our own Fareed Zakaria for an exclusive interview in Ukraine. He says long-range weapons should be used only against military targets.

This believed to be a British Storm Shadow, a long range stealth cruise missile hitting Russia'sBlack Sea fleet headquarters in Crimea last year. Russian territory has been off limits. Now a major reason for that is of course, western fears of Russian escalation. But recently the US has also been arguing that actually lifting those restrictions wouldn't make much difference on the battlefield because it claims many high-value targets, including aircraft that dropped those deadly glide bombs are out of range. But what exactly is in range? Well, this map from the Institute for the Study of War suggests that there are well over 200 targets still in reach of US ATACMS. Those are the red dots you see there. And among them is also the headquarters of Russia's Southern Military District in Rostov and dozens of command centers, storage depots, weapons production facilities, and military regiments, including, for example, the 52nd Guards Heavy Bomber Regiment, believed to be responsible for a deadly cruise missile attack on an apartment block in Dnipro last January.

Thirty-three thousand union members have rejected a new contract and walked off the job at the plane maker. It is the latest in Boeing's no good, very bad year. It started in January when a door plug blew off a plane mid-flight. The company has since seen a new CEO, multiple investigations and its Starliner spacecraft returned to Earth without its astronauts. Boeing's stock reflects the misfortune down nearly 40 percent from the start of the year. S&amp;P says an extended strike could further hurt the stock's rating. Ben Tsocanos is the airspace director at S&amp;P Global Ratings and he joins me now from New York. Good to have you on this story, and as we said, the trouble just keeps coming for Boeing. Right now, the CFO just hours ago acknowledging that, look, this strike will jeopardize its overall recovery. How did Boeing get here? BEN TSOCANOS, AIRSPACE DIRECTOR, S&amp;P GLOBAL RATINGS: Well, I think you summed it up pretty well.

The job is preparing and knowing that any possible Plan B, C, or D can be thrown at you and that you just have to deal with it. And so, I asked them what has it been like, this mental transition for you going from a roughly eight-day mission to an eight-month mission, and Butch Wilmore said, honestly, the transition was pretty quick for me. Once I knew, he said I am not a shoulda, woulda, coulda kind of guy. Once the decision was made, I was on board. Now, I will say this, as Starliner's commander and as a Navy test pilot, he said it was tough because you don't want to see your ship go off without you.

Thetwo are expected to discuss Western restrictions on Ukraine's use of long- range missiles. Kyiv would like to use NATO weapons to strike deep within Russia. The President has signaled he's open to the idea, though, the White House says there is no decision that is imminent as of yet. Alexander Vindman was the director of European Affairs for the U.S. National Security Council, and he joins me now. It is good to see you, especially as we await this latest meeting. I mean, look, bottom line, how detrimental do you believe it will be if Ukraine continues to be handcuffed by these restrictions? ALEXANDER VINDMAN, FORMER DIRECTOR FOR EUROPEAN AFFAIRS, U.S. NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL: I think it's significant in that right now, Putin believes he's he really has NATO as a whole over a barrel. He's been able to signal through threats on nuclear escalations, lots of saber rattling that somehow there will be a significant cost to NATO. And that's had an impact throughout the war, throughout the 2-1/2 years impacting how quickly we provide support, how much support we provide. And he's been doing that right now. Just recently, he said that, you know, provision of long-range weapons to Ukraine could result in a direct confrontation with NATO. Something that he said at least a dozen times. But the idea would be that he continues to affect our decision making, impedes the kinds of support that we should be providing to a partner, an ally, in the form of Ukraine defending itself against unprovoked aggression. So, I think this is a doable. This is -- we should -- something that we should be moving towards expanding that or lifting the restrictions on Ukraine and the way we offer them weapons and support in general, but I think it's -- it is not an easy thing to do. It would be a significant policy shift to from -- what we've seen thus far.",

And a nuclear war would be mutually assured destruction. So, that's not a realistic scenario, it's not in Putin's interest. Putin's interest right now are to impede the -- any fulsome support to Ukraine and then to try to deter expanding support by doing what he's already doing now, which is hybrid warfare, sabotage operations, interference and those are the areas that he's likely to respond in. He's not going to respond directly. But he's more than likely to expand the kinds of operations he's already doing through intelligence services that he's doing by supporting enemies of the West, whether that's the Houthis in Yemen, Iran, with provision of more advanced capabilities. That's the way he's likely to react to lifting of further restrictions on cupping Ukraine.",

According to U.S. intelligence, R.T. plays a key role in spreading the Kremlin's propaganda.

Today was about warning other countries and citing specific examples in South America, Africa, elsewhere that U.S. officials strongly believe and they have evidence to show that R.T. employees are sort of an extension of the Russian government. And in this case, they've alleged that the Russian government has embedded an intelligence unit within R.T. I should say that CNN reached out to R.T. for comment and they provided what is a typical response to -- a mocking response, sarcastic response that said, in part, we're broadcasting right now from KGP headquarters, referencing the Soviet Union spy service. So, they're not taking these allegations seriously, but the U.S. is hoping, Paula, that allies will as we continue to see elections held around the world this year.",

It'll lay out, at least in broad strokes, what the Ukrainians will do with regards to their own industry. And I'll probably cast a vision where the Ukrainians, without telegraphing too much in the way of details, that they will build capacity for probably a major operation in the second half of next year. So, it's not something that's derived from, you know, tactical changes or even operational changes. It's a strategic plan that's supposed to look in the future. One of the things that would concern me about this plan is that it should include components like mobilization, a larger number of Ukrainians that could be mobilized to fight in the war. Mobilization of Ukraine's industrial base, support from the west are -- and then better trading for the Ukrainians. So, like this -- they can conduct complex operations. Those would be the key elements that I would want to see in a plan of this sort. And then something that allows the Ukrainians to be tied through the next year or six months. This winter is going to be probably one of the hardest winters for the Ukrainians, based on the Russian strikes, on power generation. It's going to be a cold winter. So, I think those are the elements that should be communicated to the west and much, much deeper behind scenes, in closed, classified channels.

Russia would certainly be apt to test whether it could win in a year or two years, given the fact that they would have the tacit support of a Trump administration in their corner. We would not see a reduction in violence. We potentially would see an expansion violence. And frankly, I would have deep concerns about a broader spillover. Various European powers understand that they strongly believe that they're next in the crosshairs of Russia.
