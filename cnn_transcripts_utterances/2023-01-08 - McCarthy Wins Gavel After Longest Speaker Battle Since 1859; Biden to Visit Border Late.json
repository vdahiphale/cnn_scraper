After 15 ballots and four days, Kevin Owen McCarthy became the 55th speaker of the House early on Saturday morning. This week offered us a rare and maybe unprecedented window into the drama taking place on the House floor as a party went to war with itself. The wheeling and dealing, as different factions hunted for support, the agony of the vote that went the wrong way for McCarthy, parents on the floor dealing with fussy babies and new and former leaders sharing a moment of levity, board members looking for subtle ways to pass the time. And most dramatically, a near brawl just after 11:00 p.m. on Friday night. But after a half an hour and a sudden turn of fortunes, the dissenters finally gave McCarthy a win at the literal 11th hour.

What the Biden administration announced last week is basically to say, if you have a connection to the United States, we're going to make it easier for you to come in legally.But the critics, including some Democrats, say that basically that leaves people who are truly fearing for their lives out in the cold. Here's a statement from a bunch of Democratic senators. \"We are deeply disappointed by the Biden administration's decision to expand the use of Title 42. Continuing to use this failed and inhumane Trump era policy put in place to address a public health crisis will do nothing to restore the rule of law at the border.\" And it may not stop the flow because some of the people walking up to the border, they don't have passports, they don't have cell phones, they don't have connections in the United States. They're just coming because it's a sign of desperation. ZELENY,: Fleeing for a reason, absolutely. But that statement there indicates one thing. Excuse me. President Biden's biggest problems, of course, are House Republicans on immigration. But it is probably the more pressing serious ones are Democrats. Democrats are deeply disappointed in what this administration has and hasn't done. He's not taken this as seriously. You can hear by his rhetoric there. So that, of course, is why he's going. Yes, it's a photo op, but anytime a president invests time in going to a place, it is showing that they're taking it seriously, at least politically. So we'll see what comes of this. But that is his issue with the Senate Democrats. It's a huge challenge for him.
