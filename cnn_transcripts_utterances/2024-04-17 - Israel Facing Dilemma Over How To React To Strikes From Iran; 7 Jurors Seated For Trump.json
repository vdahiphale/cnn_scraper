This missile was actually found in the Dead Sea. It was recovered and it was taken to this base in southern Israel. But now Israel says it must respond. It must reestablish deterrence. They say this attack cannot go unanswered. The only question now is how the Israeli military will respond. And when. And so when you see that video, you can really just get a sense of the size and the scale of these missiles and the destructive power that they could potentially deliver. I'm told that the warhead on top of that missile would typically weigh about a half a ton, a half a ton of explosives of destructive power. And so you can just think if these missiles had indeed made it through Israel's air defense systems, the kind of destruction that they could have caused.

Trump was seen craning his neck toward him and flashing a smirk. Judge Juan Merchan issued a stern warning to Trump after he visibly reacted to a juror's answers about a video she posted on social media. He warned Trump's lawyer your client was audibly uttering. I will not have any jurors intimidated in the courtroom. That juror was questioned outside the presence of the others about a video she posted on social media showing an outdoor celebration quote spreading the honking cheer around Election Day 2020. She said it was a New York celebratory moment. Trump's lawyers suggested she was biased. The judge said he believed the juror could be fair and didn't excuse her. Trump's attorney Todd Blanche, telling those in the jury pool quote is extraordinarily important to President Trump that we know we're going to get a fair shake. One juror said he finds Trump fascinating because he quote walks into a room and he sets people off one way or the other. Blanche seemed amused with the response. Another juror said she learned for the first time Tuesday that Trump has been charged in three other cases. Prosecutor Joshua Steinglass address prospective jurors asking them to set aside any strong feelings. He asked each to consider if they would be able to look defendant Trump in the eye and return a guilty verdict, if the case is proven beyond a reasonable doubt.

But USC says this has nothing to do with free speech. This is purely about safety. They say that over the past few days, the discussion around this speaker has some alarming red flags and they say that they've seen what's happened on other college campuses as people disagree over what's happening in the Middle East and they say that they can't afford to have similar violence and harassment at USC if this young woman speaks. Now, I spoke to Asna Tabassum, who says that she does not believe this has anything to do with safety. She wouldn't tell me what she was planning to say in her speech. But she said it was going to be about hope. Take a listen. ASNA TABASSUM, U.S.C. VALEDICTORIAN: Whether or not I planned to speak about Palestine, speak about any sort of conflict in general I think is beside the point. The point here is that the university preemptively made a decision not on the basis of safety, but on the basis of potentially other factors that I think impedes on my freedom of expression.",

The U.S. recorded 8,873 anti-Semitic incidents for the entire year.And October 7, the day Hamas fighters murdered innocent men, women, and children in Israel is a key data point. Because for that quarter of the year from then until the end of the year, there were 5,204 anti-Semitic incidents. Now, the number is more than the total for every year since 1979 when the ADL began their record-keeping. And it seems there's two ways to look at this. One would be to consider 2023 an outlier, with an expectation that once the war in Gaza ends, the numbers would fall. Or 2023 is the year when anti-Semitism got a foothold once again in civil society. And a growing number of Americans think that's fine. So which way do you go",

And then we had Charlottesville and it went up even more. Then I thought after that it would go down. And then we had Pittsburgh and then we had Poway (ph) and then we had January 6th. And 2022 was the worst year we ever saw at ADL until again last year. And if we look at this data, what's so alarming, it's not the 400-plus businesses that were targeted and vandalized it's not the over 1,000 incidents on college campuses. It's not even the 2000-plus acts of vandalism. It's that in every situation there is a child, a son, or a daughter, a brother or a sister, a dad or a mom, a grandmother or a grandfather, a person who has actually experienced this hate. That's what makes it so troubling. So look, I certainly would hope and pray that as things cool down in the Middle East, things would cool down here at home.
