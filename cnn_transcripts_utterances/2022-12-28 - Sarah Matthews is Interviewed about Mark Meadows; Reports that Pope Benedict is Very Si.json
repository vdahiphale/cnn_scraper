And so that's what will be interesting to learn is, were those documents that Mark Meadows was burning in his fireplace original copies and what was the nature of those documents. COLLINS: Yes, and I should note, Cassidy Hutchinson testified she didn't know if they were originals or if they were copies, what that (INAUDIBLE). We haven't heard from Mark Meadows on that.
