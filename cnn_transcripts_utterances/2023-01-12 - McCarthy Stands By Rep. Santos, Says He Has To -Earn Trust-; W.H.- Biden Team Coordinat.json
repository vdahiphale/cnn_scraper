Look, I want to reiterate what you heard from the President today. It is important for the American people to know this, is that the President has said he takes classified documents and information very seriously. This is something as you all know, that he will not shy away from saying and has continued to say this this week. And again, he was surprised that these records have been found. He does not know what's in them. And his team, once they identified that these documents were there, they immediately reached out to the Archives, to the Department of Justice and did the, rightfully so, did the right thing by turning that over. And they have been cooperating very closely with the Department of Justice. You actually heard AG, Attorney General Garland say today that they heard from his team, really shortly after the discovery.

It's in the statement of -- from his lawyer, Richard Sauber, and at the end, he said we are confident that they are -- a thorough review will show that these documents were inadvertently misplaced. And the President and his lawyers acted promptly upon discovery of this mistake. I'm going to leave it there. That's what his lawyer said.

Is the White house being transparent about that if that was already known and not discussed up front?JEAN-PIERRE: So just to -- you said transparent, I want to say that we have been transparent here. That is why the minute that his lawyers found those documents, they reported it, they reached out to the Archives and the Department of Justice. And they did that voluntarily. And they were not compelled to do it. They did it voluntarily. Now I want to step back a little bit as you're asking me about the timeline. Look, the lawyer said we have been working closely with the Department of Justice and coordinating a search that was still ongoing to ensure any additional documents were in the proper possession of the government. After that search -- after the search concluded last night, we released a statement disclosing the facts from that search. As you all know, this morning.

And again, he takes this very seriously when it comes to classified information, when it comes to classified documents. And again, it still stays the same. He was surprised that the records were found. He does not know what's in them, that has not changed.

I can speak to what we have done and what is already out there. We laid out a statement pretty extensively on Monday.

All but one of these documents were found in storage space in the President's Wilmington residence garage. One document consisting of one page was discovered among stored materials in an adjacent room. No documents were found in the Rehoboth Beach House. Look, I just want to underscore that this is something, again, that the President takes very seriously. It underscores how we executed the search with the DOJ to make sure that they continued cooperating fully with the review. And I think that is what we are trying to be very clear about is that we have been -- the President's lawyers has been cooperating fully, fully.

He did not know the records were there. He was surprised that the records were there. So let's be very clear, that is something that the President shared with all of you on the world stage and also recently today.
