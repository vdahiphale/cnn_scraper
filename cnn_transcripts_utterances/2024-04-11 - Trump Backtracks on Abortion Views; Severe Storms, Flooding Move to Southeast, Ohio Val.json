Back in 2016, he released a list of 11 Supreme Court justices he would consider appointing to convince skeptical evangelical voters, who are the bedrock of the Republican base, that he, Trump, was one of them, or at least that he would act like one of them. Then to hammer that home, he picked the very publicly pious Mike Pence as his running mate. And then he was elected president, and he transformed the Supreme Court. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

But the issue can be defined by his past, as Democrats are clearly going to do, not just in talking about Donald Trump, but in seeing -- and putting videos like you just showed over and over again. And does that mean that Donald Trump can't win in November? No. Certainly, if you look at where Biden is on every issue other than abortion, he's -- he's underwater, often deeply underwater. But it does make it hard to win over, certainly, those suburban women who aren't satisfied with Joe Biden's presidency, who are otherwise gettable. This makes it much more impactful. ZOLAN KANNO-YOUNGS, CNN POLITICAL ANALYST: The difficult thing, even then, his attempt to find nuance is -- you know, in the most recent statement where he tried to defer to states on this issue. He's still opened up by also mentioning that he, basically, is responsible for the makeup of the Supreme Court currently, right? So people are going to notice those comments, as well. And also, his kind of attempt to sort of meander this and pivot, that goes up against videos and testimonies showing the human toll of this. I mean, immediately, once this statement was made by the former president, you saw the Biden campaign initially start making statements distributing videos, as well, like powerful ones that you just saw. So, will sort of these quick answers, trying to sort of \"both sides\" it, you know, match up against some of the emotion and pathos that's shown in those videos? I mean, that's -- that's really going to be the challenge going forward, at least for his argument.",

The risk that Republicans have in Washington is that what's happening is state legislatures or judiciaries are sort of legislating out loud. And you don't know which state is going to be next and what those rules are going to be. Certainly, we weren't thinking about -- when we're talking about South Carolina or Texas, for instance, weren't thinking about laws that went back to the Civil War.
