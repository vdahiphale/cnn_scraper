      "sentences": "Well, President-elect Donald Trump is likely to have some sort of ending to the Russia- Ukraine War, or at least negotiations fairly high on his priority list when he comes in on January 20th. He has claimed the war would never have started if he was president, and said at least once on the campaign trail that he could end the war in a day.The question is how? And that's where the specifics, the details have been very short. Retired General Keith Kellogg, who served in the first Trump administration, is one of those speaking with Mike Waltz, the incoming national security advisor, to lay out at least a potential plan or an idea for how to proceed here and his idea, according to two sources familiar with the matter is to essentially hold off on arming Ukraine, unless they're willing to partake in peace negotiations with Russia. But that's only one of the options being considered here. Ric Grenell, who was Trump's former ambassador to Germany, has a different idea. And that's the creation of autonomous zones along the front line and in the areas where we have seen fighting, where Russian forces have taken territory in Ukraine. And there have been even some other ideas. Sebastian Gorka who will be a deputy in the National Security Council, suggested arming Ukraine even more and said that's what the Trump administration might do. So there's quite a spectrum of options that have been put forward. One of the sources with whom CNN spoke said it's really up to Trump in the end, and he could change his mind at the very last second. But at least we see some ideas from those who could play a crucial role in shaping this in the incoming administration. And it's certainly worth noting that General Keith Kellogg, who is one of those who put forward an idea, was picked by Trump to be the special envoy to Russia and Ukraine.",

It's good to see you both tonight. Spider, we just heard in Fred's report there, Russia advancing on nearly all front lines. The Biden administration now calling on Ukraine to dramatically lower the recruitment age for Ukrainian soldiers from 25 to 18. General, is that enough to turn this around? MAJ. GEN. JAMES \"SPIDER\" MARKS (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST: No, it's not enough. I think from the outset. Um this administration really didn't have a clear strategy in terms of what they wanted to try to achieve as a desired end state, even if that was an interim step toward a larger strategic objective. And so what you see, right now is an administration that's on its way out. Ukraine, which has done incredibly well in this fight against the Russians, and clearly the West has not lost, Ukraine has not lost. This is a narrative that were going to see more of coming out of Moscow. But what we see now is, I hate to use the term stalemate, but what we see is a very well defined tactical battle between two combatants and clearly Russia has the law of large numbers. They've got the manpower. They've got the capability to keep piling on. And -- but yet bear in mind, Moscow has lost close to 600,000 young men in this fight so this has been an incredibly costly victory for them. Maybe the definition of a pyrrhic victory, if they want to use the word victory, but it's not over. The challenge is Russia doesn't have the capacity to further advance into Ukraine and threaten Kyiv and threaten well beyond where they are right now. Again, this is a very tactical fight going on. On the other hand, Ukraine is doing a wonderful job resisting that but they also don't have the capacity to dislocate the Russian forces. So were going to see this volume of this intensity of fighting through the change of administration, where a negotiated settlement clearly will be on the table.",

We can go after the United States. We can go after NATO. And this is where you get that asymmetric war rhetoric that we just heard a couple of minutes ago. They can strike by carrying out sabotage in Europe. They could do something in Asia, they could do there are a lot of things that they can do. They recently may have taken some steps in the Baltic Sea. So this is where it gets dangerous. But again, part of this is that the United States we could argue that Biden held himself back because of his fear that it would go too far, and that temporizing ultimately was a bad policy. So this you know, I think the West has to be realistic, as Spider was saying, you know, how dangerous this is.

Can we convince the Ukrainians that a cease fire of some sort is in their best interest, if, in fact, that's the message -- I can't speak for the administration but if it's -- if that's the message, that has to be crystal clear, that has to come straight from that envoy, Keith, from the president indicating that this is the way forward.

Also to convince Putin to join the peace talks suggesting that NATO leaders should offer to put off NATO membership for Ukraine for an extended period.Jill, when you look at that, too, there is the conditioning of aid, but also what feels like in many ways a major concession to Vladimir Putin.

The president of Ukraine, to do that, to just freeze and essentially give those areas the Donbas in the East and Crimea in the south to Russia but it wouldn't be hard for Vladimir Putin to say yes, I want to negotiate and we will. Well freeze everything but then continue I actually believe continue to fight, continue to push, all the while saying he wants a peace agreement. [19:15:02] And I think, you know, again, Spider is right, that we need to get real details how this would work.

I don't think it's really necessary, though, to put people's names out there. I would imagine many of these people may ultimately lose their jobs anyway if the president elect, with the power of Congress, decides to minimize or merge some of these departments with other departments to cut costs. I think, however, the overall aims, I would argue, are pretty noteworthy. Government inefficiency is indeed a problem. It doesn't make sense that the Pentagon has yet to be able to pass a budget, for example. I do think we could utilize technology to streamline certain services for the American people. And also reduce inefficiencies and ultimately reduce cost and spending, which, again, is a benefit to the overall taxpayer.

And there is going to be a rise of voices like John Fetterman in particular who represent more of a working class populist message, not as polished a little bit more authentic.And I think that will be a part of the reset of the Democratic Party. But I think we're going to be able to compete with the Republicans because most of the stuff that Donald Trump is promising to do is going to be highly inflationary. Tariffs are going to make prices go up, deporting all the low wage workers is going to make prices go up. So I think were going to be able to compete with them whether or not we have new spokespersons because their agenda as implemented is going to hurt so many people. There is a limited runway here as we know, right, so as the reporting has been, Donald Trump wants to get as much done as he can when he first gets into office, Shermichael, because, of course, you have midterms looming. We don't see how things are going to play out with perhaps a Ro Khanna emerging as one of the main voices of the Democratic Party. You're a big fan of his. How much of a concern would that be to you as a Republican? SINGLETON: I mean, look, I think the congressman is a brilliant guy. I've been following Fetterman. I think they're the type of Democrats that I, as a conservative, would absolutely work with. I mean, we're not going to see eye to eye on a whole host of things, but I do think they sort of represent a Democratic Party of the era of Bill Clinton, Democrats that my grandparents remember, so the halcyon days of the of the DNC, if you will. And I think that serves the public good ultimately, right. The objective of government is to serve the welfare of the American people. And in order to do that effectively, you need both Democrats and Republicans to work together in a collaborative effort to move the needle forward to maximize opportunity of success for the greater number of people. And so, if you have Democrats on the left who are sort of in the middle, maybe they teeter to some of the leftward politics, but can still work with Republicans and conservatives on issues that impact working class people, whether were trying to figure out new trade agreements. NAFTA was a disaster as Senator Fetterman has articulated in the past. If we can do that type of collaborative work, I absolutely think that they would be great partners for many Republicans.

How important is that moving forward? Is polished essentially a dirty word, Lulu, at this point in politics? GARCIA-NAVARRO: I think the word that everyone is searching for is authenticity. I interviewed Senator Fetterman as well. I've spoken to Ro Khanna. You know, Sherrod Brown is also someone who, even though he didn't win, his Senate race, is someone who is incredibly relatable. And I think what people want to see in their political leaders is that they stand for something, and that they're able to articulate what that is and that they're able to buck conventional wisdom when they need to. Because what ends up happening is that then people internalize that and think, oh, that person will then stand up for me. If they're standing on their principles, they're going to stand up for me too and that is something that I think Donald Trump has very successfully managed, even though he changes his positions often, he does -- people do feel that he is authentic and that he speaks for them.",

Hell of a legacy. But now they've got to figure out what to do with this. In 2010, Harry Reid and Nevada Democrats killed a plan to bury the nations nuclear waste under Yucca Mountain.

The idea is to pool that money, give it to one host site to accept it all forever. But it's really interesting right now in a bitterly divided Congress, the one thing that seems pretty bipartisan is nuclear energy. Both Republicans for a long time have supported it more and more. Democrats, these days, well see what their appetite is now for a plan to clean up the waste but the fear and loathing of nuclear energy seems to be fading -- Erica.",

MELISSA BELL, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): He appeared to come out of nowhere, but Calin Georgescu, a far right populist, won the first round of Romania's presidential elections on Sunday. More than 2 million people in the country which borders Ukraine, chose a candidate vocal about his pro-Russia and anti-NATO stance. His success, in part attributed to a relentless TikTok campaign in which he showed off his love of riding and martial arts, church, and country, emulating Vladimir Putin, whom Georgescu admires. And it's not only the Russian president's bare-chested, virile image that's being copied, but his politics too, traditional, anti-Western, anti-NATO. To the right even of the country's far right, Georgescu stood as an independent but now heads to the runoff after winning almost 23 percent of the vote. And that's led to fears among NATO members that this eastern flank ally may move away from its support for Ukraine.",
