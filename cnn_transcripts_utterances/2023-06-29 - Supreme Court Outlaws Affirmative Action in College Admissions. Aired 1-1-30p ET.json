We heard from Justice Thomas. And what was unusual here is he actually read his concurrence from the bench. That rarely happens. And he basically said, he is painfully aware of the history of racism in this country, but he thinks everybody needs to be treated equally. Justice Jackson, on the other side, her first term, she said that the court's own missteps are both eternally memorialized and excruciatingly plain. The schools wanted diversity. They felt like their schools are a pipeline to society. And the conservative challenges here -- it was a group. They said, look, taking race into consideration violates the Equal Protection Clause, violates federal law. And that's why they wanted these programs struck down. They got the win today.",

      "sentences": "Yes, that's right, Boris.And President Biden leaving no question about where he stands here, very much saying that he strongly agrees with the dissent in this case and, like the dissent, that he believes this decision overturns decades of precedent that has been tested in the courts, and that he now believes to have been overturned. The president issuing a message directly to Americans and to colleges and universities, effectively saying, look, even though this Supreme Court decision says you cannot explicitly admit students on the basis of race, that does not mean that you should give up on your commitment to diversity in college admissions. And, essentially, what he is doing is, he is pushing for a new standard, for new ways for colleges and universities to try and build diverse classes. He talked about considering socioeconomic status, a lack of financial means, where a student grew up, individual hardships, including racial discrimination. And that, of course, picks up on that one caveat in this majority decision, effectively saying that students can still talk about their experiences dealing with racial adversity, and that that can indeed be considered. And so for colleges and universities that may be concerned about following that path because of the risk of additional lawsuits, this is the president trying to give those universities a green light to move forward with that kind of consideration. And, as you noted, Boris, he did say that he is directing the Department of Education to essentially come up with a list of best and worst practices for college admissions to ensure diverse classes. That includes some of the things that he was -- that I just mentioned, but also the negatives. For example, legacy admissions is something that the president also talked about there. We know that this is a White House that has been preparing now for weeks and months for the possibility of this very decision, preparing potential executive actions. And it's also a president who is increasingly dealing with a conservative majority on the Supreme Court that has -- that has been ruling against where the president stands. And the president noted that when he said that this is a Supreme Court that -- quote -- \"once again walked away from decades of precedents.\" And, lastly, our colleague Arlette Saenz was in the room there, and she asked the president about a statement by the Congressional Black Caucus, which -- and she asked, do you agree with them that effectively this is a rogue court, that this is a court that is illegitimate? The president's words: \"This is certainly not a normal court\" -- Boris, Brianna.",

      "sentences": "Well, it just speaks to the larger issues that we're confronting right now about the credibility of a court that traditionally had been viewed as the one apolitical, nonpolitical body, now under a microscope for a number of reasons, not the least of which has been the ethical allegations that have been reported by ProPublica and other sources, but also based on precedent.Remember, every single time you hear a Supreme Court nominee in the confirmation process, they will tell you how much they honor precedent, how much that they will value it, and that they seem to indicate to the powers that be that they have no instance -- no interest in touching them. And then, as recently as where Roe v. Wade, overturned the Dobbs decision as well, and, of course, this one as recently as 2016, when they had a slim majority, including Sonia Sotomayor, the only remaining justice of that slim majority, dealing with a case that reaffirmed the notion that you could use race as part of a holistic factor. Now you have got, just so many years later, it being gutted or turned down yet again and rejected. And so you have got the president rightly addressing what I think many people in the nation are looking at, is, should the court, this Supreme Court, be under the type of microscope that the talking point suggests that it should be, or is this an indication of the justices not being swayed by the political objectives and policy considerations you often see? The Supreme Court in this very lengthy opinion, though, does not do itself as many favors in distancing completely from discussions you often see on the political trails. I will point to one particular, Justice Clarence Thomas talking about the idea of 17-year-olds, applicants, he's talking about, not needing or deserving to bear the weight of the sins of the past. It sounds like the CRT discussion that happened the past. And so you do have the infusion of these points that are coming yet again. And, Ariana, as you rightly pointed out time and time again, the composition of the court, we often speak about -- you talking, Brianna, before, the idea of the so-called conservative bench, the liberal bench, the appointee, which president has done so. Americans are paying attention to how the decisions come down, who's on which side of the issue, and they are reading a kind of tea leaf or maybe reading the robe of the Supreme Court justice to determine, was this a predetermined conclusion or was it really the result of objective analysis of the law?",

Wade, a big deal in the last midterm election.I do want to get your perspective on this, Elliot Williams, because I'm no attorney, like you and Laura, but I do wonder if there's a gray area that the Supreme Court opened up here, because they talk about applicants and universities being allowed to consider applicants' discussion of their experience with race, but they aren't allowed to, the universities, ask about that in demographic questions or in essay questions. How is that going to work? Could there be confusion for institutions of higher learning?",

And there's all kinds of things that could come out of this that we just don't know. I do want to talk a little bit about polling on where Americans are on this, because it is interesting. On affirmative action, how do you feel about it, the most recent Pew Research Center study shows 50 percent of people disapprove. Only 33 percent approve; 16 percent are unsure. So this maybe is something that does reflect, Ariane, on some of where America is on this issue, even as, obviously, it is a divisive one.",

And when this huge decision came out, in the first few minutes, we were looking very quickly to say, did he say, I'm overturning Grutter? Chief Justice John Roberts never says that. He never explicitly says he's overturning it. And you wonder if he doesn't say that because he doesn't want to have the same thing happened last term, when he overturned precedent. And the liberals on this bench called him on it right away and said, you're overturning precedent here. That's a big deal, because, once again, you are changing the way people live their lives and go by the law. And even Clarence Thomas, the conservative on the court, he says, in his opinion, you overturn precedent. So I think that what you're talking about with public approval and how this court is trying to navigate their very low approval ratings really comes out today, because Chief Justice John Roberts and the majority here tried to hide the ball a bit.",

And he would direct his Department of Education to examine programs like legacy admissions that reward privilege. We want to discuss these developments with Rashad Robinson. He's the president of Color of Change. Sir, thanks so much for sharing an afternoon with us. We're wondering where things go from here, because you and your organization have been outspoken in favor of affirmative action. Before this decision, your group said it was planning to protect diversity and true equity for all. What does that effort look like now?",

      "sentences": "Well, it looks very much what the -- like what the president saying.We are calling on universities to become public and transparent about their plans. What are their plans to ensure that they are not simply prioritizing privilege in their admissions? I mean, there have been so many reports and studies that really do animate all of the different ways in which privilege creates a whole set of doors for unearned opportunities for people to get into universities. There's a study that looks at Harvard's admissions; 43 percent of admittance into Harvard University of white admissions, college admissions in Harvard University are either legacy, on something called the dean's interest list, which is basically kids of potential donors or folks that can buy buildings, and white athletes. And so when you have a group of 43 percent of white students falling into that group, and the same study looked at, if -- if those benefits were not provided, diversity would look very different in terms of entering classes, you have to sort of look at all of the ways in which access and unearned opportunities comes into play. And so when we think about affirmative action, affirmative action is an antidote to white privilege, to opportunities that have been afforded because of zip code, because of access to wealth, because of opportunities in terms of how schools are funded in this country. And if we don't have a full range to look at the experiences that people have going into schools, we will turn back the hands of time on opportunity. This is not simply about diversity. This is about merit and how we look at the range of things that constitutes merit, in terms of how we provide opportunities, and the cascading impacts that decisions like this have on employment, on public investment, and so much more. That is why we at Color of Change are so serious about holding institutions accountable, about making sure they are transparent about what they are doing, and not allowing these institutions to simply move on, and at the same time making sure that all of those that enable this are also held accountable as well.",

But we also have to look at where this case comes from, right? Edward Blum, who -- a white conservative that is also behind the attacks on voting rights and the attacks on other areas of racial equity, him and his organization, institutions like the DonorsTrust and others have been behind these cases. When you look at some of the ways in which they brought forward plaintiffs, like in the UNC cases, even while promoting some sort of equity for Asian students, their plaintiffs ended up being white students. And so what we know here is that they have put forward this idea of protecting Asian students, when they have fought against the ability for AAPI people to have equal access to the polls in terms of some of their voting rights lawsuits and the ways in which they gerrymandered in this country. They have fought against racial equity and DEI in other areas in this country. And so we can't simply sort of read their press releases and talking points and take this as standards. They have used this idea and also avoided the real and deeper conversation about legacy admissions, about folks with wealth being able to buy their way into universities.",

And what we see is us now turning around wealthy billionaires trying to close the door and opportunity just as more Americans learn about things like redlining, just as more Americans learn about systemic racism, just as more people want to fight for racial equity. We see the doors being closed because they don't want to play on a fair field. They want privilege to be able to rule the day, and they want privilege-based admissions. And they're not going to stop there. They want privilege-based hiring, privilege-based public investments, privilege-based everything to rule the day. And that is why the work that civil rights organizations will do, that's why the work of everyday Americans of all races who want to be able to have equity and opportunity and merit to have a full public hearing, to get involved in this effort -- the same people behind this are also the same people that are trying to ban books about Martin Luther King and Rosa Parks.
