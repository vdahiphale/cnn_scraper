      "sentences": "It is a Friday. It is the summer, and therefore, of course, it is our first Summer Friday. We are at theIntrepid Museum on the west side of Manhattan, of which you'll hear a great deal more over the course of the hour. But there is still an hour to trade left on Wall Street. Look at the Dow. It's on a tear, it's on a roll. It's the last day of the first half of the year. All the major indices are much higher. The S&amp;P is actually up for some 16 percent for the year so far. Those are the markets and the main events that we will be talking about in the hour ahead. France has now shut nighttime buses and trams and canceled large gatherings. The country is bracing for a fourth night of protests. We'll be in Paris in a moment. Apple stock is now worth -- or the company is worth $3 trillion. Tech stock has a stunning first half. The NASDAQ has been a deal on a tear. And space tourism has become a reality. Deloitte says it is a $3.3 billion market by 2035. We'll get to that. We are live in New York, on the Intrepid, delighted to be here. It is Friday. It is June 30th. I'm Richard Quest, and yes, aboard the Intrepid, I most certainly mean business. Good evening. We start of course, with just where we are and why we're here. We are on the Intrepid, which is an old US Navy warship, an aircraft carrier. Let's not call it old, let's call it distinguished -- a distinguished aircraft carrier. It is now a national historic landmark, just down the road. You see there, of course, is the Empire State Building and just over there is Hudson Yards, which is our normal home where we come to, and indeed from the camera on the roof of Hudson Yards, you should be able to see us. I wish you'd be able to see us better, but the weather with the smoke coming down from Canada and that is something we'll be talking about during the course of our program tonight. We'll be discovering New York, the themes and our Summer Fridays. Let's begin though with the news of the day. We go to France, where the country once again has been suffering a nighttime of violence. It will be the fourth night tonight, and many thousands of police have been deployed. They have also -- France has cancelled large scale events in a desperate attempt to restore order, but we are already starting to see protesters gathering in Paris. You'll remember the reason. It is a deadly police shooting. Germany and the UK has now issued travel warnings to those tourists going into Paris, and it all is at the peak summer travels. These are live pictures coming to us at the moment from Paris. We've got the Tour de France starting on Saturday. You've got the Paris Fashion Show starting next week, but let's start with the events of the last few hours. Nic Robertson reports from Aubervilliers on the outskirts of Paris. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) NIC ROBERTSON, CNN INTERNATIONAL DIPLOMATIC EDITOR (voice-over): Thursday night, Paris' underprivileged suburbs in flames. Elite cops in Nanterre, the epicenter of the violence and anger over the killing of the young teen, Nahel, dust through barricades of burning vehicles. Paris' Ring of Fire engulfing a bus station in the suburb of Aubervilliers, 12 buses on fire. With daybreak, the extent of the losses becoming clearer. Twenty-six buses and a tram destroyed in this neighborhood alone according to a local official, total cost ballpark: $11.7 million. France's Transport minister came to see the damage for himself. ROBERTSON (on camera): What will it take to end the violence, please? CLEMENT BEAUNE, FRENCH TRANSPORT MINISTER (through translator): We can't allow for any ambiguity in his question. We need to condemn this violence with extreme firmness. We need to protect our public service. It's in the interest of those who are expressing their anger today to protect the public service. ROBERTSON (voice-over): Local residents here worried about an escalation. (UNIDENTIFIED MALE speaking in foreign language.)",

This is the Plaza La Concorde in very central Paris. You can see already, night hasn't yet fallen, and there is there's a fairly tense standoff between protesters and riot police here. No teargas for the time being, but this protest has been called here in the very heart of the French capital as it has, as protests have been called in other French cities for tonight. So for the time being, what the government has taken in terms of measures, canceling concert that were to be held tonight at the Stade de France, banning gatherings, large gatherings haven't tempered anything down. What they have said is tonight, there will be even more policemen and women on the streets of France, 45,000 versus the 40,000 we saw yesterday and what the Interior minister has announced is that we will all be seeing armored vehicles, helicopters, and far more elite mobile units as they try and keep these kinds of scenes under control.",

There's also the 14th of July, as you say, Paris is preparing for the 2024 Summer Olympics. This is not the images they wanted to give of their city, and yet it is also the summer, it is hot, school is out, and these are also the conditions that we saw back in 2005 when an incident similar to the one that we saw on Tuesday, two young people in the neighborhoods in outer Paris being killed after -- dying after a police check, trying to flee the police had set off an entire summer of protests. So that factor, Richard, the fact that we are heading into the summer months is not necessarily going to dampen things down; on the contrary, there is a lot of young kids out there ready to take part in these protests and not terribly occupied at all -- Richard.",

Yes, Richard, you know, about a year ago, you and I were talkingabout the NASDAQ being off by 32 percent, so it is certainly what a difference a year makes. But yes, Apple $190.73 a share, Richard, this is the key level we have to watch and Apple currently trading at $193.11, so it certainly seems at least right now, set to close and cross that $3 trillion market cap. So how did it get here? Because Richard, of course, as you know, in January of 2022, Apple stock had flirted with this level, but it failed to cross. So I think a few components. One, Apple seems to have weathered the Chinese supply chain issues with the factories there, better than many investors were expecting. Also, still enjoying really strong demand for its iPhone sales. And then its services business, and this is really important, Richard, because the services side of Apple's business is less vulnerable to economic downturns, think things like Apple Music, different services, monthly subscriptions, that has seen really remarkable growth, Wedbush saying in a note that the growth trajectory there is jaw dropping, and investors clearly like it.",

Prigozhin's reportedly in exile in Belarus after his failed mutiny but so far has not been seen. The entertainment world is paying tribute to the actor Alan Arkin on the news of his death. Who is a well-known for his range and subtlety and won the Best Supporting Actor Oscar in 2006 for Little Miss Sunshine. He was 89 years old. Those who belong to LGBTQ rights today when new Supreme Court limited the protections, especially as it relates to businesses refusing to serve or to be involved in LGBT events. The court back the Christian web designer who refused to serve the same sex couple who wanted it for their wedding. It was a victory for religious conservatives. You won't be surprised. It was a decision that was six to three. And it was a decision rooted in free speech. Ariane de Vogue is our Supreme Court correspondent and is with me now.
