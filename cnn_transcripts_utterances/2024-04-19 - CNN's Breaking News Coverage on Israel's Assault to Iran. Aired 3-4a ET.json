      "sentences": "Hello, welcome to our viewers watching all around the world. I'm John Vause, live in Atlanta. We're following breaking news this hour.After days of deliberation and despite overwhelming international pressure to stand down, a U.S. official tells CNN Israel has carried out a military strike on Iran, apparent retaliation for an unprecedented Iranian missile attack just over a week ago. At least three explosions have been reported not far from a military airbase in the province of Isfahan in central Iran. According to Iran's Fars News Agency, defense systems on the base were activated in response to what may have been a drone attack targeting the base's radar. In the city of Isfahan, it's believed to be the home of Iran's illicit nuclear weapons program, as well as the country's biggest nuclear research facility, which operates three small Chinese-supplied research reactors. All flights to Isfahan, Tehran and Shiraz have resumed after being suspended for several hours, according to a spokesperson for Iran's airports. One U.S. official confirms to CNN an Israeli strike inside Iran, adding the target was not nuclear, and Israel informed the White House on Thursday an attack was just days away. Iranian officials say air defense systems in several regions were activated and explosions heard in Isfahan were outgoing fire from those air defenses. For the very latest, CNN's Paula Hancocks standing by live in Beirut, but we'll go first to CNN's Nic Robertson in Jerusalem. Nic, you have new reporting on Iran's response to this Israeli strike. What have you been told?",

      "sentences": "Well, Iran's response from what we've seen in their media and what the state media and the local media are reporting is it appears to play down the strike. We've heard that from the Iranian media that they switched on their air defense systems in the night because of a perceived threat, but they actually saw no aircraft coming into their airspace and there were only these three drones that were spotted in the vicinity of a military base near Isfahan.But the explosions there were, they say, the air defense systems firing in the air, so really sort of playing down. And certainly some of the local media in Iran is characterizing these drones as very small, as quadcopters, as relatively insignificant. I've spoken with a regional intelligence source who will be understanding and informed about this situation and the information that he has and his understanding at this time is that Iran is not going to respond to this strike by Israel, that they will not perceive this as crossing a red line. Look, anything can change and we know that the dynamic of how Israel reads Iran's red lines and how Iran reads Israel's red lines has changed. It's gone through a paradigm shift. But this night after this military action inside of Iran carried out by Israel, there does not appear to be a follow-up coming from Iran. That could change, but that's how it looks at the moment. This is reading between the lines from Iranian media, how they're characterizing it, nothing to the scale of the big 350 missile attack they launched at Israel over the weekend, nothing in scale of that and the readout from intelligence sources, unlikely to be follow-up from Iran.",

      "sentences": "It's right, yes, John. I mean, you can see the Iranian state media downplaying what has happened. And yet over recent days, you have heard some very fiery rhetoric from Iranian leaders. In fact, just hours before this attack took place, we heard from the Iranian foreign minister speaking to CNN, saying that if Israel carries out an attack on its assets, then the result would be an immediate and at a maximum level, saying it would be a decisive response.We heard from President Raisi as well, saying that if there was another response from Israel to what they did over the weekend, those more than 300 drones and missiles launched at Israel, then there would be an even greater and more resolute response from Iran. So, the public messaging that we heard from Tehran itself was that if Israel responds, there will be a bigger response in retaliation. Now, whether or not this is posturing, whether it's messaging, it's threatening, potentially some of this is also for a domestic audience. But that is certainly a very different public view that we have been hearing from Iran. In fact, we also heard just yesterday from the Revolutionary Guard commander who's in charge of the nuclear assets and in charge of securing the nuclear assets in Iran, saying that if Israel does target any of its Iranian nuclear sites or if it threatens to, then pointing out that they could change their nuclear positioning, their nuclear policy. Now, they've maintained at this point that they are having a peaceful nuclear program, which many countries do not take it as that, but that is what Tehran has said. And they have said that they know where Israel's nuclear sites are as well and could target those. So, what we're seeing now from state media, and of course, we are waiting to hear from a more official source within that, is that they are downplaying this, they are showing images of where these drone strikes or the drones were apparently taken out, showing a very peaceful situation. They've said there was no ground explosion, there is no issues on the ground and no damage at this point. So, you're right, two very different messages that we're hearing here.",

If it were three drones or perhaps more, those drones came very, very close to the center of Iranian nuclear development. And it's a statement. And it's a statement that says, if this matter continues, we have targeted your facility. And if the time comes to escalate and severely jeopardize or destroy that emerging nuclear capability. So Netanyahu gets a lot out of this. One, it appears that he has listened to some degree to advice from the United States and other Western allies. And by the same token, he has made that statement to Iran that if Iran attacks, we attack and we're going to attack much harder the next time.",

      "sentences": "That's one of the most difficult strategic questions to answer. But it's perhaps the most important because just several hours ago, some of us were speculating that the response on the part of the Iranians would be the igniting of a renewed and much more forceful engagement by Hezbollah in southern Lebanon.We might see increased activity by the Hamas. And then, of course, Iranian attacks via ballistic missiles and drones. And then you have the potential disturbances that can erupt on the West Bank. So collectively, these things would constitute a multi-front war for Israel. And while Israel has an acknowledged capability, a history of success in several wars in which it faced off against multiple opponents, I just have to remind myself that in 1973, which was the Yom Kippur War, and Israel faced three opponents, one, of course, being Egypt, Syria, and Iraq. And in that particular instance, Israel ran out of weapon systems. Literally, too many of its tanks were destroyed. And but for the intervention of the United States flying in big C-5s, multiple M1 tanks, the final disposition of that war might have been dramatically different. So the takeaway from all that is Israel might have some space to conduct multi-front war, but it has to assess not only the response of the world, but from a very operational standpoint, it's got to ascertain whether it has the logistical support, the weapons, and even the personnel to continue that type of very complex and demanding military activity.",

Apparent retaliation for the Iranian missile attack just about a week ago. Flights have resumed in Iran after reports of explosions in the region of Isfahan.The city of Isfahan is believed to be home to Iran's illicit nuclear weapons program, as well as the country's biggest nuclear research facility, which operates three small Chinese-supplied research reactors. Iranian media say the nuclear facility in the region is secure, while the U.S. official says those facilities were not the target. Still no comment, at least official comment, from Israel's military. Reports of explosions in Iran sent oil prices surging up nearly 4 percent, with U.S. oil prices climbing above $85 a barrel. Prices sort of recovered a bit, but right now Brent crude sitting at $87 or $88 a barrel, practically, while the world benchmark is at $83 a barrel, just up by about 1 percent. Meanwhile, the news drove U.S. stock futures lower. Dow futures went down 480 points. They still are down by about a third of 1 percent. NASDAQ futures down by half of 1 percent, and the S&amp;P futures also down by about the same. Let's bring in Scott McLean. He's live in Istanbul, Turkey. Scott, for months now, tensions across the region have been soaring on fears that there could be some kind of major escalation of the war in Gaza. Without this Iranian response to the Israeli attack, there does seem to be a reprieve, but it's only a reprieve, right? So there are still those ongoing concerns that this situation still remains tense and volatile.",

The fact that the Iranians are staying also a bit quiet about what was attacked, and they're trying to downplay the significance, is also their attempt to try to contain it.

And there were others who didn't want to see a response at all. Add to that the pressure that this government was under from President Joe Biden, from the U.K., from the European officials to basically what they were calling take it a win of what the interception of that Iranian assault was. Even though it was just a defense, it was not no win. It was just a successful interception. But Israel felt that it did need to do something. And I think that this is probably, like you said, the compromise. It is a way for Israel to get a shot across the bow at Iran and show them that something has been done. Don't learn a bad lesson from what you did on Sunday. But also, we in Israel don't want this to go any farther right now.",

Israel was able to intercept all of those missiles and drones that pretty much 99 percent that were making its way together with that regional collective partnership that involved the Americans, the British, the French, the Jordanians, the Saudis, and possibly others. That's a great success, but it's not a victory.And I think that the way to really look at this is just actually tend to look at it, John, as we should view every single one of these missiles and drones as if they actually landed, damaged, and even killed people. Because just because something was shot at you and didn't hurt you doesn't mean it wasn't shot. It was, and there's an intention by Iran to, as we know because they clearly stated, they want to wipe Israel off the map. They've been supporting proxies throughout this region. Hezbollah, which has fired since October 7th almost 5,000 missiles into Israel. Hamas, of course, in Gaza. The Houthis in Yemen. Israel is the most attacked country today in the world, and we can't contain this. Those days of where we just pretend just because it was intercepted that it didn't really happen, well, it did happen, and it needs to be met with force, I think. [03:40:04] VAUSE: On the other side of the equation, though, the Iranians would be looking at that weekend attack as a complete and indivisible colossal failure. And then comes this counterstrike by Israel. Clearly, there has to be a calculation there that they don't want to get into a wider conflict with Israel right now because the strike on the weekend was a failure.",

We know that some of those missiles landed at this base where the F-35s, Israel's most advanced fifth-generation fighter jets are based, and they could claim that they actually penetrated and were able to strike inside that base.And even though most of it was intercepted, it did get Israeli air sirens going. It got Israelis into a week of mass hysteria, John. Israelis were in fear of their lives, I would say, in a way that we haven't been in a long time. Unfortunately, and this is not a good thing, but we've gotten used to rockets from Gaza. We've gotten used to rockets from Lebanon. Getting fired at from Iran after all these years of hearing of how strong and powerful and dangerous they are did not make Israelis feel safe. And there still is a lot of concern of what comes next.
