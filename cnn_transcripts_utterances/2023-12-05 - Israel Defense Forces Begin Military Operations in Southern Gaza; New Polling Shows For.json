Now Israel is telling those same civilians to go even farther south. Khan Yunis is going to be a target for the Israeli military because they do believe that some of the Hamas leadership is in Khan Yunis.

Former South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley, Governor Ron DeSantis, former New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, and entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy all qualified for this debate according to the Republican National Committee last night. The GOP frontrunner Donald Trump, he will not attend, opting instead to attend a fundraiser for one of the super PACs supporting him.Meanwhile, warnings are mounting about the threat a second Trump presidential term will pose to American democracy. CNN senior data reporter Harry Enten, you're joining us. That's always a good thing. It makes me happy on so many different levels, because you explain things. And the thing we want to kind of start with here is this idea of Trump trying to change the narrative, right. He wants on Saturday talking about he is the one who is going to save democracy, not Joe Biden, that had been a big pitch of Biden's. Trump, obviously, attempted to perpetrate a coup in the United States of America. However, how do voters feel about this? HARRY ENTEN, CNN SENIOR POLITICS WRITER AND ANALYST:  They actually do believe that Donald Trump committed a serious crime or at least believe there is credible evidence that he did. Look at this. This is a poll that was just a few months ago by PRRI -- 58 percent of Americans believe that there is credible evidence that Donald Trump committed serious federal crimes. Just 37 percent of Americans disagree. So that message is breaking through that Donald Trump did something very, very unusual. More than that, a Trump reelection poses a threat to our democracy and way of life -- again, the majority of Americans believe that this is true. They agree with the idea that Trump is a threat. This is a message we have heard from Democrats and Joe Biden over and over again. It does seem to be breaking through. Just 41 percent of Americans disagree. So all the reporting that's going out, all of the talks from Democrats does seem to be having an impact. Here is the question, though, Phil. Donald Trump is trying to pull this reverse Uno card. Here we go -- a Biden reelection poses a threat to our democracy or way of life. Look at this, a majority of Americans agree on this. What Donald Trump seems to be arguing does, in fact, seem to be working to some degree because 53 percent of Americans believe a Biden reelection poses as threat to our democracy. And again, that's fairly similar to that 57 percent who believe a Trump reelection poses a threat to our democracy and way of life.",

There is only three way to stop him -- the primary season, which we're still in, the courts, which very likely may not convict before an election or the general election. And for Democrats who I think rightly have argued he is a threat to democracy, you're saying we are putting one guy as the backstop to stop Donald Trump.
