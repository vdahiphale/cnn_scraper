What's interesting is he said there would be no harm, but the FDA said exactly the opposite. They said there would be major harm, chaos, confusion if these restrictions went into effect.

They were not eager to lean in one way or the other, and are allowing it to go back to the pre Texas Court's decision.

Now, a Circuit Court of Appeals is not necessarily bound to always anticipate and try to figure out how the Supreme Court Justices will rule, but they will take into consideration the potential to be overruled, or whether to be, you know, essentially validated from the Supreme Court or to be, you know, not have their cases even heard.

So we've got a long way to go for this to be resolved.I think right now, what Republicans have been grappling with is the fact that you did have, at least in a number of cases, an argument for prolife advocates to make pre overturning of Roe vs. Wade, around sort of moderate restrictions, things like that. There were places where the prolife movement had some opportunities to make an argument, to try to build a majority coalition. But getting rid of Roe versus Wade, it has thrown the issue back on the table in the way that you may recall the Supreme Court decisions in the past, things like for instance, Obergefell, in the gay marriage ruling that took a political hot button off the table. Suddenly, Republicans weren't getting asked about that all the time. By overturning Roe versus Wade, it has put it back on the table. And I think the prolife movement and Republicans have been really flatfooted in being able to respond to this new political reality. That's why you're seeing them not come out and make statements quite as much.",
