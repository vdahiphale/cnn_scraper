House Democrats insisting they still have a path to the majority through outstanding races out west, and promising to stand unified if Republicans do, in fact, win the chamber. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. JAMES CLYBURN (D-SC): Whether or not we would be upgrading from the minority or a majority, or whichever position, we must be a loyal opposition to this president.

Nobody in this country wants people bullying trans kids. Kids that are struggling with gender identity, identity issues at all. They don't want them, you know, bullied and messed with. And at the same time, they don't want government telling people what to do. So, you know, we go to a place where we have local control and people make the decisions on who plays what locally and the rest of us focus on, you know, the economy and, you know, a bipartisan border fix and all of those things.

I don't like to echo the congressman, all three of them. I don't like the fact that a small portion of our party is pretty much dictating where we are.

You shouldn't be afraid if it's something stupid and hateful and make someone feel that they don't belong. But saying I don't agree with you or saying that's not representative of the bulk of us, that's like Medicare for all is not something that the bulk of the party - of the Democratic Party believes in. But yet we spend tons of time on it. Now, on immigration, there are people who do believe, and I think I buy into it, that part of the problem we've had as Democrats is that we have gotten pulled to the left so far that we cannot make common sense decisions. And look at 20 - look, I worked for Hillary and she had to contend with Bernie. Bernie, you know, went after Biden - I shouldn't say went after - he entered the primary. There's no evidence had the Bernie Sanders wing of the Democratic Party has met with any success or represents this party. Yet, we're going to go ahead and we're going to continue every time someone on the hard left says, oh, you can't do that. We're all going to - we're all going to paralyze. I mean I don't know what the answer is, but the answer is for people to start saying what they say on, you know, WhatsApp and Twitter and whatever it is, that this is - this is enough already. People can't - the PC police doesn't just apply to Republicans. It applies to, I don't know what I'd call myself. I'd just call myself a Democrat. I am not a progressive. I'm not a lefty.
