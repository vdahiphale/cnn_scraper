Here's more from what Romney had to say when he announced his retirement. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. MITT ROMNEY (R-UT):  The times we're living in really demand the next generation to step up and express their point of view, and to make the decisions that will shape our American politics over the coming century. And just having a bunch of guys that were around --the baby boomers who were around in the post-war era -- we're not the right ones to be making the decisions for tomorrow. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

But it's also interesting because Mitt Romney kind of fashioned himself also as a standard bearer of the old Republican Party and someone who was willing -- one of the few people on Capitol Hill who is willing to stand up to Donald Trump in this populist movement that he so disagrees with within the Republican Party.But it's also interesting because over the last week, and even a little bit before they left for their summer recess, Mitt Romney started talking about age and a new generation, and how important it is for a new generation, whether it was about Joe Biden, Mitch McConnell, or other leaders. He said that people need to pass the torch. And so, there was a little bit of hinting in what Romney was saying.

One of the requests -- they want to talk to the grand jurors that handed up the indictment in this case. They also want to unseal the transcripts from the witness -- from the witnesses that interviewed them from the special grand jury that recommended charges. And they want to know the names of the unindicted co-conspirators in this case -- those unnamed individuals who clearly provided information or were used to support the D.A.'s case in this thing. But look, big picture, you zoom out here. The big question still is what's going to happen with the other 17 co-defendants in this case, right? We know Sidney Powell and Chesebro are going to trial on October 23, but the judge hasn't weighed in yet on whether or not that will apply to the other 17. The D.A. wants to try all 19 of these defendants, including Trump himself, together. That's been their position since the very beginning.

We know there's other co-defendants who have also been trying to move their cases to federal court, so they're closely watching what's happening.

This is not a math problem. This is a political problem. And until Speaker McCarthy decides that he wants to govern for the United States and not for the MAGA caucus we're going to continue to have these problems. And I would remind our viewers that it was only a year ago that Democrats were empowering Medicare to negotiate drug prices. That we were investing in clean energy and climate action. That we were investing in semiconductor manufacturing to outcompete China. We were doing a lot of this with Republican votes and Speaker McCarthy could have taken the gavel and continued that bipartisan momentum. Instead, he is catering to his hard right.

As individual members, they are Reagan Republicans. They support Ukraine and they understand the value. But their base back home is hearing Majorie Taylor Greene and Donald Trump, and they are increasingly pro-Putin and they're split. What we saw Kasie with the vote on the defense budget this summer was that really, most Republicans broke towards the Reagan pro-Ukraine camp.
