Now, Paul briefly had an interaction with a reporter. We want you to listen.

He's a Democrat from Delaware, a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, the Judiciary Committee, and chair of the Senate Appropriations Sub- Committee for Foreign Aid. Senator, thanks so much for being with us. This footage of Paul Whelan incarcerated, I think it's fair to say that R.T. wouldn't have this kind of access without approval from the Kremlin. So, what would you say is the intent here? Why broadcast this now? SEN. CHRIS COONS (D-DE):  Look, it's hard to guess exactly what Putin's motives are. But once again, he is showing that he's got an iron grip on dissent within Russia and that he continues to violate human rights. Evan Gershkovich of \"The Wall Street Journal\" is in a Russian prison, the first American journalist taken hostage by Russia since the Cold War. And Paul Whelan, a Marine veteran, is continuing now, five years on, to serve a similar sentence for espionage. In both cases, these are folks that we believe are wrongfully detained. And as you well know, there are folks around the world who are being wrongfully held in different countries, in different prisons. The Biden administration is working tirelessly to secure their release. Secretary of State Blinken did have a chance to talk to Paul Whelan not long very ago. And I'm working on two different bipartisan bills to try and elevate the issue. To try and create a National American Hostage Day, a bill I have with Senator Marco Rubio of Florida. And a bill to stop the IRS practice of imposing fines and fees on Americans unjustly detained overseas. Senator Rounds and I have introduced this bipartisan bill. And it was based on American journalist Jason Rezaian who -- when he returned from a year in Iranian prison faced tens of thousands of dollars of fines and fees from the IRS.",

In any event, we're going to have to provide long-term security guarantees for Ukraine so that Russia doesn't simply re-arm, retrain, re-equip and relaunch an offensive further into Ukraine. Exactly what the contours of that will look like is something that our NATO allies have been discussing closely with the United States and with President Zelenskyy on several visits to capitols both here in the United States and around the West.",
