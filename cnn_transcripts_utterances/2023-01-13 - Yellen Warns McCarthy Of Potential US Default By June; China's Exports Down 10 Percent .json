To give you some context, it's the worst drop since the start of the coronavirus outbreak in February 2020. So what's behind the contraction, some analysts from Capital Economics are pointing to weakening global demand and disruptions due to labor shortages that occurred because of illness as things started to reopen. And then another significant headline, China's trade with Russia hits a record high. This is according to a spokesman from China's trade authority, accounting for three percent of China's total trade.

It is extremely difficult to get reliable information as towhat precisely is happening on the ground at any given moment without being there with the troops on the frontlines. But we are getting snippets of what is happening and we are getting bits and pieces here and there. So what we know so far is that the Russians claim -- the Russian Military Defense says that as of last night, they are in control of this town of Soledar. This comes after the Wagner mercenary group, which is doing much of the fighting there claimed a few days ago to have claimed Soledar, to claims control of Soledar. The Ukrainians though continue to insist that look, this is not over. The fighting is still ongoing. The General -- the Ukrainian General Staff posted a video not long ago showing that a soldier this afternoon, said that fierce fighting was ongoing and he showed what appeared to be a video feed from a laptop of the town showing that they still have eyes on it. We have also gotten word from the 46th Brigade, this is the unit of the military that is doing the bulking of the fighting for the Ukrainians. And they said that the Russians are essentially trying to push what troops remain in the city into the center essentially trying to surround them, but there are pockets of resistance all over town, it appears. I also spoke with a soldier earlier today. This is a Special Forces soldier who is in the area of the strategic town of Bakhmut and Soledar just yesterday in what he described was very fierce fighting in the streets, maybe ten, twenty, thirty meters away from the other side with small arms, with grenades, in addition to all of the shelling and airstrikes that are taking place, as well. And what he said is, regardless of what happens with Soledar, the plan for the Ukrainians was never to hold that city, to attempt to hold that town forever, because frankly, they don't believe that it has all that much strategic value first. First off, it's been almost razed to the ground. Second off, it doesn't have the kind of natural defenses that some other more strategic towns do. And so they believe that the Russians, at some point may be able to have it. Their goal, their task was to try to kill as many Russian and Wagner mercenaries as they possibly could. And he says that, by that standard, they have done a very good job. But as you mentioned off the top, Richard, the Russians really seem to need any kind of a win on the battlefield. They've changed up their military command structure. They have been having this internal squabble with the Wagner private military group. And really, in the last six months, they have not had very many key victories on the battlefield. If they were to take Soledar, this would be one, but it doesn't get much easier from there because the Ukrainians say that regardless, the town of Bakhmut, which would be their next logical place to try to attack, it does have a lot of the natural defenses, plus added military defenses as well. And so the Ukrainians say that town is still very much a fortress -- Richard",

By the way LockBit is denying that they did this, but what is interesting is, the ransom notes that have been produced, go to URLs that are, you know, website links that are previously associated with LockBit. So it'll be interesting to figure out who is really behind this. But we really do need to have a conversation in the executive suite about this. For starters, just assume you will be a victim of a ransomware event, you need the right response playbook. Ask yourself, will all of our data be encrypted? So if they steal the data from us, well, we have encrypted it at a level high enough that if they take the data, they won't actually be able to use it. It is like giving somebody you know, a box, a nested box that's locked up so tight, they'll never be able to get into it. So there's a lot of different strategies that can be deployed. But first, everyone has to assume one day, you could be a victim of a ransomware syndicate. You have to have a plan and think to yourself, what are our manual processes that we're going to have to enact? How long will we be inoperative? And what will we do? Will we pay the ransom or not pay the ransom, and where will the money come from? So those are all things that need to be discussed?

It allows us toget things done to connect with folks. But what it also does is it distracts us, it pulls us out of the moment. And research shows that we are distracted almost half the time, 47 percent of the time, we're not focused on what we're doing. And our phones are a culprit. Even the mere presence of the phone. When you see the phone sitting there, it reminds you of all the things that you should and could be doing. And so, what I would suggest is that when you are spending time on these activities that are sources of joy, like those social connections, spending time with your family, spending time with friends, having a good communication with a colleague, is put the phone away out of sight is closer to out of mind. Also, when you're looking to do that deep strategic work, getting into a flow state is absolutely impossible when you're being distracted by incoming pings on your e-mail and incoming messages on your phone.

And with that intentionality, you are likely to minimize the amount of time you spend wasting on your phone, for instance, and increase the amount of time that you're spending on these activities that really matter. That social connection, that work exercise is something that is so important to deal because it's a direct mood booster, it helps offset anxiety and depression. Yet, it's something that we -- when we feel busy, we don't make the time for. But by exercising, it increases a sense of self-esteem and self-efficacy. And with that, it lessens your sense of limitation with the resources you have, namely your time. So, it's -- it is now thinking about three months on, as you said, once you experienced the benefits of it, then you see that it is easier to do these behaviors.
