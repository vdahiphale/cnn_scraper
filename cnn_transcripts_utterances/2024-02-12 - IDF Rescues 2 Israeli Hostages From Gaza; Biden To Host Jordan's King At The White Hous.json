      "sentences": "Hello, a very warm welcome to the show, everyone, I'm Lynda Kinkade in for Isa Soares. Tonight, a successfulhostage rescue by Israeli Defense Forces, but at what cost to civilians inside Gaza? We'll have the very latest on what's been happening in Rafah. Then a high-stakes meeting at the White House this hour as President Joe Biden hosts Jordan's King Abdullah. The king is pushing the international backing to support a ceasefire in Gaza. We'll bring you more on that this hour. Plus, Donald Trump's remarks about NATO sends anxiety and anger through Europe. We'll explain why? Well, the Israeli Prime Minister calls it one of the most successful rescue operations in the country's history. Benjamin Netanyahu is praising his forces for carrying out an operation in Gaza overnight that freed two Israelis who had been held hostage since the October 7th terror attacks by Hamas. But it came at a catastrophic human cost. Israel launched blistering airstrikes for cover as forces stormed a building in Rafah, the densely- crowded city where more than a million Palestinians is seeking refuge. It brought the hostages to safety amidst heavy fire. The man had an emotional reunion with their families near Tel Aviv later. Mr. Netanyahu calls it a perfect operation with perfect execution. But the Palestine Red Crescent says 100 people were killed including children. Some video we're getting from the scene is frankly far too graphic to air. Doctors described people's limbs blown off, men, women, and children. And witnesses say some strikes hit tents, sheltering displaced families. Israel has been threatening a full-scale ground invasion of Rafah, despite widespread international opposition. Today, the EU Foreign Policy chief said world leaders need to stop asking nicely for a ceasefire, and instead use whatever leverage they have. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOSEP BORRELL, HIGH REPRESENTATIVE OF THE EUROPEAN UNION FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS &amp; SECURITY POLICY: Let's be logical. How many times have you heard the most prominent leaders or foreign ministers around the world saying too many people are being killed. President Biden had said this is too much on the talk, is not proportional. Well, if you believe that too many people are being killed, maybe you should provide less arms in order to prevent so many people being killed. So, I don't know, every member state is owner of his foreign policy, but this is a little bit contradictory to continue saying that there are too many people being killed, too many people being killed. Please take care of people. Please don't kill so many. Stop saying please and doing something. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

We've heard from the Israeli Prime Minister saying he has directed the Israeli military to prepare for a mass evacuation of civilians from the Rafah area where they will be evacuated to is unclear. We have little to no detail from the Israeli side. And as we know, the vast majority of northern and central Gaza has been almost entirely destroyed by more than four months of airstrikes and ground operations by the Israeli military and on the ground fighting. And of course, as we have seen over the last few months, civilians have repeatedly been told to themselves, this is an area where they have concentrated. We've seen these sprawling huge tent cities being set up where civilians are sheltering there in these makeshift tents, little protection and the elements where they go next, it's really anyone's question because there's simply nowhere safe left in Gaza. And as you mentioned, the threat of a ground operation in Rafah hasn't -- morally bears civilian consequences, but also could place diplomatic efforts in jeopardy as well. We've been hearing from regional leaders, we've been hearing from elders here in Egypt of course, particularly because over the situation on their side of the Rafah border saying that this could really play such diplomatic efforts into a state of jeopardy, that this would be unacceptable. A red line for many in the region. We've heard from U.S. President Joe Biden and the White House saying that while they have said they are not opposed to the Israeli military carrying out a targeted operation in Rafah, they would have to be credible, executable efforts to protect the lives of civilians, and this is a priority at this stage. We are seeing or had little clarity and what that would look like. So mounting concerns particularly from international aid organizations for many around the potential this could have for civilians in the area. We've heard from the U.N.'s Human Rights chief who has warned that we could see many more lives lost as a result.",

At the -- at the end of November, she's related to this family as well. And so, obviously, a very emotional reunion, a reunification of a family in many respects that was separated for so long. But now, the question is, will negotiations lead to the release of more hostages? Because we know that this is only the second time that the Israeli military has actually successfully carried out a raid to release these hostages. The rest of the hostage releases, of course, have come through diplomacy. And tomorrow, we expect that in Cairo, Egypt, there will be a major meeting of key Intelligence figures to discuss the possibility of yet another hostage deal. A lot, of course, riding on the line is more than 130 additional hostages are still believed to be held in Gaza.",

I've been saying sincethe very first day of the war that the only way to bring all the hostages home safely and alive is through a negotiated agreement with Hamas. There were likely to be attempts set military rescues. There have been as was said, this is the second successful attempt, and three hostages have been brought back this way. There are still 134 hostages in Gaza. It's believed that between 30 and 50 of them have already been killed, either an Israeli bombings or by executions by Hamas. There's no doubt that every day they stay in Gaza, it's a risk to their lives. The Israeli assumption is that they are somewhere between Khan Yunis and Rafah in the 20 percent of the southern part of the Gaza Strip where more than a million and a half Palestinian civilians are also waiting for this war to end. There's no positive scenario in military operations attempting to bring the hostages home, but for the Palestinian civilian population and probably for the hostages, and it's best that, that meeting that's taking place tomorrow in Cairo come up with some new ideas to enable at least a renewed ceasefire and the return of some of the hostages. While perhaps during a 40-day ceasefire, we come up with some ideas, how to have a diplomatic end to this war.

The problem with the proposal that was put forth by Hamas in phase one is that they were demanding from Israel to release 1,500 prisoners of which 500 of them are serving life sentences for murdering Israelis. There's a total of 559 prisoners, Palestinian prisoners in Israel who have murdered Israelis and are serving life sentences. So, this term of zero point-of-view is a non-starter, both in the number of the Palestinian prisoners with blood on their hands as they call it, the large number of 1,500 for the civilian hostages. And if there's a linkage after a 45-day period to the phase 2 and 3, which ends the war with Hamas in power, then for Israel, it's total defeat when Israel wants to make sure that this war ends without Hamas in control of Gaza.",

We don't need a path, we need the United States and the European Union, United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, Japan, other countries to recognize the state of Palestine, because we need to make Palestine real for Palestinians to know that they can live for Palestine and not only die as martyrs for Palestine. We need the Palestinian Authority President to step aside and appoint a prime minister or at least, a temporary administrator for Gaza who's a technocrat, who can build a new government in Gaza to take over from Israel, because the longer Israel stays in Gaza, the more I promise you, there will be armed insurgency against Israeli soldiers who will be coming back in body bags. We need an international effort to put down a commitment now to rebuild Gaza, and a regional framework which will promise security, stability and economic development.

He thinks NATO is like a country club membership or you don't get to swim in the pool if you don't pay. But that's not what NATO is at all. So, it's deeper than that though. I think Nikki, I think really he just doesn't understand how effective the United States is in the world, because we're united in this alliance with NATO. This is our diplomatic political base. This is what gives us the legitimacy in international affairs. It strengthens America's voice, and everything we're trying to do in the world is not a military alliance. It fundamentally -- it's a political alliance. And it's only military in the sense of, it does have a commitment to respond if one member is attacked, and according to the treaty, that's viewed as an attack on all, and the members have to take appropriate actions. But I don't think Mr. Trump wants America to have those kinds of commitments. He sees the world as a sandbox in which he can play with other powerful figures, cutting transactional deals without regard to the past or the future, simply watching his personal interest at the time. What's amusing and entertaining doing at the time.

And certainly he has been outspoken about the plight of the Palestinians along with his wife, Queen Rania, who will be here at the White House today as well. And when you talk to White House officials, they do really view the centerpiece of this meeting as a discussion about these continued efforts to secure the release of hostages that are continuing to be held in Gaza. That is something that the two men will really want to discuss. And this has been sort of an ongoing process that is now, according to officials, reaching something of an end game. The White House saying that there is a framework now on the table between Israel, Hamas and all of the mediators to try and come up with an agreement that would secure the release of those hostages in partnership with a prolonged pause in the fighting. But the real impediment, of course, at this point is Israel itself and the Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, who just last week called Hamas' counterproposal crazy. So, there are significant differences and President Biden is dispatching his CIA Director, Bill Burns, to Egypt this week to continue those discussions. And so when President Biden sits down with the King of Jordan, who is expected to arrive here in the White House any moment now, that will be something that, I think, they will really want to discuss. In addition to this key question of what happens once the war in Gaza is over the question of a Palestinian state, that is something, again, that has been a point of difference between President Biden and Prime Minister Netanyahu.

They're battling on three fronts. This is the last day to request the Supreme Court pause, the election subversion case against him. And here in Georgia, a hearing related to accusations of impropriety at the District Attorney's Office. Earlier today, Trump showed up at the courthouse in Fort Pierce, Florida. This is for a hearing related to his alleged mishandling of classified documents. Donald Trump has maintained his innocence. CNN's Jessica Schneider is joining us from Washington. Good to have you with us, Jessica. So certainly a lot of legal cases to stay across today. Three happening, one over the classified documents, of course, at Mar-a-Lago.

Sources tell CNN that Moscow announced a lucrative package last year for foreign fighters to join its military. But as CNN's Matthew Chance reports, some of them came back traumatized. Others didn't return at all. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MATTHEW CHANCE, CNN CHIEF GLOBAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): It should be a world apart from the battlefields of Ukraine. But this Himalayan state has become an unlikely casualty of Russia's brutal war. Nepalese like Ramchandra, who escaped the Russian army with his life, now praying for his comrades still fighting on the front line. He took a bullet and shrapnel in Ukraine, he told me, and saw many Nepalese killed. \"Some complained they were sent forward while Russian troops held back,\" he tells me. \"But the main problem was the language barrier. Sometimes you couldn't even understand where you're supposed to be going,\" he says, \"which way to point your gun.\" But that chaos hasn't stopped Nepalese signing up. Many posting upbeat videos on social media of their military training in Russia where they're meant to be prepared for the hardships of the Ukraine war. In reality, several former Nepali recruits tell CNN they were sent into battle after barely two weeks to fight for the Kremlin armed with a rifle and a contract for a few thousand dollars a month, a fortune in Nepal, where unemployment is high.",
