And it's really remarkable given someone who basically is thumbing their nose at the Republican primary voters and the subject of attack.He didn't, no one landed a punch. Aside from him, all the candidates really made their case also against President Biden and what he's doing with regard to the economy and open borders and crime across the country. And those attacks really resonated with the Republican voters. But for the most part, no matter how much they tried to put a dent in Donald Trump, I would imagine we're going to see in the next few days and weeks is not going to hurt the support that party faithful has for Former President Trump.",

And it's really dumbfounding, that this is part of the process to select the next President of the United States of America, because it was it was unruly, they were interrupting. They were talking over each other.And sometimes there were some personal attacks, but all of them really needed to break away from the PAC and really needed to make an impact and make a statement. And, you know, at the end of this debate, I think Former South Carolina Governor and Ambassador Nikki Haley had the really the takeaway line of the night where she was talking, again, directing attacks at Vivek Ramaswamy and his support and his engagement in the TikTok app. She says every time I hear from you, I feel a little dumber and it was a personal attack. But again, it was one of those one liners that people will be talking about in the days and weeks to come that a lot of these candidates, you have to have a takeaway line, you have to have something that people will be talking about, because not many people are going to sit there and watch the entire two hour debate. And I can guarantee you, after the first 20 or 30 minutes of the chaos, people were turning the channel. So having a good takeaway line is important. And I think Nikki Haley managed to do that.",

And a lot of these polls, it's, you know, it's political malpractice to get him to share the debate stage with these people, because there's no place to go but down if he were to do that, and that's clearly the strategy that the campaign is taking.I don't see him doing that unless for some unforeseen reason the polls tighten up, but I just don't see that happening. And their idea and their strategy in their mind are to take their message directly to the American people and his counterprogramming during the debate going to Michigan and speaking with auto workers. They looked at as an opportunity to appeal to a working class Americans. And he also engaged in what he's basically doing is, he is running a general election campaign, he's virtually bypassing the Republican primary candidates and making a general election plea to the American people. He took the opportunity to really go after President Biden on his support for electrical vehicles and his environmental policies. And Former President Trump was able to talk about American energy and drill baby drill. And these are issues that are important to Republican voters. But ultimately, this was his way of saying I'm going to take my message directly to President Biden, and based on the polls and the support that is not leaving him, he is really bypassing the primary process.",

He's had several 100 that are active on the Eastern Front. Now, this is not a sort of Wagner 2.0.There's not a sense that the group has reconstituted as a separate entity, but that they have in fact, joined the Ministry of Defense Forces, as Putin had said before and after the mutiny that he wanted them to do. He said that Wagner doesn't exist. So Ukraine is obviously watching this very closely. Because Wagner fighters we seem to be some of the most effective, they are painting this as a sign of Russian desperation, saying that Russia will take anyone they can get, but I think we also can't read into this necessarily. The Wagner has somehow gone away. As you know, U.S. defense official told CNN over the weekend that in Africa, for example. They haven't seen any meaningful signs that the group has withdrawn, nor that their relationship with the Ministry of Defense in Russia, in Moscow has changed that they've somehow been absorbed.
