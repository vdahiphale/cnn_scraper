And that really woke up this country and you can -- fair to say the rest of the world as to what was happening right now with this latest outbreak and violence. And it's something that, as you point out now, involves the prosecutor who was investigating that TV takeover.And we went, by the way, to that station just a couple of days ago to get a rare tour of what it looks like now. There are bullet holes riddling a lot of the infrastructure inside still. A lot of damage was done. The folks there are terrified. The prosecutor investigating that, shot and killed yesterday on the way to a court hearing. Now, we know two people have just been arrested. We confirmed that in the past couple of hours. But the question remains, why didn't he have security? I mean this is an incredibly sensitive topic to be investigating. This is a very dangerous place at this time with organized crime. And so we put that question to officials. The attorney general's office has said that there was security provided to this prosecutor, Cesar Suarez. The national police are supposed to provide that security. However, according to Suarez himself, the day before he was killed he said, I don't have any security. So, there's a lot of conflicting information. Something that we're trying to clarify with national police, Phil and Poppy. But it speaks to the dysfunction right now and really the concern as to anyone connected to these cases, their lives may be at risk.",

This was known as an island of peace. This country was very calm, was at ease amidst a lot of other turmoil in Latin America. What you happen - what you - what you see now is, if this happens to continue to unfold, you've got folks here who happen to think, well, it's not safe. At some point, I'm going to up and go. Where are they going to go, Poppy? They're going to go north. They're going to continue adding to the migrant influx. And you also have a place now where, if you look at how spread thin the U.S. is with resources, this is a country that needs resources.

That it's not the type of proceeding - it's not a trial, it's not something with evidence where you can use this sort of charge.And so not just those people, but lots of defendants are now very hopeful that the Supreme Court will overturn the Justice Department's ability to use this law in these cases and dozens have asked to delay their sentencings.
