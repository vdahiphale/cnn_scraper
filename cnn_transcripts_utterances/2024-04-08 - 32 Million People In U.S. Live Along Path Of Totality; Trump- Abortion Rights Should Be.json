We are just hours away from a solar eclipse that you will likely talk about years from now. Some 32 million Americans will be in the so called path of totality later this afternoon. And that means from Texas to Maine, they will be plunged into darkness when the moon blocks out the sun for about four minutes. But if you're not lucky enough to be in that narrow band, worry not, 99 percent of Americans will see at least a partial eclipse. And this reminder, of course, be sure to wear those special eclipse glasses to avoid permanently damaging your eyes. It will be another 20 years before the next total solar eclipse is visible in the contiguous United States.We're covering all the angles of this truly rare event, CNN's Rosa Flores, Ed Lavandera, Harry Enten, they are all in the totality zone. Rosa, let's start with you. You're in Kerrville, Texas. What kind of crowds are expected there?",

The blue skies are starting to happen here, so these clouds might be parting.As Wolf was saying, having the proper eyewear is key for humans and also perhaps for animals. I have some guests here with me, Lana (ph) from Bandera and her littles. And I have a few other people, if you want to come right closer to me, around me, because our pets are so integral in our families. And I'm wondering if littles has glasses for the eclipse.",

And so we are going to be monitoring them, asking for help from the public as well, because there's very little research that has been done to animal reaction to what happens, what animals do during total eclipse. We're here in the Dallas Zoo in the Savannah area. We've got elephants over here. We've got zebras out there. This is Tobogo (ph). The giraffe over here, who will be our co- host during this time. And there's a little bit of a prima donna because they don't really stand next to you when you're doing the live shot.But we'll entice Tobogo (ph) over here with some lettuce at some point. And one of the things that they're going to be watching for is just the reaction. And so a couple things to expect is, you know, in 2017, during that eclipse, some animals behaved in a rather odd way at times. And even though it happens quickly, so one of the things that they're looking for is just that animal reaction. It could be anything from, they think it's nighttime, they put themselves to sleep. It could be that there's a perceived threat, so they gather around their young, flamingos did that. So we will be trying to monitor this as best as we can here during the eclipse. And if you anywhere in the path of this eclipse, if you see anything about animals reacting to what is happening out there, it's going to be a really interesting time. And we spoke with some of the officials here at the Dallas Zoo to get their perspective on what they'll be looking for and watching very closely here throughout the day. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

It's actually, they're not something that they're terribly worried about, and it has to do with more that the animals kind of instinctually are more concerned with what's happening around them. In fact, the one person we talked to here from the zoo said, you know, animals a little bit smarter than humans in this regard, that we don't have this -- they don't have this inclination to want to look up to what's going on. They're more interested in what's going on around them, so they're more likely to look down to see if there's any kind of threat around them.

That includes places like Evansville. These are all going to be spots that are expected to have very little cloud cover, if any, this afternoon.Another good spot is going to be up into the northeast, essentially from Burlington, Vermont, all the way up through Caribou, Maine. Plenty of sunshine there. Now with that said, there are going to be a couple of spots where we are looking at pretty significant cloud cover, that's going to extend from Niagara Falls up through Rochester, New York. And then also another area of concern is going to be Texas. Now, the main concern here is a lot of strong to severe thunderstorms. The good news is the storms themselves are expected to be after the eclipse. But we all know those clouds start to increasing well ahead of the storm. So the real question is, how much cloud cover do we have before the storms begin to set in? Another concern is once the eclipse is over and all of these folks get back out onto the roads to head home or wherever they came from, then they may encounter some of those storms. And that includes very large hail, damaging winds and the potential for some tornadoes, especially across states like Texas, Oklahoma, Louisiana and Arkansas. But all is not lost for some areas. Dallas, we've got some clouds but may still have some sun peeking through. A place like Indianapolis will actually start to see the clouds decrease as we head into the afternoon, making it much nicer by the time the eclipse takes place.",

These are a thousand times darker than even the darkest pair of sunglasses. They only let in the smallest fraction of the sun's visible light. And you need to make sure they're ISO certified. And if you're still not positive that you've got really good glasses because there are unfortunately counterfeits out there, you can test them by putting them on and looking at the brightest light you can find.
