They believe that this is not just -- this is a winning issue for them, that parents broadly do not want the government whitewashing history telling parents and schools what they can and cannot teach. And the battle over history, you know, I think as much as this is political for the president, it's also personal. I've watched him give a lot of speeches, and you could feel more conviction and more personal attachment to this issue. I mean, he reflected on the fact that Emmett Till was 14 when he was killed and the president was 12. This is someone who is essentially a contemporary of the president's. He lived through this history. And this is not the first time. Yes, he signed the Emmett Till Anti-Lynching Bill. He screened the film \"Till\" at the White House. But back in 2021, just months after taking office, he went to Tulsa to mark -- to mark the 100th anniversary of a race riot there that most people in the country don't really know about. So this has been not just important to the president, politically, leading -- you know, leading up to next year. But it's important to him personally, I think, to make sure that the full story of American history is told and front and center. And if there is a contrast to draw with Ron DeSantis, other Republicans, this White House is eager to draw that ink and could press pretty firmly.",
