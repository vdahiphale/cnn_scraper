The percentage of positive tests for the flu in the last week now at just over 25 percent, and more than 23,000 Americans are in the hospital with the virus as we speak. Public health officials are also worried about a surge in COVID cases that is setting in at the same time, and this, of course, is on the heels of that early spike of RSV that we saw in so many children just recently.Joining me now for more on this is Dr. Paul Offit. He's the director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. It's good to see you, Dr. Offit. These numbers that just released this hour really confirming what we're all seeing. I mean, everybody, especially kids are sick right now. How do you describe this flu season? DR. PAUL OFFIT, DIRECTOR, VACCINE EDUCATION CENTER, CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL OF PHILADELPHIA: Right. It's worrisome. If you look at what happened in Australia or South America who have winters that precede ours, they had bad flu seasons. I think it's going to be a bad flu season. Remember two years before SARS-CoV-2 came into this country, we had 800,000 hospitalizations from influenza and 60,000 deaths. I mean, hopefully, this won't be like that this year. But the good news is the current flu vaccine is well matched for the strains that are circulating. So, please get vaccinated. Everybody over six months of age in this country is recommended to receive an influenza vaccine.",

I mean, we mass and social distance and quarantine and isolated and closed businesses and closed schools and restricted travel and virtually eliminated influenza from this country. I mean, every year, typically, 75 to 150 children will die from influenza. That year, one child died from influenza. So, the virus isn't circulating and generally inducing sort of a population immunity.Similarly, last year, we were still at some level of masking and social distancing and being careful, but not this year. I mean, we're pretty much back to living, playing, and working as normal this year. And I think with RSV, I can tell you the RSV that we saw in our hospital this year was greater than I've ever seen before in my life. And I do think it was in part an immunity gap.",

And by that, I mean adults who are elderly, meaning over 75, people -- anybody who is immunocompromised, anybody who has sort of multiple comorbidities that put them at risk. I mean, those are the three groups that are most likely to be hospitalized and most likely to die. And so, I -- it really is important for those groups to get vaccinated. Not necessarily everyone but certainly focus on those groups. So, I think if those groups were also choosing not to get vaccinated, then they increased the risk of hospitalizations and death.",

Because if you look back and -- we had a -- we had a measles vaccine that was first available in the early 1960s. 10 years later, there were a lot of people who still weren't getting vaccinated. So, what we did was we had school mandates. That was the birth of school mandates in the 1970s.And with that, we eliminated measles from this country by the year 2000. I mean, to some extent, it's come back. You'll see, for example, this outbreak in Columbus, Ohio now were six -- more than 60 children have gotten measles and 20 have been hospitalized. If we again go back to sort of eliminating school mandates, if this sort of libertarian notion of government off my back, don't tell me what to do, I don't want to get a mandate, spills over from COVID-19 vaccines to measles or other vaccines, then we'll be where we were before we had school mandates when you would see 100,000 children infected with measles or 150,000 infected with measles because they've chosen not to get a vaccine that was available.",

Once I told her that the Louisiana State Police had put two of the officers, they say, on administrative leave pending legal proceedings, she was furious at that saying that she wants those officers arrested saying that the LSP continues to make and break their own laws.Look, a part of what makes this story so tragic are the allegations of a cover-up. In fact, the family says that they were initially told by police that Greene died as a result of injuries sustained in a car crash. And that's what they would have believed and the public would have believed, if not for a video leaked to the Associated Press more than two years after the incident which showed Greene being violently beaten, dragged, and punched by those officers. And in the aftermath, there's been a DOJ investigation launched, there's been resignations of the top brass at the state police, and there's even been claims that the governor of Louisiana, John Bel Edwards, has been involved in a cover-up. Those are claims that he adamantly denied. But even after all of that, there's still been no arrests. And while the family welcomes these indictments, they say that their pursuit of justice will not stop until someone goes to jail.
