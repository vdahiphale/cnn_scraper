The Americans made a brief stopover in Doha before leaving for the United States. While only three have been identified publicly, including Siamak Namazi, who has been held in Iran since 2015. Morad Tahbaz and Emad Shargi were both arrested on espionage charges in 2018. While the two other freed Americans have not been identified publicly, a US official says President Joe Biden spoke with all of their families. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

If the Iranians want to buy food, agricultural products, medicine, that list has to be approved by the US, and then the Qataris will make the purchase using that money.

The Indian government has released a statement, they have rejected all allegations. And I'm going to quote from the statement issued by India's ministerof external affairs here, they say such unsubstantiated allegations seek to shift the focus from Khalistani terrorists and extremists, who have been provided shelter in Canada and continue to threaten India's sovereignty and territorial integrity. Now for Canada, Hardeep Singh is a prominent Sikh leader. But for India he is a terrorist declared back in 2020. The allegations against him, and the charges against him issued by India's home ministry are very serious, they say he's a terrorist. He had been sending funds to India to radicalize groups, and also issued the targeting of people back in India. This is going to escalate, Laila. There is no two ways about it. India's parliament is in session this week, there will be outrage expressed there as well. And this is a huge lull in ties between the two nations. Remember Canada is seen as a very important and significant Western partner to India, but these allegations are extremely serious in nature. And this is not the first time that India has raised concerns over anti-India extremist activities taking place in Canada. Now the Palestine movement, as the foreign ministry has mentioned in that statement, is a movement that is outlawed in India. It is seen as a movement of extremist groups coming together, and has been repeatedly condemned. There have been extremist activities in India in the past because of which this movement has been outlawed. And you do see a lot of supporters in Canada, Australia, and the UK, and India has consistently condemned any activities by these outlawed groups across these nations. Back to you.",

Well Mr. Biden is the only leader of the permanent five members of the UN security council attending the UNGA. Ravi Agrawal is the editor in chief of Foreign Policy Magazine, and he joins us now from New York. Ravi, always good to have you with us. Set the scene for us. There is no shortage of global crises that are vying for the world's attention right now. As this United Nations General Assembly gets underway, what will you be watching for? RAVI AGRAWAL, EDITOR IN CHIEF, FOREIGN POLICY: Oh, several things. I mean I think the sustainable development goals are going to be a big part of the next few days. We're at the halfway point, they were announced for the first time in 2015, 2030 is when the goals need to be realized. So everyone's looking at this year as a point where they're going to call out that enough progress hasn't been made. I think the war in Ukraine, as always, is going to be something that overshadows much of the next few days, and part of the reason there is the fact that Russia's on the security council, it has a Veto power of course. And it has, perhaps single-handedly, destroyed the UN charter, which mandates that there will be international peace. So if you look at anything that the UN deals with, right now, Russia and its Veto power, in some senses, stand in the way. There are many other big issues that are going to come up from the global food crisis, the climate crisis, all of which is going to require a lot of fundraising and money to be brought up.

It could happen to you tomorrow. So they are going to push, not the idea of protecting democracies because democracy can often be seen as gray, not black and white, especially in the global south. What they will push is the idea of sovereignty. That if you do not protect borders, what is there to protect?

The broadcaster said it was \"appalled\" and was determined to understand what happened. The BBC, who parted with Brand in 2008 over offensive voice mail messages, said it was also \"urgently looking into the issues raised.\" And the literary agent Tavistock Wood, who had been listed as Brand's representative, told CNN they believe they had been horribly misled by him and had severed all ties. As for potential criminal investigations, there are, as yet, no indications these are under way, either in London or in Los Angeles, where two of the alleged assaults took place. The Metropolitan Police, though, says it did receive a report on Sunday of an alleged sexual assault in London in 2003, without directly naming Brand. The Met has urged anyone who believes they've been the victim of a sexual assault, no matter how long ago, to come forward. Clare Sebastian, CNN, London. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
