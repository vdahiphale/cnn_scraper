I think it's good head start the counter on how many times that word will be uttered today. Just hours from now, Donald Trump is set to turn himself in and become the first ex-president ever to face criminal charges. However, the American public will not be able to actually watch the historic court hearing live on television because the judge overnight and decided he will not allow cameras in the courtroom during that arraignment. He will allow some photos before the proceedings actually begin. So, you will get to see some images of it. All of this is the spectacle began to unfold yesterday. Trump left Florida, he flew to New York City, arriving here in the afternoon and his playing at LaGuardia airport. You can see there. The motorcade, then escorted him to Trump Tower where he met with his legal team on the eve of his surrender. This comes as we're learning that Trump's attorneys have advised him to stop attacking the prosecutor and the judge presiding over this case. That judge will be before today. He recently called the Manhattan district attorney animal and insisted the judge was biased against him, even suggesting overnight that Alvin Bragg should indict himself. Trump has called for protests and warned that his arrest could lead to death and destruction. The mayor of New York City says right now, no credible threats to the city, but security has obviously been heightened at the courthouse. We can see police department officers just this morning, putting up additional barriers. It's Mayor Adams is urging Trump supporters to be on their best behavior. The former president is set to speak at Mar-a-Lago tonight after his arraignment. His attorney says he does not expect the judge to issue a gag order, which would prevent the former president from speaking about this case. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

They made the right decision there. And then should we prosper own defense witness? And they did ask for Attorney Robert Costello to go before the grand jury as a defense witness. That turned out to be a pretty good idea because that knocked prosecutors back on their heels, according to our reporting. They had to bring in some other witnesses to clean that up. But now, it's a new stage, right? They're going to have to file motions. They're going to be hearings, potentially even a trial. So, Susan Necheles and Joe Tacopina have been the attorneys up until now. Todd has now joined the team. Some questions about what this means for Joe Tacopina because he has been really the most forward facing on the defense team, but well, I am told that he is definitely still on the team.

He knows what he's doing. He was used to prosecute violent crimes and gangs. He also prosecuted white collar crime. And I should say, both Todd Blanche and I were colleagues with the current D.A. Alvin Bragg. We were all feds together a couple buildings now. So they know one another, which could have factored into the mix here. The other thing to know about Todd Blanche is his style is completely opposite of what you see from a lot of Trump players. He's not blustery. He's not aggressive. He's thoughtful. He's a tactician.

You know, folks who are speaking out provocatively on social media and, you know, really kind of fanning the flames, they're seeking that sort of attention, and I do think that there is a danger by calling Marjorie Taylor Greene or anybody else out specifically, you're essentially giving them the spotlight and the platform that they seek.So we'll see how that works out. I doubt that it's going to cause her to, you know, rein her language in any. I think that also not having the video coverage in the courtroom, it's normal. There isn't typically video coverage in Manhattan arraignment court, but in this case, I think having video live coverage of exactly what's happening could potentially be helpful in dispelling the myths and misinformation that will likely be all over social media as soon as this is concluded. So that I think was an opportunity lost. It's the judge's discretion, obviously, and so I guess we'll have to make do with still photographs.",

Well, the U.S. intel community says that it's not overly concerned because they believe that this by balloon was not able to capture images and collect signals intelligence in a way that was a lot more sophisticated, say then Chinese satellites do every day. But at the same time, we are learning that the U.S. government still doesn't know whether or not that spy balloon which, of course, the U.S. now has in its custody was able to basically have its data erased by the Chinese government.And that raises a lot of questions, of course. About whether it collected intelligence and captured images that the U.S. simply does not know about at this point. Now we are told that the FBI is still conducting its investigation, but ultimately, you know, it raises questions about whether when this balloon was passing over the sensitive military sites, it was able to capture imagery and then send it back to Beijing. In real time, we're told, and then Beijing was able to kind of delete that data. Now Sabrina Singh, who is the deputy pentagon press secretary, she said that the balloon's trajectory over the U.S. was, in fact, very deliberate, of course, raising more questions about what kind of intelligence the balloon was trying to gather. Here's what she said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
