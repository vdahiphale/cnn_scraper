Time here is 3Egypt, Qatar, and the U.S. pushing for renewed ceasefire talks as regional players look to avoid a broader Middle East war. Ukraine pushing forward launching a massive drone attack on Russia early this morning Friday, and the Olympics coming to a close in Paris as athletes gear up for the final push before the closing ceremonies. Israel says it will send a delegation to hostage and ceasefire talks next week. No word yet on whether Hamas will attend. They are planned for Thursday likely in either Doha or in Cairo. The main mediators, U.S., Qatar and Egypt, stepped up the pressure for talks yesterday. Many believe a ceasefire is the only way to de-escalate tensions and avert an all-out regional war. Well, CNN's Alex Marquardt is working the story from Washington for you, journalist Elliott Gotkine is here with me in London. Alex, let me start with you. U.S. officials say that they were close to an agreement before the assassinations of those Hamas and Hezbollah leaders last week. Question now is with August 15th it seems as the date for these talks, is a ceasefire still possible at this point?",

So what we're seeing now, Becky, is the first sign that those talks are not dead and you're really seeing this major push from the mediators, from the U.S., Egypt, and Qatar. They put out this statement last night as signed by the leaders of all three countries, including President Biden. And there's a real sense of urgency in this statement, bordering on exasperation and frustration, basically saying that after 10 months, that a ceasefire really needs to happen. And I want to read you a part of this statement. It says there is no further time to waste nor excuses from any party for further delay. It is time to release the hostages. Begin the ceasefire and implement the agreement. These three leaders go on to talk about offering up a bridging proposal to narrow the gaps and bring the two sides together, essentially saying we're tired of your back-and-forth, your proposals and your counter proposals. Of course, Becky, this comes at an extremely tense time in the region. Israel bracing for a potential strikes by both Hezbollah and Iran. So there is a real impetus to try to get this ceasefire done. There are major gaps that remain, but just yesterday, I was on a call with a senior administration official who says that they do believe those gaps are bridgeable. There's going to be a lot of work done in the next week because we're six days out from this potential meeting. As you say, Israel has agreed to send a delegation. We have not yet heard from Hamas. There is an expectation that if this meeting does go ahead, that the CIA director Bill Burns will be there. So we will see work by these technical expert teams in the next week leading up to that. But we should not have any expectation that as those main players get into that room on Thursday, that a deal is signed. It is not, if you will, a done deal just yet -- Becky.",

      "sentences": "I think Israel is clearly making preparations for all eventualities. There's even talk of some municipalities in thesouth of Israel kind of building tent cities in preparation for a kind of flood of displaced people from the northern part of Israel in case Hezbollah attack. So there are certainly concerns about it and there's speculation that perhaps if there is going to be an attack, that Iran might choose to do it on Monday night, Tuesday, because that is the Jewish fast day of Tisha B'Av, which commemorates the destruction of both Jewish temples in Jerusalem. It's the saddest day in the Jewish calendar. And just to mark, go back to October 7th, that of course goes Simchat Torah, which is supposed to be one of the most joyous days when Jews celebrate the end of the reading of the whole of the Torah and then start all over again. So, you know, with that in mind, that's kind of one of the days that people are speculating, which of course would come between now and next Thursday. But certainly they're taking preparations for all eventualities. There is, of course, a hope that it won't happen. But Iran itself and Hezbollah themselves have both promised retaliation. And I think it's, you know, the only thing that could perhaps potentially forestall this, maybe give Iran an off-ramp from some of its rhetoric, and just to give you, for example, something that Ali Khamenei, the supreme leader of Iran, said in the immediate aftermath of the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran, which again Israel has not claimed, saying you have paved the way for your harsh punishment. But there was like almost like perhaps a window, perhaps a nuance in a conversation between French President Emmanuel Macron and the new Iranian president where the Iranian president says that, you know, if Western countries want to prevent war, they should force Israel to accept a ceasefire. The other, if you want to be optimistic, change that we've seen over the past couple of weeks is of course President Biden is no longer running. The opinion polls in the U.S. have changed. So whereas previously, Prime Minister Netanyahu, who may have been playing a waiting game, waiting for President Trump with whom he had a bromance even if they had a little bit of tension between them after Netanyahu congratulated Biden on his election victory, that could now mean, OK, now, if there is a possibility of continuation, if you like, if Kamala Harris were to win, and polls suggest that they're neck and neck more or less, then perhaps he might be more inclined to do more of what the U.S. administration is asking of him than he would previously.",

I'm just going to start turning around, because you can hear this singing. This is a completely organic gathering that's been going on for two days now. Swifties just coming to this one street in Vienna singing as loud as they can, dancing in the street. They say this street, their safe space. Yes, a terror plot took away their opportunity to gather in a concert hall, but they're finding that chance to connect just organically again on the streets. I'm going to tap shoulders because one of the things I really want you to see is these beaded friendship bracelets here that these young ladies have on and these are so important to Swiftie fans, right, like these are super important.

It appears to be significantly deeper than it was, or it's very hard to tally precisely where we're seeing Ukrainian troops there. But they're certainly not back across the border. They appear to still be in Sudzha. They may have gone further around that. There's a Russian column of troops and ammunition that appears to have been destroyed even further to the north of Sudzha, so a lot of motion around here. The Lipetsk drone strikes you talked about important to separate that from the incursion because we've been seeing Ukrainian drone activity deep inside Russia hitting military infrastructure, and energy infrastructure structure over the last year or so. And so this is obviously at the same time as the incursion, but a tactic they've been using consistently over the past months with some significant drone technology at their disposal. But this larger incursion, still ongoing, still causing the Russians to panic and send reinforcements there and showing frankly that it's possible for Kyiv to take Moscow completely by surprise and catch them off guard.",

And so we have seen brutal attacks on dual, I could say, I don't know exactly who was in the supermarket, but you're often there with soldiers around buying their food at the same time. A civilian target like this, though, often hit by Russia at times of frustration. Elsewhere on the battlefield, no way of dividing the motivation. They've also just hit civilian infrastructure whenever they can anyway. So it's hard to see where's the pattern in things like this, but it's certainly a reminder of the brutality of what Russia has been doing inside Ukraine when they say, Vladimir Putin did on Wednesday, that Ukrainian forces have been indiscriminately shelling residential areas inside of Russia. Look at what Russia has been doing for years there. We're in a very interesting phase here with this new move by Ukraine because they're clearly trying to show the ability to project strength. As you mentioned, it's not entirely clear why. There's not some obvious strategic goal that we can see publicly that maybe some genius here for infrastructure, railways that we don't know about, that we haven't divined because Ukraine are not telegraphing this. They telegraphed their summer counteroffensive for months and that did not go very well. So this is clearly a bid to move faster and quicker but ultimately I think it is Kyiv trying to say after months of bad headlines, look at what we can do. It may be with a mind of showing Western allies that they've still got some fight in them. They may be trying to get an upper hand because the possibility of a Trump presidency and the likelihood of a possibly clumsy, swift and not particularly long-lasting ceasefire being imposed. And so it's a very fluid time, but I think it's one where we've seen again that if Ukraine gets a tactical surprise it could still show how weak Russian forces indeed are, despite how Moscow seems to have won in the kind of frontline wars of attrition that we've been seeing over the past months.",

So much of the talk, of course, in the buildup had been about Noah Lyles, whether he could do the double at the 200 title to the 100.

They argueHarris is making up ground with voters who had moved away from Biden and that the fundamentals of the race haven't changed. And CNN's Daniel Strauss covering the Trump campaign for us and joins us now from Washington. And there are now polls showing that Kamala Harris has actually not just sort of caught up with Donald Trump but is overtaking him.

There's been a massive surge in donations to the Harris campaign and a surge in support across the country with national polls showing that the Democratic nominee Kamala Harris flipped her advantage from when Biden was running so that she's leading Trump by just a few points. So to do the math on that, that's also making up the lost ground of Biden trailing Trump and then taking a lead, and it's really surprising, and it's something that has really, I wouldn't say caused a panic among Republicans, but has given them pause and concern because they do see that there's a large amount of momentum and a shifted narrative. And there are things like being a coherent speaker that the Trump campaign has to worry about now simply because he is running against a ticket that is younger, that is more dynamic than Biden, and that is newer and a new fresh face to the American electorate. But I do want to caution at the same time that Democrats usually win the popular vote in national elections. That doesn't necessarily mean they'll win the White House, and it's still up for grabs whether the Harris campaign or the Trump campaign is the favorite to win the electoral vote, which is really the key to the White House.",

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) DANNY FREEMAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): It's the moment we've heard so much about, seen now for the first time on police body camera. A Butler Township police officer asking for a boost to check the roof of the AGR Building outside former President Trump's rally. There's no audio in this video obtained by CNN. You can see on the time stamp this is less than one minute before Crooks started shooting. The officer climbs up to the roof and almost immediately drops down and the tone changes. You don't see it on the video, but police have said Crooks aimed his rifle right at the officer. He runs to the other side of the building to look at the roof. And on this officer's dash cam, which was recording audio, you can hear those first three gunshots from Thomas Matthew Crooks at 6:11 p.m. The officer rushes back to his car to get his rifle. You hear him shout to other law enforcement officers on the dash cam.",

I want to read you just a portion of that report that they put out yesterday. OpenAI said users might form social relationships with the AI, reducing their need for human interaction, potentially benefiting lonely individuals but possibly affecting healthy relationships. Extended interaction with the model might influence social norms. Essentially what they're saying here is they're worried that people are going to pull back from their human relationships to spend more time with ChatGPT, and this is already happening.
