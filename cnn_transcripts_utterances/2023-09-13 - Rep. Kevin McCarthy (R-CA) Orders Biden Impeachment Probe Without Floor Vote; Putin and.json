There's the floor vote issue and the change in the stance that McCarthy has made in just like the matter of two weeks, but also what's really interesting is how DOJ handled this under the Trump White House and what may happen now. So, in 2020, the DOJ declared that the impeachment against Trump could not proceed. You couldn't legally do this without a full House vote. They were invalid. Let me just read you that memo from the OLC. Quote, we conclude that the House must expressly authorize a committee to conduct impeachment. investigation and to use compulsory process in that investigation before the committee may compel the production of documents or testimony.

It is a statement by Congress accusing a seated official of grave misconduct that might warrant their removal, merely stating so as the leader of the House Republicans simply can't. I doubt it was what the framers intended that that's how you could open an impeachment proceeding.So, you know, my guess is that that's the legally right position, and that in order to figure out, you got to take it to court, as always seems to happen in these cases, Poppy.",

It is the body within the Justice Department that says what's right and wrong legally.

That's certainly for sure.And that's going to send very worrying messages around the world, actually, in the Korean Peninsula. Of course, you mentioned the need that North Korea has for Russian know-how, potentially, to improve its missile program and its satellite launch program. It's tried to launch a couple of satellites in the past four months and has failed. And, of course, when it comes to Russia, it's well known that the conflict in Ukraine has become a war of attrition, and it may well be decided by who can sustain the sort of vast amounts of ammunition to lob over to the other side. And Russia is running short on that ammunition. North Korea is known to have vast stockpiles of the kind of ammunition that would fall fit into the Soviet era sort of equipment that Russia has put out there on the frontlines in Ukraine as well. So, if there is a deal like that done, then it could dramatically change the calculations both on the Korean Peninsula and on the frontlines in Ukraine. As far as we know, though, that has not happened -- well, certainly, it hasn't been announced publicly. Whatever was discussed behind the scenes has basically stayed behind closed doors. There's been a shroud of secrecy flung over this whole carefully choreographed visit by Kim Jong-un. He's a very secretive leader, of course, and Vladimir Putin isn't that open either. And so we don't even know what's going to happen next, where Kim Jong- un might go next, how long he's going to be in the country, there's no joint press conference going to be given and there's not really been any joint statements yet either, if there ever will be. And so, yes, we're pretty much in the dark but, obviously, the big concern is what goes on behind the scenes.

Looking at your state of South Dakota of America's 15 counties with the highest rate of child poverty between 2017 and 2021, six of them are in South Dakota.
